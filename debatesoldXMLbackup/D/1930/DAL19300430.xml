      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware of the considerable damage done annually by the flooding of the River Inny, particularly in the lower reaches; and, if so, if he will state what steps he proposes to take with a view to having a proper drainage scheme carried out.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have had the whole question of the drainage of the River Inny and its tributaries under consideration, and a preliminary general examination of the river basin was made by an engineer and a land valuer.  The results showed that the mere restoration of the existing Inny River drainage district or the Upper Inny drainage district without substantial improvements would not afford much practical benefit and that the best method of dealing with the matter would be to formulate, under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, a comprehensive scheme which would include the existing Upper and Lower Inny draínage districts and some areas for which petitions under that Act had been received.  These views were communicated on the 17th July, 1928, to the County Councils of Cavan, Longford, Meath and Westmeath, who were asked to arrange for the presentation of the requisite petitions in respect of the affected areas in those counties so as to enable the machinery of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, to be put in motion in connection with them.  So far, the required petitions have not been received by the Commissioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinnsias O Fathaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state (1) what qualifications must be fulfilled by a national school in order to secure the Carlisle and Blake Premium, and, in the matter of Irish, what qualifications are required from the teachers, and what standard of proficiency from the pupils of such school; and (2) how many teachers, not holding the Bilingual or Ard-Teastas certificate, were awarded the Carlisle and Blake Premium in the years 1927-28 and 1928-29 respectively; and (3) to how many schools in which rural science was not taught was the Carlisle and Blake Premium granted in those two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Minister for Education (Professor O'Sullivan) John Marcus O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Professor O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme of regulations and conditions for the award of the Carlisle and Blake Premium, for which teachers of ordinary national schools are eligible, is published in the report of my Department for the year 1927-28 (page 121).  I am supplying the Deputy with a copy.</P>
      <P>Premiums are awarded to teachers of exceptional merit only.  In accordance with the scheme their selection is based on their work in their schools, not on the certificates of qualification which they possess, and the efficiency of the instruction in Irish is included in assessing their ratings.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme the award of premiums is made for a calendar year.  Six teachers, who secured the premium for 1927, and five for 1928, did not hold an Ard-Teastas or Bilingual certificate.  Their teaching of Irish was in all cases at least &ldquo;Good.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1051" /> A condition laid down is that, in the case of a boys' or a mixed school under a master in a rural district, the elements of the sciences underlying agriculture are fairly taught to the boys in the senior standards to enable the award of a premium to be made to the principal teacher. This condition was fulfilled in all the schools to which it applied.</P>
    <P>In ten of the schools on the list of awards for 1927 and eleven on the list for 1928, rural science was not included in the curriculum, but with one exception instruction was given in the alternative course in nature study, in accordance with the requirements of the official programme. The exception was a school in the list of awards for 1928, which was staffed by a mistress and junior assistant mistress.  In this case the official programme of instruction does not require the inclusion either of rural science or nature study in the curriculum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the British Board of Trade has issued an order that all roofing slates sold in Britain after June 28th, 1930, must bear an indication of origin, and that this order is likely to interfere with the sale of Irish slates in Britain; and if, in view of the fact that the quantity of British slates sold in the Free State greatly exceeds the quantity of Irish slates sold in Britain, he will take steps to restrict the importation of British slates, so as to ensure that no additional unemployment will result here from the action of the British Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the issue of an Order in Council requiring all imported roofing slates sold or exposed for sale in Great Britain and Northern Ireland (United Kingdom) to bear an indication of origin but do not consider that this Order, which is not directed specifically against Irish slates, need <Col N="1052" /> necessarily interfere with their sale. As stated in my reply to the Deputy's question on 27th February, I propose to introduce a Merchandise Marks Bill which will make provision for the marking of goods imported into An Saorstát, but I have no present power to restrict the importation of slates.  Wider considerations than a mere impulse to retaliate enter into any proposal for the restriction of imports, particularly where that impulse is directed against one only of the possible exporting countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

In view of that fact, does the Minister not think that the effect of the order will be to damage the trade in Irish slates in Scotland?</P>

      <P>On the application of the Great Southern Railways Company, and in accordance with Section 4 (7) of the Railway (Road Motor Services) Act, 1927, I have agreed to a revision of the fares charged on the approved omnibus services operated by the Irish Omnibus Company as the Railway Company's agent.  The amended fares are not all increases&mdash;some of them are in the nature of reductions&mdash;and none of them are in excess of the scale of maximum fares originally approved by me, after I had received a report thereon of the Rates Advisory Committee.</P>
      <P>The Great Southern Railways Company based its application on increased cost of working, including the addition of 150 per cent. to the road tax, which became operative on the 1st July last.</P>

      <P>In introducing last year's Budget I informed the House that the imposition of a substantial burden of fresh taxation had been avoided only with very great difficulty. This year the task has been much easier.  In the twelve months which ended on 31st March last the yield of revenue exceeded anticipations and it proved possible, in spite of the fact that supplementary estimates for fairly large amounts had to be introduced, to keep expenditure below the level for which provision was made.  The consequence was that, while in accordance with the principle which has been adopted in all our Budgets for the past five years borrowing took place for the purpose of defraying charges of an abnormal and non-recurrent or capital nature, there was an excess of normal revenue over normal expenditure amounting to about £250,000.  The tax which most substantially exceeded anticipations was the excise duty on beer.  Deputies may remember that in the year 1928-29 the brewers' credit was shortened by a month, with the result that in that particular year thirteen months' duty was collected. It was expected that in 1929-30 the yield would be down by some £420,000.  This estimate took account of the fact that in the past year only twelve months' duty would be payable and that some further decline in consumption was probable.  On 31st March, however, it was found that the actual produce of the excise duty on beer had, during the preceding twelve months, <Col N="1064" /> fallen by only £296,000, so that the estimate was exceeded by no less than £124,000.  The extra tax received under this head last year was somewhat in the nature of a windfall. It resulted from an increase in the export trade in beer and a consequent increase in the duty-paid stocks of beer held by brewers in the Saorstát.  A few years ago the Saorstát suffered substantial losses of revenue attributable, not to decreased consumption at home, but to the fact that brewers here considered it expedient to reduce their stocks.  Last year's returns show the effect of a reversal of the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The yield of spirit duty, both Excise and Customs, in 1929-30 was above the estimate by about £36,000. Twelve months ago I had the pleasure of informing the House that in the financial year 1928-29 the produce of the tax on spirits had exceeded the amount obtained in the previous year by nearly £100,000. The increased return was then ascribed by the Revenue Commissioners mainly to a somewhat general use of whiskey as a specific for influenza, in an epidemic which occurred fifteen or eighteen months ago.  Accordingly, in view of the fact that a recurrence of the epidemic could not be counted on, and in view of the fact that since the establishment of the Saorstát the consumption of spirits had shown a marked tendency to fall, I estimated in last year's Budget for a drop of £164,000 in the revenue from spirits. The fall actually shown at the end of the year proved to be no more than £128,000.  I think the conclusion may fairly be drawn that the decline in the consumption of spirits has now practically ceased.  In the years 1924-25 and 1925-26 the decline was very great indeed, representing in the former year a revenue loss of almost £550,000, and in the latter year a further loss of over £400,000.  In the two years 1926-27 and 1927-28, taken together, the fall in revenue was £106,000, while in the two years 1928-29 and 1929-30, taken together, it was only about £30,000.  As regards <Col N="1065" /> beer also, the decline in consumption has become very much slower and seems likely, in the course of another year or two, to be definitely arrested.</P>
    <P>The revenue obtained from the duty on sugar and sugar confectionery, though £10,000 more than in the previous year, was still short of the estimate by over £50,000.  The yield of the tobacco duty rose in the year 1928-29 by £200,000 as compared with the year 1927-28, largely in consequence of abnormal withdrawals from bond caused by a rumour that an increased duty was to be imposed in last year's Budget. It fell again during the year 1929-30 by £218,000 to a figure little over the yield in 1927-28.  The lesson of last year's return taken in conjunction with the returns for the three previous years seems to be that the tax on tobacco may be depended on to give a steady return with a certain tendency to rise.  That the upward tendency is so slight in spite of the increase of smoking amongst women would seem to indicate that the duty at present levied on tobacco is about as high as the commodity will bear, and that any additional impost would result in some restriction of consumption.</P>
    <P>The duties on matches again gave a slightly increased return, as indeed they have done every year since 1926-27.  It is interesting to note that while the total revenue from matches was £136,000 last year as against £127,000 in the year 1926-27, the tax paid on imported matches fell in the interval from £39,000 to £30,000.  The revenue returns for the years 1926-27 to 1929-30, inclusive, show that so far as matches are concerned the home manufacturer is steadily driving foreign competitors from the Saorstát market.</P>
    <P>It was expected that the duty on motor vehicles and tyres would produce £500,000.  The estimate was exceeded by £14,000.  In this connection it may be mentioned that road-tax produced £868,000 in 1929-30&mdash;an increase of £256,000 in three years.  There is no ground for believing that the return either to the <Col N="1066" /> Exchequer or to the Road Fund from the taxes on motor vehicles has become stabilised.  On the contrary, it may be taken that the number of motors in use will continue to increase for a considerable time and that we have here one of our few steadily expanding sources of revenue.</P>
    <P>In the past financial year the yield of the betting duty was £204,000, which was an increase of £22,000 as compared with the previous year. The improved return in all probability was due mainly to better enforcement of the law.  This particular tax is one in respect of which it is difficult to prevent frauds against the Exchequer.  Indeed, wholesale evasion can only be avoided by extraordinary vigilance on the part of the revenue officers.  Fortunately, they have during the past year or two succeeded in making detections which have led to penalties calculated to make the most stout-hearted defaulter quail.  On the whole, the betting duty has proved to be a satisfactory method of obtaining public revenue.  If it inflicted any damage on horse-racing in the Saorstát, it is likely that that damage will be more than made good by the introduction of the totalisator, which is one of the incidental results of the imposition of a tax on betting.</P>
    <P>The yield of the entertainments tax was up by almost £20,000.  This welcome rise was, no doubt, due to the advent of the talking pictures, which have given the duty, for the time being at any rate, the character of an expanding source of revenue.</P>
    <P>The import duty on wireless apparatus produced over £30,000, an increase of nearly £4,000 on the sum obtained in the previous year.  When this tax was first imposed four years ago it was anticipated that it would produce about £20,000 per annum; it has ever since showed an upward trend, and it may now be safely stated that it is not likely in future to yield less than £30,000 per annum. When the tax was first levied it was indicated that the proceeds, together with the amount obtained from <Col N="1067" /> annual licence duties, would be devoted to giving an extended and improved broadcasting service.  When the new high-power station has been erected I think the whole amount will definitely be required for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The revenue obtained from stamp duties was down by £54,000 as compared with the previous year and was £19,000 below the estimate. About half of the decline occurred in the last quarter of the financial year, being largely due, no doubt, to the decreased number of transactions and the fall of prices in the stock market.</P>
    <P>The yield from income-tax together with super-tax and sur-tax was £3,966,000, or just £16,000 more than the estimate.</P>
    <P>Looking at the revenue figures for the year 1929-30 as a whole, the impression to be gathered is that the yield of Saorstát taxation has to a very great extent become stabilised. The return from various duties will, no doubt, continue to fluctuate up and down, but there is no longer any sign of the considerable shrinkage which for a few years was a disquieting feature of our financial outlook.</P>
    <P>With the exception of the duties on motor vehicles and perhaps on entertainments, few of our taxes are likely to give us increasing yields in the next year or two.  On the other hand, except in the case of the definitely protective duties, returns, if they decline at all, will decline only slightly.</P>
    <P>During the year 1929-30 the dead-weight burden of public debt was not very greatly increased, but considerable sums had to be borrowed to enable advances to be made to the Local Loan Fund, the Shannon Power Fund and the Electricity Supply Board.  No issue of National Loan was made during the period under review because of the unfavourable conditions existing in the money market.  The amounts which were required for capital advances or for abnormal and non-recurrent expenditure were found mainly by <Col N="1068" /> the sale of Savings Certificates, by discounting bills and by obtaining ways and means advances from departmental funds.  During the year 1929-30 the amount due by the Exchequer in respect of Savings Certificates increased by almost £800,000; the amount due in respect of bills discounted, and ways and means advances increased by over £1,400,000.</P>
    <P>At 31st March last the public debt outstanding, calculated on the basis adopted in previous Budget statements, was £25,218,000, made up as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>When the aggregate of these, together with other smaller items, has been deducted from the gross total of National debt already given we get a net figure of £14,003,000.  This may be compared with £13,983,000 last year and £13,584,000 at 31st March, 1928.  That the increase in the net total of the liabilities of the State has been so small during the past financial year is due, first, to the fact that a Budget surplus was <Col N="1069" /> realised and, secondly, to the fact that there are such ample sinking fund provisions in connection with 1st and 2nd National Loan, Compensation Stock, Telephone Capital Advances and so forth.</P>
    <P>In order to give the House figures comparable with the figures set out in previous Budget statements, I have left out of account the amounts due in respect of the Dáil Eireann Loans and the sum which is being repaid to the British Government by means of the annuity of £250,000 authorised by the Damage to Property (Compensation) (Amendment) Act, 1926.  Even if allowance were made for these items it would be found that the entire dead-weight burden of State indebtedness was well under £20,000,000.  The debt to the British Government is less than £5,000,000.  The outstanding liability in respect of the Dáil Eireann Internal Loan is only about £60,000.  So far as the Dáil Eireann External Loans are concerned it is difficult to form an exact estimate of the amount which will have to be disbursed in order to repay the subscribers in so far as repayment may prove to be practicable.  Taking everything into account, it is not likely that the Saorstát will be involved in a charge amounting to more than £500,000 in connection with the repayment of the Dáil Eireann External Loans, allowance being made for interest.</P>
    <P>There is, however, another item of State indebtedness which has now begun to assume considerable proportions and which was not referred to in previous Budget statements. It is the liability in respect of Land Stock issued under Sections 5.  25 and 52 of the Land Act of 1923 and Sections 42 and 46 of the Land Act of 1927.  Section 5 of the Act of 1923 sets up a costs fund amounting to 2 per cent. of the total purchase money advanced under the Act.  The fund is used to recoup vendors, incumbrancers and other claimants in whole or in part for the costs of sales.  It consists of 4½ per cent. land bonds for the interest on which and the redemption of which the Exchequer is solely responsible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1070" /> Section 25 of the Land Act of 1923 provides that the State shall contribute to the price of tenanted land purchased under the Act an addition equal to ten per cent. of the standard price for which the tenant is liable.  This contribution by the State is analogous to the &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; under the Land Act of 1903.  It is made by the issue of land bonds for the service of which the Exchequer is responsible.  The contribution made by the State under Section 52 of the Land Act of 1923 represents one-eleventh of the price of land taken over by the Land Commission which had been originally purchased by means of advances made by the National Land Bank.  The contribution under Section 42 of the Land Act of 1927 is made in those cases in which the Land Commission purchases land for the use of owners of uneconomic holdings, landless men and other suitable persons, and resells the land at a lesser price to tenants of the class mentioned.  The excess of the purchase price over the resale price represents a contribution by the State and becomes a State liability.  The contribution under Section 46 of the Land Act of 1927 arises in the case of lands purchased by co-operative farming societies in 1920 and 1921.  The Land Commission having taken over such lands may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, resell them to the tenant purchasers at prices below the purchase price. The difference represents a State contribution and gives rise to a State liability for the interest on land bonds and for their redemption.</P>
    <P>All payments under the Land Acts, 1923-27, are made by the issue of 4½ per cent. land bonds at par. The State, of course, accepts a contingent liability in respect of the capital and interest of all land bonds issued, but it accepts a direct liability in respect of the land bonds issued under the five sections just mentioned for the purpose of contributions to price and advances to the costs fund.  The amount of such bonds outstanding is now £780,000, and that sum must <Col N="1071" /> be added to the figures of debt already given.  Consequently, neglecting for the moment the Dáil Eireann Loans and the sums payable to the British Government under the Damage to Property (Compensation) (Amendment) Act, 1927, we find that the gross total of the public debt of the Saorstát is £25,998,000, while the dead-weight burden which remains after allowing for Exchequer assets is £14,783,000.  If our liability to the British Government and our liability in respect of the Dáil Eireann loans is added, we get a total net liability of £20,250,000 or £20,300,000, or thereabouts, which is less than one year's tax revenue. This figure is not likely to grow very much, because within another year or two the abnormal, as distinct from the definitely capital items, will practically disappear from our estimates of expenditure.  Our existing provisions under various heads for sinking fund are such that if they were to continue undiminished and if no new dead-weight debt were incurred, then at the end of fifteen years we should, reckoning interest at 5 per cent., have no net liability in the way of national debt except that represented by the annuity of £250,000 to the British Government. All other indebtedness not counterbalanced by repayable advances like those to the Electricity Supply Board or Unemployment Fund would have been wiped out.  For the next few years the fresh liabilities imposed through the operation of the Land Acts of 1923 and 1927 will probably be sufficient to prevent the sinking funds from reducing the net indebtedness of the State, and afterwards certain sinking fund payments will automatically come to an end.  Nevertheless, it is almost certain that the aggregate of our dead-weight debt will not rise above £21,000,000.  Possibly it will not even reach it.  In these circumstances, I am satisfied that our next issue of National Loan ought to be made under conditions which will require the smallest possible increase in our annual appropriation for sinking <Col N="1072" /> fund.  It is doubtful if there is any other country in which the provision made annually for the repayment of debt is such a high proportion of the net sum outstanding as is the case in the Saorstát.</P>
    <P>Our arrangements for redemption of debt are so ample that we have made it a practice in fixing the level of taxation to allow for the element of over-estimation in the estimates of expenditure and to refrain from budgeting for more than a nominal surplus.  We take the view, however, that even if a substantial surplus is realised in a particular year, as it was last year, it should not be carried forward, but should go to the reduction or limitation of debt.  If, on the other hand, there should ever chance to be a deficit it ought not to be carried forward either.  It should be met by increasing the public debt, every care being taken to see that a deficit rarely occurs, and that when it does it is trivial in amount. Normally, a financial year should end with a small surplus.  The objection to carrying forward a surplus is that if such a practice were adopted there would be a temptation to withhold payments due in a particular financial year till after 31st March, so that there might be a paper surplus which could be brought in to obviate the imposition in the next year of fresh taxation though, in fact, such taxation had become doubly necessary by reason of the liabilities wrongly carried over.  The existing practice encourages the prompt settlement of liabilities, because a surplus in one year does not ease the task of budgeting for the next, and delay in making payments would simply create a crop of difficulties.  The practice of making each year stand by itself from the budgeting point of view must, however, on the whole have the result of adding appreciably to the sums actually available for the redemption of debt.  It is impossible, without risking a series of deficits which would damage the national credit, to estimate both expenditure and revenue so closely that there will not frequently be a surplus of some consequence.</P>
    <P>In this fact we have an additional <Col N="1073" /> reason for keeping the sinking fund provisions in connection with our next issue of National Loan as low as possible.  In it we have also a reason for continuing our practice of borrowing, not only for capital expenditure of a reproductive character and for the purpose of making repayable advances of various kinds, but also to defray certain abnormal and non-recurrent charges, such as the payment of compensation for damage to property during the Anglo-Irish War and the Civil War and the cost of restoring public buildings damaged and destroyed during the same period.  If we were to meet such exceptional and disappearing heads of expenditure, especially those arising out of the troubles connected with the establishment of the Saorstát, from the proceeds of taxation, the position would be that the taxpayer was being loaded with war charges, while the State was redeeming debt by the addition of Budget surplus to sinking fund at a rate which promised to leave practically no net burden at all on the Exchequer at the end of a decade.  Attempts have been made from time to time to show that we were borrowing for purposes that ought to be provided for out of taxation, and consequently were not really balancing the Budget.  The almost static condition of our net national debt at a time when heavy compensation charges are still being paid is a sufficient answer.  There would have been more justification for criticising us for not beginning the practice of distinguishing between normal and abnormal expenditure before the Budget of 1925-26 and thereby giving earlier relief to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>In order to determine the sum necessary to be raised by means of taxation in the present year, I propose, as I have already indicated, again to segregate those items of expenditure which are of a capital nature or are abnormal and non-recurrent and may properly be met out of borrowed money.  The White Paper issued a few weeks ago shows that the estimated amount necessary to maintain public services and to <Col N="1074" /> meet necessary outlay during the current financial year is, in respect of Central Fund Services, £4,219,072, and in respect of Supply Services £21,782,928, or a total of £26,002,000. From this figure we must deduct the aggregate of the following items of expenditure which need not be met out of the proceeds of taxation:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The total of these items is £1,203,000.  When that sum has been deducted from the gross aggregate estimate of expenditure we get a figure of £24,799,000, representing all the items of expenditure which must be met out of the proceeds of taxation or other normal revenue. We are still, however, dealing with a gross figure from which, as we know from experience, a certain deduction may safely be made in respect of the element of over-estimation. Deputies are aware that the estimates of expenditure for the current year were prepared in the departments four or five months ago, and after alternations resulting from scrutiny by the Department of Finance, were sent for printing two months before the end of the last financial year.  If the Estimates were not yet in print and were open for revision, it would be found that even already in respect of the purposes for which various sub-heads were inserted, circumstances have so changed that it would be wise to alter upwards or downwards the amounts approved in January or February last.  Before the end of the financial year so many other changes that could not have been foreseen will take place that numerous sub-heads which were most carefully measured before being inserted in the Estimates will prove to be either inadequate or excessive for the purposes to which they relate.  The only way in which a department could secure that infallible estimating, which certain critics seem to desire, would be to allow itself a good margin so as to obviate the danger <Col N="1076" /> of a shortage and then definitely set out to spend up to the limit of its estimate, making a special spurt, if necessary, in the month of March. If such a course were adopted the complaints about over-estimation which we sometimes hear would doubtless fade away, but taxation would increase.</P>
    <P>What happens at present is that Departments seek under each of the six hundred or more separate sub-heads into which the Estimates are divided an amount which they deem to be sufficient to pay for the service to which the particular sub-head relates.  They take the view that while the ideal thing would be to have in a sub-head just enough money to meet necessary and unavoidable charges on the object for which the sub-head provides, it is better to risk an excess than a deficiency. They act upon this view not merely or mainly in order to avoid coming to the Dáil with too many supplementary estimates, but because our whole financial system would be thrown out of gear if we approached the position in which it was not certain that the Dáil knew, before considering the Budget, the full requirements of Departments. Inevitably, in a great many of the six hundred sub-heads money remains unspent at the end of each financial year and, although a certain number of sub-heads prove inadequate, the total of the supplementary votes presented to the Dáil is never nearly sufficient to balance the aggregate of the surpluses. There remains, therefore, at the end of the year, scattered throughout the various votes, a great sum, the expenditure of which has been authorised by the Dáil, but which it has proved unnecessary to use.</P>
    <P>Since we have already, as I have indicated, very substantial provisions for the redemption of debt, it would be unjustifiable to impose taxation in order to bring this large amount into the Exchequer merely to create a Budget surplus.  For the past five years I have, for budgetary purposes, reduced the total estimate of normal expenditure by the amount which it was believed fairly <Col N="1077" /> represented the element of over-estimation. In April, 1928, I fixed the amount which could reasonably be allowed for over-estimation, together with savings, at £600,000, a figure which proved to be sufficiently near the mark.  Last year, because the estimates submitted by Departments had been so rudely and drastically pruned, I considered it impossible to count on nearly so large a margin.  I accordingly fixed the amount to be allowed for over-estimation and savings at £435,000, which was about two and a half per cent. of the estimate for all normal supply services after deducting fixed grants on which no saving could be effected and in respect of which no over-estimation could arise.  The figure of £435,000 proved to be too small. By careful checking of expenditure during the year it was found possible to save an additional £140,000, which, along with the improved yield of certain taxes, including the beer duty, was responsible for the good Budget surplus which was realised.  I propose, therefore, to raise the figure to be allowed in the present year in respect of over-estimation and savings to £575,000. When this amount is deducted from £24,799,000, the gross aggregate of the estimates for normal supply services, we get a net total of £24,224,000.  This is the amount which will actually be spent during the present year, and must be entirely provided out of the proceeds of taxation or other normal revenue.</P>
    <P>Turning again to the White Paper, we find it estimated that taxation at the rates at present in force will produce a revenue of £20,551,000. Non-tax revenue will amount to £3,706,000, making total revenue for the year £24,257,000.  From this must be deducted a sum of £20,000 included in the miscellaneous non-tax revenue, which represents repayments of advances made out of borrowed moneys to Agricultural Credit Societies.  The estimated aggregate of normal tax and non-tax revenue is, therefore, £24,237,000.  When that figure is compared with £24,224,000, <Col N="1078" /> the total normal expenditure to be defrayed during the year, we find that the Budget will balance with a nominal surplus of £13,000.  The position, therefore, is as it was twelve months ago, that there is no need to increase taxation and no possibility of remitting taxation, except by way of very slight adjustment.</P>
    <P>The net estimate of expenditure on supply services of a normal kind&mdash; that is, services that must be paid for out of revenue&mdash;is up this year by £245,000.  This increase is due partly to the fact that the pruning of estimates last year resulted, in certain cases, only in postponing for twelve months expenditure such as outlay on the painting and repair of buildings, partly to the inauguration of the Gaedhealtacht housing scheme, which will cost £66,000, partly to the increase in the number of old age pensioners, which has added £40,000 to the estimate as compared with last year's original figure, partly to the operation of incremental scales in the civil service and police, and partly to a variety of minor increases in services. The estimates for the normal Central Fund services also show an increase this year of £14,000 as compared with the estimates for 1929-30. Apart from an increase in the payment to the Road Fund the cause here is that some additional provision is made for the service of debt in view of the fact that there will definitely be an issue of National Loan this year.  Having regard to these increased draws upon the Exchequer, I think it is highly satisfactory to find that no additional taxation is required.</P>
    <P>While I believe it will be possible to balance the Budget again next year without throwing additional burdens upon the public, such a result can only be achieved by continuing to practise strict economy and seek for savings in every direction. It will be an indication of the difficulties before us if I mention that amongst the items of miscellaneous non-tax revenue which I have treated as normal are two amounting together to £280,000 which will not recur.  One of them is £100,000 which will be received <Col N="1079" /> from the National City Bank in completion of its repayment of a sum of £300,000 advanced to it out of revenue some years ago for the purpose of enabling it to make advances under the Trade Loans Guarantee Act.  The other item is a sum of £180,000 which it is proposed to take from the Interest Account of the Post Office Savings Bank.  It has long been the practice of the British Government, acting under Section 14 of the Customs Inland Revenue and Savings Bank Act of 1877, to appropriate for the Exchequer as ordinary revenue part of the excess of the gross amount of interest accruing in each year from securities held by the British Post Office Savings Bank over the interest paid and credited to depositors in respect of that year.  The Statute requires provision to an extent to be determined by the Treasury to be made against depreciation. The whole of the surplus interest arising in any year is not, therefore, appropriated.  In the years immediately following the European War, up to and including the year 1925-26, the appropriation for the benefit of the Exchequer was limited to one-half of the surplus of interest accrued to the Bank over the interest credited and paid to depositors. It is now no longer necessary to make provision on such a scale against depreciation and the share appropriated by the British Exchequer has since 1926-27 been increased to a proportion which appears to be 75 per cent.</P>
    <P>Since the Saorstát Post Office Savings Bank was established surplus interest has been accumulating and no part of it has yet been taken for the Exchequer.  The amount accumulated at</P>

    <P>The accounts for the year ended 31st December, 1929, have not yet <Col N="1080" /> been made up but are in course of preparation.  It is clear, however, that the surplus interest accrued up to the end of the year 1929 will not be less than £240,000.  The sum which it is proposed to take into the Exchequer is, therefore, 75 per cent. of the total amount which has been permitted to accumulate.  The remaining £60,000 will be allowed to stand over as provision against possible future depreciation.</P>
    <P>The sum of £280,000 supplied by the National City Bank's repayment and by the Savings Bank from surplus interest will not be available next year and the gap will have to be filled (if fresh taxation is to be avoided) either by an improvement in the yield of existing taxation or by a corresponding reduction of expenditure. It is the policy of the present Government to avoid the imposition of fresh burdens on industry and agriculture.  If production can be stimulated, existing sources of revenue will gradually expand and new services may then be undertaken by the State without hindering or preventing further economic progress.  We believe, however, that the Saorstát ought not at this stage to set out to rival the social services of much more highly developed countries, and thereby run the risk of smothering economic growth under ever-growing public burdens. On the contrary, we think that the right line of advance is to give agriculture and industry the opportunity of developing so that the country may later on be able to afford social services on a scale comparable with that of any other country.</P>
    <P>But the stage in which great and striking economies might be looked for has now passed.  Equally, the time when people could reasonably hope that important new services might be squeezed into the Estimates without involving the imposition of fresh burdens on the public has gone by.  Such savings as may be effected in the future will be relatively small in amount and hard to achieve.  The bulk of the estimated expenditure of £26,002,000 may be divided into two categories.  In the first is comprised <Col N="1081" /> unavoidable expenditure; in the second expenditure which except in times of crisis neither the Dáil nor the electorate would consent to abolish or even reduce.  In the latter class is included outlay not only on various social services, but also expenditure on certain economic objects such as the encouragement of agriculture.  The expenditure shown in the Estimates for 1930-31 which may be classed as unavoidable is that incurred on the following:&mdash;</P>

    <P>These figures, of course, include the allied services which are shown at the foot of part 2 of each vote in the Volume of Estimates, the necessary eliminations being made to prevent any item being counted twice.</P>
    <P>In regard to some of the headings mentioned there will be little tendency to deny that the expenditure is unavoidable and is not capable of arbitrary or even speedy reduction. Interest on public debt must be paid punctually and in full, and the provision for redemption promised when the money was borrowed must also be made.  Post Office services must clearly be maintained on something like the present scale. Throughout the world more and more money is being expended on education.  The Saorstát cannot afford to reduce materially its outlay on the training of its future citizens. Revenue must be collected if Government is to be carried on at all.  Our expenditure on prisons and police, on judicial salaries and the machinery of the courts is not only on a very much more modest scale than prevailed in the area of the Saorstát during the British occupation but is hardly capable of further reduction until we reach a state of affairs in which, for example, the ordinary resident in a rural parish will go <Col N="1082" /> straight to tell the police if he hears that poteen is being made in the next townland, or will be prepared to protect the bailiff who is seizing his neighbour's cattle for a debt to, say, the grocer in the nearest town.  As regards the expenditure on superannuation allowances, it is clear that retired public servants cannot be denied the pensions they were promised when they entered Government employment.  I think it will be agreed by most people that expenditure on the Army cannot safely be reduced below the figure at which it now stands, at any rate until the possibility of internal armed attack on the State has completely disappeared. Even then it is questionable whether much further reduction would be justifiable until the sanctions of international law and institutions like the League of Nations have grown more powerful than they are now.  Taking a general view, the expenditure at present being incurred under the eight headings I have just mentioned is unavoidable and not capable of appreciable reduction.  It totals £16,180,000, from which must be deducted appropriations-in-aid amounting to £320,000, leaving a net £15,860,000.  To this figure might be added the aggregate of certain expenditure which is unavoidable, because its stoppage by the State would only throw additional burdens on local ratepayers.

    <P>To amounts already mentioned must be added the annuity of £600,000 which is payable to the British Local Loans Fund and against which revenue flows into our Exchequer. Thus we get an aggregate figure of £24,469,000, which is for all practical purposes outside the field of economy.  The cost of national health insurance and of unemployment insurance, taken jointly, after deducting appropriations-in-aid, is £559,000.  Both services have been misrepresented and are misunderstood in the country.  Consequently, a proposal to abolish them would have certain support.  But if such a measure were carried out, not only should we destroy social services of <Col N="1084" /> great value and of a kind which nearly all up-to-date countries have found it necessary to adopt, but we should cast considerable burdens on the boards of health throughout the country.  Allowing for the moment, however, that they may be the subject of substantial pruning or of abolition, we find that, out of estimates of expenditure aggregating £26,002,000 for the year 1930-31, the total amount representing the field in which substantial savings might conceivably be effected is £1,533,000, and in order to save the whole of that sum it would be necessary to abolish the following, or, at any rate, to sweep them into financial oblivion: The Governor-General, the Oireachtas, the Comptroller and Auditor-General, the Office of Public Works, National Health Insurance, Unemployment Insurance, the Civil Service Commission, the State Laboratory, the Valuation Office, the Ordnance Survey, Patents Office, General Register Office, Stationery Office, the Tariff Commission, the Department of Finance, the Department of Justice, the Department of Local Government, the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of External Affairs, the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds, the Broadcasting service, and to stop outlay on law charges, temporary commissions, electoral expenses, marine services, railways and certain other minor services.</P>
    <P>I showed in a previous Budget statement that even if, regardless of efficiency and legal rights, we were to cut all higher salaries to an extent that no advocate of cutting has yet suggested, reducing salaries of £800, for instance, down to £480, the entire saving that could be effected would not equal the proceeds of a tax of ¼d. per lb. on sugar.</P>
    <P>In this connection it is worth remembering that the total pay, including bonus, of all State employees, from Ministers and Judges to messengers, charwomen and labourers, but excluding teachers, soldiers and police, amounts to only 16.5 per cent. of the total estimated expenditure, both Central Fund and Supply, for 1930-31.  If post office employees, the <Col N="1085" /> larger part of whose pay is met out of postal revenue, are left out of account, the percentage falls to 10.45 per cent.</P>
    <P>Though many people refuse to see it, the plain fact in regard to public expenditure and taxation is that new services, except on the most modest scale, are not likely for some time to be possible without the imposition of fresh taxation, and reduction of taxation if, in face of all the calls for increased services, it is to be effected at all, can only take the form of comparatively minor abatements.  It is not proposed to make any important changes in the scheme of taxation in the present year.  Appeals have been received for reliefs of various kinds, but it is considered that to create disturbance simply for the purpose of changing burdens from the shoulders of one set of people to another is not, on the whole, desirable.</P>
    <P>For a good number of years past we have been urged to give relief to the smaller income taxpayers, particularly to those with families.  It would not be possible to do so this year without imposing new taxation to make good the loss of revenue that would be incurred.  If we were to levy indirect taxes for the purpose they would have to be put on articles of necessity, because duties on goods of a luxury character would give little revenue.  Customs and Excise duties on articles of common use would have the effect of taxing those who were too poor to be liable to direct taxation for the benefit of people who had the good fortune to be income taxpayers. It would, of course, be possible to find the means of giving greater reliefs to smaller income taxpayers by increasing the standard rate.  We do not consider that such a course should be adopted. An increase in the standard rate of income tax would have an adverse effect on firms of a type that is, unfortunately, not so numerous as it ought to be in this country, firms which are anxious to employ part of their profits for the expansion of business and for the creation of adequate reserves to enable them to <Col N="1086" /> face and overcome future difficulties. It is true that there are many businesses which would not be directly affected to any great extent by variations in the rate of income tax, because all profits are drawn by the owners or distributed to them and expended by them or invested outside the Saorstát.  On the other hand, however, there are many businesses which an increased income tax rate would directly injure, and there are many businessmen whose attitude towards home industry would be definitely affected by variation in the income tax rate.</P>
    <P>I believe that over a period of years enterprise and productivity will certainly be stimulated by the maintenance of the income tax at a low level.  Moreover, there is reason to believe that by keeping our income tax at the 3/- rate we shall induce people of Irish origin who have left the country to return to it, and cause people who have residences both here and in England to become Saorstát residents solely in order to avoid payment of tax at the British level.  This has already happened in a few cases.  If it happened in a moderate additional number, enough extra revenue would be obtained to give some relief to the smaller income taxpayers without increasing the standard rate, and the country would also secure the advantage of having the income out of which the extra revenue was obtained expended in the Saorstát, with a consequent increase in employment.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested to me by some of those members of the public who so freely proffer advice about this time of the year that the money required to give reliefs on the British scale to small income taxpayers could be obtained by levying a duty of 3d. or 4d. per gallon on petrol.  This is not a proposal to which I am prepared to give serious consideration at the moment.  My attitude is that nothing of a fiscal character should be allowed to happen to petrol till the De-rating Commission has reported, as it will before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I have been urged to exempt the trading profits of harbour authorities <Col N="1087" /> from liability to income tax.  The matter is one which has been considered by the Ports and Harbours Tribunal appointed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce; and as the report of the Tribunal will, it is understood, be ready in the summer, I should prefer not to express a definite view as to the desirability or otherwise of giving the relief sought until the report has been published and studied.  It appears to me, however, that if the trading profits of harbour authorities were exempted from income tax, the concession would have to be extended to the trading profits made by all local authorities, and by the Electricity Supply Board.  It would also have to be extended to the trading profits of charitable bodies in so far as such profits were devoted to charitable purposes.  Moreover, I am satisfied that if trading profits were exempted, the case for exempting the investment income of such bodies would prove to be irresistible.</P>
    <P>In the Report of the Royal Commission on the Income Tax issued in 1920, it is indicated that the claim to charge tax on the trading profits of local authorities and charities is stronger in principle than the claim to tax investment income, because public bodies and charities may, and in certain cases do, compete with private traders.  In the case of charities, exemption is already given in the case of investment income, but not in respect of trading profits, except in one special class of case. In short, there is, if anything, more to be said for exempting other classes of income than trading profits. Therefore, the proposal to exempt the trading profits of harbour authorities from tax must, I am afraid, be looked upon as practically a proposal that all income received by public bodies and by charities, including trading profits, rents and interest, should be exempt from income tax.  If effect were given such a proposal, it would involve an immediate loss of £70,000 per annum.  In the near future the loss would probably rise to £100,000 per annum.  Without going into the <Col N="1088" /> merits of the claim at the moment, I am coerced to reject it, for the present at any rate, because there is no surplus from which the concession sought could be made.  Various other claims for the remission or modification of charges must also be rejected for the same reason.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to make one or two minor alterations in the law relating to income tax in order to relieve serious hardships arising in certain cases from changes in the basis of assessment made in last year's Finance Bill.  The Departmental Committee have been at work on the preparation of proposals for the simplification of the income tax code.  There seems to be a certain amount of misunderstanding abroad as to the nature of their task.  It does not mean merely codification. The Income Tax Act of 1918 was itself a codifying Act.  Our present Income Tax code comprises the 1918 Act, the Income Tax provisions of the British Finance Acts from 1919 to 1922, and those of the Saorstát Finance Acts from 1923 to 1929.  The Income Tax Act of 1918 itself contains a large number of provisions which have no force in the Saorstát and others which are unsuitable to conditions in the Saorstát. It would be possible by codifying the Acts to reduce the total number of sections considerably and to make the codified Act more readily intelligible.  But this of itself would not have the effect of simplifying the system, and the Committee are endeavouring to secure amendments which will make the system itself more simple and thus enable the forms to be simplified.</P>
    <P>This is not nearly as easy a task as it seems to many people.  The new system must be as effective in producing revenue as the old one and it must, if possible, be no more expensive to work.  There are many obvious steps towards simplification which might be taken without hesitation if it were possible to ignore these two requirements.  For example, if the principle of taxation at the source were wholly abandoned the way to a considerable degree of simplification would at once be <Col N="1089" /> opened, but it is a matter of very grave doubt indeed whether without it anything like the same yield of revenue could be obtained.</P>
    <P>The taxpayer is apt to think of simplification solely by reference to the size of the form which he has to fill up.  There are difficulties, however, in eliminating questions from the forms.  If there were no personal reliefs the amount of matter could be very greatly reduced, but obviously we cannot simplify the forms by withdrawing the reliefs.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that the Committee will be able to make their report in the autumn, as special arrangements have been made to expedite the work, and a good deal of ground has already been covered. It should be possible, therefore, to have a Bill for the simplification of the income tax code prepared and passed by the Dáil before the introduction of next year's Budget.</P>
    <P>It is intended this year to suggest only three changes in the scheme of taxation.  All are of a minor character, and will not appreciably affect the figures already given.</P>
    <P>In the first place it is proposed that the minimum duty on wine be reduced so that wines containing 25 per cent. proof spirit or less will be charged at the rate of 3/- per gallon instead of 5/-, and that similar wines imported in bottle will be charged additional duty at the rate of 2/- instead of 4/- per gallon.  It is also proposed that the additional duty on sparkling wine imported in bottle shall be reduced to 12/6 per gallon. The change in the wine duty now suggested arises out of negotiations for a commercial treaty between France and the Saorstát which have been carried on at intervals since 1926.  The French Government have been able to satisfy us that the duties on wine, which were increased in 1926, fell with special severity on French products, and accordingly it has been agreed to make some reduction.  There is no doubt that the new scale represents a more equitable adjustment as between the different qualities of wine imported from various countries.  Notes have been exchanged with the French <Col N="1090" /> Government defining the treatment to be accorded to our imports from France and to our exports to that country, and a commercial treaty will be concluded on the basis of the agreement set out in the notes.  It secures to goods of Saorstát origin the benefits of entry into France, the French colonies and protectorates, on the minimum tariff, a concession which, in fact, is enjoyed in full by very few countries.  On the other hand, we shall give France most favoured nation treatment, which does not, however, interfere with Imperial preference or the system of giving special concessions to other States of the British Commonwealth. The loss in revenue occasioned by the change in the wine duty will be about £12,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to impose one new tax.  Many complaints have been addressed to the Government, particularly by traders in the country towns, about the injurious effect on many of the smaller urban areas of the great increase in recent years of the practice of hawking by means of motor vehicles.  When the matter was under investigation we were struck by the curious fact that while the ordinary hawker, who operates normally with a horse-drawn vehicle, is charged a licence duty of £2 per annum, the hawker with a motor van is exempt from taxation.  Those who drafted the Hawkers Act, 1888, apparently overlooked the possibility of motor cars being used for such traffic. We intend to repair their oversight. In view of the greater burden capable of being carried by the motor vehicle and of its much greater range, the motor-hawker should, as a matter of equity, be subject to heavier taxation than the hawker who, in the words of the Act, travels with a horse or other beast bearing or drawing burden.  It is proposed, therefore, that the motor-hawker shall, as from 1st August next, be obliged to pay an annual licence duty of £10. The revenue obtained will, it is estimated, be approximately £3,000. Thus we shall be left with a nominal Budget surplus of £4,000.</P>
    <P>The third change we propose will <Col N="1091" /> not affect the Exchequer.  When the Road Tax was imposed in 1918, a reduction of 25 per cent. was allowed in favour of vehicles dating from before 1913.  In 1927 we were very strongly urged to extend the concession to apply to all cars over five years old.  We refused to do so on the ground that the reason for the original concession did not really apply to cars of a more recent date than 1913, and because we did not want to eat into the income of the Road Fund.  Since the time the matter was last seriously discussed the income of the Road Fund has, as I have already indicated, increased by £256,000.  We do not accept the view of those advocates of the concession who urge that it will actually increase the revenue of the Road Fund by substantially increasing the number of cars on the road, but we are satisfied that such loss as it may cause will not be a serious matter henceforth.  We propose, therefore, that as from 1st January next the road tax shall in the case of cars over five years old be payable subject to a rebate of 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>Two years ago it was necessary, in order to balance the Budget, to find the large sum of £700,000 by temporary expedients.  That it was not necessary in last year's Budget, and is not now necessary to impose taxation, is largely the result of a very close scrutiny and a very severe limitation of expenditure.  I should like again to acknowledge the help I have received in this connection from the investigations of the Economy Committee presided over by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. They have examined thoroughly a great part of the field of Government expenditure, and, if I have already appropriated much of the matter that would normally have formed part of their report, the credit due to them is not lessened thereby.  There is no prospect that in the next few years it is going to be easy to find the full amounts required to maintain public services. The disappearance of the element of arrears from the returns of income <Col N="1092" /> tax will be sufficient to counteract the effect of any improvement in economic conditions unless such improvement should be quite marked. The changed habits that have gradually grown up since the high liquor duties were first imposed will prevent any great increase in the yield of the beer and spirit duties, no matter how trade and industry revive.  As the protective duties achieve their purpose they will produce less revenue.  But however difficult may be the replenishment of the national purse, every indication points to the conclusion that although the improvement in the country's economic health is very gradual, it is unbroken.  It will be some time before better conditions can be reflected in bigger revenue. Already, however, we have reasons for pursuing our task no longer merely in a spirit of resolute confidence, but rather in a spirit of cheerful optimism.  We cannot afford to slacken our efforts, but we can afford to rid our minds of anxiety.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is not very much to cheer about in the Budget statement which the Minister has just read for us, it is a happy augury that there is not much for most of us to weep about.  The Minister himself, I think, summed up the nature of his Budget when he said: &ldquo;There is no need for increased taxation and there is no possibility of remission.&rdquo; That is the burden of to-day's song. It is a source of disappointment, to some of us at any rate, that some of the things referred to in the Press recently as probably under consideration when the Minister was drafting his Budget have not found a place in it.  One thing which we were led to expect was a tax upon the importation of motor bodies. That matter has been under consideration for a long time, and if a tax of that kind had been put upon imported articles there is good reason for believing that it would have meant a considerable revival in coach building, an industry that was once flourishing in this country.  It may, however, be that the tax is only delayed.  I hope, even if it does not come now, that the tax that has been asked for by that trade will make an early appearance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister dealt at considerable length in an interesting analysis with items of expenditure which he classed as &ldquo;avoidable&rdquo; and &ldquo;unavoidable.&rdquo; With his analysis of what he classed as &ldquo;unavoidable&rdquo; I do not agree&mdash;at least in regard to some of the items.  He quoted a figure in regard to superannuation of £2,065,000, police and prisons £1,884,000, and Army £1,574,000, making a total of £5,458,000, which, with other items, he classed as unavoidable expenditure. We do not agree that all of that huge sum is unavoidable.  We think that a considerable saving could be made in those three items without danger or disadvantage to the country and the citizens in general.  With regard to superannuation, <Col N="1094" /> we do not suggest that any of the rights of civil servants, or public servants in general, should be interfered with.  We do not want to deny to public servants the pension rights which are their due, but, aside from that, we think that considerable reductions could be made in those votes.  Certainly, in regard to pensions paid to able-bodied men who gave very little, if any, service to the country, considerable saving could be made, and also under the heading of the army and the police. The prison service probably does not account for very much in that total, but with a change of attitude on the part of the Government, there might be some room for cutting down in regard to that matter also.</P>
    <P>Another item to which the daily Press gave considerable attention in the last week or so&mdash;and it is possible it was under consideration by the Minister when drafting his Budget&mdash;was the question of increased allowance to men with small incomes and large families.  I think that something could reasonably be done in that direction and that the money for it might be found by economies of the nature I have indicated, if not by other economies which would be possible if that committee, over which the Parliamentary Secretary for Posts and Telegraphs presides, were more active in searching for places where real economies could be made.  It is not possible to attempt, and I would not attempt, to analyse any further the figures which the Minister has given at this stage, beyond saying that it is interesting to note that practically the only reduction in taxation&mdash;the other two items are very small&mdash;is made for the benefit of those who can drink champagne.  It is an interesting indication of the Minister's mind.  I cannot say, because I know nothing about it, that he is particularly interested in that matter, but it is a striking indication perhaps of the mind of the Ministry, if not of his own, that the only one class in the community who get any advantage out of the Budget are the gentlemen who can afford to enjoy <Col N="1095" /> themselves on foreign wines.  I am not objecting to France getting that little bouquet.  I understand that the reason that a treaty between the Free State and France has not been concluded before now is the very strong objection of the Government and people of France to the very heavy taxation put on their wines and other articles by the Free State Government.</P>
    <P>If this brings about a better feeling between the Free State and France, and if it encourages trade between the countries, the result in the end will be good, apart from the extra enjoyment in which it may induce certain people to indulge. There is just one matter in addition to which I desire to refer.  When the Minister was dealing with the question of national debt and loans he explained how he raised money in the course of the year for necessary services, when money was required, by discounting bills, short-term loans and the like.  That is a very expensive way of carrying on a Government. Some months ago he might easily have foreseen that money would be cheap at this stage, and might have made an effort to take advantage of the low rate of interest before indulging to such an extent in short-term loans and adopting other methods of raising money.  There is not, as I have said, much to be said at this stage about the Minister's Budget statement.  It provides hardly anything to get excited over.  That, perhaps, is a good thing.  In a way, people will be more satisfied and will believe that we are getting to more normal stages when the Budget contains nothing of an exciting or alarming nature either in the way of extra taxation or great reduction. There are changes, not of a radical nature, in the methods of taxation that we think ought to, and could with advantage, be adopted by the present Ministry, changes which would give better conditions and improve the social services to the classes of the community that need them very badly.  We believe that by a re-arrangement of expenditure and by a closer watching of the great <Col N="1096" /> spending departments savings could be made which would allow the Free State Government to bring much closer to the British and Six-County level the social services of the Free State.  Evidently, the mind of the Minister and of the Government does not run in that direction, and they do not see that they could reduce certain services, some of which I have indicated, on which they spend a great portion of annual revenue. We believe that changes in the direction indicated could with advantage be made.  Again, as often before, we urge on the Minister to look more searchingly in that direction for further savings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T.J. O'Connell Mr. T.J. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not usual at this stage to make any general remarks with regard to the Budget statement, but to confine ourselves to the Resolutions to be proposed.  I think, whether we agree with the Minister or not in his statement&mdash;we certainly do not&mdash;it is only right to say that he deserves a personal tribute from the Dáil on his personal record in being so fortunate as being able to bring in his eighth Budget.  I think this is his seventh or eighth Budget.  Perhaps because of that he has got into a definite Budget groove from which, I suppose, it will be impossible to shift him.  I think we may make up our minds that if we are going to change the financial policy of the State we must, first of all, change our Minister for Finance.  Just because the Budget might be described as an &ldquo;as you were&rdquo; Budget, our criticisms must be largely as they were last year.  We have practically no new criticisms to bring forward. Perhaps it was right that the Minister should paint the picture he did. I hope it was not in over-glowing terms.  He advised us to strike a note of cheerful optimism, and said that there was good and sufficient reason for it.  I, too, would like to strike that note, but at the same time I would be more pleased if we could forget that we had with us still some important social problems that require to be urgently attended to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1097" /> In so far as I could judge from the general statement on the Budget, the Minister has no particular intention of dealing with these problems in the drastic way in which I think they should be dealt with.  We have the problem of unemployment and the problem of insufficient housing all over the country.  Other opportunities will be afforded for dealing with these matters, but personally I would be much more pleased if I saw some attempt on the part of the Minister to recognise that these are two problems that are, as it were, festering sores in our national life, and the Minister should face up to the problem of dealing with them in the drastic manner in which they deserve to be dealt with.  As I say, other opportunities will offer for dealing with these matters.</P>
    <P>In connection with the three small changes that are made in taxation, I would like to know if there is any assurance that we will get a <i>quid pro quo</i> in the matter of the reduction of the wine duties.  It will cost us, I think, £12,000 per annum.  That is the estimate of the Minister.  I would like if he would explain on the appropriate occasion what we are likely to get in return.  I agree with Deputy O'Kelly that it is rather strange that the only remission of taxation should be in that particular direction.  It will be a consolation, I am sure, to the labouring man, a docker or a builder's labourer, who is anxious for a reduction in the price of his pint of beer, to know that his champagne will cost him less.</P>
    <P>Coming to the Resolution before us in regard to income tax, I would like at the beginning to pay a small tribute to those responsible for making the estimate.  I think it is rather creditable to our Revenue Commissioners, the officials of the Department of Finance or the Minister himself, to say that in estimating an amount of almost £4,000,000 they came to within £16,000 of being correct. I think that is something to their credit and while I am not slow to criticise in some respects, I like to give credit where credit is due.  In regard to criticisms which have been offered from these benches for the <Col N="1098" /> past six or eight years I will only briefly repeat them.  I think that it would not be impossible for the Minister so to adjust his income tax that the reliefs which have been asked for from these benches and the Fianna Fáil benches could be given. I believe they could be given if the Minister faced up to the task with the will to do it.  I do not agree at all with the principle which he outlined when he said that to create disturbance simply for the purpose of changing the burdens, from one set of people to another, is not desirable.  I do not know what is the force of the word &ldquo;disturbance,&rdquo; whether it is a disturbance of the Minister from the set groove, in which he seems to be.  I do not at all agree with the principle that it is not right that burdens should be shifted from the shoulders of one set of people to the shoulders of another set of people, if it is the proper thing to do&mdash;that just merely because you do not want to go to the trouble of re-arranging your income tax code it is not to be done.  I do not think that is a sound principle and I certainly do not agree with it.</P>
    <P>We have the fact that in Great Britain and Northern Ireland the standard rate of income tax is ? higher than here but, at the same time, the smaller income taxpayers are getting very much more relief there than is given to the smaller income taxpayers here.  The incidence of the tax is entirely different.  For instance, in the case of a married man who has three children and an income of £400, he has to pay £3 7s. 6d. here in the Free State and, although the standard rate is ? higher in Great Britain, a man similarly circumstanced there gets off without paying any income tax.</P>
    <P>[<i>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle took the Chair.</i>]</P>
    <P>A married man here with three children and a £500 income a year pays £10 2s. 6d. income tax; in Great Britain, even under the increased income tax, he gets off with £3 2s. 4d. In fact, on all incomes under £1,000 income tax is lower in Great Britain <Col N="1099" /> than in the case of a married man here.  As the income reaches £1,000, the tax increases and is higher in Great Britain than here.  In the case of a single man, the income tax at the Saorstát rate and the British rate is equal at about £228 income. Above that, it is higher in Britain, and it increases rapidly.</P>
    <P>Now we have this position, that in Britain the family man is encouraged; in Ireland the bachelor is encouraged; that is, the effect of the income tax rates.  If we look at the census returns, we see that there is a very considerable proportion of bachelors in the Free State, and I think the Minister for Finance will have to answer for that in some measure.  His policy has, perhaps, something to do with that.  I again raise this point, as it has been raised year after year.  Last year I had some hope&mdash;this year I have none&mdash; that the Minister would mend his hand in that particular direction. Last year we thought we had brought the Minister to the point that he would do something.  He had expressed his sympathy the year before.  He virtually promised that the relief that we have been pressing for for the family man, and especially the man trying to give higher education to his children, would be given, but he dashed our hopes to the ground last year.  Although there was reference to it in the newspapers this year, I felt the temptation to have a Budget &ldquo;just as you were&rdquo; would be too great for our present Minister for Finance to withstand.  So I am not disappointed in finding things just as they were. Until we can shift the Minister for Finance, I am afraid there will be no possibility of getting the relief we want.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Budget, I do not wish to say very much beyond this: that apparently the prodigals of the spending Departments have put the Minister with his back to the wall, for the greater part of his Budget, if I may say so, was a defence of squandermania. There are one or two features in the Minister's financial policy which, I shall take an opportunity of examining in greater detail later, but I would like at this stage to express disagreement with the Churchillian principle which the Minister enunciated of meeting a budgetary deficit by increasing the public debt.  I think that that principle, as has been explained already elsewhere by another Minister for Finance, is simply an incentive to undertax and overspend. We feel that as the Minister is responsible for the finances under his control, when a deficit in the public revenue arises he, as the Minister responsible for that, ought to face the Dáil with proposals that would liquidate it.  Such a deficit normally can only arise through some failure either of foresight, or of courage, or of control, on his part and he ought to take responsibility for it, and not to leave it to his successors to shoulder the burden that he has created.</P>
      <P>With regard to the income tax proposals now before us, we on these benches, like Deputy O'Connell, express regret that nothing has been done to meet the case of the poor man with a family and a very small income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in his Budget, has referred to the effect that an increase in income tax would have upon those who would employ or invest part of their profits in their business.  We feel that he might have met the position by introducing the principle of discrimination which we so often advocated in this House, and by granting some concession to those who derive their income either from investments in, or as profits from, Irish industry.  If <Col N="1101" /> he introduced that principle and gave effect to it in his proposals he would have done a good deal more for the development of Irish industry, and to induce people to come and live in Ireland, than he has done by maintaining, so far as the small income tax payers are concerned at any rate, what is a mere delusion&mdash;that the income tax rate in this country is lower than in Great Britain.  Those of us who have had the opportunity of studying the figures, particularly as they have been affected by recent proposals of the British Chancellor, know very well that so far as income tax on incomes up to £500 or £600 a year are concerned, in the case of married people with three children, the amount of income tax paid in this country is considerably higher than the amount paid in Great Britain.  I think, speaking from recollection, that the amount of income tax paid here by a married couple with three children, with an income of £400, is three guineas if the income is earned, while in Great Britain such a couple would pay nothing.  If the income were £500, I think they would pay £10 7s. 6d. here, while only three guineas would be payable in Great Britain.  If the income was £600 I think the income tax to be paid would be £16 or £17 here and only £10 in Great Britain.  So that so far as the great mass of the income tax payers in this country are concerned, the suggestion that income tax here is lower than in Great Britain is unfounded and untrue. I do not intend to say any more at this stage on the Minister's Budget, but possibly I shall have something more to say to-morrow.</P>

      <P>(Cork): I rise to congratulate the Minister on the very mild criticism his Budget has received at the hands of the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party and the leader of the Labour Party. Deputy O'Kelly was most gentle considering the fact that in his own conscience he believed that the Minister was the greatest sinner.  Yet there was no better Budget for the <Col N="1102" /> country than the one put before the Dáil.  His speech and actions here, and those of his party, for a number of years have rendered the position of the Minister most difficult with regard to reducing taxation.</P>

It may be a nice thing to have a placid statement, an air of satisfaction and contentment created by the indication of the fact that there is no change, but it is poor consolation to those unemployed who are emigrating because they cannot get a livelihood that the Government have no proposals to make, which indicates that they have no solution to offer of the economic problem that faces the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not in the Chair when Deputy O'Kelly and Deputy O'Connell were speaking, but I am quite satisfied that the Ceann Comhairle did not allow Deputy O'Kelly or Deputy O'Connell to wander away from the resolution in the way in which Deputy Lemass has wandered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite certain that the Ceann Comhairle allowed them to talk about French wines and champagne, which have nothing to do with this resolution and which will come up on another resolution, whereas the matter I am referring to cannot come up on any resolution except the general resolution to-morrow. If that is your ruling I am not going to question it.  It seems to me that it would have been better to have the matter dealt with at the beginning.  The Minister told us that it is not possible to make any allowance to the income taxpayers with small incomes.  He admitted that for a number of years the Government have been urged to give relief to income taxpayers with the smaller incomes, particularly to those with families.  He then proceeded to endeavour to create a false impression in the public mind by stating that this allowance could only be given by the imposition of indirect taxation, particularly upon the necessities of life.  He did admit later on that the allowance to the smaller income taxpayers with families could also be financed by an increase of the standard rate, or by so modifying the burden of the tax that those with larger incomes would pay more.  But that is not advisable, he said.  It is not the policy <Col N="1106" /> of his Government to case the burden upon the poorer man by increasing it on the richer man.  It is true, as he knows, that the man with the smaller income pays proportionately more here than in Great Britain.  The Minister is anxious to preserve that position, because he thinks that by so doing he will induce a number of the dukes and lords and carls whom we drove out ten years ago to come back and establish residences here. That is his hope and aim.  The poor people of the country must continue to pay through the nose, because the Minister desires to create a proper social atmosphere in which he and his colleagues can perform the new stunts which they have been learning at garden parties and dinners at Buckingham Palace and other places of the kind.  It does not matter to the Minister or his colleagues apparently that the burden of the tax upon the small man constitutes a very considerable hardship, provided that these few millionaires whom he has in mind, who can afford to keep a country house in Ireland and a town house in London, may be induced to come back here and establish permanent residences and reconstitute the era of the landlord and the local Nabob, so that the people may again get into the habit of touching their hats to a lord when he passes along the highway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not want these people here.  I think the country would be much better off without them.  I think if the only way in which relief can be given to the smaller income taxpayers is by an increased burden upon such people, that burden should be increased.  The fact is, however, that these people would still have sufficient inducement to bring them into this country, even if the standard rate was increased by 6d. in the £. and relief given to the smaller income taxpayers by that means. The standard rate here is 3/-, while in Great Britain it is 4/6d.  If a difference of ?d. in the £. is likely to bring these people into this country to establish permanent residences here, so also will a difference <Col N="1107" /> of 1/-.  But it has not done so. These people have not found that their anxiety to avoid paying tax to the British Government is strong enough to urge them to take the drastic action of establishing a permanent residence in this country.  I do not think it is likely to have that effect.  Neither do I think that an increase of 6d. in the £. in the standard rate would affect business in the manner in which the Minister indicated.  The business man whose attitude towards home industry would be definitely affected by a variation in the income tax rate is of very little use to this country.  In any case, may I again point out that if the standard rate was increased by 6d. there would remain a definite inducement to him to favour industry in this country rather than go abroad with his capital for the purpose of investing in England.  I maintain that the reasons which the Minister gave for not making this allowance to the smaller income taxpayers with families indicate an attitude of mind in the Government which should secure for them the opposition of those people in the Dáil who were elected by the votes of poor men and not by the votes of dukes, lords and millionaires who have not come here yet, even though as a result of the Minister's attitude one or two of them may come here.</P>
    <P>The Budget is, if anything, an indication of a variation of the policy of the Government in the wrong direction.  There was a time when they seemed to feel that it was their duty to so alter the burden of taxation here so that it would be made lighter on the shoulders of the poor and heavier on the shoulders of the rich.  The fact is that the poor people, the workers of this country, pay a much higher proportion of the total tax revenue of the State than they do in England.  The yield of direct taxation here is, I think, only about 40 per cent. of the total.  The yield of indirect taxation, which is paid in the main by the poorer classes, is about 60 per cent. of the <Col N="1108" /> total.  The position in England is the reverse.  The Minister here is not prepared to take any action to remedy that position, because by doing so he might make the country less attractive to a few dukes, millionaires, or earls.  I, personally, am not satisfied with that policy, and I hope this Dáil will express its dissatisfaction. I hope, when the general resolution comes to be voted on, that we will get an expression of that dissatisfaction by a vote against the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the general public outside this House will view with very considerable satisfaction the Minister's Budget statement, because I think there has been a certain amount of uneasiness that it might be necessary to have increased taxation.  We are glad to see from the report he has given us of all the items of taxation that it will not be necessary.  There is only one matter I would like to touch on.  I am glad to see that the Minister has been able to give effect to the relief on motor vehicles.</P>

      <P>I will leave it then. As I say, the public will view with satisfaction the fact that it has not been necessary to increase the income tax or super tax.  In spite of what Deputy Lemass has said, that we do not want to have millionaires, dukes or lords, I think the country generally will view with satisfaction the advent of money into the country, whether it comes with dukes, lords or anybody else.  If people come from America or other countries who have money to spend, the country will be very glad to see them and will give them a very hearty welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to Deputy Wolfe, I would like to support what <Col N="1109" /> Deputy Lemass has said about this matter.  It might easily have happened that the Minister would have increased the higher amounts of income tax for the purpose of getting a healthy distribution of money in the country&mdash;to relieve the poor man and to make the burdens heavier for the very rich.  We do not want to make Ireland the happy hunting ground of those international persons who belong to no country, though they are extremely rich.  They go where their pleasure calls them. They come to Ireland for hunting and fishing.  They go to Scotland for shooting and fishing.  They are increasing in types; that is to say we have all sorts of nations contributing. We have foreigners of all kinds. They are no good to any country. They make the ordinary workers of the country sycophantic and dependent on them.  They are a most unhealthy element.  These people should be taxed for the benefit of the State and if, ultimately, they tend to get out of the country I think it will be a healthy tendency on the whole. They are only a very small class and they really have no country at all.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister whether he should not have brought in a money resolution dealing with the moneylenders somewhat on the same lines as he dealt with hawkers. I do not know whether he proposes to deal with them in a different way. He might be able to mention that, as he promised to do so.  Ten pounds is the amount we suggest.  There is another matter I desired to mention, but it arises rather on the Finance Act.  The Minister promised last year to give drawbacks in the case of persons importing motor parts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>It was an oversight that a resolution in connection with moneylenders was not brought in.  I am bringing in a supplementary resolution, so that matter will be disposed of.  Deputy O'Kelly expressed <Col N="1110" /> regret that a certain protective duty had not been imposed.  The question of the tariff on motor bodies is before the Tariff Commission.  I understand that they are now very well advanced with the preparation of the report.  If their report recommends a tariff, a tariff will be imposed.  If their report does not recommend a tariff, there will not be a tariff.  In any case, the matter will be then before the Dáil for discussion with all possible information available.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kelly also suggested that a new issue of national loan should have been made before this. Up to a very short time ago, the conditions were such that it would have been impossible to issue national loan.  Certainly, it could have only been issued on very undesirable terms.  It was impossible to issue a loan before the Budget.  It would be impossible in any year, within two or three months of the Budget, to make an issue of loan on the most favourable terms, because all sorts of suggestions in regard to the possibility of new taxation, and so forth, would get out and would prevent proper arrangements being made for the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell asked a question about the duty on wines, but I shall leave it over until I come to deal with that matter on a subsequent Resolution.  There are important social problems remaining to be dealt with here.  There are many difficult problems before us, but what is encouraging in the present situation is that there is no indication, as there was at one time in the Saorstát, that those problems are likely to become worse.  The encouraging feature of the situation is not at all that the problems have disappeared, but that the problems have ceased to grow worse, ceased to grow more pressing, and that there is every indication that we will have the means gradually to deal with them.  They are problems for which nobody has a ready-made solution.  They are problems that no country seems to have been able to solve, and they are problems that there is no great likelihood that we shall completely succeed in <Col N="1111" /> solving either.  But if we can reduce the hardships that they cause and reduce the exact size of the problems themselves within a reasonable period, then we will be doing as well, I think, as any other country.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell said, in criticising us for not providing additional relief to the small income taxpayers, that the Saorstát was encouraging the bachelor, whereas in Great Britain the family man was encouraged. Of course, that is not a correct description of the position at all.  It is not correct to say that, any more than that within the last few years greater reliefs have been given to the smaller taxpayers in Great Britain than have been given here. The incidence of the income tax is to some extent different here and it is bound to be different because conditions are different.  It would be possible for the British to give reliefs that we could not give without losing almost half our total revenue. Without losing perhaps more than one-eighth of the proportion of their revenue from income tax, the British could give reliefs which would mean, if we gave them, that our revenue from income tax would be insignificant. Yet their revenue from income tax, with these reliefs given, would still be very large.  The fact is that we have not the great accumulations of wealth and we have not the great numbers of people from whom very great revenue in the way of income tax can be obtained.  Consequently, it is very likely, until there can be economic growth and accumulations of wealth here, that the incidence of income tax here will be considerably different from what it is in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass seems to have really no use for a great number of people.  I take the view that there is no use in saying that a man who might start industries here or who might develop industries is no good because his views are not stronger than they actually happen to be.  We have all too few people who, on any ground or for any reason, will support and extend industries here and <Col N="1112" /> it is not profitable to indulge in attacks on them or to say they are not to be considered or that they are not of any use to the country.  With regard also to people who have large incomes and who have some connection with this country, Deputy Lemass and, I think, Deputy Little, seem to hold the view that instead of encouraging them to come back and spend their money here, to bring back to this country the ownership of the capital which is theirs, we ought to tell them to stay away, that they are a good riddance and that we do not want them any more.  Deputy Lemass talked a great deal of nonsense about people who are elected here by the votes of earls, dukes and millionaires.  There are not so many of these people here that they could elect a Deputy, even if there was a constituency arranged to suit them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that there are a great many earls, dukes and millionaires in South Dublin.  I cannot imagine any constituency where there would be many such people.  The Deputy indicated generally that there was some disposition to consider the interests of the wealthy and disregard the interests of the poor.  The real thing we are trying to have regard to is the possibility of increasing the wealth and the productivity of the country.  It could very easily happen that a small number of people returning here would give us additional revenue in the way of income-tax equal to £100,000, enough to finance the scheme which was prepared last year by the Committee that was set up to consider how, at the least possible cost, some appreciable reliefs could be given to the smallest class of taxpayers.  It would be quite easy if a very small number of these people came to get enough revenue to give these reliefs.  If we could get revenue to give reliefs in that way, it would be a very important thing for the country, because, in addition to getting this extra money by the coming in of taxpayers whose income tax is divided with <Col N="1113" /> Great Britain and who by being solely resident here would have to pay their income tax here, it would be far better to get revenue from new taxpayers than by increasing the burden on others.  Moreover, if people like that did come in in considerable numbers, very much greater sums than we would obtain in tax would be actually spent in the country and would be of very considerable advantage to the country.  I do not think that conditions are so good here and that our resources are so great that we can afford to ignore possibilities of strengthening the general economic conditions of the country.</P>
      <P>Deputy Little talked about people who come temporarily into the country for fishing, shooting or for various reasons.  His argument would apply with a great deal more force to tourists who come into the country.  Other countries spend, and this country, by means of subsidies from local bodies, is spending an appreciable sum to attract tourists to the country to spend money and give employment.  It seems to me that it is an absurd view of national dignity for us to take that of all countries in the world we are not going to have these strangers coming amongst us.  On the other hand, if it is desirable and profitable for the country to attract tourists, it is more desirable and profitable to attract permanent residents to the country, people who have some associations with the country and who have control of considerable wealth, people who probably in the past were politically opposed to the majority of the people of the country, and perhaps may even have been described in a sense as enemies of the country, but who, if they came back in the new situation would presumably be prepared to accept the change that has taken place and be good citizens by throwing in their lot with it and bringing up their children as good citizens of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether a difference of 1/6 is going to bring in very large numbers or not.  I do know that the difference of 1/- <Col N="1114" /> brought in a certain number.  If a certain number came when the difference was a shilling, the possibility is that when the difference has been increased a greater number will come.  I do not know whether a sufficient number will come to give us an additional £100,000 a year in income tax, but I indicated in the Dáil last year that we have a scheme of relief for the smaller taxpayers which is not equivalent to the British scale of relief but which would cost £100,000.  If the £100,000 were available, I have indicated quite definitely that we would be prepared to put that scheme into operation. In any case, I think that there is no use in talking, as Deputy Lemass talked, about Deputies being elected by dukes and land-owners and about the revival of landlordism.  There can be no revival of landlordism. Even if a man tried to buy up land, which he would find difficult, there could not be a revival of landlordism, because there are articles in the land codes which prevent that. There is no use in raising up bogeys, and there is no use in preventing developments which, from every point of view, in my opinion, would be an advantage to the country.</P>
    <P>It certainly would be an undesirable thing that millions of pounds which in the past could have been described as Saorstát capital, and which perhaps could still be so described, should be lost to the Saorstát by the emigration of the owners, and in our present circumstances there is no use in thinking that people are going to be public enemies simply because they are owners of wealth.  Under the system which exists here and throughout the greater part of the world, industry is in the main carried on by private enterprise, with capital provided by private persons.  One of the things we do suffer from is that there are so few persons of considerable wealth who might invest in industry, and of those that there are, there are perhaps not enough interested in this country.  This is, perhaps, more apropos of the remarks made by Deputy Lemass than of the Resolution, but still I think it is fair to mention <Col N="1115" /> it.  There are people with incomes like £250,000 per annum who might settle down in this country.  If one person with such an income settled down here, it would immediately give us about £80,000 per annum in income tax.  We would need only two or three people like that, or five or six people with half that income, to get enough to provide the reliefs that so many Deputies have talked about.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell asked what exactly I meant by saying that I did not believe in causing disturbance simply for the sake of shifting the burden from the shoulders of one set of people to the shoulders of another. What I meant to indicate was that while we were not going to impose taxation which was not otherwise necessary merely for the sake of giving relief to a different set of people, if other circumstances caused changes in the scheme of taxation to become necessary, it might easily happen that it would be convenient, in making the changes, to give reliefs for which we would not set out simply and baldly to impose taxation in order to find the money.  I do not think I need say anything more on this point.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to argue in favour of higher taxes, and it is very easy to argue that we should make the wealthy pay, but there are, particularly in this country, limits to the extent to which that can be done. Much more than Great Britain we might lose actual national wealth and actual national revenue by the adoption of a policy that would in any way conform to what seems to be the spirit of the remarks made by Deputy Lemass on this Resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I never suggested that they would bring their capital with them for investment here, but at one time an estimate was made that there <Col N="1116" /> was £200,000,000 of Saorstát capital invested abroad.  The sense in which that £200,000,000 was Saorstát capital was simply that the people who owned the £200,000,000 lived here. If the owner of a particular block of property anywhere in the world is a permanent resident here that property is Saorstát owned; if the owner leaves the Saorstát, the ownership of that property, as well as the income arising from it, leaves the Saorstát. If it leaves the Saorstát there is this to be considered, that while people in the past who have been wealthy did not share the political sentiments of the majority of the people and were not in sympathy with them, we must not hold that that would be so in the future. There is every possibility that wealth owned by a permanent resident here might to some extent become available for the development of Saorstát industries, but if the people who own it cut the painter completely there is no possibility of its being available.</P>

    <P>This Resolution varies the wine duty.  Deputy O'Connell asked me some questions about it, but really I would prefer not to answer him very fully until the notes on which the treaty will be based have been exchanged. The treaty has not yet been negotiated in detail, and I would prefer that any full statement should be reserved until the treaty actually comes before the House for ratification.  I would merely say this, that this £12,000 will not be a loss to the Saorstat; that is, we believe that the advantages we will get from the treaty will be sufficient to justify the change.</P>

      <P>I would suggest to the Minister that it would be a far better thing to reduce further the amount of taxation on the very light wines, and not to make such a reduction in the tax on champagne.  It is a joke, really, to be reducing the tax on champagne in this country, and it would probably be of far more value to French wine producers if the lighter wines were made even cheaper than they are.  Besides the fact that these are healthy drinks, there is an immense amount of Bass imported to the injury of the Irish-produced beer, and I think it would be far better, whatever the loss might be, to increase slightly the tax on imported beers and imported spirits, and to decrease the tax on home spirits.</P>

Champagne is really a light wine.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not.  What I said was that it would carry very favourable consideration if we had on any substantial scale an indication that there would be a manufacture of cars from parts imported&mdash; that imported separate parts would be built into cars.  I do not think any indication exists that such would happen.  Of course, in order to preserve the revenue a very big change would be required, because if we were to exempt car parts, and if they were to be imported on a large scale, we would have to adjust the duty on cars.  I do not think there is any indication at present that there would be any considerable building of cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>My suggestion is that you cannot know that until you actually make the experiment.  It is not an exemption that was asked.  If the Minister remembers, he refused an exemption and then a suggestion was made that on parts that were actually used in the making of motor cars the drawback would be given. In that way, the experiment could be tried and the industry developed. The natural process of the development of an industry&mdash;especially the motor industry&mdash;as the Minister probably knows, is, first of all, that small firms buy parts, make cars and gradually develop from the knowledge gained by fitting and making cars into building up a real motor industry, and making the parts themselves.  In that way it would be quite in keeping with that gradual process which the Government is so fond of putting forward of trying to foster things gradually, to make them come in a natural growth.  I would suggest that if the Minister <Col N="1122" /> were to do that this year he would probably find that it would develop into something very valuable; that you would have small firms doing handwork giving individual attention to the work of putting parts together, and producing cars which, in due time, would get a market.  These firms would then be able to move forward and build cars on a bigger scale, and to make cars, the parts of which would be made in the country. I know an enterprising motor man who claims that he could, with such encouragement, develop an industry where the parts would ultimately be made in this country, without having to go abroad for them, because the mechanics would be trained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter in which, if there are one or two people interested, they should approach the Department of Industry and Commerce, in order to have the matter looked into thoroughly by the officials. But one of the difficulties that strikes me is that if you take the duty off parts, you are not so likely to have the parts made here; it will not be profitable for a small man to make the parts rather than to bring them in.  I think, therefore, it is a matter to which a great deal of consideration would have to be given.  I know that it was recommended by the first commission which examined the tariff policy, but one of the reasons why we did not do it then was the question of revenue.  We get from tyres and vehicles £500,000 a year.  I do not say that the freeing of parts is going to rob us of the whole of the £500,000 a year, or anything like it, but if it were going to be carried on on a substantial scale, it would certainly lose us a fair amount of revenue, and we would have to examine the whole matter.  There is the other point, that if we were doing it by way of giving a rebate or a drawback to the man who had in the first instance imported parts and paid duty, there would be considerable difficulty about supervision, as the tendency would be to use the parts for the purpose of doing ordinary replacements where parts would have to pay duty.  On the whole I would not say <Col N="1123" /> that there would be any use in asking that the matter be pursued by the Department for Industry and Commerce, but if there are people in the business or prepared to enter the business they should discuss it with that Department.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That on and after the 1st day of August, 1930, every person who travels with a mechanically propelled vehicle and goes from place to place, or to other men's houses, carrying to sell or exposing for sale any goods, wares, or merchandise, or exposing samples or patterns of any goods, wares, or merchandise to be afterwards delivered shall be deemed to be a hawker within the meaning of Section 2 of the Hawkers Act, 1888, and that Act shall apply to such persons accordingly, subject to <Col N="1125" /> the modification that the duty payable upon an excise licence issued under Section 3 of the said Act to a person to whom the said Act is applied by this Resolution shall be ten pounds, and no such person shall be deemed to be duly licensed under the said Act by reason of his having taken out a licence under the said Act on which a less duty than ten pounds was paid.</P>
    <P>The effect of the Resolution, which is subject to the exemptions in the Act of 1888&mdash;exemptions which may also be inserted in our section&mdash;is simply that the man who with a motor van at present engages in hawking will have to pay an annual tax of £10 where the hawker operating a horse-drawn vehicle will pay, and at present pays, a £2 annual tax.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt that, on the whole, this will be a very popular tax, but I think that at least one exemption ought to be made. We all know that the fisheries are about to be organised, and that the task which the new Fisheries Bill will impose on the Council to be set up will be to capture the home trade. In connection with that, the Council will be constantly up against this difficulty: that in the average small town shops will not be set up for the purpose of selling fish only and no other goods.  The position, therefore, will be that the Council will not be able to create a demand in these places for the sale of fish.</P>

      <P>There is another point that I wish to bring to the Minister's notice.  It is quite customary for shopkeepers in different places to go out through the country with delivery vans and sell goods&mdash; not to deliver goods already ordered or sold in their own shops, but actually to bring out lorry loads of goods and sell them to the people in the country.  I take it they would come under this unless they were selling fish, fruit, victuals or coal?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">

      <P>They would be caught.  I may say that there was a suggestion made to which I promised to give some further consideration&mdash;that the word &ldquo;victuals&rdquo; was a rather extensive word, and that we should make it apply to fish, fruit, milk and coal.  So far I have not had that suggestion fully examined.</P>

      <P>I entirely approve of the action of the Minister in proposing to impose this new tax.  At the same time, I am rather surprised that he has not made an attempt to increase the tax upon travellers operating horse-drawn vehicles.  If the Minister is anxious to do away with the obnoxious practice of people going out to the country and selling goods from house to house, a practice which has a very serious effect upon the traders in our small towns, I would like him to say why he has not thought fit, when proposing to impose this new tax on <Col N="1127" /> travellers operating mechanically propelled vehicles, to, at the same time, increase the tax on travellers using horse-drawn vehicles?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister considered that he may possibly affect injuriously the sale of certain Irish goods by the imposition of this tax? I suggest that, in levying a tax like this, some advantage could have been taken of it to force country shopkeepers to stock Irish goods to a larger extent than they do.  At present, all over the country, there are individuals who would fain buy Irish goods invariably when making their family purchases, but they find that the local shopkeeper is not able to supply these goods.  Very often these people are glad to be able to deal with one of these hawkers who offer for sale such things as homespuns. It seems rather curious that, in proposing to impose this tax, no notice appears to have been taken of that aspect of the trade.  If the imposition of this tax were to stop even one traveller from selling, say, Irish woollens, it would be a bad thing for Irish Industry.  I think the Minister might very well consider that aspect of the matter before asking the House to agree to the imposition of this new tax.</P>

He does not pull up selling his goods from house to house, but goes along with a load of second-hand goods and sets up his tent or stall in a market place or fair and sells the goods off the stall.  A good deal of objection is taken to him by the small shopkeepers in the different towns whose trade, as the result of his operations, is taken away.  I would be glad if the Minister would say whether such an individual would be liable to this new tax or not.</P>

It is certainly doing untold injury to the traders in the towns who are paying rates and taxes in their localities.  The Hawkers Act was drafted in 1888.  If a sum of £2 was considered a fair and reasonable tax in 1888, there is a good case in the changed circumstances that have taken place in the intervening period for a reconsideration of that figure.</P>

      <P>That it is expedient that a tribunal be established for inquiring into a definite matter of urgent public importance, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  the marketing of butter produced in Saorstát Eireann during the five years ended 31st December, 1929, with special reference to the effect of combined marketing on the demand for and price of butter produced in co-operative creameries, and</P>
      <P>(2)  the method of marketing butter in future which would conduce more effectively to increase the demand for butter produced in Saorstát Eireann and the price obtainable for such butter relative to the prices obtainable for other butters, without adding unduly to the cost of marketing.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to the end of 1927 butter was marketed in this country by each creamery.  In 1928 a marketing body was set up by the creameries and it has been in operation for two <Col N="1130" /> years.  During that time there has been considerable canvassing amongst parties interested as to whether the operations of that body have been fruitful or not.  I should say that roughly, 80 per cent. of the creameries are affiliated with that body and the I.A.C. is the biggest exporter of Irish creamery butter, but there is a big percentage of important creameries exporting besides that particular body.  During the last two or three years there has been considerable discussion in the Press, and wherever farmers meet, as to what the effect of the operations of that body has been on the price of butter, and, generally, as to whether the operations of that body are what they might be.  Recently, Farmers' Unions, and bodies like the Irish Dairy Shorthorn Breeders' Association, met and passed resolutions suggesting that the Minister for Agriculture should establish some tribunal which would inquire generally into the marketing of Irish creamery butter, and, in particular, the marketing of co-operative creamery butter, examine into such methods of marketing as have been in operation in the last four or five years, and make any representation which that body, after inquiry, would consider best for the purpose of more efficiently marketing Irish creamery butter.  I see no reason why we should not yield to such a request.  I think it is entirely an advantage that the Department of Agriculture should get that information as far as it is available.  I think this is a particularly suitable time to set up such a body, for I am assured beforehand that the Irish Associated Creameries Marketing Board that is in operation will give us the benefit of their views and of the experience they have had in the last two or three years.  I hope such an inquiry will elucidate the position, and come to conclusions which will be valuable from the point of view of satisfactorily marketing Irish butter.  A similar resolution must be passed in the Seanad.  The tribunal will have power to summon witnesses and to examine witnesses on oath.</P>

It is difficult to get a suitable body that is capable of examining accounts very closely and that understands something about the production of butter on this side and marketing on the other side.  I think the body I have mentioned is suitable.  Mr. McAuliffe is the officer of the Department of Agriculture who has most to do with the marketing of the butter of the five or six creameries which the Department owns.  It is proposed to add to that number some capable accountant who will be whole-time at the disposal of the body.</P>

I was glad to hear the Minister say that in the inquiry that will be held that body is prepared to give every assistance possible in persuading those outside the creamery organisation that there is a good case for the organised marketing of butter in the British market.  The time for this inquiry is certainly overdue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe there is a case for investigation into this matter of the I.A.C., but it appears to me that this suggestion is in keeping with the habit of the Minister for Agriculture, when it is a little bit too late, always to set up a tribunal.  I think the <Col N="1132" /> Minister ought to be ashamed of himself, when the price of butter has reached its present stage, to ask us to consent to the setting up of this tribunal as a matter of urgent public importance and so on.  Some six or eight months ago when the tillage farmers found that they had to give up tillage as a means of livelihood the Minister set up a tribunal to find out what could be done for the tillage farmer.  That tribunal was to report in the middle of December last, but later the date of the report was postponed until early in January.  The fact of the matter is that we have not heard anything since about what they are going to do.  When the farmers found that they were unable to compete with the British farmers or the Northern Ireland farmers in the British market because of de-rating, a Commission was set up here to consider de-rating.  That Commission is still in session and we do not know what is going to happen.  When it was found that farmers were paying rates and annuities on land that was washed away by the sea a Commission was set up to deal with coast erosion.  They are still deliberating and nothing has been done.  Notwithstanding all the Commissions that are sitting, nothing has been done for our farmers.  I do not know whether this proposed tribunal will be able to do anything effective. Possibly there is something legal in the form in which this proposal is drawn up, setting out that this tribunal is of urgent public importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then that is the reason why those words were put down.  I notice in the second paragraph that the tribunal is to investigate the price obtainable for Saorstát butter relative to the prices obtainable for other butters, without adding unduly to the cost of marketing.  The Minister has given us the names of men who will probably act on this tribunal.  I think I know only one of them personally, but from what I know of the others I believe they are sensible men and I am sure they will <Col N="1133" /> do their duty to the best of their ability.  What I would like to know is, are they going to listen to reliable evidence given by the I.A.C. or are they going to be treated to the sort of statement the Minister has made both here and outside&mdash;that the price of Saorstáat butter is catching up on the prices obtained by other countries or is as good?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was wondering whether the tribunal would be asked to listen to the Minister, but he has assured me now that he will not give evidence.  I know, therefore, that the tribunal will have a better chance of getting on.  It will investigate, I assume, the working of the I.A.C., for the last two and a half years, and will inquire whether it would be a good thing to discontinue the I.A.C. or let it continue operating as it is and induce or compel other creameries to join in.  I expect all these matters will be investigated. Even the greatest opponents of the I.A.C. have not claimed that the loss on the part of creameries that did join the I.A.C. was more than 5/- per cwt.  That would not amount to more than £100,000 per year, but, of course, that is a very considerable sum.  It is nothing, however, to the loss we are going to suffer this year on account of the policy of the Executive in not allowing the unemployed throughout the country to get work, in not promoting our industries, thus providing work for the unemployed in the urban and rural areas.  If the Executive had taken a definite step in that direction we would have a good home market for our butter and we would not be at the mercy of the British market as we are at present. Because we are at the mercy of the British market our producers of butter are going to suffer a loss of one and a half millions over and above what they suffered last year. It would be much more to the point if this tribunal were asked to investigate <Col N="1134" /> the policy of the Executive Council which has prevented our town workers particularly from getting employment.  If these men had employment they would be better purchasers of the home-produced butter, and in that way our butter producers would not be left at the mercy of the British market.  This tribunal may be useful from the point of view of investigating the I.A.C., and for that reason it is just as well that it should be set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know if the Minister intends to confine the inquiry merely to the sale of butter, or will he extend its deliberations to such creameries as send their cream to places across the Border?  Some two years ago, when we were discussing here the general scheme of creameries, the Minister more or less anticipated that a big general scheme would be applied all over the country, and he made special reference to the West of Ireland and the necessity for a scheme to deal with the situation there.  It is rather strange, after the lapse of two years, that we should hear from him again in this fashion.  He makes this proposal just after an announcement has been made that the price of butter this year will be very much lower than for a number of years past.  In face of that announcement, and in view of the expectations of the Minister some years ago in regard to the development of this industry, this suggestion of a tribunal rather appears to me to be a scheme to cover up any panic that may likely arise amongst the creameries that have been encouraged to invest capital and that are at present carrying very heavy overhead charges. To my mind it is very doubtful if this inquiry will be of any benefit to the farmers.  Like most tribunals set up to investigate different matters. I dare say we will, in this instance also, have a long delay, and the results will be negligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this tribunal is to be of any service all the circumstances connected with creameries must be examined impartially.  Those creameries which have abstained from becoming <Col N="1135" /> members of the amalgamated society must have had some substantial reasons for so abstaining.  They are not philanthropists.  They believed that they could market their butter better than by joining the society.  The reason some of them have remained independent is because they got better prices, and the figures prove that to be the case. These people will naturally have some doubt in their minds in regard to this tribunal.  They will look upon it as being rather prejudicial to them.  It is only fair that the Minister should give a guarantee to these people that they will have proper representation on that tribunal, such representation as will set at rest any doubts they may have. I think that this matter should be dealt with in a more open way.  The Minister should set up a judicial inquiry before which evidence will be heard, where both sides will have an opportunity of stating their case and where a proper decision will be arrived at.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am against it because I know the result of it beforehand. There is no occasion to set up a tribunal at all.  The Minister wants the verdict of the tribunal in order to fortify himself in any action he will take to compel the free creameries to be dragged into the mesh, or rather the mess, caused by the selling of butter by the associated creameries for the last two years.  That is at the bottom of the whole thing.  A short time ago at the Dairy Farmers' Congress a demand was made &mdash;a very inspired demand&mdash;for the tribunal.  One thing I am glad of is that the tribunal apparently is going to inquire into some manner by which we can increase the demand for our butter in our own markets. I hope, when doing that, the tribunal will consider the action of the Minister <Col N="1136" /> in not pressing for some tariff on foreign butter being brought in here.  Last year £360,000 worth of it was dumped into our Irish market in competition with Irish butter produced here.  I hope the tribunal will consider that matter.  I would like to know from the Minister whether he is going to take any steps in a matter about which we have heard much&mdash;in connection with the prevention of ordinary farmers' butter as distinct from dairy butter being exported from this country.</P>

      <P>Then the Minister is dropping it and I am glad to hear that.  Now the decision of this tribunal is a foregone conclusion.  I wonder where the Minister is going to get an impartial tribunal?  This controversy between the I.A.C. and the free creameries, between the associated creameries and the independent creameries, has been going on for the past twelve months.  The matters in dispute have been keenly gone into on both sides.  I do not think that there is in any Department any individual who has not taken sides in this butter controversy either for or against the associated creameries, for or against having an open market.  For that reason, I would like to know where is the impartial tribunal going to be secured? On that tribunal, there must be some men who have some knowledge of creamery methods and some knowledge of the marketing of butter.  As far as I know, practically every official, every creamery manager, and everybody connected with creameries in the country, have taken one side or the other in this matter.  It is for that reason that I say that the decision of the tribunal is a foregone conclusion.  Apparently, the Minister thinks it is necessary for him to fortify himself with the decision of this tribunal before introducing a Bill here compelling the free creameries to join the associated creameries.  I am convinced that that is at the bottom of the whole thing. If the tribunal will do nothing else <Col N="1137" /> but inquire into the inactivity of the Minister for Agriculture in not taking some steps to prevent this dumping of foreign butter here against the butter produced by our own farmers, then it will have done some good. That is the only hope I can see from this tribunal.</P>

      <P>At a meeting of the Shorthorn Breeders' Association some months ago, a resolution was put forward asking for this inquiry.  I then supported the demand or the request that this tribunal should be set up. There has been a very vexed controversy between two sections of the community on this matter&mdash;that is, the section supporting the I.A.C. and the section supporting the free creameries with regard to the marketing of their butter.  I would like that the findings of this tribunal would be such as would inspire confidence in those who, up to the present, have remained outside the working of the I.A.C., and would induce them to join hands with those who are associated in the I.A.C. in improving marketing methods.  From my association with creameries, I am convinced of the value to the industry of improved methods of marketing. I am convinced that combination amongst the butter producers will result in the ultimate success of this industry.  I am convinced that the ultimate success of the industry depends more and more on active co-operation between the various creameries in the country. In my judgment, it is not the right policy for creameries, any more than it is for individuals, to go on ploughing a lonely furrow.  It is not right for them to go on in a selfish way doing things each in its own separate way when by joining with their fellows they can do things in a much better way.  A great many improvements can be effected in the marketing of our Irish butter and by marketing it through the I.A.C. At the same time, I must say that I am in disagreement with certain parts of that work.  I know that very big improvements can be effected. It is not by remaining away from the fight and by not adopting something <Col N="1138" /> of a constructive programme that the Irish creameries can benefit. It is by trying to help in finding a right solution that we will achieve the objects at heart.  I believe that the attitude of all Deputies in this House, in view of the serious situation that confronts the creamery industry at present, will be as helpful as possible in this matter.</P>
      <P>I hope the members of this tribunal will come to their task earnestly, sympathetically and with open minds.  I would be sorry that any of those on that tribunal should come into it with prejudiced views. I hope, if any member of the tribunal has prejudiced views and attempts to force those prejudiced views on the tribunal, that the country will take him seriously to task for it.  What we want is to have this question examined fairly and impartially and in such a way that all persons who have grievances on either side will have a fair and open opportunity of having those grievances examined.  I hope the tribunal will be able to present a proper solution to this House.  I am generally in agreement with the principle of co-operative sale.  I think we have a lot to gain by proper development in the marketing of our butter.  It is perhaps a slight divergence, but I would like to say that if the I.A.C. were properly developed it would eventually gain the confidence of the creameries of the whole country and, perhaps, at a later stage it could do useful work in helping to improve the sale of our bacon as well as of our butter.  Why I say that is that skim milk as a by-product is used extensively in the feeding of pigs. And if at a later stage we had some such agency as the I.A.C. properly worked and with proper salesmanship, it would be a splendid adjunct to the farmers of the country in the sale of their bacon.  It would help them to get a better price for their bacon and it would probably open up better markets.  That would help all sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the personnel of the tribunal, I think it is a pity that the Minister has not given representation to the I.A.O.S.  The I.A.O.S. is charged <Col N="1139" /> with the duty of organising the creameries and supervising the work of creameries.  I believe that if the I.A.O.S. had access to the methods of the I.A.C. it would be all to the good.  Generally speaking, committees of farmers who are running creameries will not have the same chances and the same opportunities of investigating matters as the I.A.O.S.  I think if some representation were given to that body on this Tribunal it would be a good thing.  I would like if the Minister would consider that point.  One of the best ways of helping the creamery industry here&mdash;and that should be borne in mind by the people who are about to act on that tribunal&mdash;is by excluding foreign butter from this country.  I believe if the Irish creameries had the market at their doors they could successfully make use of it.  It would help to steady prices during the winter period.  We must do something to encourage the tillage farmers who have the means of feeding their cows in the winter to take up to a greater extent winter dairying and the production of winter butter.  Farmers in the tillage areas should be encouraged in this direction and in co-operation with the farmers in the central parts of Ireland who produce summer butter should have reserved to them the benefits of the market.  Butter from New Zealand and other countries that take very little produce from us should not be allowed to be dumped here at the expense of the farmers who are producing butter in our midst.  At present, that butter floods our markets at the very time when the farmer is expecting for his butter a price that will enable him to produce it.  The importation of New Zealand and foreign butter is having a very serious effect on the Irish creamery and dairy industry.</P>
    <P>I believe that we should have the home market for ourselves.  I saw in an American dairy journal the other day that the United States has a tax on imported cream of 30 cents a gallon.  The United States is a big country, and when the people there think it wise to have a tax against <Col N="1140" /> the importation of Canadian and other cream I think it is worthy of our consideration to bring about protection for our little market.  The chief offender, from our point of view, is New Zealand, a country which is thousands of miles away and which takes very little from us. I do not think that we would upset the British or any other market by saying that we want the Irish market for the native product.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a pity that the Minister has not specifically referred to the question of the administration of the present Marketing Board.  As Deputy Dr. Ryan said, perhaps it is a question of legal phraseology.  The question, however, is, are the tribunal going to examine the question of the principles of combined marketing, of which we are all in favour, or are they going to examine particularly the present system?  I think that that is what the country needs most and what it is most anxious to have, namely, a thorough examination of the present administration.  Like Deputy Dr. Ryan, I have no doubt that those who are on the tribunal will carry out their work to the best of their ability, but I think that the Minister should take the opportunity of putting other interests on the tribunal besides those which have been connected with the question of combined marketing up to the present, and he should try to get independent interests represented on it. There is no reason why you cannot get in the Free State, or, if necessary, across the water, a business man who has special knowledge of the marketing of butter, apart from what has taken place during the last few years, and who will be able to look at the question from a detached point of view to see where expenses can be cut down and economies effected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter which the tribunal should include in their inquiry is the question of the importation of foreign cream.  Australian butter comes here in large quantities.  There is a high tariff on butter going into Australia.  Is there any advantage <Col N="1141" /> in having Australian butter very often sold as Irish creamery butter in the home market while foreign butter is excluded in Australia?  Surely the obvious way to improve the situation in the marketing of butter is by cutting out the importation of the foreign article.  I hope that the Minister will be able to assure us that the administration of the marketing board, the method which it has adopted, and the economies which might be carried out will be examined.  In connection with the marketing of butter, I take it that the terms of reference cover marketing in the Free State as well as outside, and that the question of putting a tariff on foreign butter will not be excluded from the scope of the inquiry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of reference leave the question open.  Reference has been made to the importation of foreign butter.  It has been the practice in the past for butter merchants in this country to import foreign butter mix it with Irish, and export it to England as Irish, but they have been careful not to mark it as Irish produced butter.  It is sold largely in England.  In my opinion no creamery butter can ever equal farmers' butter.  It may be a personal predilection, but I think, and many people hold the same view, that really well-made farmers' butter will beat creamery butter every time.  Every effort should be made to protect it, so that people who turn out a good product in their own homes will get as good a chance of disposing of it as the Associated Creameries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that really well-made farmers' butter is better than creamery, but you can only get it from a few farmers.  You cannot have uniformity as regards farmers' butter, so that there is no hope for it <Col N="1142" /> in modern times.  The inquiry will be into the question as to how creamery butter was marketed in the past, and as to how it should be marketed in the future.  That is the intention, though the resolution is a bit wider.  That is the job which the tribunal will have to undertake, and it is a big task.  Such a tribunal could not go into the question as to whether foreign butter should be prohibited.  That question may be one that should be examined, but this tribunal could not do it, and you cannot ask it to do any more than the task it has been set.  Leaving out the references to the prohibition of foreign butter, which are irrelevant, as that question cannot be considered by such a tribunal, I may state that Deputy Gorry's point of view is on the whole my own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to remove a few misconceptions. I was not responsible for the establishment of the I.A.C.  Neither myself nor the Department has, or should have, anything to do with the marketing of butter as such.  That should be done by the producer. We want to interfere as little as possible in such matters.  The I.A.C. was set up by the co-operative creameries.  It was a business experiment and, as always happens in the case of experiments, you must improve your machinery in the light of experience.  I made no mention of the I.A.C., and I want to dispel the impression that the I.A.C. is in the dock.  I ignore Deputy Corry's remarks, because he is, I think, in a minority of one.  I do not want to prejudice or influence the operations of the I.A.C. in any way.  I do not know whether their operations have been efficient or inefficient.  I have no special knowledge, and I do not want to prejudice the question.  The position is not, as some Deputies seem to think, that there are two sides to a very big question, and that we are intervening between them.  I want to have an inquiry by impartial men who will examine the question as to how butter has been marketed not only by the I.A.C. but by every other marketing organisation <Col N="1143" /> and individual creamery in the last four or five years, and who will make recommendations in the matter based on the information they obtain as to how butter should be marketed in the future.</P>
    <P>I do not want to give the impression that this tribunal is being set up for the purpose of settling a quarrel between the inside creameries and those outside.  I hope it will, but I want to get certain facts through an impartial tribunal and to let the facts speak for themselves.  Let them be placed before the body which is more important than either of the parties, namely, the farmers who supply the milk.  If there is anything in the result, and if they make any contribution to the question which is really valuable, I believe that the farmers as a whole on both sides, both those outside combined marketing and those inside it, will be impressed by them, and possibly they may be the means of settling some of the difficulties between the two systems.  I do not know whether I should delay in dealing with Deputy Dr. Ryan's point, namely, that I should not set up this tribunal because the price of butter is low.  The price of butter, whether high or low, has nothing to do with the inquiry.  If it was higher than it had been for the last fifty years that is no reason why Irish farmers should not get the full market price, and if it is low, equally, he should get the full market price.  The reason that we are setting up the tribunal is that we are not satisfied that the farmers are getting the full market price, whatever that may be. I want to tell Deputy Dr. Ryan also that I have nothing to do with the price of butter.  If I consumed more butter than I am consuming it would not put up the price a penny in the pound.  With the exception of Deputy Corry, I think that everyone is in favour of this resolution.</P>

    <P>This Vote almost entirely depends <Col N="1145" /> on statute, as regards sub-heads A, B, C, and F.  There is one change which shows itself in both sub-heads A and F&mdash;a decrease of £1,400, due to the fact that the baronial guarantee in connection with the Cashel extension of the Great Southern Railways lapses, and consequently the payment under the 1924 Act comes down by that amount.  Equally the appropriation-in-aid is cut down by a similar amount, that sum not being collected from the Tipperary County Council as heretofore.  Sub-head D has to be regarded as a token vote and as nothing else.  It is impossible to estimate what further sums will be needed, and in what further payments we will be involved in order to wipe out this old outstanding item.  I think as far as sub-head E is concerned, the amount is founded on the experience of previous years, and it is not expected that either the £500 or the £1,000 will be exceeded.</P>

      <P>Sub-head A of this particular Vote makes provision for the payment of £47,288 under the Amalgamation Act of 1924.  During the discussions on the Act, which made provision for the payment of that particular sum, we were assured in a speech made by the President that the policy of amalgamation would get a period of trial, after which the Government would consider whether it was necessary or desirable for them to take the further step of nationalising the railways of the Free State.  Members of this Party supported the then amalgamation policy of the Government because it was the first step to nationalisation.  I am not aware that the shareholders of the Great Southern Railways Company, the workmen who were employed and who have been dismissed as a result of amalgamation, those at present employed by the Railway Company, or the trading or the travelling public are satisfied with the working of the Great Southern Railways.  To that extent, I contend that the amalgamation policy of the Government has been found to be a failure by those who have any interest in the working of the railway system of <Col N="1146" /> the Free State.

      <P>I wish to raise a matter to which I referred last year. Some years ago, as the result of a special rate levied in Waterford County at the time the railway amalgamation came about, when the Great Western Railway of England got the Rosslare line built, a sum of approximately £70,000 remained in the British Treasury which was the property of the Waterford County ratepayers. Portion of that was obtained for the construction of the bridge in Waterford City, but the people of Waterford County are still under the impression that a considerable portion remains in the British Treasury.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to make any statement concerning policy, or as to what policy should be on this Vote, but merely to try and get information concerning it, because I am not clear as to the significance of the decision that was given by the Supreme Court in favour of the railway company, over-riding the decision of the Railway Tribunal in relation to the question as to whether standard charges should be actual charges or not.  There was also a statement issued by the Minister in explanation of the standard charges in which it was stated that standard charges are not designed with other sources of revenue to bring in the full standard revenue. If standard charges are not designed to bring in the full standard revenue, how is it anticipated the standard revenue will be secured?  Heretofore, the company has progressed towards the realisation of standard revenue by the process of cutting expenditure to meet declining receipts. That, in the main, meant a reduction of staff and wages.  Is it expected that that process will continue even after the standard charges have come into operation?  I should like if the Minister will give us some information on the point.  It may be that the position is quite clear to him, but to those who are not in a position to get expert advice the situation seems very complicated and hard to elucidate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point on which I should like the Minister to give information. Last year, we passed an Act to enable the Minister to reduce the members of the Railway Tribunal from three to one, the one member holding office from year to year.  On that occasion, the Minister conveyed the impression to the Dáil that it was his intention to effect that reduction after the standard charges had been fixed.  The standard charges <Col N="1151" /> have been fixed, but the Minister has now re-appointed the three members for another year.  It was stated that that was done because there were a number of other important questions which had to be determined by the Tribunal and I should be glad if the Minister would tell us what these other questions are.  Apart from the question of the revision of standard charges after their operation has been examined over period, is there any other question of importance likely to arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the point that has been made with regard to the standard charges, again I shall have to postpone a full answer to that until the main Vote for the Department comes up, because it would be difficult to give in a concise way just what the full effect of the decision in the Court was, at least, if it is to be brought into its context and associated with all the matters that the public will want to know.  I can state roughly what were the contentions of my own Department in the interests of the community before the Railway Tribunal and I can say what the Railway Tribunal declared, and it seems to me that the judgement of the Court in acknowledging what the railway company desires is easy enough to understand.  I cannot speak of that at all unless I give it in its context and give a concise statement.  The phrase that the Deputy queried I think is easily understandable.  It is that standard charges were not designed to bring in the standard revenue. The Department's plea was &mdash;but this must be taken with many reservations&mdash;that standard charges ought to be actual charges.  The aim was to get away from exceptional charges.  The railway company's contention was that standard charges should be maximum charges.  They envisage a state of things in which possibly no single standard charge would, in fact, be the charge throughout the country.  Having got a decision that standard charges need not be actual charges, it is clear that standard charges are not designed to <Col N="1152" /> bring in the standard revenue.  There will be variations up and down.  The railway company suggested that the standard charges represented maxima to which they believe it will never be necessary to go.  I shall leave it at that.  A better explanation can be given on the main Vote.</P>
      <P>As to the Tribunal, I thought it would be possible to have the question of standard charges determined sooner, and that the life of the Tribunal might be brought to an end, so far as the three members of it were concerned, but it was afterwards recognised that other matters there would have to be cleared.  For instance, the question of the singling of lines occupied greater attention and a greater part of the time of the Tribunal than we thought possible at the time.  Once they were carried forward, as a Tribunal of three it was thought better to reappoint them.  It does seem that in any new traffic rearrangements in contemplation, even arising under the very Bill that Deputy Cassidy is so anxious about, the Railway Tribunal, possibly with enlarged powers, might play a part.  And as they had work to occupy them at the moment it was considered advisable to keep the body of three members in existence.  If the Deputy wants further details of their work, I shall try to get them for him.  But, again, I would like to keep that body, as an independent body, at arm's length outside Government control, and I would have to get a definite statement from them as to what occupies them.  I can, for my own Department, say what work the Department brings before the Tribunal, and in that way show some of the matter that comes before them.  But it would not be fair to indicate that that is, as it were, all the work they do.  If there are any matters of public interest to the Deputy I shall get the particulars for him.</P>

      <P>There is one matter that I should like to get some information upon.  Is the Railway Tribunal an ultimate court that decides on the singling of lines, for instance, in opposition to the wishes <Col N="1153" /> of the people?  It was decided to single a portion of a railway line running into Waterford City.  The people in the city objected very strongly to that.  The Chamber of Commerce and all representative bodies in the city objected to it and very strong resolutions were passed against it, but these resolutions, I understand, received no consideration whatever.  Is the Railway Tribunal an arbitrary body that can override the wishes of the people?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy prejudices the answer by putting his question in that form.  I do not think that there is any doubt about appeals being taken from the Railway Tribunal.  I do not think that is the point he wants information about.  If what he means by the phrase is, is the Tribunal such an independent body that it can override the wishes of the community, it may in certain instances, because the wishes of the community may not be backed up by law.  But another point arises.  I am not going to give a decision as to how far the Railway Tribunal is the proper court to deal with such a thing as the singling of a railway line.  There have been a couple of varying decisions hinted at in this matter.  But the Railway Tribunal can be appealed to, and its decision may be often, and has been in some cases, contrary to what the Deputy would call the wishes of the inhabitants of a particular part of the country.  There is an appeal from it in certain instances, but not to the people.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister could explain to us exactly what power he has in regard to wrecks.  Under sub-head F there is a small sum for service in connection with wrecks.  When a ship is <Col N="1155" /> wrecked on this coast has the Minister power to conduct an inquiry or is it conducted by the British Board of Trade?  Throughout the country there is considerable suspicion as to the circumstances of the wreck of the &ldquo;Celtic&rdquo; outside Cobh Harbour. I doubt if anything was made public with regard to any inquiry by this Government as to the circumstances of that occurrence.  Likewise, I do not know if the Minister has any information with regard to the wreck off Tory Island referred to in the British House of Commons, and in connection with which the English made various allegations of theft against the Tory islanders.  If the Minister does not conduct an inquiry in such a case I presume it is conducted by the British Board of Trade.  Also under sub-head H there is a sum for travelling expenses and subsistence allowances for the officers of the coast life-saving service, but I understand that that service is also paid for like the Irish life service by the British Government. That, perhaps, is only right, seeing that we have not got a mercantile marine, and as it exists merely for the assisting of British ships it is right that they should pay a contribution.  I do not know whether the Minister is conducting any negotiations for getting over that service or how far he has got authority over it, and how far the British authority controls it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received, during the course of the year, quite a number of complaints from persons insured under the Unemployment Insurance Acts in Dublin, that the attitude of the officials in the employment exchanges here is somewhat harsher than in the opinion of these persons it should be.  In fact, statements were made to me of a very strong nature, and I was told that workers who became unemployed and desired to claim benefit were not treated as insured persons receiving benefits for which they had paid premiums but as paupers seeking charity.  I believe these statements were, in the main, exaggerated, but I have heard so many of them, and they were of such a nature, that I believe there must be some cause for them.  I think it would be advisable for the Minister to take steps to see if there is any real ground for them at all.  Personally, I cannot give him any evidence that these statements are either true or untrue, but I was surprised by the number of occasions on which they were made to me and the vehemence with which they were made by individuals who had experience of going to claim benefit.  It is possibly due to the fact that in Dublin the work of the officials in the exchanges is much heavier and more onerous than in the other exchanges, and that consequently the atmosphere becomes less human and more mechanical, but I think there must be some ground for complaint in view of the number of complaints that are made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like if the Parliamentary Secretary would tell us whether the unemployment insurance code has been reconsidered by his Department with a view to effecting improvements in administration and a reduction of costs.  A Bill was introduced in the British Parliament last <Col N="1158" /> year which attempted, amongst other things, to amend the machinery for the determination of claims.  I do not know if the particular proposals of that Bill have been considered by the Department here with a view to investigating their applicability to this country; neither do I know&mdash;I would like to be informed, if it is not out of order&mdash;whether the Department has considered the advisability of adopting what was probably the main proposal in the British Bill, that is, the reduction of the age of entry into insurance from sixteen to fifteen.  The effect of that reduction in Britain was expected to be an increase in revenue to the fund, and there is no reason to believe that the effect would not be the same here.</P>
    <P>I would like also to know if there is any additional cost involved in maintaining the Labour Exchanges as distinct from the machinery for the administration of the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  If there is any considerable additional cost involved, I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us whether, in his opinion, the work done by these Exchanges justifies itself.  There has been a considerable decline in the last six or seven years in the use that has been made of the Labour Exchange machinery.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce told me, in reply to a question some time ago, the number of vacancies notified at and filled through employment exchanges, and it was obvious that although there is still a large number of vacancies notified and filled each year the number represents a very substantial decrease upon the numbers of other previous years. 16,800 vacancies were notified in 1929, and 14,830 were filled.  I do not know if that number is, in the opinion of the Minister, sufficiently large to justify the maintenance of the machinery if that machinery, in fact, involves anything like considerable additional cost.  It is quite possible, I admit, that the maintenance of that machinery does not involve any cost that would not be necessary if the machinery of the Unemployment <Col N="1159" /> Insurance Acts was to be maintained.  I would like to know if the question was considered.</P>
    <P>The cost of administering the Unemployment Insurance Act appears to be about 10/- per head of insured persons and about 30 per cent. of the benefits paid, and in my opinion that is high.  I think the figure of 10/- per head falls to be compared with the allowance for administration expenses under the National Health Insurance Acts, which is at present 4/9 or 4/10 per head.  Although it is extremely likely that under any circumstances the cost per head of administering the Unemployment Insurance Act would be heavier than the cost of administering the National Health Act, it does not seem to me that it should necessarily be double.  If it could be reduced, it would mean that the deficit in the fund could be wiped off much more rapidly than is being done, and possibly in time a reduction in premiums could be effected or an increase in benefits could be paid.  I suppose it would be out of order to discuss the matter of a reciprocal arrangement?</P>

In some of the rural counties, especially Donegal and Mayo, small farmers occupying uneconomic holdings, to make ends meet take up road work. During the time they are working on the roads, money is deducted for unemployment insurance stamps. When they become unemployed and make application for benefit, they do <Col N="1160" /> not receive benefit, although they have a sufficient number of stamps.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hard to go into details of that particular description, but I will quote a number of instances for the Minister.  The plea put forward by the insurance people is that they are not unemployed within the meaning of the Act.  It is tantamount to saying that during the time they are unemployed, as far as road work is concerned, they are able to take up work on their small farms.  The point is that a man occupying two or three acres of land and having a sufficient number of stamps on his card is debarred from getting unemployment benefit owing to his having two or three acres of land.  The Minister has pointed out on numerous occasions that it does not debar him from obtaining unemployment benefit.  I will quote a specific case to the Minister in which the mere fact of a man's father occupying six or seven acres of land debarred the applicant from benefit which he otherwise would have received. This particular case occurred in Ballyshannon.  The applicant had been employed as a motor driver by the Shell-Mex Company for a period of five and a half years.  During that time he had 286 stamps.  He received unemployment benefit for a period of six months, which, I understand, is the statutory maximum time in which they are allowed to receive benefit in any insurable year. He still had over 100 unexhausted stamps to his credit, and after a lapse of six months when he applied for benefit again he was told that he could not get benefit owing to the fact that he was not unemployed within the meaning of the Act and that because his father had six or seven acres of land he should be able to work upon that land.  As far as that particular case is concerned, it <Col N="1161" /> could be argued, I believe logically, that when that man became unemployed he could get unemployment insurance benefit for six months, and that seeing that he had over 100 unexhausted stamps to his credit he should have got a second period. But owing to the fact that his father had six or seven acres of land he did not get it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>He appealed to the Court of Referees.  I understand he was turned down by the Court of Referees and that the umpire concurred in the turning down of him. There is another matter to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention.  When an applicant for unemployment insurance benefit appeals to the Court of Referees he gets notification from the Department stating that his case will be considered on a certain date and that if he desires he can attend.  In many cases the applicants, in order to attend, would have to travel probably fifty or sixty miles, and they are not always able to do so.  Of course, it could be argued that they are entitled to have a representative there, but in rural districts it is very hard to get a representative to go before the Court of Referees.  I suggest to the Minister that sums should be set aside to enable applicants to appear before the Court of Referees, because at present it is not fair to the applicant who is not able to attend.</P>
      <P>There is another matter in regard to the Court of Referees to which I would like to draw attention.  Very often when the Court of Referees turns down applications it refuses leave to the applicants to appeal to the umpire.  I hold that if an applicant for unemployment insurance benefit appeals to the Court of Referees, and if he is turned down by two out of three of the Court, or even if he is turned down unanimously, it should be open to him to appeal to the umpire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to direct the attention of the Minister to the question <Col N="1162" /> of the unemployment exchanges. As far as Donegal is concerned, there are a number of exchanges, but in Buncrana area, where there are more workers in insurable occupation than in any other part of Donegal, there is no exchange.  I would suggest that it would be advisable to open an exchange there.  I believe it would facilitate the work generally. As far as the present Vote is concerned, it seems to me that the House is not asked to vote a sufficient amount.  The Minister is aware that there is no provision made for uncovenanted benefit.  I believe that the six months' limit should be extended, in view of the many people at present unemployed and of the hunger and starvation that exists in cities and towns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lemass referred to the attitude adopted by some of the officials of the Labour Exchange towards persons seeking unemployment benefit.  I have investigated a few of these cases of harsh treatment by some of the officials.  I find that it is only in rare cases that it has happened and that usually the persons in charge are sympathetic, but that there is a great difficulty.  The man at the hatch to whom the individual goes to sign his <Col N="1163" /> card for unemployment benefit is too busy to spend any time discussing a case with an individual and some better arrangement should be arrived at.</P>
      <P>I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to explain what system the Labour Exchanges have in regard to securing employment for men signing up.  Do they keep records of a man's trade?  Do they keep records besides what is posted up on the red card of people in a particular area who can give employment.  The Parliamentary Secretary is aware that only recently I was interested in a case of a man who was signing on for a considerable number of years. He came to me over some difficulty he was in, and I had him sent to Cork where he got immediate employment in Ford's.  I was informed that Ford's were looking for a number of men of his particular trade. The Parliamentary Secretary facilitated him by giving him his fare to Cork.  The system should be such that it should find employment for men when it is available.</P>
      <P>Another thing that I would like to get information on is when an arrangement is made between an employer on the one hand and employees on the other by which the employees become exempt from contributions for unemployment benefit what steps are taken to see that there is some guarantee of employment for the employees. An arrangement was made in 1923 between the Tramway Company and its employees whereby the employees were to become non-contributing but now there are fifteen or sixteen men who had been employed on road work unemployed and they get no unemployment benefit and have no means of getting benefit from the stamps to their credit, which had been placed there week by week prior to 1923.  I understand that after 12 weeks' work in the current year if their stamps have not got into arrears they can draw benefit. I would like to know if there is any hard and fast rule by which the Department is guided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing I would like to know is when companies go into <Col N="1164" /> liquidation what is the position of their employees.  Take the A and B Taxis as an illustration.  A number of employees became unemployed as a result of the liquidation of that concern.  They had been contributing as long as twelve years and had twelve years' stamps to their credit. Yet they could not draw any benefit because there were no funds there. After a lot of difficulty the Labour Exchange did manage to get the liquidator to place twelve stamps to the credit of most of these individuals and they were able to draw benefit for a certain period.  What arrangement has the Department for getting these things done without having to engage the offices of somebody outside to negotiate?  Why cannot that be done by the Department itself without keeping people hanging on waiting for this thing to happen?</P>
    <P>I would like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary something with regard to the arrangement there is for finding out where employment is available and as to how the officials can tell for whom this work would be suitable.  How can they tell from a man who goes into a hatch and signs up whether he is a good bricklayer or a good mechanic?  Do they send along the first five or ten men who apply and who might or might not be suitable, or is there any arrangement, apart from the fact that they post on the wall a red card stating that there is work available on such and such a building?  I have gone down to the Exchange very often and I have seen the difficulties of the staff.  When the door is opened thousands of men rush in. It is impossible for the staff to do anything in the time at their disposal except to have the cards stamped.  Would there be any way by which the assistant managers would have better contact with the unemployed men, rather than to have them shut off in an office where they see nothing except when a complaint arises?  I believe that if the assistant managers had contact with these people there would be a better understanding and there would not be all this trouble which arises between <Col N="1165" /> the men who are signing up and the officials behind the hatches, and in that way the men who would be most suitable for certain types of work would be found.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

      <P>These are the facts. I am not blaming the Department for the delinquencies of the employer; what I am blaming them for is that from the time that firm closed down until about a month ago no move was made by them to put these people in benefit at all.  I believe some of the men had a certain number of contributions, others had less, and some had none, that some men were out of benefit altogether because they had no stamps, and that others were because they were in arrears.  What I was wondering at was the delay of the Department in doing anything.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughColohan" hpid="Mr. Colohan Mr. Colohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colohan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some matters which I would like to bring before the Minister in regard to unemployment insurance.  One is the delay, of up to five or six weeks in some cases, before the authorisation of the benefit is made.  I cannot see why there should be such a delay in the case of some claims.  When you consider that a man, say a labourer, is knocked out of employment and has to wait five or six weeks before he gets any benefit, everyone will see that it is a real hardship, and I do not think there is any justification on the part of the Department for such a delay.  Several cases have come to my notice in my county during the last twelve months or so, and I would like the Minister to look into these and to try to get his Department to hasten the payment of benefits.  In connection with that also, I would like to bring before him what I think is the rule of the exchanges&mdash;the acceptance of the statements of employers and other people as to the actions of the man concerned.  In some cases there may be a little tiff between the employer and the workman, and every statement made by the employer or, we will say, other prominent resident, is taken for granted by the agents of the exchange, while no notice at all is taken of the statement of the working man.  I think that the function of the exchanges should be to try to help the working man more <Col N="1167" /> than the employer.  In some cases the man is discharged simply because he will not accept a reduction of wages, and then his payment of benefit is delayed because the employer, of course, states that the man left the work of his own free will; he never tells the agent that he has left because he will not work for a lesser wage.  I think that the Minister should take notice of that point and that he should give instructions to his agents to make certain investigations about these matters so that the working man will not be penalised. I think that the function of the exchanges should be to help the working man before anything else.  That is why they were set up.</P>
      <P>Another point I would like to bring to the Minister's notice is the payment of benefit to men who have left the country for a number of years and who, after returning and working again in the country have lodged claims for benefit.  I understand&mdash;and I know it to be a fact in one case&mdash;that they are allowed only the number of stamps that have been put on their cards since their return and that no account is taken of the stamps that were on their cards before they left the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughColohan" hpid="Mr. Colohan Mr. Colohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colohan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know of one man, a bricklayer from my own town, who has been working for over twelve months in Dublin for a member of the Dáil.  That work was finished and he returned to Newbridge to look for employment&mdash;God help us! He lodged a claim in Newbridge and he was allowed fifty-four days&mdash;I presume that was for the time he was working in Dublin.  He told me that he had been in fairly constant employment from the time the Act was passed in 1912 and that he has not drawn very much out of it.  He hopes that he will not have to remain unemployed for the fifty-four days. <Col N="1168" /> I do not think it is fair for the Department to penalise this man or any other man.  It is bad enough for a man to lose money that he has paid into the British Unemployment Fund, but that you should disown responsibility for all the stamps he has paid before he left is not fair. This man to whom I referred is a bricklayer; we have not very many of them in the country, and we should be able to find employment for the few that are left.</P>
      <P>In that connection the Minister should use his influence with his colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary in charge of the Board of Works, to try to get the Prince's St. section of the G.P.O. started at once to give employment to the unemployed bricklayers in Dublin and in that way take some of the burden off his funds, because as far as I can see the structure there is a standing disgrace to the city of Dublin, with moss growing on the steel work, while the bricklayers of Dublin are walking about unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryBroderick" hpid="Mr. H. Broderick Mr. H. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points on this Estimate to which I want to draw the Minister's attention. One complaint that seems to be general is the delay that takes place at the head office in Dublin in authorising payment of benefits. Another grievance is that a number of employers seem to think that the Act is not in force at all.  Small employers in the country towns do not seem to pay much attention to carrying out the Act.  They think it has been abolished.  I think the Minister should ask the inspectors to do what they did some years ago, to go around and impress upon the employers that the Act is still law, and that they must stamp the cards of their employees.  That would be very good business, because it would do away with the chief grievance that many workers have.  At present, when the cards are not stamped, and when these people become unemployed, they find when they go to the exchange to make claims, that they are not entitled to benefit.  The officials at the employment exchange or at the head office in Dublin tell <Col N="1169" /> the applicants to take their employers into court to compel them to stamp the cards.  The unfortunate workers are not able to pay for summonses to bring the employers to court, and the Minister's Department comes along after, perhaps, three or four months, and makes the employers stamp the cards.</P>
      <P>Another complaint in connection with this matter concerns arrears. When an employer complies with the Act and stamps the card after, perhaps, five or six months, the money is lodged, probably in Dublin, to the credit of the general fund, and in many cases the applicants do not get credit until they make claims. Weeks elapse sometimes before inquiries are made at the head office to see if the stamps have been put on the cards.  I do not say that the collectors misappropriate the money. They may do so in some cases, but I do not think that is general.  I would remind the Minister that, if the inspectors got busy, as they did a few years ago, the grievances that many workers now have would not exist.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>A type of complaint has reached me on a few occasions that I think it right to mention.  Men employed in insurable occupations, and who have their cards stamped, when they become unemployed, because they own a small piece of land or for some reason like that, are not able to draw benefit.  That complaint has been brought to my notice on a couple of occasions, and while I am not an expert on unemployment insurance, it becomes the duty of a Deputy to inquire into the matter.  To my mind, it is very unfair to compel men to stamp cards and that when they become unemployed they cannot draw benefits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesNicholasDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lemass referred to a rather serious matter when he made a sweeping complaint about the treatment of workers when they go to the unemployment exchanges.  I would be very glad to get from him particulars of any case of that kind, because my experience has been, in any of the cases where we have made an investigation, that there was no ground at all for sweeping statements of the kind. However, I will take serious note of what he has stated, and if he can make any case I will have it rectified. The officers in the employment exchanges are most sympathetic to the workers, and make every effort to facilitate them in securing unemployment benefit.  They are not there to prevent the workers getting unemployment benefit.  Statements have been made by Deputies about delays.  I have gone into the figures very carefully on many occasions, and in 98 per cent. the claims are paid automatically after the first waiting week.  These are the figures and they speak for themselves, showing that the offices are working smoothly and efficiently.  In only two per cent. of the cases is there any trouble, and where there is delay there is a necessity for it; something has to be got over, and they have to go before the Courts of Referees or before the Umpire.  The treatment by the Courts of Referees was referred to.  Deputies know that a Court of Referees is a body set up to inquire into any claims that are not automatically paid.  On the Court of Referees there is a representative of the workers, a representative of the employers, and an independent legal chairman.  The court carefully examines any cases in which there is any doubt and gives a decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>If I might point out to the Parliamentary Secretary my complaint was that the workers who appeal to the Court of Referees are very often unable to appear at <Col N="1171" /> the hearing, owing to the fact that they may live 30 or 40 miles away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesNicholasDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is usually a fairly bad case when it goes before the Court of Referees, and there is something wrong.  If there is any doubt, the worker gets the benefit of the doubt.  The Court of Referees is not set up to prevent workers getting benefit, but to ensure that only workers who are entitled get it.</P>

      <P>In reference to the Labour Exchanges placing people in employment, the additional cost would be very slight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not keep the figures separately. I do not think it would be a wise procedure to drop the exchanges, because they cost very little and they serve a very useful purpose. The different offices keep in touch with employers.  They keep a list of the unemployed segregated under different headings.  The local offices, as well as the central offices in Dublin, have been very successful in placing quite a number of people in employment.  During the past twelve months fourteen or fifteen thousand people were placed in employment. <Col N="1172" /> The case referred to by Deputy Briscoe and cases similar to it are very exceptional&mdash;that is, where there might be employment for an individual with a particular trade and where that fact might not be known.  That might happen in one case out of a thousand. The labour exchanges act as between the worker and the employer.  They are very successful in carrying out the functions of securing employment for people.  As regards the cost, a special committee was set up to inquire into the cost of administration generally, and it was suggested before that committee that the post office might pay out unemployment benefit.  After consideration, it was decided that the suggestion was not a workable one, and that it was better to continue in operation the present arrangement, which is working very well.  Proposals for legislation are under consideration with the idea of reducing the cost of administration.  We have had a committee carefully examining the different Acts relating to unemployment insurance.  We intend to introduce legislation which will, I think, secure a reduction in the cost of administration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesNicholasDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  With regard to the matter raised by Deputy Briscoe about companies in liquidation, the Deputy must know that it is the fault of the worker if he has been in employment for a number of years, and did not insist on his employer stamping his card.  In any case, when it is brought to the notice of one of the labour exchange officers that an employer is not stamping a worker's card, we immediately take legal proceedings against that employer. It is really the worker who should do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not my point at all, and I am not blaming the Department. I admit it is the worker's fault if his card is not stamped. What I did try to point out was the <Col N="1173" /> terrific delay, on the part of the Department, in getting cases of this kind settled when they arise.  A Deputy on the Labour Benches also referred to it.  What happens is that if an employer is not stamping a card, the employee is told by the Department to bring the employer to court.  It is well known that the employee is not in a position to do that.  The result is that months elapse before the Department moves in the matter.  My point was that the Department should move immediately. There is no use in telling the employee to use the employer and bring him into court, because it must be well known that the employee is not in a position to do that. The man has not even got the few shillings in unemployment benefit to which he is entitled, and which would be a help to him to pay his rent.  What happens is that he is told to bring the employer into court, and that is why I believe all the delay arises in these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesNicholasDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of delay comes up again on this.  I gave my percentage figure and I stick to that. The number of workers who are delayed in securing benefit is infinitesimal. When a worker makes a complaint he is told that he can bring the employer into court.  As a matter of fact, immediately it is brought to the notice of the Labour Exchange officials that an employer has not been stamping the card of a worker, we immediately take legal proceedings against him. That is the position.  The worker is also informed that he can immediately take legal proceedings against the employer to recover all that he is entitled to.  With regard to the case referred to by Deputy Haslett, if a worker is unemployed he is entitled to unemployment insurance benefit, but in many cases it may happen that a man who has been out of one particular job may be working at something else.  He may be unemployed as a road worker, and may have gone back to work on his farm.  He would not be entitled to unemployment insurance benefits if he was working on his farm.  He <Col N="1174" /> must be unemployed and not working to get the unemployment insurance benefit.</P>

      <P>We are making no case whatever&mdash;I do not think that an attempt to do so was ever made from these benches&mdash;against the officials in the labour exchanges.  In view of the way that the Act is administered from headquarters, I think these officials are as courteous and as capable as it is possible for them to be.  Cases have been put up here repeatedly dealing with people who may have four or five acres of land.  These people may get employment from the county council for ten, fifteen or twenty weeks during the year.  When they get unemployed and make application for unemployment insurance benefit, they are told that they are not unemployed within the meaning of the Act <Col N="1175" /> as they have land.  What employment do these few acres give them? In my own county people have come to me repeatedly and pointed out that they had one or two young cattle on these few acres of mountain.  Just at the time they are unemployed on the roads is the time when these few acres of land require no attention whatever. Their position is, that at the very period of the year when they are unemployed on the roads they are also unemployed on the few acres of land they hold.  Cases of that kind have been repeatedly put up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a matter for administration and not legislation.  It is a case where the head of the Department should administer the Act in a proper fashion, not merely according to the letter but according to the spirit of the Act.  As it is, these people are done out of the benefit to which they are entitled.  If they are not entitled to benefit the county councils and other public bodies who employ them should be instructed not to deduct money from their wages for the purpose of stamping their cards.  When the money is deducted and their cards stamped the people are led to believe that they are entitled to benefit, but when they are unemployed and apply for benefit they are turned down or told to submit their case to an Umpire or Court of Referees.  The Parliamentary Secretary tells us that cases of that kind are exceptional.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary know the country sufficiently well to be able to say that?  Can he imagine an unemployed road worker travelling from Ballyvaughan to Limerick at his own expense&mdash;taking a bus or train to Limerick, staying there overnight, and then travelling back again next day?  Could there not be a system by which the Court of Referees would rotate?  Surely it should be possible to have a Court of Referees sitting in different districts to avoid hardship, as in the case of an unemployed person who has to travel from Ballyvaughan to Limerick?  The Minister may believe these cases are not numerous.  I suggest they are <Col N="1176" /> sufficiently numerous to warrant consideration. The Parliamentary Secretary said it was thought that people might be asked to sign at the Post Office, but it was found that the old arrangement was sufficiently good.  He also said you could go to a Civic Guard station and notify when unemployed.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary know how far away these barracks are from people in certain districts?  It strikes me that it would be a good thing if the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They might get a senior inspector to investigate these cases and submit them to senior officers in the Department to see what could be done.  The Parliamentary Secretary might do something to alleviate suffering in that way.  He might consult the county councils on this matter.  They know how the Act is administered.  They see that the people have to stamp their cards and that they get nothing in return.</P>

      <P>There are two points in connection with this Vote with which I would like to deal.  One is the distance some may have to travel in order to claim unemployment benefit and register at the labour exchange. It seems to me that the areas are not well enough defined with a view to giving the opportunity to men to register at the nearest possible labour exchange.  I will mention one case, and there are many like it.  On Monday last, in order to register, a man had to travel from Birdstown, in the peninsula of Inishowen, to Letterkenny, a distance of almost thirty miles.  If that man could register at Buncrana he would have to travel only five or six miles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the great faults in connection with the Act is its administration, including the long delay that occurs when non-compliance takes place and is reported.  It is well known that in a case of non-compliance files pass to and fro between the inspector and the Department, so that a question remains undecided for months.  I have personal knowledge of a case of that kind. This is a matter that ought to be looked into, for it is the cause of a great deal of hardship as well as dissatisfaction with the working of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a great many cases, the present arrangements with regard to the Court of Referees are not satisfactory. It is quite true that this is particularly apparent when you are dealing with cases from remote areas. I have had cases brought to my notice of people employed in the extreme end of the constituency of West Cork&mdash;Allihies Mines.  That would be over 100 miles from Cork City where the Court of Referees sit. In cases of that kind, it is practically useless to offer a man a railway voucher from Bantry to Cork City. He has to travel close on 50 miles by road to Bantry.  It is humanly impossible in the case of an unemployed worker who had been working in Allihies Mines to travel there.  He has so many stamps affixed to his card but even with that he is not in a position to get unemployment benefit. In the case of a great many workers, it is very difficult for them to present their case in proper form. What ought to be done in cases of that kind is that the Department might make arrangements whereby <Col N="1179" /> cases which they wish to have examined closely might be investigated by an officer of their Department on the spot.  If an arrangement of that kind were made, much better results would be obtained and the true nature of the case elicited on the spot.  I admired Deputy Hogan for having brought up again this question of the very small farmer who farmed a very small patch of land.  The small farmer who has a small bit of land is debarred from unemployment benefit. I have heard the Minister say so often that that is not the case that I expect he will say it again this evening.  But that is not so.  I, at any rate, would not have Deputy Hogan's perseverance in bringing that matter forward again and again as he has done.  Cases of that kind are occurring, not perhaps to the extent to which they did occur.  Deputy Hogan is right when he says that the letter of the Act might be adhered to but that the spirit of the Act is not carried out.  The Parliamentary Secretary was, no doubt, quite sincere when he said that immediate steps were taken to deal with cases of non-compliance.  I am satisfied that immediate steps were not taken, and, if they were, better results would have been achieved.  It was necessary that these cases should be referred to.  A good deal of improvement can be effected in these cases without very much expense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary did not make any reference to the case of the Dublin Tramways Company and their employees, referred to by Deputy Briscoe.  Under the section of the Act, arrangements were made by the Tramways Company under which employees of the Company were excluded from liability to become insured.  That arrangement was made on the understanding, as far as I can interpret the Act, that the persons concerned were in permanent employment and not liable to dismissal except on the ground of inefficiency or neglect of their duties.  In point of fact, the men were dismissed consequent <Col N="1180" /> on the decision of the Tramways Company to reduce expenditure following on the strike.  The men were unable to claim benefit because of the fact that they were not in an employment where they were insured. Their claim to benefit had become inoperative owing to the period which had elapsed since they had put stamps on their cards.  The Minister must admit in that case that some hardship was inflicted on the men because these men would have been insured were it not for the fact that this arrangement had been made &mdash;that is, except for the fact that they were deemed to be in permanent employment and would not be dismissed except for inefficiency or neglect of their duties.  The men became unemployed through no fault of their own.  Steps should be taken to ensure that in similar cases in future hardship of this kind will not arise.</P>

      <P>I wonder would the Parliamentary Secretary tell us, as far as married women are concerned under this Act, what exactly is the meaning or the interpretation of the phrase &ldquo;not available for employment&rdquo;? I have had a case quite recently brought to my notice of a married woman who in the last six or eight months was refused unemployment benefit.  She had been contributing for the past fourteen years.  She appeared before the <Col N="1181" /> Court of Referees, and the Court of Referees found that she is available for employment.  The woman was refused unemployment benefit on the ground that she had not satisfied the court that employment is not available as far as she is concerned; that she has not satisfied the court sufficiently that she has sought for employment necessary to comply with certain provisions of the Act. The court first finds, when she appears before them, that she is available for employment as far as the Act is concerned, and then she appears at a later stage before the court and the Court of Referees decide that she is not entitled to benefit because she is not available for employment. Will the Parliamentary Secretary tell us precisely what is the interpretation of the words &ldquo;not available for employment&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>The two cases hang together&mdash;the administration of the Act in so far as it affects people with small patches of land who appear before the referees.  These people are dealt with in automatic fashion, and they are said not to be entitled to insurance.  When they come before the Court of Referees they are automatically turned down <Col N="1182" /> and they have to pay their own expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The two cases are distinct.  We have the statement from one Deputy that there is some improvement in dealing with land cases.  I would like to assure Deputies that there is no automatic turning down, none whatever.  I challenge every Party in the House, my own Party included, to put test cases before me, because that is the only way that I can properly deal with any allegations that are made here.  The only way that I can test an allegation is by means of a concrete case.  Deputy Byrne puts me a question which I cannot answer. It is not my business to answer it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The interpretation of that case does not lie with me.  On another occasion Deputy Morrissey asked me did the Court of Referees and the umpire finally adjudicate on cases in accordance with instructions issued by me or by the officials of the Department.  If I were to give an interpretation such as Deputy Byrne wants to-night, it might be taken as a ruling in many cases.  I prefer to keep away from any interpretation.  We have the Act there, and we have the people to administer it.  I am quite convinced, from the concrete cases that have been put before me, that there is no reason to complain of the spirit in which the Courts of Referees, as they are constituted, or the umpire, deal with any cases that come up for consideration.  As I have said, the only way to test any matter is to put forward a concrete case.  Since I issued that challenge on a former occasion, Deputy Ward submitted one concrete case.  I would like Deputies to read that particular discussion and judge for themselves if it was a strong case to bring here and to found an argument upon that all such cases are turned down, and the landowner, simply because he owns a patch of land, is turned down.  Deputy Hogan, apparently, wanted to get something out about the man with the couple of acres&mdash;<Col N="1183" /> poor land.  Deputy Cassidy wandered into that too, but before he entered into any concrete case the holding of land had trebled in size.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">

      <P>The only way to deal with any matters in dispute is to submit a concrete case.  I would like the Labour Party to pick out a few cases so that we can examine them.  I must say that Deputy Murphy has brought forward more cases than anybody else.  Let some Deputies who are not satisfied pick out half a dozen cases in which definite decisions have been given by the umpire against the applicants. We will then get to all the facts. We will be furnished with particulars as to the size of the holding, the stock on the land, the condition of the land, and we will see on what basis the umpire's decision was given.  If there is any hardship, then we can modify it.  I have challenged different Parties over and over again to bring forward cases in which hardship can be shown. Deputy Colohan gives me a case of undoubted hardship, but I take leave to doubt the Deputy's facts.  I refer to the case of broken employment. On the facts as presented by Deputy Colohan I cannot really understand why that particular man does not get payment of benefit.</P>

      <P>Provided what the Deputy says is correct, and if the man got certain benefits paid to him and then had certain work which again put him into the insurance pool, I cannot understand why he was not entitled to further benefit.  If a man got certain work after four or five years had elapsed which put him into the insurance pool again, and if he has got unexhausted stamps to his credit and is out of employment or not available for employment, he should get paid.  He is entitled to benefit as long as he is again brought into the insurance pool.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand why he is not.  There must be something more in it.  If the Deputy will submit that case to me, which, as he puts it, establishes a prima facie case in the man's favour, I will get it looked into.  As far as ordinary delay in dealing with cases is concerned, I will stand over the Parliamentary Secretary's figures. The Parliamentary Secretary stated that 98 per cent. of claims of a particular type are paid at once, after the waiting week.  I will say that of the non-compliance cases that Deputies get to handle probably a very big percentage would not be paid for months.  Why?  Because Deputies get the most doubtful cases. They do not hear of the cases in which men get paid automatically. They do not even hear of the non-compliance cases where investigations are proceeding smoothly and where there is every possibility that the workers will get the benefit due to them.  They do not hear of the cases where the office gets hold of the fact that there is non-compliance and then proceeds to deal with the firm.  In these cases there is no question of the firm breaking up.  We do not hurry them, and sometimes we postpone these cases in order to deal with more urgent business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cases that Deputies mainly get to deal with are the difficult cases, the cases in connection with which there are considerable doubts, the cases in which there may be an element of fraud, or something amounting to conspiracy to defraud as between the employee and the employer. Naturally, in these cases we must make very thorough-going investigations.  There may not be any conflict between Deputy Murphy and myself when I say that there is little delay in non-compliance cases. The Deputy may hold that there is <Col N="1185" /> delay, but he is dealing with a limited number of cases.  I say that there is little delay and I am dealing with a whole lot of cases.  If Deputy Murphy thinks that he has got hold of non-compliance cases in which there is what he considers undue delay, I would like particulars of them. I find that the officials even at headquarters, where they are more criticised than the officials in the country branches, do their duty with commendable alacrity and with tremendous sympathy for the people whose applications they are considering.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will say that for an ordinary case that period would be a great delay.  Deputy Corish knows of a case which has been delayed for over one and a half years and there is likely to be another half year's delay.  I must say that there is very grave doubt about that case and a suspicion almost amounting to assurance of fraud. Deputy Carney raises a point about men having to travel in order to register.  In so far as he speaks of men having to travel to register I do not think that the Labour Party are under any misapprehension as to the system that is in operation.  As far as registering is concerned, a man need not walk any farther than to the nearest post office.  There he gets an envelope and he puts inside it his application to be registered.  He may send that application in an unstamped envelope, addressed to the office.  The entire obligation on the man is to go the length of securing the necessary writing material and to drop whatever he has written into the nearest post office receptacle.  As far as making a claim and getting payment are concerned, attendance at the office is necessary in order to avoid fraud.  As to the distance which people are obliged to travel under the latter circumstances, I must say that the offices have to be centred in such a way as to make the cost of administration reasonable. We have to keep down administration <Col N="1186" /> expenses.  Deputies have been talking here to-night on the point that administration expenses are too high.  Our aim is to get the offices centrally situated so as to meet the needs of prospective claimants in any area.  I cannot tell the number of claimants that there will be in Bunerana or the peninsula north of it and I cannot tell the number of people who will be making claims in the Letterkenny area.  I have had the situation of offices often under review when it came to a question of appointing branch managers and I have often considered how better to locate them as the needs of prospective claimants might warrant.  We have endeavoured to place them so that the least amount of travelling is imposed on the greatest number of people.  I will have to look into the matter referred to by Deputy Byrne.</P>

      <P>It went before the Court of Referees on three different occasions.  On the first occasion the Court of Referees found that the unfortunate woman was not entitled to benefit because she was not available for employment and also because she had not satisfied the court that she had not been able to find employment. The case was turned down in the first instance on these grounds. A claim was re-entered and went before the court again.  The court found that they could not grant unemployment benefit for one reason, and one reason only.  That was, that she had not satisfied the court that she had been unable to obtain employment.  We went before the court and we satisfied the court in every detail that she had sought, and diligently sought, such employment and was unable to obtain it. The court actually reversed its previous decision on the same set of facts, despite documentary evidence we asked to have produced.  I have never known a court to follow such procedure in all my experience, and I ask the Minister what the interpretation of the Act means because, if &ldquo;unemployment&rdquo; is interpreted as at present, there is certainly no equity or justice.</P>

      <P>The Deputy, being present on both occasions, made a mistake.  The court could not rehear a case which had been previously decided on the same facts.  There must have been some new facts produced.  I do not know that there is any other point, except the point first raised by Deputy Briscoe, and secondly by Deputy Lemass, about exemption cases.  I think it is exemption and not exceptance he means.  Employment of a certain type is exempted where there is a certificate granted that the employment is of a type that would ordinarily be considered permanent. If Deputy O'Connell's point is that hereafter, owing to what has happened, a certain type of employment should no longer be considered exempt, that is a thing I could deal with.  I understand that Deputy Briscoe wanted me to look after people who, having been exempted some time ago, now find themselves without stamps to their credit and unable to get benefit.  In that case I can do nothing, because they are not entitled to draw upon the fund. They have not stamps to their credit. They might have had stamps to their credit under an early apprenticeship. There is a three-year period in railway employment in which railway work is considered still subject to the incidence of employment.  After that it becomes exempted and the old stamps are no longer effective. In the case of these men, retrospectively I can do nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be possible to have the certificates <Col N="1190" /> issued by the Minister under the Act reviewed periodically so as to provide against the possibility arising of a type of employment, which in 1923 was considered permanent, being still exempted, although in 1927 or 1928 it would be common agreement that it was no longer permanent within the meaning of the Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Most exemption cases arise on an application by the class of workers who are likely to be exempted.  They arise on their own initiative.  If conditions have so changed for them and if they bring forward an application it will be considered.  The Deputy wants me to review departmentally exempted classes to see whether conditions of employment have changed.  We could hardly undertake that.  It has to be recognised that in cases like tramway employment or railway work it is regarded as a benefit both by the employee and the employer that the contribution should not be deducted. It means that more is coming in at the end of the week or the month to the worker's house in wages.  The only other matter that arises is the question of the non-compliance cases, particularly the special case which Deputy Briscoe spoke of, a firm going bankrupt.  Cases of non-compliance, where in the course of an investigation it appears that there is a possibility of the firm or individual going bankrupt, are undoubtedly the most long drawn-out and the most difficult cases to deal with.  Over and over again we find the plea made, and evidence given in support of it, that if we insist on going back two, three, four or five years for arrears and impose that burden on a struggling firm at a particular moment, we will knock them out of business altogether.  In that event we warn the employer that the employee has the right to sue him in the civil courts in the ordinary way. We say, as far as we are concerned, that we are prepared to accept long spaced-out instalments provided they immediately start stamping the cards for the employees.  We have to make a decision on the best facts we can <Col N="1191" /> find.  Sometimes it is an intricate decision whether we should insist on the payment of the whole arrears and risk throwing a lot of people out of employment or whether we should let the thing drag on and let the contributions be paid by instalments.</P>
      <P>I cannot deal with the case mentioned by Deputy Briscoe.  I do not believe that an actual case has occurred in a bankruptcy if a claim were put forward to the receiver, or whoever was in charge, in respect of arrears.  The Deputy mentioned the name of the firm, and I can have inquiries made.  In non-compliance cases we are not entirely but for the greater part in the hands of the employees and as long as they do not help us we cannot do very much.  If they like to give us notice we can take action but, if not, we cannot do anything. We do get some information through our inspectors but if there is what amounts to a conspiracy between employers and employees to evade payment it is very hard to get on the track of it.  I was glad to notice from Deputy Broderick's statement that there is still an amount of non-compliance in the country because it means that there is still some money to be got into the fund.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £320,158 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, <Col N="1194" /> 1931, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, including Grants and other expenses in connection with Housing, Grants to Local Government Authorities and Sundry Grants-in-Aid, and the Expenses of the Office of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals.</P>
    <P>The total amount of this Estimate is £482,158 compared with last year's Estimate of £463,603, showing a net increase of £18,555.  In considering the causes for this increase special attention must be directed to two of the most important sub-heads.  In the first place, the treatment of tuberculosis shows an increase of £32,750, but if Deputies will turn to page 146 of the Estimates they will recognise there as a new feature, the inclusion of an amount of £27,750, a figure with which they will have been familiar during the passing of the recent National Health Insurance Act.  It consists of the compensation to local authorities given because of the withdrawal of moneys previously available under the National Health Insurance Act of 1911 for sanatorium benefit.  It will be noted that this sum would of itself exceed the net increase in the Estimates by £9,195. This sum of £27,750 is in effect a book-keeping transaction between the Estimates for the National Health Insurance Commission and the Estimates you have at present before you. The expenses of medical certification have this year disappeared from the Estimate of the National Health Insurance Commission which shows a net decrease of £29,997.  The only other sub-heads to which it is proper to refer in a preliminary review of the difference between this year's and last year's Estimate are the sub-heads concerning housing which, taken together, show a reduction on the previous year of £22,492.</P>
    <P>While I will refer more fully to housing at a later stage in my remarks it is well to remember that no direct inference can validly be drawn between the expenditure of one particular year and another, as much may depend on a particularly large sum belonging to some particular <Col N="1195" /> scheme falling for payment in one or other year.  The proper method of examining housing developments is to take cognisance of the moneys provided in the various Housing Acts since our first Housing Act in 1924.  The outstanding feature of interest in these Estimates is that they testify on the face of them to the continued progress in matters concerning the health of the community; the care of mothers and infants; the ascertainment and prevention of physical defects in school children; the feeding of school children; the care of the blind and the treatment of tuberculosis.  I feel that those Deputies who give any special attention to these matters will afford a very ungrudging acquiescence with the increased amounts now provided.  As I remarked when submitting the Estimates on a former occasion, every penny of this money will bring its certain return many times over in the prevention of needless suffering and in the avoidance of the many kinds of impairment which become chronic in adult life because of neglect, inattention or ignorance during child-birth and infancy.</P>
    <P>I would like, however, to give this assurance, that the greatest possible care is taken to ensure that all this money is legally and prudently administered. The accounts of local authorities are rigidly examined by my own audit staff, and the amounts passing from this Vote as recoupment to local authorities are likewise most vigilantly scrutinised.  In great part this expenditure is under the experienced supervision of county medical officers of health. When dealing with last year's Estimates I was able to report that county medical officers were then working in Cork, Carlow, Kildare, Louth, Offaly and Westmeath.  I am now pleased to be able to state that appointments have been made or are imminent in Donegal, Galway, Meath, Wicklow, Cavan, Limerick, Monaghan and Roscommon.  In some counties a considerable advance has already been made in the reorganisation of the public health <Col N="1196" /> services.  In Cork County much attention has been devoted to school medical inspection, treatment of tuberculosis and inspection of midwives. A system of central meat inspection has also been initiated.  In Kildare County the medical inspection of school children is being systematically carried out by the county medical officer of health and his assistant.  Provision is being made for the segregation of advanced cases of tuberculosis in an institution provided locally, while the systematic inspection of midwives is being carried out under the supervision of the country medical officer by the public health nurses. In Louth County the work is proceeding on similar lines.  In this county the striking effect of immunisation against diphtheria is noted in the report for 1929 of the county medical officer of health.  The number of cases of diphtheria in Dundalk urban district for the year 1928 was returned as 84.  The immunisation campaign conducted by Dr. Musgrave commenced in November of that year and 500 children were inoculated with three doses of toxoid anti-toxin before the end of December, 500 more in the spring of 1929, and another 500 in the autumn, making a total of 1,500 children protected against the disease in that year.  The number of cases of diphtheria in Dundalk urban district for the year 1929 was recorded as only 38, a decrease of almost 55 per cent. on the preceding year.  Immunisation schemes have also been initiated in the county borough and county of Cork.  The schemes are popular and are largely availed of.  From July to December, 1929, the number of children immunised in Cork County Borough was 1,600, and in Cork County 1,500.  County medical officers of health and school medical officers are unanimous in paying tribute to the cordial co-operation of the clergy and school teachers.</P>
    <P>The teachers are giving their services in connection with school inspection, calling attention to pupils needing special attention, and in some places helping to weigh the children and fill the school cards.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1197" /> The Department has long been concerned as to a means of extending pathological aids for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease.  I am glad to be in a position to announce that the Executive Committee of the Rockefeller Foundation to whom we are already much indebted for practical assistance have generously offered me a sum of £21.000 towards the construction and equipment of a diagnostic laboratory in Dublin. They will also contribute, as may be necessary, towards completing the training of any laboratory staff required.  I have had some preliminary conversations with the Minister for Finance on the matter and am hopeful that the project will develop successfully without any burden of consequence on the public funds.  It will be of very great assistance to the county medical officers of health, particularly in the neighbourhood of Dublin, when we have this diagnostic institution in full working order.  It will be very necessary to have an institution like it when we come actually to put into operation the legislation that we propose introducing dealing with the question of pure milk supply.</P>
    <P>Medical treatment of school children is in operation in the four county boroughs, in Clonmel, and in Counties Cork, Kildare, Louth, Offaly, and schemes are being formulated in the remaining counties where county medical officers of health have been appointed.  The records for the past year indicate steady progress, although medical treatment falls short of the completeness that it is hoped to achieve.  Generally speaking, it can be said that inspection revealed a high rate of decaying teeth, enlarged tonsils and adenoids and defective vision, while all forms of tubercular deformities and conditions of crippledom were fewer than anticipated.  The commonest physical defect proved to be dental caries, which was found in over 55 per cent. of the total children examined.</P>
    <P>The percentages in the particular districts are as follow:&mdash;Dublin County Borough, 65; Cork County <Col N="1198" /> Borough, 58; County Kildare, 54; County Louth, 51; County Cork, 26.7; and County Offaly, 60.  That is the percentage of total children examined who were found to be suffering from dental caries.  Enlarged tonsils and adenoids were found in 16 per cent. of the total children examined.  Medical inspection revealed that 11 per cent. of the total number of children examined were in need of the services of an ophthalmic surgeon.</P>
    <P>On the general question of child welfare, there has been an expansion in this service during the past year. Payments from the grant for the current year will amount to about £20,700.  The infantile mortality for the year 1928 was the lowest recorded in this country for any year, with the exception of 1923. being at the rate of 68 per 1,000 births.  For the urban areas, the rate was 90.75 per 1,000 births, and for the rural areas 55.75 per 1,000 births.  For the preceding year, the rates were, for the Free State, 71 per 1,000 births; for urban areas, 98.98 per 1,000 births; for rural areas, 56.08 per 1,000 births.  The average rate for the decennial period 1918-1927 was 73 per 1,000 births.  In Dublin County Borough, the rate of mortality among infants was 102 per 1,000 births, or 21 less than in 1927, and 22 less than the average rate for the quinquennial period 1923-1927, although in itself rather high.</P>
    <P>During the last financial year School Meals Schemes were established in Drogheda, Letterkenny and Wicklow Urban Districts. Schemes are now in operation in 32 urban districts, and in three county boroughs.  These areas represent over 75 per cent. of the total urban population of the country.  In Dublin County Borough, meals were supplied in the financial year ending 31st March, 1929, to a daily average number of children of 6,725, at a total cost of £10,856.</P>
    <P>On the subject of general administration, the county boards of health and public assistance have now been in operation for a number of years, and in order to enable them to get <Col N="1199" /> in proper perspective their general work and to assist them in dealing with the general administration of the work, which is pretty complex, we propose to hold a conference in July of this year, in Dublin, to which we have invited members of the county boards of health, officials, and others interested in the general work of the boards of health and public social services generally. The Conference will last a couple of days, and we hope by bringing the members together, by getting an exchange of ideas, that it will help them in the administration of their work and give them a unified outlook on their general problems.  The subjects which we hope to discuss at this Conference will deal with the despatch of business at meetings of boards of health and public assistance; the county medical officer of health and his functions; the health of the school child; the improvement of county homes; general rural health problems; the welfare of children in the care of the public assistance authorities, and such other matters as between this and the Conference may be brought to our attention as matters that may be usefully discussed.  I think it should be of great assistance in the general work of the boards of health.</P>
    <P>I referred last year to the progress of rate collection.  This was well maintained in the financial year that has just closed.  In 1928-29, the percentage of warrants for that year collected within the year was 80.5, so that 19.5 per cent. of the total warrants was uncollected in March, 1929.  At the end of the financial year, 1929-30, the percentage collected was 86.4, so that there was an improvement of about 6 per cent. in the collection, or the amount outstanding last year was only two-thirds of that outstanding the year before.  This is rather satisfactory, but we feel that much greater improvement can still be effected if a general effort be made to collect the rates earlier in the year.  Pressure is being brought to bear upon counties to get that done.  It is desirable <Col N="1200" /> that it should be done, as in many counties the public services still continue to be financed to a pretty fair extent by means of overdrafts.</P>
    <P>The amount of county overdrafts on the 31st March, 1930, was £137,000. This compares well with £172,000 for the year ended 31st March, 1929. One feature of the over-draft system was reflected in the tendency of local bodies to under-estimate their requirements and to continue to expend in excess of the amounts provided.  However, the improvement is found to be satisfactory, and there is a general prospect in the way in which local bodies are addressing themselves to this matter of rate collection that the situation will improve, and improve rapidly, so that we may very shortly hope to get to the position that the total warrants will be collected by the end of the financial year.</P>
    <P>The particular changes effected in housing policy during the present financial year were (1) the passing into law of the Housing Act, 1929; (2) the opening of the Local Loans Fund for the making of advances to urban authorities for the erection of houses under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts.  Under the Housing Acts, 1924 to 1929, the amount of £1,350,000 was provided for the making of grants to private persons, to public utility societies, and to local authorities for the erection of houses.  Of that entire sum £1,276,889 was allotted up to 1st April, as follows: to private persons, £831,016, representing 12,293 houses; to public utility societies, £84,985, representing 922 houses, and to local authorities £360,888, representing 4,615 houses.  The balance un-allocated on 1st April was £73,110.</P>
    <P>Of the 13,215 houses erected and being erected by private persons and public utility societies, 10,874 have been certified as completed: of the 4,615 houses approved for building by local authorities, 3,900, approximately, have been completed; of the 13,215 approved for erection by private persons and public utility societies, 9,151, or 69 per cent., are <Col N="1201" /> in rural areas.  It may be of interest to show the counties in which the greater number were built.  Cork County comes first with 1,147 houses, Mayo next with 1,134, Galway 844 houses, Dublin 773 houses, Kerry 706 houses.  The counties in which the smaller number of houses have been built, working backwards, are: Carlow, which is the lowest, 6 houses; Kildare, 28; Offaly, 44; Waterford, 67; Kilkenny, 73, and Wicklow, 79. These figures will be of interest when we see that private persons, in rural areas in Mayo, built 1,134 during the last few years as against six in the County Carlow.  In the county boroughs 1,997 houses are being built by private persons and public utility societies, of which 90 are being built in Cork County Borough, 1,658 in Dublin, 95 in Waterford and 154 in Limerick.</P>
    <P>In the urban districts 1,409 houses are being built by private persons and public utility societies, and 166 houses are being built in towns with Town Commissioners.  The total number of houses in respect of which grants have been allocated to private persons and public utility societies is 13,215, being an increase of 1,960 during the year ending 31st March, 1930.  In all there are 27 public utility societies carrying out operations.  As I say, advances from the Local Loans Fund have been made available during the year for the erection of houses by urban authorities.  These are repayable over a period of 35 years at 5¾ per cent. interest under certain general conditions.  We were able to report, that as a result of making the local loans available to local authorities, there was a very definite move on the part of the local authorities to build houses. At present, of the total number of 93 local authorities, including Town Commissioners, 27 local authorities are in the position that they have acquired sites and have had plans approved for the erection of 1,591 houses.  In the case of another 22 local authorities they are acquiring sites, and plans are being prepared for 363 houses.  During the last couple of months we have <Col N="1202" /> had a census taken by the local authorities of the total number of houses which they considered required to be built, in order to solve the working class problem in their area.  On the survey, as carried out by the local authorities themselves, and the estimates furnished, we find that about 43,000 houses are, in the opinion of the local authorities, necessary.</P>
    <P>I found it desirable to send an inspecting group, consisting of an architect, or an architect with a medical inspector, to examine the situation in the light of the figures submitted by the local authorities, with a view to satisfying ourselves as to the general reliance that could be placed on the figures submitted by the local authorities.  I do not mean that we doubted the bona fides of the local authorities in submitting their figures, but we felt it was well to review their figures by expert technical men.  Inspection of this particular kind was carried out in 23 districts out of 93, and in these 23 districts the number of houses estimated as required by local authorities was 6,738.  The number estimated by the inspectors was 4,776.  Thus it would appear that we might take 30 per cent. off the figure of 43,000 houses, and we are fairly sure that if 30,000 houses were built in these urban districts the position would be very satisfactory from the general housing point of view.  As I say, the opening of the Local Loans Fund to the local authorities has brought about a speeding-up in the preparation of plans and the facing of the housing requirements in these districts by a large number of local authorities. The disposition in the local authorities is pretty satisfactory, although there are cases of local authorities making no attempt to deal with the housing problem that they know very definitely exists in their areas, and we will have to consider in time what steps require to be taken with regard to these local authorities.</P>
    <P>The whole question of roads and the question of efficiency in the methods of the work itself, and of <Col N="1203" /> improving the organisation in the area of the road authorities, has continued to engage the unremitting attention of the Department.  With the exception of a few counties there is no serious difficulty between the Department and the road authorities and, even in these counties, the difficulties have very largely disappeared. Taking the counties as a whole they have shown keen realisation of their road needs and desire to have, in the solution of their difficulties, the assistance which the Department can, and is always willing to, afford.  So far as grants for the coming year are concerned we are for the present, allocating £700,000 towards the upkeep and improvement of roads.  Whether any larger sum can be allocated will depend upon the revenue as well as upon the rate of expenditure in respect of new grants and commitments on foot of existing schemes.  All our grants have been made in anticipation of revenue so that at the beginning of each financial year we have commitments to meet apart from new grants.  These commitments of old grants at present amount to about £345,000.  There is due to the Exchequer under the Old Road Fund Advances at present the sum of £640,000.</P>
    <P>For the year 1927-28, the year in which the grant towards the upkeep of main roads was instituted, 1928-29 and 1929-30 we gave as an upkeep grant 50 per cent. of the cost of repair of main roads which were trunk roads, and 30 per cent. of the cost of those which were link roads.  We found that this had two unsatisfactory aspects&mdash;one, a tendency to neglect link roads, the other, an involved and onerous amount of account keeping in the books of the county councils.  A man employed on a trunk, link and county road in the one week had to have his wages apportioned to three different accounts, and, in some counties, entered on three separate pay-sheets.  Accordingly, the position was examined, and it was decided to fix a flat rate for all main roads, whether trunk <Col N="1204" /> roads or link roads.  One disadvantage in this is that, in future, the county council accounts will not show the expenditure as between trunk and link roads.  It was felt, however, that with the data of the three years available the balance of advantage was in fixing a flat rate.  This rate for 1930-31 is 40 per cent. of the cost of the repair of all main roads, and represents the proportion which the grant towards upkeep of main roads allocated in the past three years bore to the expenditure on these roads. The fixing of a flat rate has been welcomed by the county councils generally and the county surveyors as an improvement on the former basis, and, judging by the increased sums voted for the repair of main roads, leeway is being made up in regard to the link roads.  The grant towards upkeep of main roads, which was about £200,000 when instituted, reached £300,000 in 1929-30, and will be nearly £340,000 for the coming year.</P>
    <P>On the general question as to the amount of money being spent by local authorities, that is on general upkeep and repair only, the Deputies may be interested to have the figures, say, for the last three years.  I will give the actual figures for 1927-28, and the estimated figures for the year 1928-29, and the year 1929-30.  The gross amount spent in the year 1927-28 was £1,208,058, of which £198,589 was a grant, and the amount falling on the rates was £1,009,469.  The gross amount in 1928-29 had increased to £1,284,360.  The gross amount had increased in the year 1929-30 to £1,363,510.  The grant in the year 1928-29 was £210,330, and in the year 1929-30 was £308,549.  I have said it is increasing this year to £340,000.  The total amount falling on the rates in the year 1928-29 was £1,074,030.  This amount had decreased by about £20,000 in the year ending March, 1930, the net amount falling on the rates in that year being £1,054,961.  For the current year the gross amount is £1,475,955, the net amount falling on the rates being £1,140,147.  I quoted a figure <Col N="1205" /> last year as being the percentage increase over 1913-14 that local authorities were spending on their roads.  I think I said that there was a difficulty in finding out exactly what local authorities spent on their roads in the year 1913-14, that certain loan charges might have been taken into consideration in the figure that was taken as a basis for the figure I gave last year.  The figure I quoted last year as being the percentage increase last year has gone out of my head at the moment, but the estimated expenditure by local authorities this year when compared with 1913-14 shows an increase of 80 per cent.  When we say that we have to remember, however, that there is an increased agricultural grant paid to local authorities since then.  The average monthly employment on roads during the past eleven months on direct labour has been about 13,000 men; a high proportion of these men are employed on the maintenance of main roads.</P>
    <P>The present system of carrying out engineering work in counties has grown up on somewhat indefinite lines, or rather upon lines which did not take into account the possibility of substantial savings in salaries and travelling expenses and which omitted altogether a consideration of the position of the chief engineering officer of the county&mdash;viz., the county surveyor.  We have the position in which the twenty-seven county councils between them employ 30 county surveyors, 128 whole-time assistant surveyors, 10 part-time assistant surveyors, and I find that there are 31 boards of health and public assistance who administer between them practically the same territory as the county councils and employ upwards of 100 engineers or clerks of works.  Several of the officers employed by boards of health and public assistance are already assistant county surveyors, but there are only two county surveyors employed by those boards &mdash;South Kerry and Limerick.</P>
    <P>The result is there is a very considerable amount of overlapping, a <Col N="1206" /> very considerable want of co-ordination, and I have come to the conclusion that as we get an opportunity of reorganising in different counties we have to arrive at a position in which the county surveyor will be the chief engineering officer in the county.  We are getting at present county surveyors appointed by the Local Appointments Commission. They are first class, all-round engineers. From the point of view of general benefit to the country alone, it would be very wrong that men with the possibilities of these men should get into the groove of simply being roads men and would be denied, simply because they were kept away from the work, the possibility of developing generally on the engineering side.  If we had the county surveyor in the position of the chief engineering officer of the county, then he would be responsible for repairs to cottages, he would be responsible for waterworks schemes and sewerage schemes, not necessarily the person who would draw the plans in connection with big waterworks or sewerage schemes, but the person who would advise the local body in charge as to the type of the particular consulting engineer that would be brought in, and generally would be responsible for the administration of these services when they had been set up.  However, the present position is that the county surveyor is simply responsible for his roads.  The assistant county surveyors are simply responsible for roads, whereas they could, being men also who are selected through the Local Appointments Commissioners and men of general all-round engineering capacity, under the county surveyor as chief engineering officer, be responsible for all the engineering works in their sub-area.  The matter has been taken up, I think, by three county councils at the present moment where circumstances are such as would make it possible to carry out all the necessary reorganisation by appointing a county surveyor who will be in the position of being the chief engineering officer of the county.  Deputy Carey says, I <Col N="1207" /> think, that it would be impossible for the county surveyor to do all this.  He ought not to judge by the position of Cork, which is very different.</P>

      <P>I want to explain the policy of the Department at the present moment and our approach to this matter.  I think if Deputies will consider it they will see that we are working upon proper lines.  It would be a tremendous thing for the county if we had the fabric of engineering power scattered through the country under our county surveyors not only in the handling of the work of the county councils and the boards of health, but in other respects.  The reaction on the general mind of the country through proper co-ordination of the engineering services under one man would be very great educationally. The value of the work that will be carried on under the county medical officer of health scheme is going to have an inductive educational effect. I think we would have as valuable an inductive educational effect arising out of a scheme operating under properly qualified engineering officers throughout the country.  It would, in our opinion, bring about much more satisfactory work to the nation and effect great economics. and would cut out a lot of the very poor and questionable work that is being done at the present moment by a body of officers scattered through the country, principally under the boards of health.  I think these are the only matters that I want to bring before the notice of Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo; I was prompted to put <Col N="1208" /> down this motion by a recent utterance of the Minister for Local Government in the debate on either the Vote on Account or the Central Fund Bill that it was not the intention of his Department to endeavour to do anything in the near future so far as rural housing was concerned.  I am wondering what prompted the Minister to arrive at that decision.  His inspectors are certainly very active all over the country, and I think it is apparent to them that housing for the really poor in rural areas is as much required as it is in urban centres.  When I speak of rural housing, I do not altogether mean housing in the countryside.  There are large villages and small towns at the moment which have no power to proceed with housing schemes, and these villages and small towns are deteriorating rapidly.  The housing shortage has become very acute within recent years.</P>
      <P>The Minister has told us that 69 per cent. of the houses that have been erected have been built in rural areas.  I would remind the Minister that the people for whom these houses were built are in a great many cases people who could have afforded to build the houses themselves. When those housing grants were first instituted one thought that it was the intention of the Minister to have them applied to the building of houses for the working classes all over the country.  I know quite well that at the beginning there was a sort of intention that these housing grants should initiate employment which was badly needed.  I am prepared to believe that there is something in that.  At the same time, when one hears a definite statement made by the Minister who is responsible for the public health and especially for the housing of the people, that he does not intend to approach the Minister for Finance with a view to having him do something for housing in rural areas, one is prompted to put down a motion of this kind in order to draw the attention of the House and of the country generally to the Minister's policy in this direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1209" /> In the constituency that I represent there are some large villages and one town at least, the town of Gorey.  That town has a population of about 3,000 and they are unable to do anything so far as housing is concerned.  It is places like that that are suffering through the Minister's want of action.  Anybody passing through these places occasionally will find that housing is needed there just as much as it is in the urban area.  I am prepared to admit that a great deal has been done in so far as urban housing is concerned and that a serious effort was made during the past twelve months when local loans were made available to local authorities and they were put in a position to build houses that could be let at something approaching an economic rent; but the rent that is put on, even with the advances from the Local Loans Fund for 35 years, is not at all commensurate with the position of the unskilled worker, and one wonders if the Minister would be prepared to make further representations to the Minister for Finance with a view to getting cheaper money than he has been giving for the past twelve months.  When it was decided by the Minister for Finance to permit money being released from the Local Loans Fund the bank rate stood at something like seven per cent.  The bank rate to-day is 4½ per cent. and I think we are entitled to take that into consideration and to expect that owing to the easing of the money market the rate which the local authorities are charged for moneys from the Local Loans Fund should be reduced.  Taking a sum in simple proportion, if the bank rate was 7 per cent. then and 4½ per cent. now, it would reduce the rent of a house that would be built at about £250 by something like 1s. 9d. per week.  That is a relief that would be welcome all over the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>What would give the relief?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The bank rate was 7 per cent. when the Minister for Finance decided to release the Local <Col N="1210" /> Loans Fund.  To-day it is 4½ per cent.  If the rate to local authorities was reduced accordingly it would be a relief of about 1/9 a week in the rent of a house that cost about £250 to build.  In the Wexford urban area they built houses quite recently.  They were built under the conditions of the Local Loans Fund. The annuity charged was £6 13s. 4d. per £100.  These houses are let at 6/6 per week, which covers all charges.  We feel that that is too dear, that we are not catering for the people we would like to cater for. We want a house much cheaper than that for the unskilled worker.  I think the Minister will admit that if a man has, as he has in a great many cases in some urban areas, only 30/- to £2 a week, and if he has to take 6/6 out of that for rent it leaves him in a very miserable position for the rest of the week.  I do think that the Minister should make strong representations to the Minister for Finance, in view of the decrease in the bank rate, to have a review of the whole situation in so far as that matter is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A thing that I asked the Minister to do some time ago was to endeavour to get into touch with people in this country who are quarrying slates.  Unfortunately, at the moment it would be uneconomic to use Irish slates on a great many of the houses that are being built. We all regret that; I certainly regret it, and I have always been an advocate of Irish manufacture; but we found in the case of a bungalow, where the area of roof is rather large, that it would mean a difference of 10d. or 1/- in the rent to use Irish slates as against asbestos slating, and that is a bit of a problem for us.  I do believe that if the Minister for Local Government were to get into touch with the slate quarry owners and endeavour to obtain an agreement with them whereby a general supply of slates would be forthcoming for all urban authorities, if he were to go into the matter, find out what the needs of the urban authorities are, and buy in a large way, that the problem would almost <Col N="1211" /> entirely disappear.  We all know that the ordinary slate forms a better roof than the asbestos slate, but, as I say, the position is uneconomic, and something ought to be done by the Minister to get into touch with these people with a view to having the problem solved.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the county medical officers, and I am wondering when he is going to use the powers that he received under the 1925 Act to insist on county councils or county boards of health, as the case may be, appointing these medical officers.  I have always been an advocate of the appointment of county medical officers.  On three or four occasions the Wexford County Council turned down such a proposal, but quite recently we happened to get it passed by one or two votes.  A notice of motion was handed in to rescind that, but at the last meeting it was defeated.  We have arrived at the stage where the majority in County Wexford wants a county medical officer, and I do not think that the Minister should allow this thing to tarry, as it has been doing since 1925, because we know that the services of this county medical officer are badly needed in the various counties in the Free State. In my opinion, the most important function he has is school inspection. In a great many cases, as we know, children's health has been neglected, with the result that we have had young men and young women going to early graves.  Some people would perhaps resent the inspection of their children in school by a county medical officer, but we know that it is the ignorance of the people of the diseases of their children that was responsible for a great many of the untimely deaths we had.  I would urge upon the Minister to set into operation immediately the provisions of the 1925 Act, under which, if necessary, he can mandamus the county council and make them appoint this county medical officer.</P>
    <P>A thing has happened in Wexford which I am certain would not have happened if a county medical officer <Col N="1212" /> had been appointed.  The town of Wexford has a population of 12,000, and within the last eighteen months the county board of health have taken away the fever hospital from the town.  I feel certain that if there were a county medical officer of health there he would not have consented to that.  Here we have a population of 12,000, and the County Fever Hospital has been transferred to New Ross, simply because the county board of health would not expend the sum of £1,000 to keep it in order.  New Ross is twenty-three miles from the town of Wexford.  It is almost in the extreme North East of the county.  South of Wexford town to Carnsore Point, there is another twelve or thirteen miles, and we can imagine what a fever patient will go through if he or she has to be brought from Carnsore Point to New Ross, a distance of thirtyfive miles.  I think the Minister will agree with me that his Department should never have permitted the county board of health to make that transfer.  Personally, I believe that so far as fever is concerned, there ought to be a hospital in each of the four towns in the County Wexford.  I do not need to have any medical knowledge to know that fever always carries a high temperature, and that a person who has to be brought the distance required in the present conditions in Wexford undergoes a great danger.  I do hope that the Minister will attend to this matter, and also that he will see to it that a county medical officer for Wexford is appointed at once.</P>
    <P>Another matter that is engaging the attention of urban areas at the moment is the question of putting into operation by-laws in so far as slaughter-houses and the sale of meat are concerned.  Both of these are very important matters, but to attend to them properly it is necessary. in my opinion, to have a fulltime officer.  To many of the small towns that would certainly mean an expenditure for which I am afraid they are not prepared at the moment.  I am not saying that it should not be done; as a matter of <Col N="1213" /> fact, I have said already that I am very much in favour of it, and in my own town of Wexford we are at the moment preparing by-laws to put into operation.  But I suggest that to do it properly there must be a whole-time officer.  If you are to have a veterinary surgeon as a whole-time officer, he must have a decent salary, and as the rural population purchase meat in the towns where such officers would be operating, I think it would be only fair that the Minister should take powers to himself as soon as possible to make county councils or county boards of health pay some contribution towards the maintenance of these officers in urban areas.  I obtained figures of the amount of meat that is purchased in Wexford by people living outside the town, and I found that this represents forty-two per cent.  Surely, if an urban area takes steps to prevent bad meat being sold, and if forty-two per cent. of the meat is purchased by the rural population, the county health boards or the county councils ought to be made to pay some contribution towards the maintenance of the officers who would carry out this work, and I do hope that the Minister will go seriously into this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the poor rate and to the improvement in its collection.  Certainly the position, so far as poor rate collectors is concerned, has improved within the last couple of years, but to my mind there is too much overlapping in regard to the poor rate.  Take the position of an urban area.  The county council makes a demand on the urban area, which has to appoint a collector to collect the rates for the county council.  What I think ought to be done&mdash;and I would seriously recommend the Minister to consider it and to carry it into operation&mdash; would be that the county council should collect its own rates in the urban areas&mdash;perhaps not in the boroughs, where they have a different proposition&mdash;as well as in the county council area.  From time to time there is friction, though not <Col N="1214" /> perhaps serious friction, between urban authorities and county councils with regard to the poor rate collection. There are administrative charges and various things in connection with the collection as far as an urban area is concerned which would be dispensed with if the collection were made direct by the county council, and I seriously suggest to the Minister that he should consider that.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also suggested that in the near future the county surveyor ought to be appointed as a county engineer, as he described it. Whilst that might be all right with regard to small places that would be under the control of town commissioners, who would be unable to appoint their own surveyors, I doubt very much if it would be practicable where large or fairly large urban centres were concerned.  I believe you would have a conflict between the borough surveyor and the county surveyor, because while a county surveyor might have certain theories so far as carrying out work in an urban area is concerned, in my opinion he must also have the practice, because when a man is working in a rural area for some time he acquires a certain outlook which is altogether different from that which he would acquire in his application to town affairs, and I do not agree with the Minister that it would be judicious to do this indiscriminately. There is certainly something in the Minister's point.  Another thing is that the county surveyor would be entirely under the control of the county council, and I would not like to see a county council controlling an officer who would be called upon to apply himself to sewerage, waterworks, and things of that kind in a town, because I do not believe we would get the best results.</P>
    <P>I have in my mind the position which prevails to-day with regard to the upkeep of main roads in boroughs, and I know from experience that trunk roads in urban areas are not getting from the county council the attention that they should get.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1215" /> What happens when an estimate is submitted at the beginning of the financial year by the county surveyor? They examine the position so far as the main roads in urban areas are concerned&mdash;I am speaking now for County Wexford&mdash;the county surveyor puts down a certain amount for urban roads, and someone from a rural area, who is a mad economist, without having any regard for efficiency, proposes that the estimate be reduced by 20 per cent., and even by 40 or 50 per cent.  That is done indiscriminately, without having any regard whatever to the amount of money required in the urban area.  With all respect, I submit that you must have better roads in the towns than in the rural areas. There is the question of footpaths and channel ways on the main roads to be considered and to which the county councils pay no regard.  Having that in mind, I am prompted to condemn the system, which the Minister suggests he is going to bring into operation in the near future, so far as the county surveyor or county engineer is concerned.  Before that is done I believe there should be a consultation with the various urban authorities.</P>

      <P>I quite see that there could be at any time an extension to urban areas where the urban council was satisfied, but my proposal at present is simply to bring in the county engineering services of the county councils and the board of health.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope he will leave it there.  The Minister dealt with the roads, and told us how the amount of money available this year was spent, and the system by which the <Col N="1216" /> road grants are advanced to the county councils.  As far as maintenance is concerned, the amount given by the Department is fairly liberal, but there is one aspect of the situation which has been discussed by Wexford County Council, and that is where, if a county council decides that a road should be reconstructed, they lose any grant for maintenance or anything else.  We have asked time and time again when we were about to reconstruct a road that we should be permitted to take the maintenance grant into consideration.  After all, if the road was not reconstructed the maintenance grant would be paid.  If a county council has sufficient foresight to procure money to reconstruct a road, I think, at least, the Minister should permit the maintenance grant to be taken into account. That is only reasonable.  Say that a county council decides to go to a bank to procure £4,000, £5,000 or £6,000 to reconstruct a road, I do not think it is unreasonable to ask that the Minister should permit that the maintenance grant which is not required for the road, should be taken into consideration, for interest charges and things of that kind.  In some cases this is only preventing county councils from borrowing considerable sums of money to reconstruct roads, and I would ask the Minister to consider that aspect of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter that I would like the Minister to go into, as I do not know what is the exact position at present.  I refer to the application of the public health laws to places of entertainment.  I know that urban authorities have power to deal with theatres and cinemas, but recently we have had travelling shows in tents.  I have one particular case in mind where one of these shows stays in town for four or five weeks.  As far as we have been able to find out the public health authorities have no power, or very little, to go into and to examine that place.  I would like the Minister to go into the matter, and to find out what are the powers of the local <Col N="1217" /> authorities in the matter.  I think they should have a great deal more power than they have at present. It also strikes me as being very unfair to shopkeepers and people in urban areas to permit owners of shows to come into a field in a town, and to keep their entertainment there, as I have known them to do, for a month or six weeks, and to pay no rates whatever.  The valuation of the field is very low.</P>
    <P>It is unfair to shopkeepers and to others who have to make a livelihood in the town, even to the ordinary householders, and to proprietors of theatres, who give a good deal of employment, that these travelling shows should be permitted to come into a town, from the other side of the Channel, and to stay there, as they have done on many occasions, for five or six weeks, without making any contribution to the rates.  I believe the Minister should look into the matter, to ascertain if there is any way by which some rates could be levied on such people, as they absolutely fleece the public.  As a matter of fact, I go so far as to say that the public authorities should be in a position to say to such people: &ldquo;You can stay for a week or a fortnight, but you will not be permitted to stay any longer.&rdquo;  Certain people on the road have a sort of prize scheme for which they sell tickets, and I know one town where they took £3,000.  That is a very serious matter for shopkeepers and others, and I would ask the Minister to look into the matter.  It is a problem that should be tackled, as I believe local authorities should be permitted to levy rates on these shows, in the interests of the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>A circus only stays a night in a town, but I have in mind a certain touring company&mdash;I dare say other people know it&mdash;which comes to a town and stays for five or six weeks in a field, the valuation of which is only about £2.  Of course. <Col N="1218" /> the owner of the field pays rates, but I think local authorities should have power to levy rates on the owner of a show who takes a couple of thousand pounds out of the town in a few weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to this Estimate, the total of which amounts to close on half a million pounds, I note that as regards several items in it increases are proposed this year. Instead of complaining about these increases, I would like to say that, generally speaking, we approve of them, for they are in relation to matters that we think are of particular concern to the health and general welfare of the people of the State. As the Minister has stated, there is an increase of £32,750 for the treatment of tuberculosis.  Anybody who knows the condition of the country and has studied the widespread nature of tuberculosis here, would <Col N="1219" /> not, I think, find fault with that increase. It is probably as large an increase in one year as might be justified, but the widespread nature of the disease is such that, within reason, any amount spent by the Ministry and by local authorities to eradicate the disease would certainly have our approval.  We might make similar remarks with regard to the increased amount set down for child welfare.  Personally, I would go so far as to say that, if possible, a greater effort ought to be made to get more money for that purpose and to induce local authorities to take up that subject and develop it more rapidly than they are doing.  The same remarks also apply to the increase proposed for medical treatment of school children.</P>
      <P>On previous occasions, when this Vote and similar matters were being discussed here, I and others on these benches have said that we were of opinion that the condition of the education of the people&mdash;and in many cases also I think it might be said of public representatives and members of local authorities&mdash;on this question of public health was very backward.  A good deal requires to be done in the way of advancing the education of the people on public health matters and as to the necessity for improving public amenities throughout the country in the smaller towns and villages in particular. We are not at all as advanced in these matters, in practice or in education, as we ought to be.  The more the matter is discussed here&mdash; the more publicity it gets in the Press and the more it is brought to the attention of the local authorities &mdash;the greater the advance that will be made.  For these reasons, I am glad that there is an increase under these particular headings.  With regard to some of them, at any rate, I would not, and our Party would not, in general complain if the increases were even greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking the total figure of the Vote, I note that there has been an increase in the number of staff by four persons, with accordingly an increase <Col N="1220" /> in salaries&mdash;not very great&mdash; of roughly in or about £500.  I do not think that my friends on these benches would complain in general about an increase in staff if they were satisfied that we were getting increased efficiency and increased work.  Perhaps the Minister would be able to enlighten us as to the necessity for that increase in staff and the increase in expenditure in accordance therewith.  Without some explanation, I do not think that anything we can see happening in the country with regard to the administration of this Department warrants the increase.  However, I speak subject to further information being forthcoming, but it is, I think, the opinion of many that this particular staff, with the process of reduction that has been in operation for a number of years, might carry on a little further before any occasion would arise for an increase.</P>
    <P>There is one subject and a very important subject closely related to the question of public health with which this Department has to deal, and to which I would like to refer.  It is the question of housing to which Deputy Corish has already referred.  We are not at all satisfied that all that could be done by the Ministry of Local Government to improve housing conditions in urban and rural areas through the country is being done.  The Minister may say that grants are not available, and that if he could get enough money from the Department of Finance his Department would be very glad to administer it for improving housing conditions in the country.  We have said here before, and we will repeat it as long as we think it is necessary to do so, that this matter of carrying out improvements in housing is urgent.  It is not being dealt with in a manner that we believe is proper considering the nature of what I may call the disease.  Speaking for my own constituency, I can say that there has not been any attempt made to tackle the problem in Dublin, and particularly in North Dublin. Money has not been made available <Col N="1221" /> to tackle the problem in the big manner in which it ought to be tackled.  Not alone are the housing conditions bad, but they are very bad, and the effects on public health, so far as infantile mortality is concerned, are atrocious.</P>
    <P>I have quoted here before the words of Dr. Russell, Medical Officer of Health for Dublin, who certainly speaks with knowledge, and considering his position we must assume that he speaks with authority and a sense of responsibility.  In a speech which he recently made in one of the city hospitals&mdash;I think it was opposite the doors of Merrion Street itself&mdash;he said that the housing conditions in Dublin had disimproved, and that there were in the city cellar dwellings occupied by families that were condemned as long ago as in the lifetime of his predecessor, the late Sir Charles Cameron.  That ought not to be so, and though the Ministry may say that they are not entirely responsible for the City of Dublin, and that is so, they have a very great responsibility, particularly in view of the fact that they added to it by taking from the citizens direct responsibility and putting in their own official nominees to run the city. Officers of their own Department are responsible, and, therefore, the Ministry are responsible in my judgment for the abominable condition of housing in Dublin, and the shockingly high rate of infantile mortality in the city.  It is a matter that cannot be too frequently spoken about and too often stressed, until a remedy is found.  I do not know what the policy of the Department with regard to housing in general is, and I would like to know what it is.</P>
    <P>We know that a number&mdash;a considerable number if you like&mdash;of houses have been built under the various Housing Acts that have been passed here during the last seven or eight years.  I think the Minister told us that 17,115 houses have been built. I take it these figures are correct.  If it is the policy of the Department to build in seven or eight years 17,000 houses, I say that discloses a mentality <Col N="1222" /> that does not realise the condition of housing in this country, the backward nature of it, and the urgency of the problem.  If you build at the rate of 5,000 houses a year, you would not, in my opinion, be doing enough.  That may be thought a rather extreme statement.  I know that the money question enters largely into this, and I know the Minister told us here in discussing housing that the question of the cost of building enters largely into this matter.  The cost of building could be largely reduced if the question of housing were tackled as it ought to be.  Even if the suggestion made by Deputy Corish to-night with regard to slates were adopted, it would be an advantage.  The combined purchasing department has been very much criticised, but, in my opinion, it is a necessary and useful department, and if that department inquired into the number of houses local authorities throughout the Free State area intended to build in any one year and endeavoured to get the slate quarries to contract for the supply of slates for these houses, in that one item alone I imagine a considerable reduction could be made. What could be done in that direction I believe could be done in many other directions also.  On several occasions here we have urged the setting up of one authority to deal with the question of housing.  I will not go into that now, but I believe if there were such an authority and the question of builders' supplies were taken up, the present cost, and in some instances high cost, of house building in the Free State could be materially reduced, and, therefore, more houses could be built and let at lower rents than have to be charged at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister, as we know, has had a survey made among, I presume, all the urban authorities of the Free State with regard to the question of housing.  I do not know whether that census is completed or not yet. I hope it is.  It certainly is useful work.  The Minister told us, according to the estimate given to him, that the number of houses required in the urban areas is 43,000.  I wonder <Col N="1223" /> would I be thought to be extreme in suggesting that a similar number would be necessary for the rural areas, including the small villages and towns.  The Minister or his officials considered that an over-estimate of the number of houses required, and he suggested that 30,000 would probably be nearer the number necessary for urban areas.  We will take it that probably another 30,000 would be necessary for rural areas.  That means 60,000 houses would be necessary, but at the present rate of progress it would take twenty-four years to get these 60,000 houses built, without taking into account whatever increased demand there might be if there were an increase of population in the meantime, and without taking into consideration the number of houses that would fall into decay.  I do not know if the Minister is satisfied himself with the rate of progress.  If 30,000 houses are, as his officials suggested, immediately necessary for urban areas and 30,000 for rural areas, and that is a moderate estimate, I wonder is the Minister satisfied that it would be at least twentyfive years at the present rate of progress before these houses could be built?</P>
    <P>I do not think, if that be the policy of the Department, that it can be called satisfactory.  In the meantime, one can imagine the condition of the slums in Dublin City, and one can imagine the death rate in the city.  The Minister told us this evening that there had been an improvement in the matter of infantile mortality.  That is very satisfactory, and I hope the improvement will continue.  There will be no rapid progress in the right direction unless a more satisfactory housing policy can be introduced and developed by the Local Government Department.</P>
    <P>[<i>An Ceann Comhairle took the Chair.</i>]</P>
    <P>It was satisfactory to hear that numbers of local authorities had developed a desire for the medical inspection of schools and school <Col N="1224" /> children, and we were told that the number of authorities taking an interest in child welfare is increasing. In that connection I am sure that everybody who takes an interest in the subject was glad to see the Press announcement some time ago, and was glad to hear the reference made to-night by the Minister, to the effect that there will be a Public Health Conference held in Dublin in July.  That is a development in the right direction: it is something that was for a long time necessary.  I hope the Conference will be a success, and that there will be in attendance many public men from all over the Free State.  I hope that the people will be encouraged to take an increased interest in public health matters.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister promised a Bill which, he said, would bring about a codification of the poor law. That Bill has not yet made its appearance. Perhaps the Minister, when he is concluding the debate, will tell us what progress has been made, and if and when the Bill will be introduced.  Similarly, a Bill dealing with pure milk was promised. I hope these two Bills will be introduced in the near future. There are one or two matters in relation to public health to which I would like to refer.  In the report of the Department for 1927-28, published a couple of months ago, there are figures given on page 33 relating to the number of cases of infectious disease.  It seems to me that in regard to some of these diseases the figures are very high.  In relation to diphtheria and scarlatina the figures are, perhaps, unduly high in comparison with other years.  I would like to know in what number of cases is the disease fatal.  The report does not indicate the percentage of fatal cases arising out of infectious disease.  I notice on the next page of the same report a disease that ought not to be common in this country.  I refer to enteric fever which appears to have been fairly widespread in certain parts of this country.  These are matters that bear out what we say with regard to the question of public health and <Col N="1225" /> the necessity for education in matters relating to public health.  The number of cases of infectious disease, such as enteric fever, diphtheria, and scarlatina is too high.  There are too many cases of disease in this small, thinly-populated country.  If our knowledge in public health matters were improved I believe that such diseases would be rare&mdash;some of them, at any rate.  A disease like enteric fever ought to be rare in the Free State.  I move that progress be reported.</P>

      <P>Statistics for income tax purposes are not extracted in sufficient detail to enable the information required in the question to be compiled.  The particulars could not be obtained without considerable expense and without diverting the revenue staff from the main work of the assessment and collection of tax. The Deputy's attention is directed to Table 78 of the Fifth Annual Report of the Revenue Commissioners for the year ended 31st March, 1928, and to the corresponding tables in the earlier Reports, which contain the statistical information readily available in regard to assessments, allowances, etc.</P>
