      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if the Irish Free State share of the balance at 31st March, 1922, of the Road Fund of the late United Kingdom has yet been finally determined; and, if not, to state the reason for the delay; and, further, to state the amount received to date by the Free State Treasury under this head, and if any additional payments are anticipated in the present financial year.</P>

      <P>The Saorstát share of the balance at 31st March, 1922, of the Road Fund of the late United Kingdom has not yet been finally determined.  The delay in arriving at a determination of the Saorstát share has been due to the fact that resort has had to be had to arbitration, prolonged negotiations with the British authorities for an agreed settlement having broken down.  The sum of £200,000 has already been received on account of the Saorstát share, but no additional payments are anticipated in the current financial year.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is prepared before taking any further action under Circular 9/30, dated 28/2/30&mdash;Promotion of Writing Assistants to the Clerical Grade&mdash;to obtain the views <Col N="2026" /> of the Civil Service Representative Council thereon, in view of the important questions of principle raised by its terms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Civil Service Representative Council have already had the subject of promotion of writing assistants to the clerical grade under consideration more than once and have acquainted me with their views.

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance (a) whether it is intended that the &ldquo;six years' service&rdquo; qualification for eligibility for promotion of writing assistants will in future apply to all writing assistants; (b) whether the Minister has given any consideration to the special case of male writing assistants, a small number of officers who are serving in a grade which is proper to women, and whether he will be prepared to consider the advisability of transferring them to another grade or to grant automatic eligibility for promotion to them to the clerical grade on completion of five years' service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  The male writing assistants to whom the Deputy refers entered the grade as a result of an open competitive examination held in April, 1926, before the passing of the Civil Service Regulation Act of that year, which conferred authority on the Civil Service Commissioners to confine examinations to persons of a particular sex.  They are not entitled to better treatment in the <Col N="2027" /> matter of promotion than are the other candidates who succeeded in the same competition under the same conditions, and I am unable to undertake that they should be exceptionally treated in advance of the consideration of their cases individually, in the ordinary way, upon completion of the prescribed period of six years' satisfactory service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that the case is exceptional. A number of these male writing assistants were at first recruited through open competitive examination; the examination was then open to males and females, but, subsequently, it was open to females only. In view of that fact, would the Minister agree that it is only equitable and right that those young men who entered the service as writing assistants should now get the promotion to which they are entitled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think they are entitled to any exceptional treatment.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state what amounts have been withheld from the Longford County Council out of the Agricultural Grant for each year since this has been the case, and when these sums will be paid to the Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer the Deputy's two questions together In the case of Longford County Council, a sum of £4,320 6s. 10d. Estate Duty Grant was, in 1925, absorbed in the Guarantee Fund in respect of charges against the Fund for arrears of Land Purchase Annuities, etc., covering the years from 1922 to 1925, inclusive.  Of that amount, a sum of £2,269 10s. 5d. has since been paid to the Council.  In the following years Guarantee Fund charges absorbed the following amounts:&mdash; 1926, £977 18s. 8d.; 1927, £279 2s. 0d.; 1928, £1,051 18s. 11d.; 1929. £844 8s. 5d.  The total amount of Estate Duty Grant absorbed in the <Col N="2030" /> Guarantee Fund since 1922 is, therefore, £5,204 4s. 5d.</P>
      <P>As regards Agricultural Grant, a sum of £442 17s. 7d. was deducted in April, 1926, from Longford County Council's share of that Grant, as their share of the Estate Duty Grant was not sufficient to meet Guarantee Fund charges in respect of arrears of Land Purchase Annuities, etc.  The amount was, however, paid in 1927. For the same reason, a sum of £1,855 1s. 9d. was deducted in 1928, but this amount has since been paid with the exception of a sum of £241 12s. 7d., which will be paid to the Council at the end of the present month.</P>
      <P>Any sums outstanding in respect of Estate Duty Grant or Agricultural Grant, which have been absorbed in the Guarantee Fund to meet the charges imposed by law upon that Fund, will be paid to Longford County Council according as the arrears of Land Purchase Annuities, etc., in the county are paid off.</P>

      <P>Inspectors of my Department having several times drawn attention to the unsatisfactory condition of the county home at Leix, and following representations made by my Department to the Board of Health, plans were submitted for improvements at an estimated cost of £17,000.  On consideration of these plans, and after a full discussion between myself and a deputation from the Board of Health, it became evident that the building of a new home, besides being more generally suitable, would also be ultimately more economical.  Previous experience in the conversion of workhouse buildings has always shown that further expensive repairs and renewals become necessary.  The cost of maintenance for the last three years has averaged £432.  It is estimated that a new home would cost £30,000, in respect of which the annual repayment would commence with 2.55d. in the £, diminishing each year.  I am prepared to sanction a loan for this amount on a basis of thirty years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Eireann approves of the Report of the Conference on the operation of Dominion Legislation and Merchant Shipping Legislation, and recommends the Executive Council to take such steps as they may think fit to give effect thereto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion refers to a Report which has been on the Table of the House since about the first week in February, a Report which I should characterise, right at the start, as the most comprehensive constitutional document that Dáil Eireann has had to discuss since the Treaty was itself discussed.  I would rather have had to debate this in other circumstances when I could have dealt more adequately with this resolution, regarding it from the point of <Col N="2051" /> view of the magnitude of the matters with which it deals and the momentous nature of the recommendations brought forward for discussion. I am going to ask the House to found their decision upon this resolution on the recommendations that are contained in that Report itself.  I do that, feeling a vast confidence about the Report, a confidence that is bred in me from my own knowledge of the particular problems that had to be discussed at the 1929 Conference, basing myself, for confidence sake also, upon the method with which the Press generally received the publication of the Report of that Conference as well as upon the silence with which a certain part of the Press greeted it, the fumbling attempts that have been made by another part of the Press to belittle the Report and the recommendations, and the attempts made elsewhere to find imaginative terrors, not sustained or sustainable by any real reason, in the Report, to induce people to go against it.  I claim at the beginning that this is the clearest constitutional record that has ever proceeded from any Conference of the States that are associated together in the Commonwealth of Nations, and that it reveals, better than any report hitherto has revealed, the international status and the destiny of the States that comprise the Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>I use the word &ldquo;reveal&rdquo; as I did when I spoke in this House in June, forecasting what was to come before the Conference and forecasting, as well as I could, the results I expected from it, because, as I then said, although the States that comprise the Commonwealth had to the knowledge of most people become full international units yet the easy processes and gradual changes by which that position was achieved were of a type that rather hid the development than emphasised it and were such as to lead uncritical observers to wrong conclusions as to the particular position that had been reached.  That cannot be said of <Col N="2052" /> this Report.  A slight reference to the historical antccedents both of this State, as it at present stands, and of the older Dominions of the Commonwealth of Nations is necessary. I do not think there is called for at this point any lengthy investigation into the steps by which the older Dominions of the Commonwealth reached a particular stage, but I think one or two sentences will be useful now just in order to get people's minds focussed on the stage of the world's history that had been reached when the Treaty of 1921 was signed.</P>
    <P>A big number of new States had come into being.  They were, in the main, torn from older States and, however unequal they might be in power and resources they were certainly equal, one with another, in the possession of full international status.  Most of these new States had been established by Treaties and into that international situation the Irish Free State came, established also by an international pact which resulted in the recognition of this State as a full international entity.  I have on other occasions adverted to the obligations and the rights that we assumed and that we demanded arising from that international position, and it is no part of my duty here to-night to refer to these.  On other occasions upon which these matters have been discussed I gave my own view, backing it with evidence as to the part, the persistent, active and honourable part, we had played in international affairs since the establishment of the State.  The only thing that falls for consideration in discussing this Report is the relationship that has been definitely established between the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.</P>
    <P>Before going on to discuss the separate parts of the Report, I propose to read again, to refresh Deputies' minds, the terms of reference upon which the Conference was called together.  I want further to point out that the method that was adopted is a method that has come to be adopted ordinarily with regard <Col N="2053" /> to any matter of international importance. The International Labour Office, dealing with matters of much less importance, has adopted the same technique, whereby matters are brought forward for deliberation for one year, the terms of reference are, to a certain extent, established, and then the debate and the decision upon these matters are postponed for a year or two, so that a better knowledge of the full implications of what is being brought forward can be understood, and so that people can come to the final debate with their minds fully informed and their particular point of view made clear before they come to a decision.  In 1926 certain principles were enunciated for the first time.  It was realised in 1926, and stated in the 1926 Report, that by reason only of the limited time at our disposal, it was impossible to relate these principles to facts and to get the facts to square with the principles where, in fact, they were at that time found not to be in agreement.  The 1929 Conference was to take place over three years after the establishment of the principles, so that the detailed matters referred to in the terms of reference might be considered by the Governments that were going to be called together and so that there would be a chance of agreement in the fullest detail on the matters left over, as established in principle but not in detail in 1926. That was the origin of the 1929 Conference. I spoke in this House in June of 1929, and, referring to the task that was before the Conference of last autumn, I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the year 1926 the principles underlying the status of each of the members of the Association of States to which we belong were formulated and declared to the world.  The declarations then made did not proclaim a constitutional system suddenly established, but rather collected, co-ordinated and consolidated a body of constitutional principles theretofore gradually accepted, but then for the first time authoritatively interpreted and formally <Col N="2054" /> acknowledged.  Thereafter, the principles then formulated were to be universally recognised as the governing factors in the relationships of the member-States of the Commonwealth to each other, and the relationships of each member-State to the Commonwealth as a whole.  It was made manifest to the world that the new definition of status then declared postulated far-reaching readjustments in the external relations of the member-States with international society at large.  Our contribution to the formulation of these constitutional doctrines was positive, persistent, and decisive.  The vigilance and diligence which have been exercised in applying them to our routine relations with other States within and without the Commonwealth, in removing anomalous legal forms, in securing the discontinuance of practices that have no place in modern democratic life, and no justification in present constitutional theory, and generally in conforming every aspect of the Commonwealth scheme to the principles on which it rests has been, and must continue to be, the special work of the Department of External Affairs.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the autumn of the present year a Committee of Experts from every State in the Commonwealth will meet to discuss the formal amendment or modification, or repeal of enactments still on the Statute Book of the United Kingdom which are inconsistent with the existing legislative powers of the member-State Parliaments. Our purpose is that whatever remnants there may be of the old order of Imperial control will be removed and the last legal vestiges of the organisation swept away. The entire legal framework in which the old system of central rule was held together will be taken asunder and will never be put together again.  A new legal structure will take its place, in which no bar or barrier to future constitutional development will be found.  The free co-operation <Col N="2055" /> which is the basis of the Commonwealth idea, the instrument of its usefulness and the expression of the individual sovereignty of its members will be clothed in forms which reveal rather than conceal its reality.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want Deputies to examine the Report in the light of those phrases, enveloped, as those phrases are, by the terms of reference before the 1929 Conference and pass judgment after that consideration on the Report; to say whether or not the task that I then set for myself has been properly carried out, whether, in fact, the old legal structure has been changed, whether whatever remnants there may have been of the old order of Imperial control have been removed and the last legal vestige of the organisation now superseded have been swept away&mdash; whether, in fine, the entire legal framework of the old system of central rule has been taken asunder.</P>
    <P>I say those phrases are bounded by the terms of reference, for there may be anomalies still existing that were not referred to the 1929 Conference, and which could not be discussed at that Conference as not forming part of our terms of reference. Here is what was set before us on page 8 of the Report:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To inquire into, report upon, and make recommendations concerning&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(i)  Existing statutory provisions requiring reservation of Dominion legislation for the assent of his Majesty or authorising the disallowance of such legislation.</P>
    <P>(ii)  (a)  The present position as to the competence of Dominion Parliaments to give their legislation extra-territorial operation.</P>
    <P>(b)  The practicability and most convenient method of giving effect to the principle that each Dominion Parliament should have power to give extra-territorial operation to its legislation in all cases where <Col N="2056" /> such operation is ancillary to provision for the peace, order, and good government of the Dominion.</P>
    <P>(iii)  The principles embodied in or underlying the Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1865, and the extent to which any provisions of that Act ought to be repealed, amended or modified in the light of the existing relations between the various members of the British Commonwealth of Nations as described in this Report&rdquo; (i.e., the Report of the Imperial Conference).</P>
    <P>A fourth term was added to the latter part of the 1926 Conference Report, referred to at the bottom of page 9 of this Report:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To consider and report on the principles which should govern in the general interest, the practice and legislation relating to merchant shipping in the various parts of the Empire, having regard to the change in constitutional status and general relations which has occurred since existing laws were enacted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Before going on to discuss the separate chapter-headings of this Report, four of which deal with the four items that were referred to the Conference, I want to say this about the Report in general: There were present in London at the Conference of last year six States of the Commonwealth of Nations. Of those six it may be said generally that no two agreed in points of detail.  All did agree in their view of the constitutional status that had been achieved, but there was great disagreement as to the use that should be made of the particular position that all believed had been achieved.  There were differences arising from history; there were differences arising from the constitutions of the different States; there were differences even arising from the relations, close or less close, which the different States wished to have with one another, and we had to find a report and frame recommendations which <Col N="2057" /> would get the greatest possible agreement from the six peoples who were there gathered together.  The report was framed generally so as to have that agreement.  But it is for each member-State of the Commonwealth to take from the report those portions which its particular case calls for, and to frame its own legislation upon those portions, neglecting other portions that have no relation to them.  I will make clear as I go along, by reference to one or two points of detail on which there were divergences, the lines that different States of the Commonwealth will take when they come to adopt legislative means to give effect to the findings of the Conference.  That is one point. A second point that has to be remembered is this&mdash;I have already referred to it in reading the Terms of Reference&mdash;that the Conference was limited by the Terms of Reference. It by no means escaped observation that there are still anomalies, or may be still anomalies, which will require re-consideration hereafter. While I say that, I want to add that in 1926 principles were established which were to rule the relationship hereafter of the members of the Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>In 1926 certain points of detail were segregated for special consideration, points showing conflict between the constitutional position and the old status.  Those special points, when attention had been called to them, were sent off to the 1929 Conference for modification. Other points may arise.  If other points do arise, Deputies should bear in mind that the 1926 principles have ruled right through the whole recommendations of the 1929 Conference, and if any anomalous things are hereafter discovered not in agreement with the principles enunciated in 1926, there is no doubt whatever that these anomalies, when discovered, will disappear just in the same way as the anomalies that were discussed in 1929 are now due to disappear.  The 1926 Conference was held under the presidency of one Government in Great Britain.  The 1929 Conference met under the presidency <Col N="2058" /> of a different Government and took up the points of detail referred to it by the previous Government. It took up the principles established by all the Governments of the British Commonwealth in 1926, and these principles have ruled right down to details.  Nobody who has any appreciation of what these principles were, and how absolutely the details have been ruled by them, can have any fear that if hereafter further anomalies appear they will not be ruled in exactly the same way.</P>
    <P>The third point I want to make, before going into an examination of the detailed points, is that up-to-date, as was natural, attention has been paid more to getting rid of the anomalies than to anything else, to getting what I might call our side, the Irish Free State side, the Dominion side of the Association of the British Commonwealth of Nations, made clear and distinct before everybody.  This Report, and two points in the Report in particular, shows where that Association is of great value to citizens of the Irish Free State.  It seems to me it is fitting at this time that I should call attention to these as two concrete examples of the value of the Association to us.  I would ask Deputies, in considering the Report, while bearing in mind the big constitutional changes made in the framework of the old Empire, also to bear in mind the value of the Association to ourselves. They should begin to let their minds play a little bit more liberally on the advantages to be derived from the Association and consider how these advantages might be increased by some better degree of co-operation with the different units bulked together in the British Commonwealth of Nations.</P>
    <P>This Report falls into eight parts. Four of them are really material to the discussion.  Parts I and II are introductory and are in common form Part III deals with the first question referred to the Conference.  Disallowance and Reservation.  Part IV takes up the question of the Extra-Territorial Operation of Dominion <Col N="2059" /> legislation.  Part V deals with the Colonial Laws Validity Act; Part VI with Merchant Shipping legislation and Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act Part VII with a suggested Tribunal for the determination of disputes, and Part VIII is in conclusion.</P>
    <P>I take the first point&mdash;disallowance and reservation.  We were told &ldquo;to inquire into, report upon, and make recommendations concerning existing statutory provisions requiring reservation of Dominion legislation for the assent of His Majesty or authorising disallowance of such legislation.&rdquo;  The first paragraph of Part III defines the power of disallowance as meaning &ldquo;the right of the Crown which has hitherto been exercised (when occasion for its exercise has arisen) on the advice of Ministers in the United Kingdom, to annul an Act passed by a Dominion or Colonial Legislature.&rdquo;  Here we have the first example of a United Kingdom right, a right which had its place in a scheme that has now passed away, the scheme of a central authority ruling all outside associations or dependencies.  It was a right that was from time to time inexorably exercised when it seemed to the Government of Great Britain and the Parliament of Great Britain that the right should be so exercised.  It was a right which, when exercised, was exercised on the advice of Ministers in the United Kingdom, and its effect was to annul an Act passed by a Dominion or Colonial Legislature. The Irish Free State Constitution contained no provision for disallowance at the date on which this State was founded as a State.  There had been even then a movement beyond the old situation that was described in the first paragraph of this section and our Constitution marked that progress by containing no provision even for disallowance.</P>
    <P>Our interest in this section is consequently somewhat academic. There was no power of disallowance as far as our laws were concerned; there was no such constitutional <Col N="2060" /> right.  But, from the point of view of general Dominion status it had its value for us. I call attention to the findings of the Conference as set out in paragraph 23:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Conference agree that the present constitutional position is that the power of disallowance can no longer be exercised in relation to Dominion legislation.  Accordingly, those Dominions who possess the power to amend their constitutions in this respect can, by following the prescribed procedure, abolish the legal power of disallowance if they so desire.  In the case of those Dominions who do not possess this power, it would be in accordance with constitutional practice that, if so requested by the Dominion concerned, the Government of the United Kingdom should ask Parliament to pass the necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>I repeat that our interest in this is academic, as there is no right of disallowance here.  Our sole interest was to see that nothing should remain, so far as we could manage it, on the Statute Book which would seem to cast doubt upon full Dominion status.</P>
    <P>Connected with disallowance in the terms of reference and in this Report is the matter of reservation. Paragraph 26 defines the position before the Conference:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Reservation means the withholding of assent by a Governor-General or Governor to a Bill duly passed by the competent legislature in order that His Majesty's pleasure may be taken thereon.</P>
    <P>Explanatory matter in the Report points out that there were two types of reservation.  Certain Constitutions require certain Acts to be reserved for the signification of the King's pleasure.  In most Constitutions, as in ours, there is a clause enabling a Bill to be reserved.  We had an interest in this, but it, too, was somewhat academic, because no matter what remained in Statute Books or was enshrined in Constitutions reservation is a thing of the past.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2061" /> In paragraph 35 the Conference comes to this finding:&mdash;</P>
    <P>As regards the continued existence of the power of reservation, certain Dominions possess the power by amending their Constitutions to abolish the discretionary power and to repeal any provisions requiring reservation of Bills dealing with particular subjects, and it is, therefore, open to those Dominions to take the prescribed steps to that end if they so desire.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 36 follows, referring to the Canadian and Australian position. This is the first of the points to which I promised to call attention. I have said that this Report had to be so framed as to cover a number of States which differed in a number of ways&mdash;in this case in constitutional frame-work.  There were unitary and federal States; there were States which had certain control over their Constitutions, and States with a much more limited control over their Constitutions, and recommendations had to be framed to cover all of them.  Paragraph 35 is, as far as reservation is concerned, the one with which we are concerned, and the result is that it is open to us to take the prescribed steps to the end of abolishing this power if they so desire.</P>
    <P>In the parts of the Report dealing with reservation the history of this Governmental power is briefly given. It is pointed out that reservation used to be a matter for the Governor-General or Governor in relation to Bills which had been duly passed by the competent authority. In the consideration of this question there had to be borne in mind the 1926 statement of the position of the Governor-General in any Dominion. The Governor-General occupies in relation to any Dominion the exact position that the King occupies in relation to the United Kingdom, and is controlled in any duty that he carries out exactly as the King is controlled in relation to the United Kingdom.  The King in all matters affecting United Kingdom affairs acts on the advice of British <Col N="2062" /> Ministers.  The Governor-General in any Dominion acts only on the advice of the Ministers of the Government of that State.  Consequently, once the position of the Governor-General had been declared in that way, it was clear that reservation, if it was to be continued as a means of still holding central authority over the Dominion, had to be exercised through some other channel or else had to disappear.  The Conference in 1929 had no difficulty in making up its mind as to the steps to be taken.  The recommendation I have read and it is conclusive. All these recommendations have to be approved, but if approval is given, this State, as far as reservation is concerned, has the power to abolish it by amending the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Report deals with the extra-territorial operations of Dominion legislation, and here in particular the authority of the Dominions is elevated to the highest and fullest point.  We were asked in regard to this to report upon&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  The present position as to the competence of Dominion Parliaments to give their legislation extra-territorial operation.</P>
    <P>(2)  The practicability and most convenient method of giving effect to the principle that each Dominion Parliament should have power to give extra-territorial operation to its legislation in all cases where such operation is ancillary to provision for the peace, order and good government of the Dominion.</P>
    <P>The recommendations from paragraph 40 to the end of the section set out the new position quite clearly:&mdash;</P>
    <P>We are agreed that the most suitable method of placing the matter beyond possibility of doubt would be by means of a declaratory enactment in the terms set out below, passed, with the consent of all the Dominions, by the Parliament of the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2063" /> With regard to the extent of the power so to be declared, we are of opinion that the recognition of the powers of a Dominion to legislation with extra-territorial effect should not be limited either by reference to any particular class of persons (e.g., the citizens of the Dominion) or by any reference to laws &ldquo;ancillary to provision for the peace, order, and good government of the Dominion&rdquo; (which is the phrase appearing in the terms of reference to the Conference).</P>
    <P>We regard the first limitation as undesirable in principle.  With respect to the second, we think that the introduction of a reference to legislation ancillary to peace, order, and good government is unnecessary, would add to the existing confusion on the matter, and might diminish the scope of the powers the existence of which it is desired to recognise.</P>
    <P>They recommend a declaratory clause&mdash;I emphasise that phrase:&mdash;</P>
    <P>It is hereby declared and enacted that the Parliament of a Dominion has full power to make laws having extra-territorial operation.</P>
    <P>On paragraph 43 the query may be put why did we recommend that either a declaration or an enactment should be passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom.  If there is any doubt on that point it can be easily explained.  For our own purposes we would only require to pass in this Parliament legislation of a positive type.  But in order to avoid conflict of laws, certain of the Dominions desire that the British Parliament which previously had in relation to these Dominions when Colonies a restrictive power should make it clear that that restriction was being taken away.  The report having to be framed to meet the wishes of all concerned, although except for the declaratory part of it we were not concerned, we agreed to the recommendation that the clause in the terms set out in paragraph 43 should be passed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2064" /> Part V is the critical portion of the report.  It deals with the Colonial Laws Validity Act.  It recites the history of that enactment, the circumstances under which it came to be passed and its effect, and summarises in Paragraph 49 as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The restrictions in the past served a useful purpose in securing uniformity of law and co-operation on various matters of importance: but it follows from the Report of the Imperial Conference of 1926 that this method of securing uniformity based as it was upon the supremacy of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, is no longer constitutionally appropriate in the case of the Dominions, and the next step is to bring the legal position into accord with the constitutional.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The recommendation in paragraph 50 is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have, therefore, proceeded on the basis that effect can only be given to the principles laid down in the Report of 1926 by repealing the Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1865, in its application to laws made by the Parliament of a Dominion, and the discussions at the Conference were mainly concerned with the manner in which this should be done.  Our recommendation is that legislation be enacted declaring in terms that the Act should no longer apply to the laws passed by any Dominion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is carried further in paragraph 53:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We recommend that effect be given to the proposals in the foregoing paragraphs by means of clauses in the following form:</P>
    <P>(1)  The Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1865, shall cease to apply to any law made by the Parliament of a Dominion.</P>
    <P>(2)  No law and no provision of any law hereafter made by the Parliament of a Dominion shall be void or inoperative on <Col N="2065" /> the ground that it is repugnant to the law of England or to the provisions of any existing or future Act of Parliament or to any order, rule or regulation made thereunder, and the powers of the Parliament of a Dominion shall include the power to repeal or amend any such Act, order, rule or regulation in so far as the same is part of the law of the Dominion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Conference also adverted to the difficulty that is set out in paragraph 54 and indicates the solution:</P>
    <P>With regard, lastly, to the problem which arises from the existence of a legal power in the Parliament of the United Kingdom to legislate for the Dominions, we consider that the appropriate method of reconciling the existence of this power with the established constitutional position is to place on record a statement embodying the conventional usage. We therefore recommend that a statement in the following terms should be placed on record in the proceedings of the next Imperial Conference:&mdash;</P>
    <P>It would be in accord with the established constitutional position of all members of the Commonwealth in relation to one another that no law hereafter made by the Parliament of the United Kingdom shall extend to any Dominion otherwise than at the request and with the consent of that Dominion.</P>
    <P>We further recommend that this Constitutional Convention itself should appear as a formal recital or preamble in the proposed Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 55 is somewhat similar, and in it again there appear the differences in position of those members who were associated with this Conference, differences that arose in this case from constitutional development.  The end of this clause is that no law hereafter made by the Parliament of the United Kingdom shall extend to any Dominion otherwise <Col N="2066" /> than at the request and with the consent of that Dominion.  Certain Dominions believe that, from their point of view, there is value in reposing in the British Parliament the power to pass laws for them at their request and with their consent.</P>
    <P>We do not believe that that is right.  We believe that it will always be impossible for us, and we know it is unconstitutional at the moment in relation to this State.  That paragraph, relating generally to the Dominions, must, in its relation to the Irish Free State, be read in conjunction with Article XII of our Constitution.  That Article enacts that the sole and exclusive power of making laws for the Irish Free State is vested in the Oireachtas.  It follows that the last two lines of the declaration of paragraph 55 have no application to this State; at least they cannot have any application to this State as long as Article XII remains as it is.  It would be quite impossible, as matters now are, that this State should request or consent to the British Parliament passing laws that would hereafter bind this country.  The only way in which we could take over for ourselves the provisions of any British laws that we thought were acceptable to the people of this country would be by passing the same provisions as a piece of legislation through this Oireachtas.  In that case the legislation derives its authority, not from the fact that an Act had been passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, but through the sole fact that the legislation received the assent of the Oireachtas here.</P>
    <P>At that part of the Conference's proceedings, it had become clear to everybody that the results, so far, of the Conference could be summed up in the phrase that the powers of the Parliament of any of the Dominions were equal to the powers of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, that they were subject to no limitation which was not upon the Parliament of the United Kingdom.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Paragraph 57 states:</P>
      <P>If the above recommendations are adopted, the acquisition by the Parliaments of the Dominions of full legislative powers will follow as a necessary consequence.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is asserted that any country has more than full legislative powers.  Starting, therefore, from that point, we had to discuss whether there were certain matters which States thereafter not bound together by any legal nexus regarded as matters of common concern requiring special attention.  Three things emerged, two dealt with immediately, and one which followed from the fourth term of reference.  The first was the question of succession to the Throne.  The second matter was dealt with under the heading of nationality, and the third was the question of uniformity in all the vast details of legislation of the merchant shipping type.  With regard to the first point, we had to try to strike a balance as between the possession of certain powers and the exercise of these powers, particularly when both the possession of the powers and the exercise of them centred on a single item which remained as the solitary tie between the different countries.  Paragraph 58 says:</P>
      <P>By the removal of all such restrictions upon the legislative powers of the Parliaments of the Dominions and the consequent effective recognition of the equality of these Parliaments with the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the law will be brought into harmony with the root principle of equality governing the free association of the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 59 is:</P>
      <P>As, however, these freely associated members are united by a common allegiance to the Crown, it is clear that the laws relating to the succession to the Throne and the Royal style and titles are matters of equal concern to all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2068" /> And then paragraph 60 continues the recommendation:&mdash;</P>
    <P>We think that appropriate recognition would be given to this position by means of a convention similar to that which has in recent years controlled the unfettered powers of the Parliament of the United Kingdom to legislate upon these matters.  Such a constitutional convention would be in accord with and would not derogate from and is not intended in any way to derogate from the principles stated by the Imperial Conference of 1926 as underlying the position and mutual relations of the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.  We therefore recommend that this convention should be formally put on record in the following terms:&mdash; Inasmuch as the Crown is the symbol of the free association of the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and as they are united by a common allegiance to the Crown, it would be in accord with the established constitutional position of all the members of the Commonwealth in relation to one another that any alteration in the law touching the Succession to the Throne or the Royal Style and Title shall hereafter require the assent as well of the Parliaments of all the Dominions as of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>As stated heretofore the position has been with regard to the succession to the Throne that theoretically power rested in the Parliament of the United Kingdom.  That power was in theory uncontrolled by anything or anybody else.  In fact, that particular power has been regarded in the last seven or eight years, as a matter of common concern, a matter in which the theoretically uncontrolled power of the British Parliament would not be exercised save after consultation with, and with the consent of, the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations. But when it had been determined that there was no longer any legal nexus between the members of the British Commonwealth of <Col N="2069" /> Nations, this one point was singled out for special mention as being the solitary link between the States that form that Association.  The agreed recommendations come to this, that each of us would by constitutional convention impose upon ourselves a control which, while technically absent, was, in fact, always present over the United Kingdom Parliament in relation to the Throne and to the Royal Style and Titles.</P>
    <P>A point arises in paragraph 62, to which I am not going to refer fully at the moment.  It refers to the acquisition of full legislative powers by the Parliaments of the Dominions possessing federal Constitutions and I refer to it only because it leads to the declaration in paragraph 67 as to the constitutional position here and in South Africa.</P>
    <P>I have marked out for mention the question of nationality, which the Report, in paragraph 72, postulates as &ldquo;clearly a matter of equal interest to all parts of the Commonwealth.&rdquo; Paragraph 73 indicates the varying connotations of the words &ldquo;national,&rdquo;&ldquo;nationhood,&rdquo; and &ldquo;nationality,&rdquo; and the difficulty of describing the relationship of the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations to one another up to the date of this Conference.  Reference is made to the ambiguity which results from the use of these terms in the way in which they have been used.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 74 moves quickly to a decision:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The status of the Dominions in international relations, the fact that the King on the advice of his several Governments, assumes obligations and acquires rights by treaty on behalf of individual members of the Commonwealth, and the position of the members of the Commonwealth in the League of Nations and in relation to the Permanent Court of International Justice, do not merely involve the recognition of these communities as distinct juristic entities, but also compel recognition of a particular <Col N="2070" /> status of membership of those communities for legal and political purposes.</P>
    <P>Our deliberations in this matter of nationality come to this&mdash;and this is one point in which, as I said, the value of Association comes out clearly &mdash;&ldquo;Nationality,&rdquo; from this time on, is going to have only one of the two meanings heretofore attached to that word.  A national hereafter of this State, if we did pass certain legislation which can be passed at any moment, will mean a person whom we admit to the rights of citizenship in this State under whatever conditions we like to impose. It may be nationality founded upon blood, it may be nationality founded on place of birth, or it may be nationality founded on a mixture of those two.  But whatever it is, whatever rights of citizenship are permitted, and whatever people may be given these rights of citizenship will depend entirely upon the wishes of the Oireachtas of this State. Whoever is called a national of this State, under the laws of the Oireachtas, hereafter carries with him all the benefits of that citizenship wherever he goes.  The full effects of a nationality recognised and accepted will flow to him, and that nationality will frank his passport along the highways of the world.</P>
    <P>We move on to another paragraph under which on terms to be agreed our citizens will get whatever facilities may be got from Consular offices established in any part of the world by any of the members of this Commonwealth of Nations. But there are two different stages and we should be clear as to both.  We decide as to our own nationals.  We decide the conditions that are precedent to the acquisition of nationality.  We decide what are the obligations and rights of our nationals hereafter.  We decide what the conditions are resulting from nationality.  Apart from that a second condition is envisaged.  Up to date there has been a common status recognised through the British Commonwealth of Nations.  We may not desire that common status: we <Col N="2071" /> may decide that in order to acquire it we may have to put up with certain disadvantages, and we may decide that these disadvantages may outweigh any facilities or benefits we get from the common status when travelling abroad.  In that event we simply decide our own nationality and look for nothing beyond that. But we can get advantages from association with the British Commonwealth of Nations.  In paragraph 77 it is explained:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Under the new position, if any change is made in the requirements established by the existing legislation, reciprocal action will be necessary to attain the same recognition, the importance of which is manifest in view of the desirability of facilitating freedom of intercourse and the mutual granting of privileges among the different parts of the Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 78 says:</P>
    <P>It is, of course, plain that no member of the Commonwealth either could or would contemplate seeking to confer on any person a status to be operative throughout the Commonwealth save in pursuance of legislation based upon common agreement, and it is fully recognised that this common status is in no way inconsistent with the recognition within and without the Commonwealth of the distinct nationality possessed by the nationals of the individual States of the British Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>That means nothing more than this, that if hereafter we desire that there should be special facilities granted by and to those who are nationals of the different States associated with the British Commonwealth of Nations, we will agree to such terms as the conference may suggest for the acquisition of a wider status, something over and beyond nationality, something which will be recognised and valuable throughout the whole Commonwealth. We need not agree unless we are satisfied to agree.  We may not agree because we think that the <Col N="2072" /> wider status has its disadvantages. We may refuse to agree to this because of our suspicion that in fact it imports a limitation of status.  We may decide to remain suspicious and not move beyond the determination of our own nationality and our national rights.  But if we want to use the Association of the British Commonwealth of Nations to the full, if we want to get the full facilities that are desirable for intercourse, then it is laid down here that we should base our legislation upon agreement.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 79 points out:</P>
    <P>But the practical working out and application of the above principles will not be an easy task, nor is it one which we can attempt to enter upon in this Report.  We recommend, however, that steps should be taken as soon as possible by consultation among the various Governments to arrive at a settlement of the problems involved on the basis of these principles.</P>
    <P>The last item referred to in the terms of reference is merchant shipping. The section which deals with merchant shipping is long and somewhat involved, but the results are clear.  They are stated under the heading of The New Position in paragraphs 91 to 95.  Paragraph 91 sets out:</P>
    <P>Our general conclusions on the operation of Dominion legislation, including the recommendations regarding extra-territorial effect of Dominion laws, the Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1865, reservation and disallowance, are applicable to the constitutional position of legislation affecting merchant shipping.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 92 says:</P>
    <P>When these conclusions are given effect to, and the restrictions imposed on Dominion Parliaments by Sections 735 and 736 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, are removed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, which we recommend should be done, there will no longer be any doubt as to the full and complete power of <Col N="2073" /> any Dominion Parliament to enact legislation in respect of merchant shipping, nor will Dominion laws be liable to be held inoperative on the ground of repugnancy to laws passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 93 it is stated:</P>
    <P>The new position will be that each Dominion will, amongst its other powers, have full and complete legislative authority over all ships while within its territorial waters or engaged in its coasting trade; and also over its own registered ships both intra-territorially and extra-territorially.  Such extra-territorial legislation will, of course, operate subject to local laws while the ship is within another jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 94 says:</P>
    <P>The ground is thus cleared for co-operation amongst the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations on an equal basis in those matters in which practical considerations call for concerted action.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 95 refers to the fact that shipping is a world-wide interest, and states that there is a strong presumption in favour of concerted action between the members of the British Commonwealth in shipping matters, &ldquo;but this concerted action must from its nature result from voluntary agreements by the members of the Commonwealth.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Thus we can see ourselves in the near future arriving at the same point in regard to shipping as that forecasted with regard to nationals. We are to establish shipping of our own and do what we please in that connection with our own shipping. We will establish conditions for ownership, for the acquisition of ships, for the crews that go on board, the conditions under which they serve, and the flag under which they will sail.  Everything, as far as the Irish Free State shipping is concerned, will be a matter for this Parliament.</P>
    <P>Certain matters are referred to <Col N="2074" /> from paragraph 97 onwards as matters upon which the conference recognises as desirable uniformity of legislation.  It does not say that uniformity is essential, but merely points out that it is desirable, and mentions that that uniformity can only arise from the voluntary agreement of the various members of the Commonwealth.  The recommendations in this part conclude: &ldquo;It is not necessary at present to frame a complete list of the shipping questions upon which uniformity is desirable, but certain matters stand out clearly&rdquo; upon which recommendations are submitted.  Most of the points upon which recommendations are submitted are matters that are now ruled almost entirely by international convention.  Where they are not ruled by international convention they are tending to become fixed by international convention, and they will become fixed in that way soon.  The fact that this group of States agree ahead of other nations to secure uniform legislation may tend to speed up the tendency amongst all the nations of the world to have those things so regulated.  It is clear that the points referred to are matters about which the interest of humanity, in the first place, and, in the second place, the interest of the vast amount of property carried on the seas demand that there should be uniform regulations, and that these uniform regulations should be got together and announced as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>As far as this House is concerned, and as far as this country is concerned, it has the fullest and completest freedom over all shipping which comes into its power or which it itself establishes.  But our freedom should be exercised so as to secure the uniformity declared to be desirable.  When the details come to be considered it may be that on the difficult points certain to arise different views may prevail.  A decision may be come to not to have uniform legislation in regard to certain matters.  There is a diversity now between Canadian and British legislation upon some points and it may be that when an attempt is made <Col N="2075" /> to get agreement later on there will be disagreement and an adherence by each party to its own code.  I will not enter into detail upon that part of the Report at this point.  I do recommend the consideration of this merchant shipping matter to Deputies for this reason, that it was taken as a separate part of the Conference and somewhat away from the other matters which were more of constitutional value. This matter was taken as one upon which practical considerations ruled.  There was agreement amongst the experts as to the practical problems that arose and agreement that uniform legislation was desired. It was possible in this to have the point set out in much more detail than could be given, say, in the question of nationality.</P>
    <P>It is really the best example that could be given of the working of the co-operative Commonwealth that at present exists.  One can see the detail in which some of these questions must be examined before any attempt at legislation can be made covering the different points of view, and this concrete example is valuable as showing how very definitely the old central government system has disappeared and has been replaced by a system of communities all controlling their own affairs but recognising that there is value in having certain matters of common concern regulated by uniform legislation.</P>
    <P>The last point dealt with&mdash;by way of suggestion&mdash;is a matter that was referred to here at some length in a previous debate.  I call attention to one point in relation to Part VII., which deals with the suggested tribunal for the determination of disputes. The second sentence from the end reads: &ldquo;With regard to the latter, there was general agreement that the jurisdiction should be limited to justiciable issues arising between Governments.&rdquo; In other words, in so far as any tribunal was suggested or considered it was a tribunal merely for the reconciling of disputes arising between the Governments <Col N="2076" /> of the States, members of the Commonwealth.  It was not to be a tribunal to deal with private suitors or to deal with disputes between nationals of a single State.  But it is quite clear that when that matter comes to be further discussed some further discrimination must be made, for one can see the possibility of a dispute which arises at first as a dispute between the nationals of a State becoming in the end an interGovernmental dispute.</P>
    <P>That was one of the many matters that halted in our consideration of this, made us merely run over the suggestions put before us, and induced us to recommend that this whole subject should be further examined by the Governments.</P>
    <P>That is the Report of the Conference. It flows, as I have said, from the Conference Report of 1926. It is established on the principles laid down in the Report of 1926.  It went into details on many points but it did not by any means finish the subjects.  It finished the task which was set it because it definitely operated on all the Terms of Reference down even to small details of administration, in the different items that were considered.  It did not on all points define the details on which uniformity is desirable.  That is left over for further agreement and settlement either by conference or exchange of despatches.  The details of the work are not finished but the task set before the Conference is finished to this extent, that no detail has been allowed to over-ride principle or allowed to bar the fullest application of the principles stated in 1926.  The old unitary system of central government by the old Parliament of the United Kingdom has definitely departed.</P>
    <P>As I said in June, the whole legal framework of the system has been taken apart and never again will be put together.  It has come to an end. That system, which lasted for many years, was probably the most elaborate legal system of which the history of the government of political communities has any record. I described the Report in the beginning <Col N="2077" /> as a very important constitutional document and in fact said that it was the most important constitutional document which this House has been asked to consider since the Treaty.  I am going to leave Deputies to form their own judgment upon it and I only ask, if anybody objects to the phrases which I have used in regard to the meaning of the Conference Report and is going to criticise the Report, that such criticisms will not be based on fears or suspicion but that the items will be pointed out upon which it can be said that central control still remains and about which there is still in the British Parliament control over this House. It may be said in regard to this Conference that it had one big aim.  It aimed at making it clear to everybody that the power of the United Kingdom Parliament over Dominion Parliaments has gone.  I hold that the Report makes that clear.  If anyone holds that it does not, I want him to point out where the opposite can be shown.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite natural in the circumstances that the Minister should state that this is a vastly important document, and that it is the most important constitutional document, to quote his words, that has come before this or another House since the Treaty of 1921.  I suppose it is a case of the fond father.  This is the Minister's own child, and, therefore, he sees untold wonders in it and a magnificent future arising out of it.  I hope that the confidence he feels will be borne out by future events.  We look upon this Report and the various declarations and recommendations which it contains from a different point of view.  I may say that anything that has been done, or can be done, particularly now that we are discussing the declarations and recommendations in this Report, to win further power and to make it more certain that there is no outside authority that has control over even the Twenty-six counties and its Parliament is all to the good.  We stand behind anything that has been done in that connection, and we are glad to see it, but, <Col N="2078" /> having said so much, I repeat that we look upon this Imperial Conference and its results from a different point of view.</P>
      <P>First of all, we do not start out by recognising the Dominion status that has been forced upon us as satisfactory. Therefore, when any declaration, recommendation, or agreement is come to that brings us closer to other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations or to England, any declaration, recommendation or agreement that makes the working of that Commonwealth, so far as we are concerned, more smooth and that tends in the direction of endeavouring to satisfy our people with Dominion status, we cannot say that we are satisfied to go in that direction.  We are not by any means satisfied with the Dominion status of the Irish Free State, nor are we satisfied with the partition of Ireland. What some people might call relatively important, but what we call, in view of the greater problems, relatively minor and unimportant problems, are dealt with in this Report and have been discussed at great length at the recent Imperial Conference.  While, however, the problems dealt with are interesting, and while they may have consequences, as the Minister suggested, of a far-reaching nature for the community known as the British Commonwealth of Nations in the future, the major problem, so far as we are concerned, is the problem of winning Ireland's independence, the problem of breaking out of that Commonwealth and of getting Ireland, not the Free State, her proper status in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For us, the great problem is the restoration of the independence and unity of Ireland, and so long as these two big problems face the people of Ireland and as long as they remain to be resolved, matters of the kind dealt with in this Report, though perhaps important in themselves, are, to our mind, relatively minor matters. It is interesting for those who are interested in constitutional law, and the study of constitutional development here or elsewhere, to learn that <Col N="2079" /> legal anomalies are being removed or may be removed.  It is not even suggested that they are removed by any recommendation or declaration contained in this Report.  I take it that all of these recommendations and declarations are subject to adoption and to legislation not here alone but in the other Parliaments of the British Commonwealth of Nations. It is certainly satisfactory to hear the Minister state that he has been assisting at the removal of the old Imperial control.  We are glad that he has been assisting in that direction, and we hope that, whatever success which he has claimed to have, will encourage him to go further and remove control over the Six, as well as the Twenty-Six, Counties and restore to Ireland that unity which he helped to break.  Looked at from that point of view, from the Irish as distinct from the Free State point of view, and again bearing in mind the fact that these recommendations are in all cases subject to the passing of legislation in the different Parliaments, it is quite possible that the Minister is cheering a little too soon or shouting before he is out of the wood.  All of these recommendations, even those that have reference to this House alone, are only, so far, recommendations or declarations.  This House may see fit, and I hope it will, in so far as any powers can be won for Ireland or for any part of Ireland, wring from the Power that had control of her heretofore, so far as they can be got back, further powers for Ireland.  We will be glad if that is to be.  We hope that the House will implement these declarations. At any rate until that legislation has been passed here or elsewhere these recommendations have no value in law.</P>
    <P>One thing particularly struck me in reading over those Reports and it was a thing that the Minister himself might have referred to, in my opinion, because I think if we examine the history of the last nine years from, say, a purely scientific point of view, nobody will claim that the people of Ireland, or this part of <Col N="2080" /> Ireland, of their own free will, joined the British Commonwealth of Nations.  Therefore, I say that the Minister might have, and with truth, said in his speech, and might have found a place for reference to it in this Report, that the Irish Free State is in this Commonwealth of Nations not of its absolute free will.  Over and over again references are made in the Report to the free association of Members of the Commonwealth. The first reference occurs in paragraph 8 of the Imperial Conference Report of 1926 which states:</P>
    <P>They are autonomous communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to the other, in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs, though united by a common allegiance to the Crown and freely associated as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.</P>
    <P>I deny the freedom that is claimed for the association there.  We are in this Commonwealth, certainly not by the free will of the Irish people. There is one thing that should be remembered always, and, I think, remembered even by those who at present stand for the Irish Free State as a Dominion within the Commonwealth of Nations and who uphold it.  That is, that the governing factor in the signing of the Treaty which brought the Free State into existence, was Mr. Lloyd George's threat of immediate and terrible war if the delegates did not sign.  That gives the lie to the statement repeated often in this Report, that we are freely associated as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.  The following occurs in paragraph 15:</P>
    <P>These principles of freedom, equality and co-operation have slowly emerged from the experience of self-governing communities, now constituting the most remarkable and successful experiment in co-operation between free democracies which has ever been developed, the British Commonwealth of Nations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2081" /> It seems that it is necessary, even in view of our history, in view of the history that is so recent and so well known, to protest and to make clear, so far as we on this side can, at any rate, that we are not in that Association or Commonwealth by any free will of ourselves.  There are similar declarations in other paragraphs suggesting that this is a free Association. These declarations occur in paragraphs 58, 126, and so on, as if all the delegates whose signatures are to this document were anxious to impress upon the world&mdash;I take it that is why the term &ldquo;free Association&rdquo; is so freely and frequently used&mdash;and perhaps impress upon ourselves and by constant repetition to get even the Irish people to believe that we are freely associated.  I deny that, and repeat there was no freedom of choice when that Association was forced upon us.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked of the value of the Association and the value that we derive out of the Association. It is possible that there might be value for even the Free State to be got out of association with other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, but if there is any value, nationally speaking, to be got out of it, that true value can only be got if the Association is by the free choice and the free will of the Irish people.  That, up to the present, cannot be claimed.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 67 has a line or two in it which, I think, is worth calling attention to.  Discussing the Constitution of the Union of South Africa and the Irish Free State, it says in the last sentence: &ldquo;In the case of the Irish Free State they are exercised in accordance with the obligations undertaken by the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty signed at London on the 6th day of December, 1921.&rdquo;  All our powers here are subject to that Treaty, are in accordance with the obligations undertaken in that Treaty, and on account of the frequency with which free will and freedom of choice and free association are referred to in the Report, I say again that, being <Col N="2082" /> subject to the obligations undertaken by the signing of the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty, we are not free and there was no freedom of choice in that matter, and until the Articles of that Agreement are reviewed, until we have liberty to review them and sign a document, pact or treaty, call it what you will, of our own free will, then it is useless, nationally speaking at any rate, to talk of the advantage we derive or may derive out of association with the other members of the British Commonwealth.  Viewed from the standpoint of the other Dominions and Colonies of England, particularly Canada, South Africa and Australia, this Report and the recommendations contained in it probably do mean an advance.</P>

      <P>Certainly there was, and that reminds me that in 1919 &mdash;just to show you how the South Africans recognise the force&mdash; General Hertzog and five or six of his colleagues now members of the South African Government came to Paris for the Peace Conference. They had to come with British passports. They would not be allowed out of South Africa unless they accepted British passports.  But they insisted and succeeded in getting the British to endorse those passports in this way.  The man was described &ldquo;General, or whatever he was. Hertzog, British citizen by conquest.&rdquo; General Hertzog showed me his passport where he insisted that they should put in these words, &ldquo;British citizen by conquest.&rdquo; There was no free will there.  He did not recognise that he was a free citizen of the British Commonwealth of Nations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In most of these cases at any rate these other Dominions, <Col N="2083" /> Canada, Australia and New Zealand in particular, grew out of the expansion of the British Empire; they are a part and willing to be part and parcel of that Empire.  They started as countries colonised from Britain, dominated, owned and controlled originally by Britain.  They are in a very different position from Ireland or even the Irish Free State. If they wish to continue in the closest association, working in harmony with Britain, their mother country, that is their own affair. We do not wish to interfere with them.  We wish them well.  If they arrive at amicable agreements with England in relation to their mutual affairs, powers of legislation and otherwise, that is their business, but we are in an entirely different position.  We did not start out by being a colony of England or being colonised by England.  I do not think it is necessary to emphasise that, but it is well when people get into the mentality, as some seem to do to-day, some who were formerly Irish nationalists and some formerly Irish Republicans, that they find pleasure and joy in boasting of the Irish Free State's Dominion status to remind them that there are Irish Nationalists still in the country to whom the status of a Dominion in the British Commonwealth brings no pleasure.</P>
      <P>I saw a statement quoted in the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; of the 15th October of last year, where the Minister for Education, speaking at the Shelbourne Hotel, expressed a strong view against anything like sneering at Dominion status.  If that quotation be correct, it bears out what I have in mind.  Sneering at Dominion status, of course, may be objectionable to him now, and to others like him, but to those of us who are Irish Nationalists and Irish Republicans not of yesterday, those of us who claim we represent the Irish tradition. Dominion status is certainly more of an insult than anything in which to take pride.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will let that alone in reference to any individual, but I do say, speaking from this side of the House, at any rate, that Dominion status is a thing we want to get rid of as soon as we can, and all that it implies, even including the progress that, according to the Minister for External Affairs, has been made in the recommendations and declarations he has secured in this Report. We want to get rid of it as soon as we can, because it consorts ill with a nation with a record and history so full of reasons for pride, for a real Irishman, as ours is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to harp too much on this subject, but again paragraph 15, where the principles of freedom, equality and co-operation are referred to, bears out my point as to the denial of Ireland's free will in association with the British Commonwealth of Nations.  I ask: Would there have been partition of this country by the free will of the Irish people?  There would not.  If the people had freedom of choice, they would not have allowed the nation to be partitioned.  If we had no other proof that there was no freedom of choice, the very existence of partition would be sufficient.  There are <Col N="2085" /> others; they may be symbols, if you like; they may not be matters of very large importance, but as symbols they are of great importance&mdash; the symbol of the control of our harbours and the British gunboats in some of them.  As symbols of the absence of freedom, they are important and they are additional proof of the lie that is uttered every time the words &ldquo;freedom of choice&rdquo; or &ldquo;free association&rdquo; are mentioned in this Report.  Our reading of this Report is governed by that point of view, that we are not of our own free choice a Dominion, that we are not in association with the British Commonwealth of our own free will, that we do not want to be associated with them on any such terms.  That there may, as the Minister for External Affairs has said, be value in association, I do not deny.  There may be value in association of near neighbours, but that association, if it is to exist in the future, must be based on the absolute free will of the Irish nation, and that we have not had and have not to-day.</P>
    <P>I am not going to go through this Report in detail.  I will refer to a few of the points in it.  The first one I would like to refer to is paragraph 24, and its relation to the Colonial Stock Act, where it is brought out again that England maintains her right, as I suppose she is entitled to do, to refuse to the Free State liberty to have Free State loans listed as trustee stock unless the Free State will comply with certain regulations that Britain has made.  Of course, England is entitled to do that.  That is her affair, but England has certain trustee stock in this country, and if such power be refused to the Irish Free State and its Government it would certainly be worth considering why reciprocal action should not be taken.  If they refuse us liberty to list our stock as trustee stock, I think it would be worth while for the Minister for Finance to consider what action he could take so as, perhaps, to deal out the same measure of good will to England that she deals out to us in that matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2086" /> [<i>Professor Thrift took the Chair.</i>]</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of disallowance and reservation, referred to in Part III. of the Report, there are one or two lines in paragraph 31 that struck me as interesting.  Perhaps the Minister for External Affairs would explain to us what exactly they mean:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As regards Dominions, it gradually came to be realised that the attainment of the purposes of reservation must be sought in other ways than through the use of powers by the Government of the United Kingdom.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That matter of reservation is not of very great interest.  That is because there was only a very minor power of reservation in the Free State Constitution; there was no power of disallowance. But as that power, shadowy as it may have been, has disappeared, if the Minister be correct, I wonder what the suggestion that is contained in these words is: &ldquo;The purposes of reservation must be sought in other ways than through the use of powers by the Government of the United Kingdom.&rdquo; I would like if the Minister would comment on that later; if he could tell us what the &ldquo;other ways&rdquo; might possibly mean.</P>
    <P>On the question of extra-territoriality, are we to take it that, if legislation be passed as a result of the recommendations, in this House and elsewhere, power will reside in this Parliament in future to legislate extra-territorially?  I think it follows, if you read paragraphs 40, 41 and 42, that such power did not reside in the Irish Free State Parliament heretofore.  As paragraph 38 states, &ldquo;the subject is full of obscurity, and there is conflict in legal opinion as expressed in the courts and the writings of jurists,&rdquo; and so on.  It may be that that power has resided here and that no attempt was made to use it, but we maintain that, up to the present, the Free State Parliament has not had that power.  It would seem, by inference at any rate, in reading these paragraphs, that the power has not up to the present resided <Col N="2087" /> in the Free State Parliament. If such power is put in its hands in the future, I suppose it is all to the good.  Paragraph 39 states it would not seem to be possible in the present state of the authorities to come to definite conclusions regarding the competence of the Dominion Parliaments to give their legislation extra-territorial operation.  That, I think, bears out what we have claimed.  If, in future, they are to have that power as a result of these recommendations, well and good.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 44 says: &ldquo;In connection with the exercise of extra-territorial legislative powers, we consider that provision should be made for the customary extra-territorial immunities with regard to internal discipline enjoyed by the armed forces of one Government when present in the territory of another Government.&rdquo; That, I take it, would mean that members of the British Army when on Free State territory would not be subject to Free State laws, that they are outside Irish Free State law, and are subject to British law and British Army authority.</P>

      <P>They are subject to Free State law except in regard to internal discipline.  The Colonial Laws Validity Act has probably given rise to very considerable inconvenience as far as other Members of the British Commonwealth of Nations are concerned.  We have not had any big, sensational cases arising out of it so far.  If the recommendations are to be adopted, which remains to be seen, and legislation be passed in the British Parliament, all the Dominions, I suppose, will be glad to see that brake on their powers disappear.  But, again, it must be remembered that, so far, it is only a promise and that we have yet to see whether Great Britain will finally pass, as recommended here, legislation abolishing the powers contained in that Act.  There was one particular matter that I thought the Minister would have sought to raise in a special form at the Conference so as to put into effect the hopes and aspirations of the Minister for Finance, and that is to end the power of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council to interfere in Free State legislation.  There is no reference to that in this Report. There is reference to it partly in the form of the suggested tribunal for the determination of disputes, but, as the Minister explained, that probably does not refer to the type of cases that the Privy Council up to the present has had power to interfere in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should be glad to hear the Minister go further and deal in greater detail with that problem.  It is one which touches the Irish Free State and its nationals very closely and which has had important bearings on Free State legislation up to the present <Col N="2089" /> and might have more important bearings not alone on Free State legislation, but on Free State nationals in future.  If he has any further information to give us, or any explanation as to what is intended in the setting up, if it is ever set up, of this new tribunal and the scope it is intended to have, we would be glad to hear it.  We are not particularly anxious that any tribunal of that kind should be set up.  We are satisfied with the setting up of the tribunal discussed here a week or two ago when the Optional Clause was before the House for ratification.  We think that tribunal would meet all the requirements.  If it is intended to set up some tribunal of this kind, we should be very glad to hear more from the Minister as to what he has in mind with regard to it.</P>
    <P>Up to the present there has been considerable difficulty in finding out what the exact position of citizenship is so far as people living in or born in the Free State are concerned. If this question of nationality and citizenship is to be cleared up, and if we are to know what is the exact status of such citizens in future as a result of this Report, it will be all to the good.  We would like, of course, that there should be one definition of citizenship and nationality, and that is people who are born in Ireland or who adopt Irish citizenship.  We took no pleasure in the dual citizenship that existed up till now, the common citizenship with other nationals of the British Empire.  Common citizenship did not appeal to us.  To our mind, it was a degradation of our Irish citizenship and national status, and if the question of citizenship is to be settled in future, we would rather have it settled on the basis of Irish citizenship dissociated from common citizenship with Great Britain, Australia and any other country.  Irish citizenship and Irish nationality is good enough for us.</P>

      <P>All right; I shall come back to it on another occasion. I have nothing further to say on the details of that Report except again to assert that we are not freely associated and that we hope to make the fullest use of every opportunity that arises to break down, step by step, <Col N="2092" /> if necessary, if we cannot do it in any other way, the connection that does exist until such time as the people here are given an opportunity to declare with absolute freedom what their choice is in this matter of association with the other Dominions of the British Commonwealth of Nations.  I have a cutting here that I think I might refer to in this connection.  It is from an address delivered by Dr. Binchy in Berlin.  This is a cutting from the &ldquo;Irish Times,&rdquo; and Mr. Binchy, in talking of this Association, called it a partnership; and he says: &ldquo;On the contrary, it is just because the Dominions have the right of co-equality that they have not the faintest intention of leaving the Commonwealth.&rdquo;  That, to my mind, is a gross misrepresentation of the aspirations of the common people of the Irish Free State.  I would say, on the contrary, the common people of the Irish Free State will seek every opportunity that arises to get away from that Association until such time as they have an opportunity to decide of their own free will, without force of any kind being used to coerce them, one way or another, what their will is in this matter.</P>
      <P>I say that a declaration of this kind made by the representative of the Irish Free State that the people here, having reached co-equality, have not the faintest intention of leaving the Commonwealth, is a gross misrepresentation of the position. In that connection, perhaps, the Minister will define for me when he is winding up the debate what the difference is between equality and co-equality.  If we are equal we are equal.  I do not see how the prefix or qualification &ldquo;co&rdquo; makes us any more equal.  However, that is an exercise for which the Minister is probably particularly fitted to help us and I shall be glad if he gives a little attention to this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Connell Mr. T. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was disappointed that at the beginning the Minister did not give us some reason why he is asking the House in this <Col N="2093" /> formal way to approve of this Report. It is the first time, as far as I know, that a resolution of this nature has been put down.  We have had reports of conferences of this nature before.  They were published and laid upon the Table of the House and circulated to Deputies, and opportunities were found for discussing them in this House.  But so far as I know this is the first time in which we have been asked formally to record our approval of a report of this nature.  The Minister did not give us any reason why that procedure has been taken on this occasion with regard to this particular Report.  He said this is a very important document, one of the most important that has been produced since the Treaty.  We have had at least two.  We have had the Report of the Imperial Conference of 1923, and the Report of the Imperial Conference of 1926.  The Minister himself says that in the Report of the Imperial Conference of 1926 general principles were laid down, and that this Report is only showing how practical effect may be given to the principles laid down in 1926.  That would seem to me to show that the 1926 document was of greater importance than this, which is only the outcome of it.  At any rate we were not asked to give formal approval to the 1926 Report.  There was an occasion here on which we discussed it.  It came before the House on a motion for the adjournment, and it was discussed fully from both sides of the House, and opinions were expressed regarding various portions of it, but there was no formal decision required.  I say it is unwise that we should be asked in this way to give formal sanction and approval to a report of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been numerous conferences in the past, and will be in the future, and they have been beneficial in many ways perhaps, but if it comes to be adopted as a recognised procedure that every time a report of such a conference or such a meeting of Ministers or officials of the various governments is published that each government will go to its respective parliament and get formal <Col N="2094" /> ratification of the report of the conference, I think that would be setting a precedent that it may not be wise to adopt, because there will be a tendency to look upon those Imperial Conferences as something in the nature of super-parliaments.</P>
    <P>That will be the tendency.  That is not the case at present.  But if the Reports come along, and Parliament is asked formally to ratify them, that would be the tendency and they will be looked upon as legislative bodies&mdash;as the bodies that are legislating for all the members of the Commonwealth of Nations.  I do not say that that is there, but that is the tendency.  The Minister has given us no reason why the practice, up to the present, of merely laying the Report upon the Table or bringing the Reports to the notice of the House on an adjournment debate, or discussing these Reports on another Vote, such as the External Affairs Vote, should be departed from.  I say that that practice would be a more satisfactory way of dealing with it, that is, for the Minister to take occasion when the External Affairs Vote is being discussed to bring this matter forward, rather than putting down a formal motion asking for ratification in a particular way.  The Minister told us that this thing is not done in a hurry, that the practice in this and in other matters like the Labour Conference is first to set out general headings, as it were, giving the matter, as it were, a first reading, and then waiting for a year or more to allow an opportunity for full consideration of the implications in the Report, or in the recommendations of the Conference of everything that may be involved in it.  But the Minister comes to the Parliament here with a Report consisting of 44 pages, and he asks the House, inside a fortnight or less, to give a decision on it.  He puts down a motion and asks us to give formal ratification to it.  I think he is expecting us to express a great act of faith in himself when he asks us to approve of everything that is in this Report without our having an opportunity of reading it, and without <Col N="2095" /> going into it in the detail into which it ought to be gone into if it was necessary to give formal ratification.</P>
    <P>The Report consists of a large amount of matter that is merely historical.  It is explanatory and sets forth the law, it tells us what the practice has been, what the law has been, and what the history and evolution of these various countries have been.  He asks us formally to approve of this.  I do not think that is a course that ought to be adopted; there are 13 separate recommendations. He asks us to approve in globo of the lot of them.  We might approve of some of them and we might not approve of others.  I think if there is to be formal ratification in this way it would be necessary to take these one by one and consider them.  I doubt the wisdom of asking formal approval by the Dáil to this Report, and I do not see the necessity for it.  The Minister has not attempted to show that there was any necessity for formal ratification. I agree largely with one statement made by Deputy O'Kelly in which he pointed out that while many of these recommendations and the necessity for these recommendations would apply in the case of other members of the Commonwealth of Nations which grew up by certain means from a state of dependency as colonies into Dominions, they are not necessary so far as we are concerned, and we should be careful not to suggest they are, as we would, if we formally asked Britain, as we appear to do in these recommendations, to remove certain anomalies which do not apply to us and which the Minister said did not apply to us. We would be giving the appearance that they did possibly apply to us or that we have been walking in the same way and that we have grown up in the same way as the other members of the Commonwealth.  I agree with Deputy O'Kelly that we should do nothing that would create that impression. So far as we here are concerned we have always taken the view that the Treaty and the Constitution give us full equality and that the removal of these anomalies <Col N="2096" /> are not necessary as far as we are concerned.  The Minister has himself said that&mdash;that they are only of academic interest to us, pratically all of them.  I feel that there are many of these recommendations in which we ask Great Britain or the Parliament of Great Britain to do certain things.  There is undoubtedly an implication in doing that. The implication is there that it is necessary for our full status that such things should be done by the Parliament of Great Britain.</P>
    <P>I raised this point once before, and I asked what effect had the Colonial Laws Validity Act as far as Ireland was concerned.  The Minister for Defence pointed out that it had no effect whatsoever.  He pointed out that any of these anomalies that had to be removed by this experts committee had no effect so far as we were concerned.  They why should we set out to ask in this formal way that they should be removed?  Their removal is necessary to make clear and definite what the position of Canada, New Zealand or Australia may be. But we hold that so far as we are concerned they are not necessary. There seems to be in this Report&mdash; and the formal adoption of it, for this reason, would be unwise&mdash;a tendency to lessen the status which we hitherto, in any case, have maintained as being given to us or obtained by us as a result of the establishment of the Free State.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 8 there is reference to status, and it was quoted by Deputy O'Kelly.  Let us take that in relation to paragraph 81, which sets out: &ldquo;and we suggest that the opportunity should be taken of the proposed Act to be passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom to amend this definition....&rdquo;&mdash; that is the definition of colony&mdash;&ldquo;We have accordingly prepared the following clause:&mdash;In this Act and in every Act passed after the commencement of this Act the expression &lsquo;Dominion&rsquo; means the Dominion of ... the Irish Free State.&rdquo;  As far as I know, that is the first time the word Dominion has been applied and this will be the first time in <Col N="2097" /> which we will have formally applied that term in any Act to which we have given our assent.  I do not believe that in any other formal action of this Oireachtas have we described the Irish Free State as a Dominion.  I think we should not take any step here formally, as we are asked to do, that would bind us to the word Dominion.  We are asked to do that if we ratify this Report. We would, for the first time, sanction the use by this Oireachtas of the title Dominion.  I, like Deputy O'Kelly, do not like that word.</P>

      <P>The Irish Free State.  A Dominion and the Irish Free State are contradictory; the Free State and the word Dominion appear to me, in any case, to be contradictory. The word Dominion has a historical application.  It arose at the time when the British Parliament did, in fact, exercise dominion. In the case of Canada it exercised a certain dominion over the Parliament. If it is the one link that is left&mdash;the King's dominion &mdash; then Great Britain should be there.</P>

      <P>If it is a question of the King's dominion, then there is no reason why England&mdash;Great Britain&mdash;should be left out of this definition of the Dominions.  I do not like the word; I think it is a lessening of our status, and we should <Col N="2098" /> not be asked formally to give approval for the first time to the term.  Dominion and Free State seem to me to be contradictory. Paragraphs 32 and 33 deal with discretionary and compulsory reservation. In regard to those things they have only, as the Minister said, an academic interest for us.  Speaking of reservation, he said that, of course, he did not believe it was right there should be any reservation.  In paragraph 32 we have a statement of this kind:</P>
      <P>It would not be in accordance with the constitutional practice for advice to be tendered to His Majesty by His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom against the views of the Government of the Dominion concerned.</P>
      <P>In paragraph 33 there is another sentence of the same nature:</P>
      <P>It would not be in accordance with constitutional practice for advice to be tendered to His Majesty by His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom in any matter appertaining to the affairs of a Dominion against the views of the Government of that Dominion.</P>
      <P>There is there the idea of the predominant partner; it runs through that that they have the right, as it were, and have special access to His Majesty in order to tender him advice, but of their goodness they are agreeing that they will not exercise the jurisdiction against the wishes of the Dominion.

Remember that we are co-equal, that there is co-equality.

If that would not be possible, then there is no reciprocity and no equality.  On the question of extra-territorial rights, Deputy O'Kelly and I are at entirely opposite ends of the pole.  Deputy O'Kelly believes that we have no power in our Constitution to have extra-territorial legislation with operation outside the Free State.  I hold we have, but I hold also that the Minister is now accepting Deputy O'Kelly's point of view when he is asking us to accept recommendations 16 and 17.</P>

      <P>We have defined already a Dominion as the Irish Free State.  If the Minister would make <Col N="2101" /> that absolutely clear, and if it were made clear in the Report, my criticism would fall to the ground. That is the basis of my criticism, namely, that while these things are necessary for other Dominions they are not necessary for the Irish Free State.  I think the Minister has given away the whole case in that interjection.  He has strengthened my argument very much.</P>

In regard to the question of shipping, which is rather a long, involved and obscure matter, and which would again support the plea I make, namely, that we should not be asked to give formal ratification to it, there is a paragraph in page 33 which says that these recommendations are also not intended to include any reference to questions affecting fisheries or the fishing industry, which were not considered to be within the scope of the Conference.  What is the position in regard to foreign trawlers? Does that question come within the scope of the Conference, or can any light be thrown on the obscurity which generally surrounds that question whenever it is raised in this House?  What is the position in regard to foreign trawlers caught poaching in Irish territorial waters?</P>

      <P>Paragraph 100 says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present all British ocean-going ships are treated alike in all ports of the British Commonwealth <Col N="2103" /> and, as stated in the Resolutions of the Imperial Economic Conference of 1923, it is the established practice to make no discrimination between ocean-going ships of all countries using ports in the Commonwealth.  It is recommended that the different parts of the Commonwealth should continue not to differentiate between their own ocean-going ships and similar ships belonging to other parts of the Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>Later it says: that these recommendations are also not intended to include any reference to questions affecting fisheries or the fishing industry, which were not considered to be within the scope of the Conference. In other words they say, &ldquo;Do not differentiate between your own ocean-going ships and the ships of other parts of the Commonwealth.&rdquo; That, however, does not apply to fishing boats.  We have greater freedom in regard to fishing boats.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would urge again that, while this discussion is useful in elucidating many points that are still obscure, there is no necessity to have a formal ratification by this House of the various recommendations in the Report and it is asking too much of us to swallow the whole thing, especially as the necessity for it has not been shown.  I do not know whether the Ceann Comhairle would allow me to follow Deputy O'Kelly into some of the statements which he made, or whether anything would be gained by doing it.  He and I are, however, criticising this Report from rather different angles. I am anxious that the status which we always stated we had should be maintained, and I feel that there is a tendency in this Report to detract in some way from that status.  I think that a useful purpose has been served by bringing the matter to the notice of the House, but I think that nothing would be lost by not pressing the matter to a decision by the House.  If, however, it is pressed to a decision, I feel that I will be forced <Col N="2104" /> to vote against the formal adoption of the Report by the House, not entirely because of things in the Report, but because I feel that it is establishing a bad precedent to ask for the formal ratification of the Report by the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that Deputy O'Connell amended that last sentence of his.  He started off by saying &ldquo;not for what is in the Report,&rdquo; and he corrected himself by saying &ldquo;not entirely for what is in the Report.&rdquo;  Listening to the two speeches which have just been delivered, I wonder why the Deputies object to the Report.  Deputy O'Kelly fundamentally, of course, so far as the Treaty is concerned, is in a different position to the other members of the House, but on the incidental details of the Report he seemed to be in agreement with practically all the details about which he spoke.  It was only when he added them together that he found it necessary to say that he would vote against the Report.  It is the same with Deputy O'Connell.  He seems to have a vague fear.  I must say, having listened to both speakers, I am not in a position to know what the fear was founded on.  We all remember that in the case of those big settlements, such as the Treaty of 1921 and the Imperial Conference Report of 1926, similar fears were expressed.  I think on that occasion also the Leader of the Opposition in this House went through the Report, and showed that the Report, like everything else, was a retrogression.  He indulged more or less in prophecies&mdash; the record is there for Deputies who wish to look it up&mdash;and he asked: &ldquo;What effect will this have on the institution in which Deputies are interested, namely, the League of Nations.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking in December, 1926, he pointed out that a couple of months previously Ireland had been a candidate for the Council of the League, and now after this expose, as he thought it was, of the very unsatisfactory condition of Dominion <Col N="2105" /> status, he more or less hinted that there was a poor chance for any of the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, apart from Great Britain herself, of course, if they ever went up for membership of the Council of the League.  I think that Deputies will remember the prophetic fear which animated Deputy Johnson, as he then was, but at the next election to the League, Canada was elected a member of the Council. It showed that his fears were not shared, and that his view as to the set-back which Dominion status had got, was not shared by any considerable section of public opinion at the League of Nations.  As I say, if we rely on our memories&mdash; those who wish can read up the reports&mdash;we can remember that these fears were always trotted out.</P>
    <P>I would ask Deputies to take the 1926 Report and this Report, which is a corollary to it.  It is well to bear in mind that this Report is a corollary to the 1926 Report.  Let Deputies take these two documents with the Treaty and compare them with the best freedom that is possible, leaving aside all the feared implications. They will find that these fears were also expressed in 1921.  I say that if you take these three documents together you will have a working conception of freedom that is inferior to none.  I say that, though I am perfectly clear, so far as this debate is concerned, we can discuss this only on the basis of the Treaty, and to a certain extent on the basis of the 1926 Report.  It should be abundantly clear that neither in 1926 nor 1929 did we send delegates to London to negotiate a new Treaty, to repudiate the existing one, or to do anything of the kind&mdash; to take a course of that kind for which we had no mandate, and for which certainly there was no reason. The Treaty that was signed in 1921, as I have had occasion to remark on more than once, was not a dead document.  It is a fatal error to regard any of these important international documents as if they were dead words.  They have in them, if they are worth anything, the spirit <Col N="2106" /> of life.  They are instinct with life. They have in them the spirit of development, and it is our business to see that when that development takes place it takes place in the proper direction.  That is what we have always striven for in connection with developments that are inherent in the Treaty.</P>
    <P>From the national point of view and from the point of view of a better understanding with the other members of the Commonwealth of Nations, and with Great Britain herself, two forms of development are always possible, progress and retrogression.  As I say, it is important&mdash;standing still is practically impossible&mdash;that as development is inevitable, we should try to secure that it takes place along the lines along which this country wants it to take place.  That is what we have claimed has been done in the case of the 1926 document and in the case of the document now before the Dáil for which approval is asked.  There are few documents, notwithstanding the extraordinary, I might say almost childish, belief that sometimes seems to prevail in this House, that are not susceptible of very different interpretations. Anybody ought to know that, and our business is to see that the interpretation we want is not only the interpretation that we hold, but is also the interpretation that gets acceptance by everybody.  That is why this document, even from our own point of view, is of great importance. I think it is time that we should give up the rather childish habit of thinking, when there are two possible points of view, that, first of all, not only must our view prevail to 100 per cent., but that also no other point of view must ever have been possible.  That is the attitude that is very often betrayed in discussing agreements of this kind.</P>
    <P>Care, determination and very hard work have been necessary in securing general acceptance for the interpretation we hold as our interpretation. It is all very well for Deputy O'Connell to say: &ldquo;This is our interpretation.&rdquo; Granted, but it is not <Col N="2107" /> easy to get recognition of that from other members.  Is it nothing that we get universal acceptance from the other members of the Commonwealth of Nations?  Surely from the point of view both of common sense, from the point of view of the ordinary working of an institution like the Commonwealth, an agreement of that kind is of tremendous importance? In the working out of the Treaty and in implementing the Treaty in the various ways in which it had to be implemented, a certain number of anomalies made their appearance. That is, as regards Dominion status and as regards that co-equality which is mentioned, not in the Treaty, but in, I think, Article I of the Constitution.  It is quite obvious that there were a number of anomalies. There were in this respect a number of existing legal theories and legal practices in existence in the British Commonwealth of Nations as a whole.  I say it was of importance for us to get these things definitely decided and decided in the way that we wanted them decided once and for all.  When I say that it was necessary from the national point of view, it was equally necessary, I believe, for the promotion of a good understanding between ourselves and the other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations and especially between ourselves and Great Britain. In the year 1921 I am convinced that under the Treaty we got more than what I might call ordinary Dominion status as it then prevailed.  I believe that that was the position in 1921. but I believe it is absurd to pretend that we got away&mdash;far away&mdash;beyond anything that was ever thought of in Dominion status.</P>
    <P>That is what is sometimes pretended in the debates in this House. And I think it is equally absurd to pretend that Dominion status is itself static, that it is not capable of development.  It is capable of development. One of the most extraordinary developments in modern constitutional history has been the developments in the relations between <Col N="2108" /> the members of the Commonwealth of Nations that has taken place especially from 1917 to the present day.  Remember that it is stated by people who have a very keen sense of their own national status, men like the present Premier of Canada, men like General Hertzog of South Africa.  By the way I think Deputy O'Kelly did not know what was General Hertzog's attitude on this particular question.  Speaking after the 1926 Conference this was his attitude:</P>
    <P>It can make no difference whether one speaks of autonomy, independence, or sovereign independence. It is sufficient for us to know that our status and liberty are no less than that of Great Britain....  Notwithstanding the relation in which they stand to the Commonwealth of Nations or to the British Empire, the independent liberty of the Dominions remains unscathed&mdash; equal to that of Great Britain in degree as well as in nature.  It must now be clear to every one of you how completely, by the declaration of the Imperial Conference in regard to our status, the Empire group unit idea has been broken with&mdash;that idea so assiduously pleaded and preached by some people since 1919.</P>
    <P>That was his attitude on a document that Deputy O'Connell will very well remember was lamented in this House by the then leader of his Party as a retrogression, although anyone looking at the document can see that it was a distinct gain so far as the cause we stand for is concerned.  It is an important thing, even if nothing else were achieved. I hold, to define and to clarify as far as possible the relations.  I was speaking to a writer on Constitutional law, not of this country, and he pointed out that one of the effects of the Irish Free State entering into the British Commonwealth of Nations would be an increase in definition and in clarification.  I hold that his prophecy was justified.  It is a great thing to get doubts removed, not exactly our doubts, but <Col N="2109" /> the doubts of other people.  It is a great thing that there should be no hesitation about our position being acknowledged by our fellow members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.  It is a great thing that these things should be cleared up and a still greater thing that they should be cleared up in the precise way we want them cleared up.</P>
    <P>This document that we are now discussing does three things.  It defines and clarifies; then it does two other things that are somewhat distinct. It lays down what the constitutional practice is, and independent altogether of what further action is taken on the matter, it gives the view&mdash;lays down, perhaps, is not the proper word but it gives the view&mdash;of the principal Ministers that want to discuss that question from all the Dominions, from the Free State and Great Britain, from Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and Australia.  It gives their view and the views of their experts as to what the constitutional practice is on every one of those points.  It goes further and makes recommendations. I say if these recommendations were never carried into effect &mdash;Deputy O'Kelly is always afraid that England is not going to honour her bargain in relation to things&mdash; we have at least a declaration of what the constitutional practice and principles are.  One thing about this document, and it will be especially a pleasure to those who remember who it was that was largely responsible for the 1926 document, is that it shows that the root principle ennunciated in the 1926 document was not mere verbiage. It was not something that was mere eye wash.  It is a thing that has proved itself so full of life, that it has done away with the institutions that were in conflict with it.  I think that in itself would be a pleasure to those statesmen who played their part in the 1926 conference.</P>
    <P>I will just call your attention to what the root principle is.  We ought to be by this time familiar with it, but you will find it in the 1926 document; you will find <Col N="2110" /> it repeated in the present document. They put it out definitely and clearly.  This is the principle of the 1926 Conference, and it is stated by the 1929 Conference that it is the principle.  That is the value of Part 11.  It is a résume, if you like, of what was done in 1926 so far as the matters treated are concerned, but it is, if I may call it, an official résume in its emphasis. It is a decisive résume; it insists on things that are important, and the principle it sets forth is: Speaking of the United Kingdom and the Dominions, they are autonomous communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another, in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs, though united by common allegiance to the Crown and freely associated as members of the Commonwealth of Nations.  Now that is the root principle.  It was not explicitly in the Treaty.  It was not fully and definitely formulated as an agreed thing between all the members of the British Commonwealth until 1926.  It was formulated then and, once formulated, there are two possibilities open to it: to die of inanition, or else to be triumphant over the different institutions, the different legal survivals of the past that were in conflict with it.</P>
    <P>As I say, the outstanding feature of the 1926 Conference was the enunciation of that principle.  The present document is a proof that that principle was the outstanding feature of the 1926 Conference, and it overshadows all the details in the way of advances made in other respects.  Criticism might be urged in reference to one or two points of the 1926 Report.  Whether we agree or disagree with them overshadowing all these details is the root principle to which I referred.</P>
    <P>Now as to co-operation.  At least I should have the Labour Party with me in this particular matter if we can never satisfy all our opponents opposite.  There was a time when co-operation and goodwill was impossible between ourselves and our <Col N="2111" /> neighbour.  Does Deputy O'Connell think that that is any longer so?  Does he think that co-operation is now impossible between the two countries?</P>

      <P>No.  That is what I am saying.  Deputy O'Connell is fully with us in that particular respect.  I remember before 1921 it was loudly proclaimed that the one barrier in the way of good understanding between ourselves and Great Britain was the fact that we were subject to Great Britain.  Do away with that subjugation and you have done away with the only cause for continued misunderstanding between the two nations whose geographical position and commercial interests ought to make them friendly, and here I think I may claim the support of Deputy O'Connell's Party when he knows that all that misunderstanding has gone.</P>

I want to know if it is contended that a good understanding is not desirable, that goodwill is not desirable.  In these days we all speak of goodwill between nations, and it seems now, as this Report and as the 1926 Report show, and as is inherent in the Treaty, there is no longer any subjection of this State to England. It seems to me an extraordinary thing that the one nation with which we are not to have goodwill is the one it would be most practical to have it with.</P>

      <P>Expressions of goodwill towards everybody except where you could show it most effectively!  There is great hesitancy to co-operate, to show friendliness. There is great hesitancy also, I might say, to acknowledge anything in the nature of goodwill or co-operation.  Is the root of that hesitancy patriotism or Irish-Irelandism?  Nothing of the kind.  Where it has a good solid foundation it simply springs from the centuries of subjection.  It is the centuries of subjection living along in the souls of a good many people into the present.  It is an unconscious belief on their part that our civilisation and our nationalism are really inferior things to English civilisation and English nationalism.  This is the root cause of all the fearfulness with which an approach to good relations between the two countries is always greeted.  It is pointed out in the 1926 Report that each nation will judge as to the extent of its co-operation, and in this Report you have various suggested methods of co-operating.  It is suggested, for instance, as regards merchant shipping, as regards citizenship, that there should be uniform legislation. It is not pointed out that there must be.  There is no agreement to that effect.  What is pointed out is that there are certain advantages in that for everybody, and co-operation along these lines is recommended.  But it is for every Government and every Parliament to decide the limits of that co-operation. And remember we are free, so far as this Constitution is concerned, to declare that we will not co-operate at all.  But as long as we do determine to co-operate, as long as we do determine to observe the Treaty, there are certain relations between us and the other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and it is only proper that we should acknowledge their existence.  Morally and legally we are bound by the Treaty.  We may repudiate that obligation, but remember when we do repudiate it we repudiate an international agreement.  How are <Col N="2113" /> we going to get the dispute settled? Are we going to go before the International Court?</P>

      <P>I am doing nothing of the kind.  I should never undertake such an impossible task as that.  If the Deputy would read the 1926 Report he would see that it is acknowledged that such a task is impossible. The removal of anomalies from our point of view is a national gain.  Anomalies, whether they affect us or affect Dominion status, are irritants as long as they are there, and the laws, customs and institutions that are in conflict with that root principle will have to go, or else they will be the cause of ill-will and irritation. Therefore, it is to the advantage of all the members of the Commonwealth <Col N="2114" /> that they should go.  I have urged that the Treaty was a living thing capable of development.  The same thing holds true of the 1926 document.  There was a great dispute in the various countries of the world, I remember, when that document first came out.  Some people held that this was a new step forward in securing the self-assertion of the Dominion.  It was a new step forward in the constitutional development of the relations existing between the British Commonwealth of Nations. That was one view; the other view was that it was merely a statement of the existing relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reality those who are familiar with the constitutional development in different countries know that there is no conflict between these two different points of view.  This holds true especially of the neighbouring country from which, not our country but other countries developed, Australia especially, New Zealand, to some extent South Africa and to some extent Canada.  One of the great figments, so to speak, of securing development constitutionally, as everybody knows, is the pretence of stating what is the fact. That is one of the ways of moving forward in the constitutional development of England.  A pretended statement of existing facts very often may be in itself a very determined and a very definite advance.  As I say, that is practically one of the best known things about the constitutional development of that particular country, England, from which most of these countries derived, not South Africa altogether, not Canada altogether, but certainly New Zealand and, to a large extent, Australia. Remember this, that the 1926 document, no more than the Treaty, did not take the set of circumstances then existing and fix them for all time.  Neither does this document.  There is always development, and we must always be anxious that the development takes place in the precise direction we want, in accordance with our national ambitions and our national interests. Apart from the declaration of principle, the root principle of these two <Col N="2115" /> conferences, the important thing in the 1926 Report and the 1929 Report is that you have a unanimous declaration in favour of constitutional principles that suit us, a unanimous declaration by all the Dominions of the British Commonwealth of Nations.  That, I hold, is sufficient reason for asking this House to approve of the document as a whole. I have already spoken of what I consider the significance of Part II of this document.  It is useful, not merely as a résume but as an official interpretation, so far as emphasis is concerned, of the document of 1926.  Not only that, but I may point out to those who are anxious to raise other questions, that it sets forth what the agenda for this Conference was.  Certain things were not referred to this Conference.  For instance, appeals to the Judical Committee of the Privy Council were not one of the matters referred to this Conference for solution.  If the Deputies refer to the 1926 document they will find that that very important question, specially raised by the Free State, was deferred to the next Imperial Conference which is to sit in the fall of this year.</P>
    <P>The next matter I might refer to is the question of disallowance.  A certain amount of controversy went on during the speech of Deputy O'Connell about the legal and constitutional position.  It was hard for one to follow the interruptions and answers, I must say I should not like to bind anybody either to the interruptions or answers.  There is an important difference between the legal and the constitutional position. Take the most striking case that we know of&mdash;the King in England. Legally, the King could exercise a veto on Bills passed by the House of Commons and the House of Lords.  In practice, to do so, as everybody knows, would constitute a constitutional revolution.  That is one of the most striking instances of the difference between a constitutional principle and what is the mere legal aspect of the matter.  You will find here also in the question of disallowance an interesting instance of <Col N="2116" /> the conflict between the legal position, so far as the principle of disallowance is concerned and the constitutional position.  I say that from our point of view, even though the interest we have in the matter may be academic, there is no loss, but there is a gain in having the Dominion status as a whole cleared up and having that particular appendix survival in the biological sense of the word got rid of.  I might also say that it is interesting from another point of view, because this document itself shows that certain of the bonds, if I may put it that way, that still bind some of the Dominions do not apply to us.  You have instances here in the Report itself where certain legal provisions apply to other Dominions, but do not apply to the Irish Free State.  That in itself is a rather important thing to have brought out, because it does emphasise the point I mentioned in the beginning, to which Deputy O'Connell also called attention, namely, that in 1921 we did get something more than the ordinary Dominion status.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy has not been asleep.  That is, so far as disallowance is concerned. There was a matter referred to by Deputy O'Kelly, which was also referred to outside this House, and which it might be no harm to say a few words about: that is, the Colonial Stocks Act. Deputy O'Kelly was quite right.  So far as we are concerned, as we are free, as England exercises no dominion over us, we can exercise no dominion over England.  England is entitled and within her right, as Deputy O'Kelly magnanimously acknowledged, to fix whatever conditions she likes for investments to fulfil it they are to be included in her list of trustee securities. One of the conditions she does fix is this particular one here. May I point out that other States like New Zealand if they like, can submit to this particular condition. That is, when New Zealand raises a <Col N="2117" /> national loan, all the laws dealing with it, especially those interfering with the rights of investors, shall be subject to disallowance.  She can do that; she also is free.  We cannot compel New Zealand, for instance, to enjoy to the full the liberty that we in other Dominions have.  But, in the same way, as Deputy O'Kelly pointed out, we are entitled, if it suits us, if it is in the interests of the people of this country, to put exactly the same provision or any other provision in reference to English investments in force.  That is quite true.  What we have to look after is, whether or not it suits us. It is quite possible that at present it may not suit Great Britain to have Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, or Australia borrowing money in London.  Deputies may have noticed the other day that there was a strong protest from Mr. Scullin, of Australia, against this particular provision that Australian loans have to fulfil if they are to be admitted to the list of trustee securities.</P>
      <P>As to the question of reservation, the recommendations are quite clear.  There was a certain amount of controversy also as regards one particular clause of this reservation, which says:</P>
      <P>Applying the principles laid down in the Imperial Conference Report of 1926, it is established first that the powers of discretionary reservation, if exercised at all, can only be exercised in accordance with the constitutional practice of the Dominion governing the exercise of the powers of the Governor-General; secondly, that His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom will not advise His Majesty the King to give the Governor-General any instructions to reserve Bills presented to him for assent.</P>
      <P>Is there any objection to these two points?  There can be none.  Our constitutional practice is that the Governor-General is advised, and advised only by the Executive Council. That is the established practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2118" /> Thirdly, as regards the signification of the King's pleasure concerning a reserved Bill, that it would not be in accordance with the constitutional practice for advice to be tendered to His Majesty by His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom against the views of the Government of the Dominion concerned.</P>
    <P>That third condition cannot arise so far as we are concerned, because no Bill can be reserved by the King without our consent.  There is no compulsory reservation so far as we are concerned.  Therefore, the third condition can never arise as far as we are concerned.</P>
    <P>Running right through this Report, it is possible to see the immense development that has taken place so far as other Dominions are concerned from the old Colonial status to the Dominion status of the year 1930.  At one time there may have been reason for certain restrictions. At a time when England ran the whole foreign policy of her unified Empire, when there was unitary control, there was some reason for the judges in the different Colonies, as they then were, deciding that Acts of the Colonies had not extra-territorial effect, because if they gave them extra-territorial effect they felt they might be cutting across what was the policy of the Imperial Government.  All that is done away with.  There is no longer a unitary control.  It is no longer the fact that the foreign policy of the British Commonwealth of Nations is conducted by the Foreign Office of Great Britain alone.  That is done away with.  Hence there is no point any longer, even for Great Britain, in denying extra-territorial effect to laws of the various Dominion Parliaments.</P>
    <P>Again, so far as we are concerned, we may have our own view as to what the application of the Colonial Laws Validity Act is; as to whether or not our laws have extra-territorial effect.  But the main thing is that we have now got the acknowledgment of the representatives of all the Dominions specially sent over <Col N="2119" /> for the purpose of discussing these matters, that our view is the view accepted by the whole lot of them. The history of the Colonial Laws Validity Act here is itself a rather interesting illustration of the development that has taken place in the course of the last century or half century from the Colonial status at one end to the Dominions status at the other.  Because, remember the Colonial Laws Validity Act was passed for the purpose of increasing the powers of the Colonies as they then were, whereas now in the twentieth century the Colonial Laws Validity Act, so far as it was effective, would have cut across the liberties that the Dominions already enjoy.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that so far as the Colonial Laws Validity Act is concerned, a Dominion may, if it so wills, still apply English legislation to itself.  To do so may not be the high water mark of Dominion status. It is impossible for us to do it.  We have no machinery to do it, unless we change our Constitution in this particular regard.  But I wish the Deputies would remember this: that we cannot force other bodies to rise to the same height of enjoyment of Dominion status as we have ourselves. Australia, for instance, instead of passing laws of her own&mdash; and she may have difficulty, owing to her Constitution, in passing laws of her own&mdash;may find it convenient, just as Messrs.  Little and Briscoe would have found it convenient, to apply the Colonial Laws Validity Act, finding it would be handy for them if it were decided that certain laws passed in Great Britain should, ipso facto, have effect here.  I fear if the Party opposite gets into power there would be a tendency in that direction, so far as we can judge from some of the specimens of legislation that they have, up to the present, submitted to this House.</P>
    <P>There were in the year 1929 two remarkable happenings.  One was the signature of the Optional Clause and the particular line that the Free State took up in that connection. We exercised our full independence <Col N="2120" /> in the matter.  No one can deny that.  We did it without reservation, as some of the biggest nations in Europe did.  Where reservations were put in by some of the other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, I asked Deputies to examine both the reservations, and, at the same time, the declarations made accompanying these reservations by the signatories, because they contain a very interesting application so far as our status is concerned.  The declaration was then made for what it was worth; we did not want it, but it was just as well that it should go before the world. It was made by the English Foreign Secretary, who declared there was no doubt that we were full international units, and a similar declaration was made having pretty much the same effect by the representative of South Africa, and, to a certain extent, by the representative of Canada.</P>
    <P>I was not convinced by the arguments put forward by Deputy O'Connell, and I was rather surprised that he and his Party would have to vote against the adoption of this resolution, because they have a theoretical objection to the House being asked to approve of this policy or because they do not agree with everything in it.  They prefer, as Deputy O'Connell so clearly put it, not to commit themselves, one way or another, so far as this Report is concerned, and to discuss it, but not to have to take up a definite attitude either of acceptance or rejectment.  If a report is the result of negotiations, you take it as a whole or leave it as a whole.  If you go into negotiations determined that you are not going to agree to anything except you get everything, you will not have any result from these negotiations.</P>
    <P>I know perfectly well that members of the Labour Party did yeoman work so far as the Treaty is concerned, and did it in the troubled times, and I am perfectly aware that there are many members of that party out-and-out supporters of the Treaty. I am quite willing to make that concession to them, but I suggest that <Col N="2121" /> the views and actions they took on the Treaty do not accord with their attitude on matters of this kind, when they take up, to a certain extent, the attitude of leaving it there &mdash;an attitude which by no stretch of the imagination, could be called an attitude based on the Treaty position. The underlying assumption, certainly in 1926, and to a slight extent in Deputy O'Connell's speech to-day, was that before this Report our status was there, claimed not merely by ourselves, and believed not merely by ourselves but acknowledged by everybody, and that this Report throws doubt on the matter.  I hold that that is not anything like a fair representation of the case so far as this Report is concerned.  I think if you look at the 1926 document, and the 1929 document which is a corollary to the 1926 document, you will see that they do represent a very definite advance in the recognition of the claims that we have made.  It is perfectly free for the House to say we do not want them, to do precisely what Deputy O'Kelly said the British Government might do.  The House, of course, in this, as in all other things is free to decide on its own best judgment, but might I suggest that any hesitation in giving the approval of this House to this Report shows no very great faith in the strength and stamina of Irish nationalism.  I suggest, with all respect, you cannot take up the position of not having a definite attitude in big matters of this kind.  The very refusal to make a decision is very often itself the worst kind of decision.</P>

      <P>The work done by our delegates to the Imperial Conference in 1926 and 1929 introducing these two documents was tremendous.  It was very hard work on the part of our delegates to try and get an agreed Report, which was satisfactory from our point of view from the representatives of six nations all with different interests and all, to a certain extent, with different points of view.  It is only the inexperienced who would be inclined to under-rate these particular difficulties <Col N="2123" /> that were encountered and that, I hold, were completely overcome so far as our delegation was concerned.</P>
      <P>I do not like that tendency.  I do not like it, first of all, because it is wrong.  It is not true to facts in the first place, and secondly, it is unsound politically and nationally always to betlittle anything we get, always to belittle agreements we make, and always to examine with a fearful eye as to what will occur, undeterred by the fact that previous similar doubts were proved by events, so far as events have been able to testify up to the present, to have been altogether without foundation. I say that an attitude of that kind nationally can do nothing but harm.  Remember if a definite advance has been made, even from the point reached in 1921, it has been made in the teeth of opposition, and in the teeth of large sections belittling the efforts and the advances made.  I would ask the House to consider this document as a whole, to consider the whole spirit of the document and the spirit and the principles that animate it.  Every line of it, and every recommendation in it can bear the closest examination.  It is good as a whole and it is good in its parts.  It is a big triumph for that principle of non-subordination clearly enunciated in the Dominions Report of 1926.  Now we have the co-operative of the Commonwealth of Nations, in which no nation has any administrative or executive or legislative function subordinated to any other.</P>

      <P>As for the Colonial Laws Validity Act, it either does not apply to us or will be repealed. What legislative control whatsoever can even the most diehard of the opponents of the Irish settlement in England claim exists any longer in the English Parliament? There is no good in criticising this Report for the things that are not in it.  There is nothing to criticise in this Report when the constitutional <Col N="2124" /> principles laid down, and the recommendations in it are legally carried into effect.  There is still a question of the judicial appeal to the Privy Council to be taken up.  That is definitely scheduled for the next Imperial Conference.  I would like the Deputies to indicate what anomalies still remain for settlement. The Government will be quite willing that those anomalies also, if they actually exist, will be taken up and dealt with along the lines of these same principles that have already proved themselves triumphant over the various anomalies to which reference is made.  I would like to know what vestiges of external control now remain? There is no supremacy.  If I may quote from an American constitutional writer&mdash;the President of Harvard University&mdash;looking on these matters from the point of view of an outsider, it may interest the House.</P>
      <P>Summing up the 1926 document which is carried to completion in this Report of the 1929 Conference he says: &ldquo;States bound together in an association of any kind without a common organ of government must, in the nature of things, be legally and politically independent, because the very definition of independence is not being subject wholly or in part to any control by an external authority.&rdquo;  There is no administrative machinery and no legislative machinery after this Report which suggests that we are in any way subordinate to Great Britain any more than Great Britain is subordinate to us.  The Colonial Laws Validity Act is dead.  As I say, all doubts should be removed and not merely in the minds of the people of this country&mdash;where there are many people too willing to doubt.  We have doubters from the extreme end on both sides.  It is extraordinary how they always coincide.  We have the extremists in both camps&mdash;in this country and in England.  But we confidently appeal to the House for support for this Resolution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been said of the Report of the 1926 Conference <Col N="2125" /> that every important statement contained in it was capable of at least two interpretations.  It is quite obvious from the speeches that we have just heard from the Minister for Education and from the Minister for External Affairs that the number of interpretations which can be put upon every important recommendation in this Report is infinite.  The Minister has appealed to us not to belittle these agreements.  I am prepared to take his advice.  I am prepared to look at the declaration of the 1926 Conference and the recommendations of the 1929 Conference with a magnifying glass.  In other words I am prepared to take the Minister's definition of these declarations and recommendations. The Minister declines to give us an outline of the Constitution of the British Empire, but he did refer us to the paragraph in the Report of the 1926 Conference which defined its composition.  The relationship of the United Kingdom and the Dominions is stated as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;They are autonomous units within the British Empire equal in status and in no way subordinate one to another in any respect of their domestic or external affairs though united by the common allegiance to the Crown and freely associated as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will confess I do not know exactly what that means.  The British Government, through Lord Balfour, declared, in 1926, that equality of status was not to be taken as meaning equality of function. However, as the Minister has asked us not to belittle that declaration but to accept his interpretation of it, I will turn to the statement made by the Minister for External Affairs last June when interpreting that 1926 declaration.  The Minister said: &ldquo;Our membership of that Association of States called the Commonwealth of Nations is that of a completely independent State, freely associated with other members and co-equal in status with them.&rdquo;  Before going on to examine the implications that follow from that definition of our membership of the <Col N="2126" /> British Empire, it might be apposite to comment upon the absence of the prominent members of the Independent Party who usually take a fairly active part in the affairs of this House.  I wonder is their absence from the House during the course of this debate a matter of any great significance?  Do they accept the Minister's definition of the composition of the British Empire?  Do they approve of the aims of the Government in relation to the Empire?  If not, how do they propose to vote when this matter comes to be decided?</P>
    <P>The definition of the Empire given by the Minister for External Affairs and stated by him to have been given in the Report of the Imperial Conference in 1926, if correct, means, in the first place, that as we are freely associated with other parts of the Empire, so also are we free to disassociate ourselves from them. Does the Minister admit that conclusion, or has he succeeded in getting from the British Government an admission that that conclusion is correct? If we are freely associated, then we are free to secede.  There can be no other meaning attached to the use of the word &ldquo;freely&rdquo; in that connection.  I am prepared to take the Minister's statement as being absolutely correct.  I am prepared to assume that he has got from Britain an admission that we are freely associated with Britain in the British Empire, because the obvious interpretation of that statement is that we are free at any time to leave the British Empire again.</P>

      <P>According to the Minister. the British Empire represents a number of international units freely associated in a Commonwealth, the symbol of their association being their common allegiance to the British Crown.  I hope I am not misinterpreting the Minister in any way, but those are the exact words he used as far as I recollect them.  If they are bound together only by a common allegiance to the Crown, the existence of a Treaty between any two of the units does not and cannot alter that position.  The Minister for Education told us that the Treaty of 1921 is not a dead document.  If the Minister's definition of the British Empire is a correct one, the Treaty of 1921 is not merely dead, it is obsolete.  It could be repudiated either by us or by the British Government without altering the Constitution of the British Empire, as defined by the Minister, in any way whatever.  If we break the Treaty it merely means that the Treaty has ceased to be operative. There are not provided in the Treaty any penalties to be inflicted upon the Party breaking it.  If it is broken it merely ceases to be operative, and any attempt on the part of the British Government to impose a penalty upon the Irish Free State consequent on the breaking of the Treaty would be at variance with the powers of that Government as defined in the Constitution of the British Empire outlined by the Minister. I am prepared to take the Minister's definition of the Empire as accurate.  I hope he has succeeded in getting from the British Government an admission that his interpretation is the true one, because if he has, it means that all the issues that have for the past nine years divided <Col N="2128" /> our people are dead; they have no live interest whatever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>However, despite the unexpected support which I am receiving from Deputy O'Sullivan, I am not inclined to accept the Minister's definition of the British Empire as the correct one.  The particular paragraph in the Report of the Imperial Conference of 1926 upon which the Minister's definition was based was very carefully worded so as to make it possible for him to give one interpretation here while another interpretation was available for use in England.  It is quite obvious from the speech we have just heard from the Minister that the majority of the recommendations contained in this Report have been similarly drafted to admit of that dual interpretation. The Minister told us that we receive certain advantages from our association with the British Commonwealth of Nations.  He said that there were two particular advantages but I do not recollect that he told us what these were.  He did mention the advantage enjoyed by Saorstát citizens in so far as they were able to avail of the services of British Consuls when travelling abroad.  No doubt that is a considerable advantage.  But surely there must be some more substantial reason why we should continue to be associated with the British Commonwealth of Nations if, as the Minister has told us, we are free to leave it. Castlereagh made a much better argument for the Union than the Minister did.  I would advise the Minister to look back over the debates of the Irish Parliament of 1800 and read the speeches made by the advocates of the Union before he next comes to this House to teach us the advantages that our association with the British Empire confers.  If he does he will learn a number of new arguments which he does not appear to have thought of.  In so far as the 1926 Conference got the British Government to give its approval to a definition of the <Col N="2129" /> Empire which was capable of the interpretation which the Minister has put on it, it represented a diplomatic victory for the Free State delegates.</P>

      <P>The actual declaration has been criticised on several grounds.  It denies our nationality and it is, of course, at variance with the facts, but I say deliberately that as the Free State delegates did get that declaration, ambiguous and all as it is, accepted by the British Government, they are entitled to congratulate themselves upon the work they have performed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told us last June that he was going over to this Experts Conference to discuss the formal amendment or modification or repeal of enactments still on the Statute Book of the United Kingdom which were inconsistent with the existing legislative powers of the Members of State Parliaments.  &ldquo;Our purpose,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is that whatever remnants there may be of the old order of Imperial control will be removed and the last legal vestige of that organisation, now superseded, swept away. The entire legal framework of the old system of central rule is to be taken away and never put together again.&rdquo;  The Minister has asked us to show by reference to this Report whether or not he has achieved that object.  I have no doubt that the Minister went to London anxious to achieve those objects.  I have no doubt that he did his best at the Conference to sweep away the last remnant of this old order of Imperial control.  I can understand his coming here pretending that he did so. In fact, the Minister was not as capable a negotiator as his predecessor who attended the 1926 Conference. He secured certain concessions from the British by surrendering the principles which his predecessor in 1926 succeeded in establishing. If the Minister had succeeded in getting the complete abolition of the last vestige of the organisation that existed in the past we would have in this Report a declaration <Col N="2130" /> that the Parliament of one part of the Empire has no right to legislate in any way for any other part.  Is that in the Report, and, if not, why not?  Is it stated definitely in the Report that the Parliament of Britain has no right to legislate for the Irish Free State or for Canada, Australia, New Zealand or South Africa?  I asked the Minister, by way of interjection, when he was speaking, to tell me the paragraph in the Report in which that statement was contained.  He referred me to paragraph 57, the first sentence of which states:</P>
    <P>If the above recommendations are adopted, the acquisition by the Parliaments of the Dominions of full legislative powers will follow as a necessary consequence&mdash;</P>
    <P>the very paragraph to which Deputy O'Connell referred and which the Minister stated did not concern the Free State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Then we will take it that it does in part.  The Minister referred me to that sentence when I asked where it was stated that the Parliament of Britain had no right to legislate for the Free State.  &ldquo;If the above recommendations are adopted the acquisition by the Parliaments of the Dominions of full legislative powers will follow as a necessary consequence.&rdquo;  If the Minister had secured what he stated he set out to secure we would also find in the Report a declaration that <Col N="2131" /> a Government of one part of the Empire has no power&mdash;no right&mdash;to advise the Crown in respect of measures passed in another part.  Is that in the Report and if not, why not?  Let us take the Report and see what it says.</P>
      <P>In respect of the power of disallowance the Conference agrees that the present constitutional position is that the power of disallowance can no longer be exercised in relation to Dominion legislation.</P>
      <P>I admit that those who went to the Conference for the purpose of sweeping away the last vestige of the old order succeeded in getting the substance, but they got it by surrendering the principle.  It is not stated there that the power of disallowance does not exist.  That should be stated if the declaration of the 1926 Conference had any meaning.  Similarly we find an identical reference to the power of reservation.  Again the words used are as follow:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The powers of discretionary reservation, if exercised at all, can only be exercised in accordance with constitutional practice in the Dominion governing the exercise of the powers of the Governor-General and that his Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom will not advise His Majesty the King to give the Governor-General any instructions to reserve Bills presented to him for assent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again the phrase used is &ldquo;will not&rdquo; and not &ldquo;has not the right.&rdquo; These are minor matters, and the other sections deal with more important matters from our point of view. In this, as in other matters, the position attained in 1926 has been definitely abandoned in return for certain positive concessions from Britain.  Before leaving this part of the Report I want to make some reference to the Colonial Stock Act. I notice that the Minister for External Affairs made no reference to it in his speech.  The Minister for Education told us that the British Government, in exercising the <Col N="2132" /> powers which it has under that Act, were merely doing something which we could do if we so chose.  That may be so, but I think that the Free State delegation went to London with the deliberate intention of persuading the British Government to surrender those powers.</P>

On the 23rd August last the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; came out with a heading that stretched across three columns of the principal page &ldquo;To challenge the British Treasury.

    <P>The continuance in force of the latter two pieces of legislation is regarded in Dublin as inconsistent with the declaration of equality which followed on the labours of the Balfour Committee at the last Conference.  If it can be shown that certain of the provisions of these Acts may be useful, machinery can easily be found to make their operation acceptable to each Government.  It is when questions like those are reached that the parties who have made the most thorough preparations reap the most advantage.  Mr. Blythe is prepared to press very hard for the repeal of the sections of the Colonial Stock Act, which he holds <Col N="2133" /> are in conflict with national sentiment. The Executive Council are solidly behind the Finance Minister in the contention that the time has arrived when the British Treasury should cease to demand a declaration from the British Government to veto legislation passed by the Oireachtas before the Saorstát can obtain loans in London which will rank as British Trustee Stock.</P>
    <P>I agree that the statement was issued on the authority of the political correspondent of the &ldquo;Independent,&rdquo; but the Minister did not contradict it.  He was about to attend a Conference in London at which matters of that kind would be discussed.</P>

      <P>I had occasion in the past to complain that the only way in which we can get information concerning the policy or the activities of the Department of External Affairs is by some process of extraction. If the Minister was anxious to ensure that public opinion would be properly informed on matters of this kind he would have contradicted a statement of that kind.  It was not published in an unimportant sheet or as a mere item of gossip on the back page.  It appeared in the paper with the biggest circulation in the country.  It was spread over three columns of its principal news page, and the Minister did not think fit to contradict it, even though he knew a large number of the citizens of the country would be misled by it as to the functions which the Free State delegates to the London Conference were going to perform.</P>

      <P>We now come to the question contained in Part IV of the Report.  It is recommended here that a declaratory enactment should be passed with the consent of the Dominions by the Parliament of the United Kingdom to the effect that the Parliament of a Dominion has full power to make laws having extra-territorial operation.  Is it the contention of the Government that that declaration by the British Parliament is necessary to ensure that the Free State will have power to make laws with extra-territorial operation?  Does not the fact that the Minister agreed to the recommendation that the British Parliament should enact a measure of that kind mean that he also agreed that the 1926 declaration, about which he made so much noise, was inaccurate and that co-equality is, in fact, in the gift of the British Parliament?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the 1926 declaration was capable of the interpretation which the Minister put on it, the <Col N="2135" /> Free State and other Dominions had that power in 1926.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Dominions are autonomous, if they are equal in status and in no way subordinate one to the other, then obviously the British Parliament has no right or power to pass legislation either affecting the legislative position of Dominions or conferring additional legislative powers on the Dominions. That is the obvious meaning of the 1926 declaration, the obvious meaning of the Minister's interpretation of that declaration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see that it does.  Obviously the attitude of the 1926 Conference was that the various units of the British Dominions had co-equal status, each exercising full legislative powers over its own affairs.  There exists on the Statute Book of the British Parliament certain Acts which purport to give the British Government power to legislate in Dominion matters.  These Acts of the British Parliament are obsolete.  The fact that the British Government cares to keep them on the Statute Book does not interest us.  The fact that it should think fit to disencumber the Statute Book and repeal these Acts should not interest us.  They are matters that should not interest us according to the Minister, and according to the declaration of the 1926 Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not an authority on constitutional law like Deputy Byrne.  What is the Minister's interpretation of this declaration which the Parliament of the United <Col N="2136" /> Kingdom has been asked to make? &ldquo;It is hereby declared and enacted that the Parliament of a Dominion has full power to make laws having extra-territorial operation.&rdquo;  The Minister has emphasised the &ldquo;has&rdquo; in that declaration.  He obviously intends to convey that the Parliament of a Dominion had that power always.  Why, therefore, should we be concerned whether or not the British Parliament passes a declaratory enactment of that kind? The same thing applies to the Colonial Laws Validity Act.  According to the 1926 Conference that Act is obsolete, not capable of being put into operation.  Yet we have the Free State sending a delegate to the Conference in London, signing a report dealing with the terms of the enactment which is to be passed by the British Parliament for the purpose of repealing that obsolete Act. The paragraph dealing with the Colonial Laws Validity Act which the Minister has signed means that the Minister has admitted the right of the Parliament of the United Kingdom to define and delimit the powers of the Parliament of the Irish Free State.  The Minister has told us that one of the recommendations of this Conference is, in his opinion, unconstitutional.  That is the recommendation contained in paragraph 54.  That is co-equality.  I wonder if the Minister will consider passing a Bill through this Dáil to declare that the Parliament of Great Britain has full powers to make laws having extra-territorial operation. We are co-equal.  If the Parliament of the United Kingdom can pass a law declaring that we have the power to make laws having extra-territorial operation, we, to assert our co-equality, should pass an Act declaring that the Parliament of the United Kingdom has equal power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extraordinary that this conference decided that these declaratory enactments are only to be passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom.  I suggest that the reason why the Conference did not recommend otherwise in its Report is because every one attending that Conference knew that all this talk about <Col N="2137" /> co-equality is so much humbug.  It suits the Minister to use that argument here because he knows that there exists in this country a majority who desire to see Ireland co-equal with every other nation on the earth.  It is because he knows that the national aspirations of our people are towards independence that he finds it necessary to dress the policy of his Government in this camouflage of co-equality.  I am quite certain that the Minister himself does not believe that the British Government had any intention whatever of giving to the declaration of the 1926 Conference the interpretation which the Minister gives it in this House.  The conflict between the principles of 1926 and the proposals of 1929 are a necessary consequence of the attempt to get acceptance of a false statement of the position.</P>
    <P>The recommendations concerning merchant shipping are mainly unobjectionable but it is to be noted both in relation to merchant shipping and to the definition of nationality that the Conference steered a wide course of the rocks.  The principal item which should have come up for consideration at that Conference, in my opinion, was the status of a national of the Free State or of shipping registered in the Free State in the event of any other part of the Empire being engaged at war.  Of course I forget that the Conference came to a remarkable decision in this connection.  I must again quote the correspondent of the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo;, but before doing so I will point out that the statement, which received publicity equal to the other statement I quoted, was not contradicted.  It is a different correspondent this time.  I will quote the London Correspondent of the &ldquo;Independent.&rdquo;  The statement contained the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Three years ago the statesmen attending the Imperial Conference were disturbed by the atmosphere of international discontent which prevailed, and the late Mr. Kevin O'Higgins, supported by General Hertzog (South Africa), and Mr. Mackenzie King (Canada), raised <Col N="2138" /> the question of the status of Commonwealth shipping, and, indeed, the very position of the nations themselves in the event of a major war involving Britain.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Higgins laid it down that each Government should be completely free to declare its attitude, and this was accepted in principle.</P>
    <P>Now this is the startling announcement which the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; described as a dramatic decision.</P>
    <P>The Conference has decided that, as war has been outlawed by international agreement, and that as steps are being taken by the Great Powers to reduce armaments and arrive at understandings, it was only fitting that it should make a contribution by excluding from its deliberations items on the agenda which proposed to define certain conditions in the event of Great Britain engaging in war with a Great Power.</P>
    <P>The question came up in connection with discussion arising out of proposals to amend the Merchant Shipping Act.</P>
    <P>It goes further than that.</P>

      <P>I was going to remark that I could not comment on that particular paragraph in Parliamentary language, because anyone who could swallow that should not be in any Parliament.  But according to the political correspondent of the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; the Minister did more than swallow it:</P>
      <P>Mr. McGilligan, I understand, was the foremost mover in this bold stroke of policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2139" /> It is recognised that he is making a big contribution to the work of the Conference, and that his colleagues at the gathering should be found mentioning his name freely, notwithstanding the general secrecy which is being observed regarding the proceedings, is something which should cause his fellow-countrymen to feel pleased at the able manner in which they are being represented.</P>
    <P>When I read that, I thought of the story of the rustic who was brought up to the Zoological Gardens for the first time.  He was shown a lion and a tiger and a bear, and he said nothing; he was shown a giraffe and he said: &ldquo;I do not believe it, there aint no such animal.&rdquo;  When the Minister's colleagues at the Imperial Conference were found freely mentioning his name, I am sure it was to that effect, that they could not believe it, that there was not any such animal, that is if the Minister was, in fact, responsible for this proposal. In any case, the Report contains nothing about the status of our nationals when Britain is at war.</P>

However, I will take it that the Minister, not having contradicted this statement, is unable to do so.  The Report, as I say, contains no reference to the status of the nationals of the Free State, or of the shipping registered in the Free State in the event of Britain being at war.</P>

I think the Minister has only himself to blame if the <Col N="2141" /> criticism of his Department is not fully informed.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, by the Terms of Reference as defined by the 1926 Conference, that the matter of the Privy Council could not be raised, but these things are often changed by agreement.  Not merely were the people here under the impression that the matter of the Privy Council would be raised at this Conference but apparently General Hertzog was under the same impression, judging by a report that appeared in the &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; on the 3rd October:</P>
      <P>A resolution urging the abolition of appeals to the Privy Council evoked a spirit of discussion to-day at the annual congress of the Transvaal Nationalist Party.  General Hertzog, Prime Minister, while emphasising South Africa's unquestioned right to abolish such appeals, pointed out that this and similiar questions would be considered at the Imperial Conference which would meet in London shortly and at which all the Dominions would be represented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2142" /> I have at least half-a-dozen different cuttings from various newspapers all to the effect that the Minister was going to London for the express purpose of raising this question of appeals to the Privy Council.  Not merely did these statements appear in the ill-informed &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; and &ldquo;Irish Times,&rdquo; but they appeared in the semi-official organ of Cumann na nGaedheal, the leading articles in which are generally inspired by Ministers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire to suppress them at all.  The &ldquo;Star&rdquo; of 31st August stated: &ldquo;The Irish delegates will aim at the abolition of the system which permits appeals from Supreme Courts in the various free Dominions to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.&rdquo;  On the 24th August it stated: &ldquo;The right of appeal to the Privy Council will be abolished, either formally or by the imposition of conditions impossible of fulfilment.&rdquo;  And it stated specifically that that matter would be settled next October.  That is the official organ of Cumann na nGaedheal.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Connell raised a matter that is, I think, of considerable importance, and I would like the Minister to deal with it before the debate concludes.  He stated that there was a danger that this Imperial Conference would develop into a sort of Empire Parliament, and that no one-appeared to be working more vigorously in that direction than the Free State Government.  There does appear to be justification for that statement of Deputy O'Connell.  I would like if the Minister would define the attitude of the Executive towards the Imperial Conference in regard to a number of proposals that appeared in English newspapers recently to the effect that a step in that direction should be taken, if not by keeping the Imperial Conference in permanent session, at least by the establishment of a permanent secretariat in London.  Is the Government favourable to that proposal? Has the Minister noticed the proposition put forward by the Federation of British Industries to the effect that the next Imperial Conference should be asked to consider the setting up of an Imperial Trade Conference of an investigatory, advisory, and non-political nature, of persons nominated by each Government, but acting in their personal capacity, to consider, amongst other <Col N="2145" /> matters, the question of Imperial trade with a view to laying down a sound basis for an Imperial economic policy?</P>
      <P>There seems to be reason to believe that the progress of recent years has been in the direction of the establishment of an Empire Parliament to deal with matters that are common to the various units of the Empire.  I would like if the Minister would tell us the Government policy in that matter, if the Government's policy has been determined.  As Deputy O'Connell stated, the delegates who attended at these Conferences from the Irish Free State did appear, judging from Press reports at any rate, to be working more vigorously in that direction than the delegates from any other part of the Empire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In the debate on the Optional Clause I asked the Minister a number of questions which he very carefully avoided answering.  He has defined the British Empire as a group of independent units associated in the Commonwealth, bound together by their common allegiance to the British Crown.  Personally, I hope that that definition of the Empire has been accepted by the representatives of all parts of it, because if so our bond must be a very weak one indeed, if in fact it exists at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2146" /> I ask the Minister to tell us exactly how strong the allegiance to the British Crown is in the ranks of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party or in the Executive Council.  If it does exist, which I doubt, in relation to the majority of them, at any rate, when exactly did it develop itself?  Did it develop itself this year or in 1927 or in 1926 or when?  It is there obviously.  The Minister has accepted a definition of the Empire which implies its existence here.  I can understand the Minister for Education justifying Dominion status and talking about the advantages which we get from our association with the Empire, but the Minister has, of course, no history of long association with the national movement.  The President of the Executive Council has. Will he tell us when he found swelling within his bosom this allegiance to the British Crown which is so evident in these Reports?  Is it there at all?  I doubt it.  It may be good politics for him to pretend that it is there, but I doubt if he could lay his hand on his heart and say that it is there.</P>
    <P>I should like if the Minister could tell us also why the Executive Council has not decided to dissociate the Free State from the Empire, if we are free to do so as he states.  The President was asking certain questions about the Treaty and the attitude of Fianna Fáil towards the Treaty at a recent meeting.  I do not propose to answer them, because, according to the Minister, the Treaty is obsolete, a matter of no interest whatever&mdash;no importance certainly. But what is of interest is the attitude of the Executive Council to the British Empire.  I want to be told what that attitude is.  We do not know.  I am sure the Independents want to know.  The Independents will be asked to vote for this motion. We have been told by one Minister that the Government have been all the time anxious to increase the measure of freedom which they got in 1921 and have sent delegates to these Conferences for the purpose of beating down the opposition of the British Government to their progress. <Col N="2147" /> Does that policy suit the members of the Independent Party? Are they going to support it by voting for the motion or oppose it by voting against it, or are they going to take the usual course of not voting at all in a difficult matter?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that attitude appease Fianna Fáil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not particular. We do not care whether it is passed or not.  We do not believe it is of importance.  We do want to know where everybody stands: where the Independents stand, where the Executive Council stand particularly, and what is their attitude towards the Empire?  Are they for or against it?  Are they trying to strengthen it, or trying to get out of it?  If there is a bond holding us by that association represented by our common allegiance to the British Crown, how strong is that bond? Is it the policy of Cumann na nGaedheal to strengthen it or to weaken it?  These questions should be answered.  Will the President answer them?  He is fond of asking questions; he has an opportunity now of answering a few.  If he will not answer them, I appeal to the Minister for External Affairs to do so.  He failed to do so on the last occasion, when a matter concerning his Department was being discussed. He has another opportunity now. If he avoids doing so now, it will be obviously because he has no answer to give.</P>

I am sure some Deputies would prefer that I should not quote what they stated then as to what the relations should be between this country and England.  I shall not detain the House at any length, but I wish to quote a few which are rather interesting.  &ldquo;Giving her equality of status with Great Britain&rdquo; was the phrase used by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the late President Griffith, and I think, too, by the Minister for Finance, the late General Collins.  Then we come to the statement made by a person who supported the attack on the <Col N="2149" /> Treaty and the proposed new association or relation between this country and England on that occasion. He said &ldquo;Every commission which any and every officer of the Irish Army will get will be signed by the King and the Governor-General.&rdquo; It would appear that that is not so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GearoidOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not say cowardly.  The Labour Party, it would appear from their Leader's speech, would seem to fear that anything that the British Parliament should desire to state in an Act of Parliament at present with regard to the extent of the autonomy which the Dominions should possess, would be hurtful&mdash;I do not like to use the old word derogatory&mdash;to the status of the Irish Free State.  Any Act passed by the British Parliament giving away from the British House powers which they say they may not take again, will in no way interfere with the freedom which we in the Free State always claim we possessed since the Treaty was ratified in 1922.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good deal of point has been made upon matters with regard to the powers of discretionary reservation. I asked Deputy Lemass if he would <Col N="2154" /> read Section 35 and see what it said as regards reservations.  Here is the section:&mdash;&ldquo;As regards the continued existence of the power of reservation, certain Deminions possess the power by amending their Constitutions to abolish the discretionary power and to repeal any provisions requiring reservation of Bills dealing with particular subjects, and it is, therefore, open to those Dominions to take the prescribed steps to that end if they so desire.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As has been stated, in the Saorstát which is governed by its own Constitution, the power of compulsory reservation never existed.  The point of view of Fianna Fáil in their objection to this is very difficult to understand.  Fianna Fáil refuses to say whether or not it accepts the Constitution.  If it accepts the Constitution, it should refer to those Articles of the Constitution which deal with the legislative authority in this country.  It is rather a difficult subject for any particular member of the Fianna Fáil Party to deal with or even for any particular shadow Minister of the Fianna Fáil Party to deal with, in view of the difference of opinion amongst themselves as to what is their attitude towards the Constitution and towards the Treaty.  I submit, sir, that I have a perfect right to refer to the differences of opinion as to their attitude on the Treaty.  I am anxious to help that unfortunate Party out of their difficulties&mdash;difficulties into which they have fallen because of their previous statements. It is all very good for Deputy A, B, C or D in any part of the House to quote from a newspaper ten, fifteen or twenty years old, but it would appear that you suggest that I am not to quote from an official document of this House.  I do not propose to do so for a moment until I satisfy you that it is proper I should do so.  The difficulty with the Fianna Fáil Party in this House with regard to the motion before the House is that they do not know where they are.  They are afraid when their pseudo leader will come back and sit in the first Opposition seat here, or before he comes back <Col N="2155" /> that he will lash them and ask &ldquo;why did you say that?&rdquo;  or &ldquo;why did you not say this?&rdquo;  We want to hear from Irishmen here and from the representatives of the people who pretend they are Irishmen what is the attitude of Fianna Fáil towards this document?  They cannot tell us, because they do not know what their attitude towards the Treaty is. Deputy Lemass cannot answer the questions that were put to him.  They do not know what their position is in regard to the Treaty.  They come in here and possibly squirm because the Minister for External Affairs explained to them that, according to Section 77 of the Report, &ldquo;under the new position, if any change is made in the requirements established by the existing legislation, reciprocal action will be necessary to obtain this same recognition, the importance of which is manifest in view of the desirability of facilitating freedom of intercourse and the mutual granting of privileges among the different parts of the Commonwealth.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are things to which I would draw the attention of the Labour Party especially.  Does the Labour Party stand behind that? Do we here, to-night and now, know what the Labour Party accepts? Can we to-night have a show-down as to whether they stand for the Treaty?  I understand that term &ldquo;show-down&rdquo; is now accepted as a Parliamentary one. Can we have a show-down on that question from the Opposition? Should we to-night have a show-down on the question as to whether or not any and every person in the Irish Army who gets a commission gets that commission directly signed by the King and his Governor-General? Should we have a show-down on this subject as to the question of His Majesty the King being in a position to order a company of the Saorstát Army from Cork to Ballinasloe?  Should we have a show-down to-night, sir, on the question as to the north-east boundary?</P>

      <P>At the same time I want, before closing the book, to assure the Deputy, through you, sir, that I never ran away, and there are Deputies in this House who know it to their sorrow.  I take it, sir, that the objection to the motion to-night from the Fianna Fáil Party is on the grounds that at last there is a possibility that the people of Ireland would realise the extent of the freedom which they got through the Articles of Agreement signed in 1921.  That, I submit, is the chief objection to this motion.  It is possible&mdash;it has not been said here to-night&mdash;that the fatal objection to His Majesty is the word &ldquo;allegiance.&rdquo;  Everybody forgets&mdash;the person who made it forgets&mdash;that &ldquo;allegiance&rdquo; to His Majesty is allegiance to the head of the associated States.  As I said to Deputy Corry when he interrupted me, he in his time may have an opportunity to test that matter, but we all hope he will not.  We hope that his present Majesty will live <Col N="2157" /> longer than this Dáil and we all hope that Deputy Corry will not be in the next Dáil.</P>

      <P>I never bet on certainties.  I would draw the attention of members to this item in the Report:&mdash;&ldquo;Inasmuch as the Crown is the symbol of the free association of the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and as they are united by a common allegiance to the Crown, it would be in accord with the established constitutional position of all the members of the Commonwealth in relation to one another that any alteration in the law touching the Succession to the Throne or the Royal Style and Titles shall hereafter require the assent as well of the Parliaments of all the Dominions as of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Every Deputy here will have the right to speak and instruct his Minister, whatever Minister may be in power at the time.  The great objection to this motion is that at last it brings to this country a realisation of the facts, and it shows, at last, that, notwithstanding any lying statements made by Deputies or supporters of the other side during all that has been talked from 1917 onwards&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The only objection to this motion is, I submit, that an opportunity has at last been given to the people to realise how free they are, and to realise that the statements made in 1921 and 1922&mdash;&ldquo;Time will tell,&rdquo;&ldquo;You will have so-and-so doing so-and-so,&rdquo; and &ldquo;You will have a Governor-General having to do so-and-so&rdquo;&mdash;were without foundation.

      <P>I regret very much, owing to my being in the Seanad, that I was not able to be here this afternoon. I did not hear the beginning of Deputy Lemass's speech.  That speech in some ways was gratifying and in other ways rather disappointing. It was gratifying inasmuch as it seemed to imply that Deputy Lemass has moved very much in the right direction, as far as one can judge from a great many of the remarks in his speech.  On the other hand, his speech dealt practically not at all with this Report.  It was disappointing, as one always likes to see one's opponents anxious to get after the truth.  It was disappointing inasmuch as the Deputy tried to base his speech largely on newspaper reports.  When dealing with questions such as we have before us newspapers, as well as anybody else, when they come to make forecasts, are likely to make mistakes.  What is the history of the document before us?  In 1921 a Treaty was signed which this country accepted.  In the discussion over that Treaty it was perfectly obvious that there was a complete divergence of opinion as to what the effects of the Treaty would be.  I gathered from Deputy Lemass's speech that he admits that the Report of the Imperial Conference of 1926 went a large way to dissipate the fears that he had in 1922 as to what the Treaty meant.</P>
      <P>[<i>An Ceann Comhairle resumed the Chair.</i>]</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we accepted the Treaty what happened?  There was a recognised position of equality of status between the various members of the British Commonwealth.  That declaration of equality of status was, in so far as it went, satisfactory.  That equality of status has been the result of gradual growth, not of one Act.  Prior to that development there had been various Acts passed by the then Parliament of the then United Kingdom purporting to have effect in all <Col N="2160" /> the Dominions that were then subject to that Parliament.  Although one might be perfectly satisfied with a clear statement of equality, at the same time it is often necessary to make assurance doubly sure, as was instanced recently in the Dáil when I explained, with regard to the military service pensions, that we were perfectly satisfied that the position sought to be created by the Act actually existed at the time.  With regard to our position in the British Commonwealth of Nations there was, as far as status was concerned, a recognition of equality.  Nevertheless, there were, as I have many times explained, certain anomalies existing from a previous period. After the acceptance of the Treaty here we observed many forms which, although they did not, as they could not, deny the status that we possess, at the same time seemed to contain certain implications which were derogatory to that status.  In the Imperial Conference of 1926 every incident and every form that we had noticed during our time of existence as being unharmonious with our position as it was defined were brought forward, and we proposed that it had to be made perfectly clear that no deductions could be made from these forms, and that these forms should be discontinued.</P>
    <P>Deputies know very well that prior to the coming into existence of the Free State the Governor-General of the various Dominions was appointed actually by the British Government. When the Irish Free State came into existence his appointment was made really by agreement between the new Irish Government and the British Government.  The appointment made after the Imperial Conference of 1926 followed logically and fulfilled logically the status that had been brought about, and the appointment of the Governor-General was made solely upon the advice of the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>At the time of the 1926 Conference certain matters were raised which required rather careful consideration, because it might well happen that, by merely sweeping them away with one stroke of the pen, certain <Col N="2161" /> necessary things might have been contingent upon some aspect of existing arrangements which it would be very inconvenient to abolish. Therefore it was decided in regard to other matters, the result of action upon which might conceivably require further action, that they should be adjourned until there was a meeting of what was called a Conference of Experts.  I notice that Deputy Lemass seemed to think that an expert was necessarily a civil servant, and necessarily excluded a Minister.  In many of these matters Ministers are quite the best experts. Deputy Lemass seemed to be disappointed that the Conference did not deal with the question of the Privy Council.  In the Conference of 1926 the question of the Privy Council was raised, and it was agreed that the matter should be considered at the next Imperial Conference.  Other matters raised there were, it was agreed, to be considered by experts. They considered the matters referred to them, and in one or two instances, went into other matters which meanwhile were considered as advisable to be put before them.  The Colonial Stock Act was, in my opinion, hardly within the terms of reference of the 1926 Resolution, although it could be argued that it came in under paragraph 3 of the section dealing with disallowances.</P>
    <P>What has been the result of this Conference?  Long prior to the full autonomy of the Dominions, Merchant Shipping Acts had been passed, stating clearly that their legislative effects extended to the Dominions.  You might say that when the Dominions were completely autonomous there should be no question whether those Acts applied to them or not.  That is quite right, but here we have new States coming into being.  What do we want?  We want our position not merely to be perfectly sound, not merely to be unquestionable, but we want it to be unquestioned.  It might easily arise in the future that a number of matters dealt with here which other countries, international courts, and so on, might easily argue, that <Col N="2162" /> because certain Acts have been passed by Parliaments empowered to pass such Acts which have never been abrogated, therefore what is laid down in those Acts remains operative.  When it is suggested that the British Parliament should bring in certain Acts to declare that they have not certain powers over the Dominions, is that in any way derogatory to the Dominions?  There are, what you might call, renunciation Acts, although they are not renouncing anything.  They are Acts in the nature of renunciation Acts merely explaining what the position is.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass is very worried about free association, the free association of free entities.  Is this State unfree?  Deputies opposite have on many occasions gone abroad saying that this country could never prosper so long as it was controlled by another Government, and they apologised for members of this Government by assuring the people that, in doing what we did, we did so because England told us to do it.  That is not so.  In all matters relating to the Free State this Government is completely sovereign.  No British Government has attempted to say to us, &ldquo;You shall do this,&rdquo; or &ldquo;You shall not do the other thing.&rdquo;  If any British Government attempted in any way to interfere with our sovereignty we should be the very first to protest against it.  It has been suggested that there has been a tendency in Imperial Conferences to become a sort of general Commonwealth Parliament.  I can assure Deputies that since the Free State came into existence the Government have seen to it that there should not be even a suspicion of such a tendency. What are we doing to-night? There has been a certain gathering of certain State members of the British Commonwealth.  They came together, considered certain matters and made certain recommendations. Have these recommendations any effect in law?  Why are they brought here to-night?  Because, so far as this State is concerned, nobody has power to say what shall or <Col N="2163" /> shall not be except the Government of this State.  Any composite gathering of men, such as the Experts Conference or the Imperial Conference, has no power to bind the people of this country.  That is the reason the matter is brought before us this evening.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy O'Connell who seemed to think that the bringing of the matter before the Dáil tended to give a legislative reality, a legislative power, to such international gatherings which they should not have.  Quite the contrary is the fact.  If this gathering had legislative powers there would be no need to bring the matter here.  It is brought here because they have no such power.  Deputies who are afraid of a tendency towards Commonwealth control should rejoice that the matter is brought here, making it doubly clear that nobody except this Parliament has a right to say what shall or shall not be binding on the people of this country. At the same time Deputy Lemass says that if the Treaty is broken it merely ceases to be operative. There is such a thing as international relationship.  There is an instrument, more or less, regulating the relations of this State with Great Britain, for instance, and certain other States.  That is a mutual agreement.  It certainly is competent for this Parliament to declare that that agreement is no longer operative and binding.  They have that power, just as any partners have, but when that act is taken it must be taken with full advertence to the possible consequences.  Will that act be legal on the part of this Parliament?  It certainly will be. In so far as we say &ldquo;free association&rdquo; what do we mean?  We mean that, so far as the law is concerned, all communities forming the Commonwealth of Nations are perfectly autonomous, perfectly sovereign, and perfectly independent.  So far as the law is concerned they are entitled to pass any law they like affecting this, even to cut loose from the general body.  So far as the law <Col N="2164" /> is concerned that is so, but the Parliament that does that has to consider what the result would be and what would follow from that.</P>
    <P>It is a well-known fact&mdash;I do not need to name a State&mdash;that no State is really independent of other States. All international conferences which are held from time to time come from interdependence and mutual fears between States.  When there is a large State next to a small one the small State has to recognise certain facts which are inherent in its very smallness and in the relative size of the two countries.  At present, as this document states, what I might call the unifying factor is the Crown.  That is the unifying factor, and its existence enables Great Britain, if you like to talk quite bluntly, to allow freedom of action to the Government of the Irish Free State which it would probably not be possible to allow in the event of there being no such unifying factor as the Crown.  That is not a principle that applies only between Great Britain and this country.  It is a factor which is real and which is operative between similarly divergent powers, I mean powers which diverge considerably in power and interest.  It seems to me that one can say that it is competent for this Parliament to declare the Treaty abrogated, and that the Parliament in doing so will not be exceeding its legal powers.</P>
    <P>I think that the Party opposite can argue that, but that does not say that it is desirable that that should be done.  To attempt to abrogate the Treaty without agreement or notice is in itself a treacherous act.  It is not done by self-respecting States.  Secondly, we have to recognise that before this State came into existence we existed, not as a State, but as a perfectly subject people controlled by a Government outside.  In the relationship that existed thereafter in our claim to independence and sovereignty, one must recognise that pre-existing conditions would be adverted to, and that there would be a tendency to revert back to that.  Any person <Col N="2165" /> arguing that we should revert towards that would be, to some extent, strengthened by arguing that it was only by the Treaty that we became a sovereign and independent State. Deputy Lemass mentioned that this document denied our nationality and was contrary to fact.  It does not.  The only thing that I can make out that he seemed to think affected our nationality was that certain suggested acts in this document should be done by the British Parliament. These acts are not binding on the people of this country.  They are what you might call self-denying ordinances on the part of Great Britain, assuring the world that she has not the power which, as a matter of fact, she has not.  Deputy Lemass says that certain things were achieved by surrendering concessions which were obtained in 1926.</P>
    <P>I cannot see anything in this document which can be interpreted as a surrender of what was achieved in 1926.  Certain matters were referred in 1926 for the consideration of this Conference.  This Conference dealt with those matters plus the matter of the Court, plus, it may be said, the Colonial Stock Act.  Its findings have been confined to those, and those findings have all been in the direction of removing any doubt in regard to certain specific matters that might exist in regard to the competence of Dominion Governments to assert full powers.  What is the position in regard to the Colonial Stock Act?  Some Deputies think that that was an interference with our sovereignty.  The Parliament of Great Britain controls what is called Trustee Stock and says that in certain cases certain bonds or stock may be quoted as Trustee Stock. It has, I presume, a perfect right in doing that.  It says for the protection of its nationals that nothing will be declared to be Trustee Stock unless they have very considerable assurance that nationals who invest in it will have perfect security.  With regard to the Dominions, it is stated that certain loans of the Dominions may be quoted as Trustee Stock, provided <Col N="2166" /> that the British Parliament is assured that its nationals will be treated fairly.  The method they have of obtaining that assurance is that it would be limited to such instances in which the Dominion Parliaments would agree that they would do nothing contrary to the interests of British nationals, or that,  they did, they would agree beforehand that the Governor-General should reserve the Act which they propose passing to interfere with the interests of British nationals.</P>
    <P>Why do we raise that question? Our devotion and allegiance to our own country and our necessary insistence on our sovereignty and independence are such that, for no good whatever, can we agree to an outside power holding that authority which comes&mdash;if I may not offend the Party opposite&mdash;from God to this Government, which this Government cannot abrogate to any Government outside.  At the same time in the matter of raising loans, certain Dominions may agree to such things because they have not the feeling which we have in this matter, and I can conceive somebody on the London money market saying, &ldquo;The Dominion of the Irish Free State is raising a loan, Trustee Stock.&rdquo;  We say, &ldquo;No, not Trustee Stock.&rdquo;  Then they say &ldquo;Then there is something funny about it.  Why is it not the same as in the case of Canada or South Africa?&rdquo;  That may have a bad effect and we may have to pay more for our money, but is anyone going to say that our sovereignty, our independence, our integrity and our dignity demand that we should go to England and say, when we want to borrow money, that we insist that the British Government should agree that our loan should be regarded as Trustee Stock.  That is not an assertion of international independence. It is a form of Irish Imperialism.</P>
    <P>We, as a Government, have much in common with them, and are perfectly justified in going to them and saying: &ldquo;This is conceivably inconvenient to us, and we do not see that it will do you any harm or any injury <Col N="2167" /> if you agree to such loan being quoted as Trustee Stock, and at the same time, not insist that for such a privilege we should give something which you know perfectly well is incompatible with our whole national dignity.&rdquo;  Deputy Lemass misunderstood a great many things because of the difference of constitution between the various Dominions. For instance, it is very arguable, I think, whether the Colonial Laws Validity Act ever applied to this country.  Various other matters have been dealt with here applying only in different degrees to the various Dominions.  For instance, in Canada, which is a Federal State, certain things were reserved to the British Parliament, because of a fear on the part of at least one State there that they would not get impartial justice from the federal body.  They felt that Great Britain, being further removed from their party strife and immediate antagonisms, might be more inclined to give, what I might call, impartial decisions.  Therefore, certain things had to be made clear here, even when they did not affect this country at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>When this debate was adjourned on Friday last, I was urging on the Minister that charity should not be calculated in estimating the means of applicants for the purposes of old age pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was suggesting, as I do now again suggest to him, that it was manifestly unfair that sums given by way of charity should be calculated for the purposes of Section 2, sub-section 1 (d) of that Act.  It is held by the pension authorities that any sums given by way of charity amount to the enjoyment of a benefit or privilege within the meaning of <Col N="2168" /> that Act.  Whether that decision is right or wrong, and I do not agree that it is right, it is manifestly unfair and should be remedied.  If I extend the charity of shelter and food to a destitute relative or friend the position is this.  If I give that food and shelter in my own house the receipient of that relief is thereby disqualified from receiving an old age pension.  If I send the friend or relative to my gate lodge, the old age pension is paid, even though the food supplied would be the same in one case as in the other. I have before me cases in which the appeal authorities point out that an applicant is disqualified because they say she is living, although absolutely destitute of means, with a brother who has two farms, the valuation being grouped at £42. The valuation of the house in which the lady resides would not exceed £3 a year.  The house happens to be situated on a farm which is adjoining another farm.  The combined valuation of the two is £42, and she its declared disentitled to receive the old age pension.  That, I submit, is manifestly unfair and inequitable.</P>
    <P>Take the case I had before me yesterday of two old people living in a small house and entitled to receive an old age pension.  They are clothed and maintained by their son out of charity.  The son gets on a bit in the world and by borrowed means or otherwise buys a larger farm.  The old age pensioners are thereby deprived of the old age pension.  They are brought before the local committee and when a reduced pension is granted, there is also an appeal pending, suggesting that because the son has got on in the world and was able to shift them from the wretched hovel in which they lived to a house a little bit better, they are thereby rendered unfit to receive the old age pension?</P>
    <P>The other point I wish to make, which refers to a manifestly unfair regulation, is the one already re&mdash; ferred to by the other speakers. That is the position of an old age pensioner who has sought hospital relief and who has remained in hospital <Col N="2169" /> for over three months.  The result is that the old age pensioner has to remain without the old age pension for a very considerable time, after leaving hospital, often extending into months.  I suggest in that case that some alteration should be made in the regulation.  It will not require anything in the nature of an Act of Parliament to see that that old age pensioner who is in receipt of an old age pension when he leaves hospital will automatically be entitled to receive the pension.  I put this point before the Minister. There are other points I could make, but I do not want to overcrowd him with applications.  All I ask him to bear in mind are the two points I have respectfully urged above all others.  It is a disgrace to have charity counted as against the old age pension, and the fact that the poor pensioner is to receive hospital relief should not disqualify him from the receipt of an old age pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on this. Bill has been a remarkable one to this extent&mdash;so far only two Deputies from the Government Benches have ventured to give expression to their opinion.  Deputy Sheehy, who usually contributes to the enjoyment of the House, delivered himself of a speech on Thursday in which he declared that he was still prepared to pin his faith to the Minister for Finance, and on the same evening the Minister for Local Government entertained us with comparisons between the amount spent on poor law relief and old age pensions in Mayo and Donegal.  No other member of the Government Party has spoken so far.  What of the remaining 62 Deputies of Cumann na nGaedheal? Have they no opinion to express? Has this Bill, which proposes to remove a number of obstacles in the way of pension claimants, no interest for them?  Has their interest in the aged poor of their constituencies suddenly evaporated, or is their silence due to the fact that the party muzzle has been applied?  One would naturally have expected that a Bill of this nature, which affects a very considerable section of our people, <Col N="2170" /> would have brought forth some expression of opinion at least from the back benches of Cumann na nGaedheal, if not in support of the Bill, at least in justification of the attitude adopted by the Minister for Local Government last Thursday.  It is difficult to understand the sullen silence on the Government Benches, and to reconcile it with the extravagant promises which these people make at election times.  The Deputies who have been telling the people for months past that Fianna Fáil has no policy are silent now.  Whether they are &ldquo;mute of malice or by the visitation of God&rdquo; remains to be seen.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government in his speech advanced no argument as to why the Dáil should not pass the Second Reading of this Bill. His speech was a rather feeble attempt to justify existing legislation and the policy of his Department towards the aged poor.  Deputy Dr. Ward, in moving the Second Reading of the Bill, dealt at considerable length with the main objects of the Bill, and cited cases to illustrate the hardships imposed on old age pension applicants by the Acts at present in force.  The Bill, as he explained, is intended to remove certain sections of the Old Age Pension Acts that are being interpreted by the Free State Government to the disadvantage of the very poorest classes in the community. Dr. Ward, in introducing the Bill, presented a convincing case for the repeal of certain sections of the Acts which up to the present have militated against very deserving applicants.  Other speakers from these benches have since cited cases in support of the Bill which no member of the Government has attempted to refute.  In fact, every Deputy that has spoken so far, with the exception of the Minister for Local Government, has expressed a desire to have these penal sections repealed or amended.  Even that stalwart supporter of the Government from West Cork, Deputy Jasper Wolfe, pleaded with the Government to give more consideration to the old age pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other speakers from these benches <Col N="2171" /> have referred to different sections of the Bill.  I would like to again direct the attention of the House to Section 2.  This section proposes to repeal paragraph (d), sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the Act of 1911. This paragraph reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In calculating, for the purposes of the Principal Act, the means of a person, account shall be taken of&mdash;(d) the yearly value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by that person.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now it is common knowledge to every Deputy in this House, especially those who represent western constituencies, how this sub-section operates against pension applicants. I venture to suggest that there is not one Deputy in the House, except perhaps the occupants of the front bench opposite, who has not had experience of claims for pension being turned down on appeal because the applicants were afforded food and shelter by some member of their family or by some charityably-disposed person.  It is difficult to understand the mentality of a native Government when dealing with the poorest section of the community, taking into account, when assessing the means of an applicant, the few pounds that a son or daughter in America sends home at Christmas or Easter.  More inexplicable, perhaps, is the attitude of the Government in assessing at £26 or £52 per year the meagre support which an applicant receives from a son or daughter to whom he has assigned his small holding. Cases have been referred to by previous speakers where the applicant's claim for pension has been disallowed, or where only a paltry few shillings have been allowed, because the applicant resides with a son or daughter who has inherited the small holding, and who has perhaps considerable liabilities of his own to meet.  Cases of this kind are very numerous in the constituency that I represent, and I am quite sure that the same is true in most other constituencies.  Paragraph (d) of the sub-section, which this Bill proposes to repeal, operates more <Col N="2172" /> harshly against the applicant who has been hard-working, thrifty and industrious all his life than it does against the idler and the spendthrift. The applicant who, at great sacrifice, and because for years he has denied himself the comforts and refinements of life in order to make some provision for his family, usually finds, when he applies for the pension, that because he is afforded the benefit or privilege of residing with a member of his family, he is not entitled to a pension. After a life of honest toil, in the last few years of his existence, that applicant must leave the old home and live in some hut or cottage in order to qualify for the pension. On the other hand, the applicant who has been an idler and a spendthrift all his life, and no good for himself or his family, whose farm is without stock and probably in debt, is more likely to qualify for the maximum amount of pension than the honest, hard-working farmer.  As the law in this matter stands at present, it places, as one provincial paper recently stated, a premium on rascality, and in many instances induces children to leave their parents bereft of means until the pension is obtained.</P>
    <P>Surely, it was never the intention of those who framed the Act of 1911 that such a benefit or privilege as that of residing with a son or daughter should be taken into account when assessing the means of an applicant. As Dr. Ward pointed out, when the British Government administered the Old Age Pension Act in this country this paragraph was interpreted in accordance with the obvious intention of the law, and a benefit or privilege not enjoyed as a legal right was not taken into account in calculating the means of an applicant.  Any person who had experience of how these Acts were administered by the British will recall that no account was ever taken of any benefit or privilege not enjoyed as a legal right. Instances of such cases were quite common all over the country. It remained, however, for the legal <Col N="2173" /> luminaries in the Department of Finance to discover a legal way of depriving these people of the pensions they enjoyed under an alien Government.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (a) Sub-section (1) of Section 3 of the Act of 1911, which Section 2 of the Bill proposes to repeal, has been fully dealt with by previous speakers.  The repeal of this paragraph which deprives a person of the old age pension on becoming the inmate of a poor law institution should commend itself to every Deputy who desires to see the stigma of pauperism removed from the country. The repeal of this paragraph will mean a saving in the local rates of £50,000.  The Minister for Local Government stated that there is very little case for taking another £50,000 off the shoulders of local authorities and transferring it to the Central Fund.  If that is so why set up a Commission to consider de-rating?  If the Minister for Local Government and his colleagues on the Front Bench consider that no case exists for relieving the local authorities of £50,000, why go to all the show and expense of appointing a Commission to consider the de-rating of agricultural land and buildings, which means transferring approximately £2,000,000 from the shoulders of the local authorities to the Central Fund. It is quite evident from the Minister's statement that the De-rating Commission is a huge sham and that the Government has no intention of putting any of its recommendations into effect.</P>
    <P>The amendment of sub-section (1) of Section 7 of the Act of 1924, which is proposed in Section 5 of the Bill, is very desirable for many reasons.  Section 7 of the Act of 1924 limited to a great extent the privilege of assigning property without having such property afterwards taken into account when applying for the pension.  It was evidently intended by Section 7 that three years must elapse before a person who assigned property to the valuation of £10 or over could qualify for a pension.  From my experience of the working of the <Col N="2174" /> Act, I must say that this is not the interpretation that is put on Section 7 by the pension officers all over the country.  On the contrary, if a person has assigned property to the valuation of £10 or over it, and applies for the pension before the three years is up, the claim is turned down, and subsequently when the applicant makes application after the three years have expired, the claim is appealed against and disallowed, on the ground that an application was made within three years of making the assignment.  As the Act is being administered at present, any person who assigns property of £10 valuation or over, and applies for pension within three years of making the assignment, such person is automatically disentitled to any pension for life.  The Minister for Local Government stated that the interpretation placed on this section was that it only debarred applicants for a period of three years from not having the income of the property assigned being taken into account when calculating their means.  I do not agree with the Minister that this is the interpretation put on Section 7 by his Department.  Cases were cited by Deputy O'Reilly to prove that this is not so.  Several other Deputies can also cite cases, if necessary, to prove that the Minister is not correct in his contention.</P>
    <P>Now, it may be urged by the Government that the passing of this measure means additional taxation to the extent of £200,000 or £250,000, but the Government did not consider the question of increased taxation when dealing with the able-bodied ex-members of their Army.  They did not consider the capacity of the people to pay when they voted £3,000 recently for motor races in the Phoenix Park.  The Government that spent £253,473 in pensions and gratuities to ex-officers and soldiers during the current year, should be prepared to give some consideration to the aged poor who are not so fortunately placed as ex-officers of the Free State Army.</P>
    <P>I trust the House, recognising the <Col N="2175" /> plight, the dire poverty, and the helplessness of the great majority of the aged and infirm poor, will pass this Bill, and thereby bring some measure of relief to thousands of homes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>A great many of the speeches we have heard on this Bill really dealt with the administration of the existing law.  There were not, although they purported to be, pleas for changes in the law, but pleas for more sympathetic administration.  I have already said in the House that for some time past the old age pensions code has been more sympathetically administered than previously. A greater attempt has been made to give the applicants the benefit of the doubt where that was possible.  But we are always bound to have complaints about administration unless we are prepared to remove the means qualification altogether, and to give the old age pension to any persons over 70 years of age irrespective of whether they have means or not; and unless, in the second place, we are prepared to accept as having attained the age of 70, any person whose case is passed by the Old Age Pensions Committee, until and unless the contrary can be proved.  If we did that I think we would have an end of the complaints about the way the Act is administered. But unless that is done I think we are bound to have these borderline cases in which there is some difficulty about the facts and some obscurity, in which appearances to some extent belie the real facts, and in which, perhaps, real errors occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were to try to alter the law so as to make impossible these complaints then we would be adding anything from one-and-a-half to two millions to the annual cost of old age pensions.  I do not think we could afford to make a change which would involve an annual cost like that.  If we are going to keep the means qualification and if we are going to still exact proof of age then we are going to have these complaints <Col N="2176" /> and these difficulties.  When many thousands of applications have to be dealt with annually, cases scattered all over the country, very often, as Deputies said, cases put forward by people not always very well able to present the facts, then we are going to have some cases turned down which ought not to be turned down, and some cases accepted which ought not to be accepted, because there cannot be, and it is not desirable that there should be, a sort of investigation that a court might make.  It is always possible to consider how to modify the administration if a great number of hard cases, of some particular kind, are brought to light, because of some rule of administration or some difficulty in the method of administration.  As I say a great many of the speeches I heard were directed to questions of administration and not to the Bill at all.  Two or three speakers spoke about the proof of age which is not dealt with in this Bill at all.  Other Deputies spoke about the estimate of the means made in the case of an applicant who owns a small farm of land &mdash;a case not dealt with by the Bill at all.  In fact, the first night this was discussed nearly all the individual cases cited were cases that would not be affected in the slightest by the passage of this Bill.  There were cases by way of criticism of the administration of the existing code.</P>
    <P>Although we heard a great lot of talk about hard cases a discussion in this House does not really give a true picture of what is going on in connection with old age pensions, because when somebody applies and gets a pension with fair amount of promptitude, nothing is heard about that.  Nobody comes to Deputies and informs them, and in fact that sort of a case is left out of account when we are discussing any aspect of old age pensions administration here.  If the administration were as rigid as it is alleged to be, if it were as harsh as many Deputies say it is, then I do not believe that we would have anything like the expenditure on old age pensions which at present <Col N="2177" /> takes place.  I know that the proportion of old people in the population of the Saorstát is higher than in Great Britain, and I know that the proportion of old people destitute, or nearly destitute, is greater. Nevertheless, there is a very striking difference between the amount payable in respect of old age pensions here, and that on the other side of the Channel.  I think the Minister for Local Government and Public Health referred to that to some extent.  The money paid in old age pensions here works out at 18s. 5d. per annum per head of the population, as compared with Great Britain, where old age pensions represent only an annual 10s. 11d. per head of the population.</P>
    <P>Deputies referred to the widows and orphans pensions, and to old age pensions paid in Great Britain. As a matter of fact, the total cost of pensions in Great Britain, including those extra pensions, is 15s. 4d. per head of the population, as compared with our 18s. 5d. per head of the population for old age pensions here alone.  When we look at it in another way, the cost of old age pensions here is a much higher proportion of our total tax revenue than it is of the total tax revenue in Great Britain.  The cost of old age pensions amounts in the Saorstát to more than 2s. 7d. per £ of tax revenue collected.  In Great Britain it works out at only 8¾d. in the £ of tax revenue collected, so that in every way the old age pensions charge here is a considerable charge. I think myself that if it were not true that in the main&mdash;there are always exceptional and difficult cases&mdash;Old Age Pensions Acts are liberally administered here, in spite of the somewhat different conditions we, nevertheless, would not expend as largely as we expend at the present time.</P>
    <P>The Bill that Deputy Ward introduced proposed changes of which the minimum cost would be £250,000. The actual cost would be much more likely to work out at £300,000.  I think that if this House decided that it ought to spend £300,000 a year <Col N="2178" /> more on old age pensions it ought, nevertheless, to reject this Bill, because I think that if we decided to spend that much more on old age pensions we could find better ways of spending it than the way set out in this Bill.  The Bill would help none of the poorest people who receive old age pensions.  Of the very poorest people who receive old age pensions none will get any benefit if this Bill is passed.  I believe if we decided that we ought to spend £300,000 more, we would get better value for the money from a social point of view and do more good to the people if we made the pension a maximum of 11/- rather than 10/-.  The really hard cases, so far as old age pensions are concerned, are the people with no means of their own and who have no relatives with any means.  The people who have nothing but the pensions, or practically nothing but the pensions, are really the hard cases, and they are numerous.  These are the cases for whom nothing would be done as a result of the £300,000 extra that would have to be provided if this Bill were passed.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested here that there has been some change in practice in regard to maintenance, or what people in this debate called charity, as compared with what was done when the British were here. There has been no change in practice. The original Act laid down that all means were to be taken into account, whether that means consisted of maintenance given by relatives or others or of cash income.  According to the Acts it had always to be taken into account, and always has been taken into account.  The suggestions made here that a change has been made since the setting up of Saorstát Eireann in this respect are without foundation.  There are cases in which it seems to be somewhat hard to take that maintenance into account, but there are a large number of cases in which any Deputy would agree that it is the proper thing to do.  There are cases of people who are maintained in conditions of great comfort, in conditions even bordering on luxury, by relatives <Col N="2179" /> on whom they have no legal claim.  There are people maintained on very big farms in the country and in big houses in the suburbs of Dublin by relatives on whom they have no claim.  And it seems to me it is not reasonable to ask the taxpayers to spend substantial sums of money merely for the purpose of providing pocket money, shall we say, for those people, already well maintained and well supplied, or sufficiently supplied.  These cases would be very numerous indeed.</P>
    <P>Of course conditions have changed since the original Old Age Pensions Acts were passed.  At that time people like those would not have applied for, and would not have taken the old age pensions, but all that has passed away and people, no matter what the conditions in which they are supported, would now&mdash;the great majority of them at any rate &mdash;claim to be paid the pension and would take their £26 a year, which would have to be paid, to which the very poorest people living in the very worst slum in Dublin would, through taxation, have to contribute their share.  It does not seem to be reasonable that we should propose that maintenance be not taken into account. There are cases which we may admit to be hard cases, resulting from counting maintenance as means, but I do not see that we are not going to create really worse anomalies if we alter that.  So far as maintenance in a working class family is concerned, it is not a bar to the pension.  Maintenance, on an equivalent scale, is not a bar to the pension.  Sometimes the value of the maintenance provided would be actually sufficient to make it possible not to give the full pensions, at once, but if only a pension of 6/- a week were given it would be possible for a person paying something for maintenance to get the increase, and the result is that to avoid repeated applications, following a contribution given, by a person who gets the pension, for maintenance, where maintenance is on the scale of what I <Col N="2180" /> might call a working-class family, the administrative practice is to give the full pension at once.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk about people who have to live in the county homes, and the desirability of having to pay them pensions. The object of the Old Age Pensions Acts is not to give relief to the local rates.  It is to enable people who have reached seventy years of age to exist without having to go into those institutions.  The relief to the local rates is an entirely different question.  There is no reason why the proposals for rate relief should be brought into an Old Age Pensions Bill.  If there is going to be rate relief let it be dealt with on its own merits.  The principle in the Old Age Pensions Acts from the beginning, and very strongly in them, was contrary to what is proposed.  As a matter of fact, in the beginning a person who had been in an institution or receiving relief was disqualified for a certain length of time, and there was no idea at the back of the Old Age Pensions code of relieving the local rates.</P>
    <P>With regard to people who have to go into those institutions for medical treatment, and have been obliged, for the sake of completing that treatment, or because they were, apart from the question of treatment, feeling unable to go out, to remain in for more than three months, in a great many cases that has now been met by administrative adjustment.  In a great many cases, I think in the majority of cases, it is arranged if the pensioner will give a few weeks' notice of his intention to leave the institution, if he is to get the old age pension, he will get it.  Generally he can get it if he makes his claim in time.  He is helped in making his claim.  It is, in that way, arranged that he can get his pension back immediately on going out of the institution.  I know that that is done in a great many cases.  If there is anything preventing it being done in other cases, if there is any further adjustment required to enable that to be done, <Col N="2181" /> and if any cases of that kind spring up, we can look into them.  I know that at one time a great period clapsed before the person who came out of the institution got the pension again.  But as a result of that and the discussion that took place in the House following the report of the committee that was set up some years ago, a change was made.  Now in the majority of cases the pension is available immediately the person leaves the institution.</P>
    <P>There is a proposal with regard to the review of cases where two old people receive the pension, and the husband or the wife dies.  The Bill proposes that there should be no change in the amount of a pension to an old person because her or his wife or husband who also had a pension, has died.  But if that proposal in the Bill became law, new anomalies would be produced.  We would have the position where one woman was, say, in receipt of £1 a week in cash, and was getting a pension of 6s. a week.  And we have another case where, because the husband had died a month or two before he would be entitled to an old age pension, his widow, who had the same income, would get no pension at all.  That would produce further anomalies, persons who would live on perhaps seven or eight years being refused a pension, though their means were exactly the same as those who were in receipt of one.  Whether they got the pension or not would depend solely on the fact that the husband or wife lived on until he or she got the pension. In the other case the husband, dying before he could get the pension, his widow would get nothing.  The anomaly is seen most clearly when we talk of a cash income.  But it applies in other cases, too, where there is a question of getting assistance, say, when the wife dies and the husband has to get some assistance. That is a matter that is taken into account when a review takes place. It does not follow that the whole of the joint income is, on review, reckoned as being the income of the survivor.  The income of the survivor may be reckoned as perhaps <Col N="2182" /> two-thirds of the joint income.  There may be cases where it would be reckoned as only half of the joint income.  So that on the actual facts of the case the pension would not be interfered with.  But to adopt the proposal in the Bill would really be very undesirable, for the reason that it would mean that people whose means were admittedly identical, would be paid pensions at different rates.  That would not be any improvement on the present position. It would be rather the opposite, and it would give new grounds for discontent, and rightly so.  It seems to me this is a proposal which has not been thought out.  The Deputy has based it, perhaps, on the feeling one might have in the case of a person who was, as the Deputy remarked. 80 years of age.  One can see that it is not a desirable thing to make an alteration in the rate of pension for somebody who is 80 years of age.</P>
    <P>There was a great deal of misrepresentation in the discussion on Section 4 of the Bill, and Deputies have suggested that the official view is that money might earn, or is supposed to earn, 10 per cent.  It is not really a question of what the money will actually earn.  As a matter of fact, before the Act of 1924 was introduced at all, any property in excess of £400 was taken at the 10 per cent. rate, and the 5 per cent. rate applied only to property below £400.  Let me give just one or two illustrations of the effect that the change proposed in the Bill would have.  A bachelor with £250 in bank and no other means has now his income assessed at £22 per annum.  He is therefore awarded a pension of 7/- a week.  Under the proposed change his means would have to be estimated at only £11 5s. per annum, and he would draw a pension of 10/- a week.  It is not supposed that on the £250 a man will get 10 per cent. interest; but the point of view that is taken is that if a man has as much as £250 in cash in the bank it is unnecessary to give him a pension of 10/- a week.  That would be the effect of the amendment proposed in the Bill, <Col N="2183" /> and it seems to me that his case is far less necessitous than many other cases for which we propose to do nothing.  Under the Bill a man with £425 in bank or in National Loan would have his means assessed at £20 per annum and would get a pension of 8/- a week.  I cannot really see the necessity for altering the law to give a man who had £425 in bank or £425 in War Loan or National Loan a pension at very nearly the full rate.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of talk about penalising thrift, and, as somebody said, encouraging rascality. The idea that has been at the base of the administration of old age pensions from the beginning has not been the reward of virtue or the punishment of guilt, but simply the relief of necessity.  There were old-fashioned people or reactionary people who argued against having old age pensions at all on the ground that it encouraged rascality and encouraged people to think that they need not save, need not work and need not be careful because an old age pension would be provided for them.  The question of whether we are going to encourage or discourage thrift really does not arise on the matter of old age pensions and should not be taken into account. The point to be considered is whether a person has or has not means to live without the pension.  If the person has means to live without it, then that person is not entitled and that is the principle of the whole code.</P>
    <P>If we abolished the means qualification&mdash;and all this argument about discouraging thrift and encouraging rascality is an argument in favour of abolishing the means qualification&mdash;there is no logical stopping-place for us, and the cost of abolition would be, at the minimum, £1,250,000.  It might be £100,000 or £150,000 more than that. I do not think that we can abolish the means qualification.  If we cannot abolish it, then, to some small extent, the operation of the Old Age Pensions Act may be a discouragement <Col N="2184" /> to thrift, but I do not think that that matters.  If a man works his farm and retains it, it is of a certain value, and he is disqualified from receiving a pension.  If he neglects his work, drinks, loses his farm and reaches 70 years of age, he is going to get a pension.  Leaving farms out and taking house property or money, I do not see why we should have a different ruling. If a man has £450, £500 or £600 in the bank or invested in shares or house property, I do not think it is any duty of the House to say that he must not be obliged to break his deposit receipt, that he must not be obliged to sell £10 of stock.  There is no suggestion of a person being able to earn 10 per cent.  The point of view really taken is that it is unnecessary to alter the law in order to enable a man with £425 on deposit receipt to be able to get an old age pension of 8/- a week.</P>
    <P>[<i>Deputy Fahy took the Chair.</i>]</P>
    <P>With regard to Section 5 of the Bill, the Minister for Local Government explained that there was a certain amount of confusion as to the effect of the existing provision. The provision was intended to indicate that property not assigned before 67 years of age should always count for the purpose of assessing means under the Old Age Pensions Act.  From the passing of the Act of 1924 until 1928 that interpretation was acted upon.  In 1928 the question was raised and legal opinion was obtained.  I am leaving out cases where it could be clearly proved that the assignment was for the purpose of qualifying for the old age pension, and I will deal with an ordinary assignment in the case of the marriage of a son or daughter. The effect of the legal opinion was that if a man assigned a farm at the age of 67, the value of the farm assigned did not count when he had reached the age of 70, and when his means were being assessed for the purpose of a pension.  If he assigned at 68 years, the value of the farm was counted as part of his means until he reached 71 years.  If he did <Col N="2185" /> not assign until he was 70, the value of the farm counted until he was 73. When legally examined the section was found not to have effected what it was intended to effect, and there was, perhaps, some confusion.  The original interpretation having been quite the opposite, there was perhaps some confusion as to what it actually did mean.  It is perfectly clear now that the meaning of the section is that for three years after assignment the value of the farm is counted as part of the means of the applicant&mdash;that after the expiry of three years the value of the farm assigned is no longer taken into account, and there could be no question of any person being permanently disqualified simply because he happened to apply before the expiry of the full three years.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill proposes in effect to change the present figure of £10 to £13 10/- in the average case, because the £10 includes the value of buildings.  The £12 in Deputy Ward's Bill is exclusive of the value of buildings.  The average valuation of the buildings would be about 30/-, so that what Deputy Ward proposes to do in effect is to alter the existing figure of £10 to the figure of £13 10/-.  The effect of this section would be to add a very substantial amount to the cost of old age pensions, and I do not think that it would remedy any hard cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister made any investigations as to the probable amount which this provision would cost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>£125,000 under this section.  Two or three lines of estimation have been followed up and they have given approximately the same results.  I think that the figure may be taken as fairly accurate.  It would add a figure like that to the cost of old age pensions, and I do not think it would relieve any of the hard cases.  It will be possible for people who want to obtain the old age pension at seventy in many cases to make an assignment, as it was originally intended by the Bill, at sixty-seven years of <Col N="2186" /> age.  If a person for some reason does not assign a farm until he reaches seventy, then the effect of the existing legislation is that he has to wait three years for the pension.  It is not a very great hardship, because the smallest farms of all, the holdings on which there are the greatest number of old age pensioners, are not affected at all.  They are really exempt by the existing limit of £10. I remember when the 1924 Act was being passed the view was taken that holdings above £10 valuation were very definitely economic holdings. They were holdings on which there would not be any hardship if the value were to continue to be taken into account even after the assign ment.  We find that the Act, instead of keeping an old person out of an old age pension, only keeps him out for a period of three years.  I think that no great hardship at all arises under it, no hardship that would justify the additional costs that would be involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to repeat that this Bill proposes to do nothing for the poorest class of applicants for an old age pension.  The additional £300,000 which this Bill would cost&mdash;and remember that a very considerable amount of the additional £300,000 would go to people who are not only at present living reasonably well but are living in conditions of very considerable comfort&mdash;would go to people who have no need at all for it and would have to be paid by people who are not old but who are in circumstances of the very greatest difficulty, people who cannot very well afford to make any further contributions to the Exchequer for any purpose at all.  There has been a good deal of talk about the effect of the present legislation, which it is proposed to change by Section 5, on the operation of the Gaeltacht Housing Scheme.  I do not believe it will have any effect at all.  Certainly the houses which will be built under the Gaeltacht housing scheme are only going to be improvements.  The houses which are going to be affected by the Gaeltacht Housing Act are going to add very little to the entire valuation of the holdings.  The holdings <Col N="2187" /> that would be affected would be along a very narrow band.  The proposed new houses might have a valuation of £1 more than the old houses. A valuation which is now £9 1s. 0d. might become £10 1s. 0d. and so on, but so far as the valuations which are above £10 are concerned, they are not going to be affected.  Valuations of £3, £4, £5, £6, or £7, or even £8 10s. are not going to be affected at all, so that the argument that the existing law will delay the building of new houses or the improvement proposed in the Gaeltacht is entirely without foundation.</P>
    <P>I think this Bill is about as ill-conceived a Bill as it would be possible to introduce for the purpose of doing anything for old age pensioners. If we were going to spend £300,000, half a dozen different schemes could be adopted to amend or to alter the code which would help far more necessitous cases than would be helped by this Bill and would give far better social value to the public than this Bill if passed would give.</P>

      <P>I understood the Minister to state that under the second part of Section 5 of the Bill, by raising the valuation of transferable property from £10 to £13 10s., an expenditure of £125,000 a year would be involved.  I would like to know if that figure is based on the assumption that every holder of such farm would transfer or assign it.</P>

      <P>In dealing with the subject of this Bill one feels rather hopeless in going over the same ground so frequently.  Every aspect of this particular question, the question with which this Bill aims at dealing, has often been dealt with here and the same ground has been covered.  One grows tired, and perhaps hopeless, in endeavouring to effect any change.  The Minister has been, in my opinion, much less effective than usual in his statement against this Bill.  I regard this Bill as an honest attempt to deal in some degree with the hardship which the <Col N="2188" /> law at present imposes on claimants to old age pensions, but the Minister opened his statement by saying that the demand was really for more sympathetic administration.  If I remember rightly, the keynote of the Minister's speeches on the numerous occasions upon which he has had to defend the administration of the Old Age Pensions Act here was that the administration of the Act had been quite generous and that it was the wording of the Act that imposed the rigidity.  In endeavouring to refute the case made that old age pension officers frequently go out of their way to be harsh in dealing with claims, the Minister said that the officers were merely carrying out the law.  The Minister now shifts his ground and says that it is the administration that is at fault.  The Minister asks us to believe that what is really aimed at, and what would end all complaints in connection with old age pensions claims, is to have the means qualification entirely removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not advocate any such course and I do not think the advocates of the Bill would do so either.  I have no hesitation in saying that there are quite a number of people who in the ordinary way make claims for old age pensions who should not get them. The position, however is entirely different from the attitude taken up by the Minister when he speaks of borderline cases.  Unquestionably there are hundreds of cases where there is glaring hardship, cases which could by no stretch of the imagination be described as borderline.  I have a very shrewd suspicion that the Minister realises that and that he had that feeling at the back of his mind when attempting to defend the administration and the law as it stands.  No one advocates the provision of pensions for the purpose of providing pocket-money for people. I never heard that case made and I do not think that it could be made. I do not believe that pensions committees, much as they are blamed for extravagant administration and extravagant decisions, generally mould their decisions to give pensions to people of that kind.  The <Col N="2189" /> Minister ought not to evade the glaring hardships which the law imposes and which are intensified by the administration, by putting up cases of that kind because there is no attempt to defend a position of that kind, and this Bill, in my opinion, can be amended in such a way as to preclude cases of that kind being given attention.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest, and I do not think that Deputy Ward would ask the House to believe, that this Bill represents the best possible means of dealing with the present situation.  I do, however, suggest that the Bill is an attempt to which effect could be given by further amendment, if necessary, to remedy the hardships under the Act at present.  I want to give instances in particular cases which, so far from being borderline cases, clearly show that this Bill will have the effect of remedying glaring wrongs to unfortunate people in the country.  On the question of expense, I would like to say that this whole question ought not to be shelved on that ground alone.  If expense has to be met in connection with this matter, it ought to be met, and we ought not to be frightened away from considering the rights of poor people by questions of this kind, which are always raised on matters like this.  Other suggested improvements are always met with a similar answer.  I heard the Minister make a very definite statement when he said that people living in a home in which there was an average working-class income, were not penalised on that account.  That statement does not represent the facts, and it is well that the Minister should make further inquiries.  If the Minister wants proof of that we can give him proof.</P>
    <P>I have in mind one particular case, the case of a man living with his widowed mother.  He was employed by the county council as a helper to an engine-driver in connection with steam-rolling operations for the county council.  He lived away at the other end of the county. He had to support himself out of a wage of about 30/- per week.  His <Col N="2190" /> mother, who certainly could not be expected to get very much out of that 30/-, obtained, after very great difficulty, a considerably reduced pension, because of the fact that her son, working in another portion of the county, was earning 30/- per week.  The Minister can have that case verified if he wants.  That is just one case I remember at the moment, where unquestionably that disqualification prevailed, and was operated against the claimant for the old age pension.  It is time that some attempt should be made to deal with disqualification of another kind, disqualification of servants living in a house where for the greater part of their lives they were employed.  I have in mind an outstanding case that occurred recently the case of a woman who was for twenty years employed in a farmer's house.</P>
    <P>During recent years a farmer with a grown-up family found himself in very considerable difficulty. Although he might have means of some value some years ago, he was latterly a poor man.  A servant in his house claimed the old age pension.  The pension officer recommended a pension of 6/- a week, but so confident was the applicant of the merits of her claim that she refused to accept a reduced pension and appealed to the Department.  While the appeal was pending the poor woman died. I only want to say, in passing, that I think the action of the Department in refusing that particular claim&mdash; and I have special knowledge of the circumstances&mdash;was on a par with the callous communication that was received several weeks after that unfortunate woman's death, refusing a pension to the particular person who was dead and referring to her as &ldquo;the late so-and-so, not entitled to a pension.&rdquo;  The spirit of the whole thing was extremely uncivilised. It was perhaps, one of the few cases where I saw the Department take up a less sympathetic action than the pension officer, because usually the blame is with the local officer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2191" /> I do suggest that the Bill before the House merits a Second Reading. If there will be anomalies created in the terms of the Bill there is a method for preventing the enactment of anomalies of that kind, because the Bill can be amended in Committee Stage.  It is time that some attempt should be made from some quarter of the House to give effect to protests that have been made repeatedly here.  I feel there is no fear whatever as regards Deputy Wolfe's statement that if this Bill gets a Second Reading it cannot be given effect to.  I feel there is no fear whatever in that regard.  I take it if this Bill is given a Second Reading the Minister will bring in the necessary Money Resolution to enable the Bill to reach Committee Stage.  I do not know whether that particular statement has any further authority than being introduced merely as a red herring to draw across the whole path of the discussion. As I have said before, much could be said from the point of view of administration, but it does not arise on this particular Bill.  I think the Bill makes a reasonable attempt to have some provision made for a case of the kind I mentioned.  I think that on that account alone it deserves a vote.  I only want to say again that the question of expense <Col N="2192" /> ought not to be the deciding factor. Rather should it be the justice of the particular case and the justice generally of the policy pursued in connection with cases of this kind.</P>
    <P>I would re-echo what has been said in connection with the hardships imposed on people who have to become patients in the local hospitals.  It is true that there is a very considerable delay and there is undoubtedly hardship in that connection, at the moment.  I am not making any plea in support of this Bill for the borderline cases.  I am making a plea for the cases that are as clear as could be and that are simply debarred from getting justice by the law as it stands at the moment.  It is, unquestionably, to some extent a matter of administration, but to a very large extent disqualification is caused by the law as it stands at the moment. This Bill will, to some extent, relieve the position and is worthy of support. It is time the House took some steps to provide a remedy for what is really a very disgraceful state of affairs in connection with old age pensions at the moment.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries whether he is aware that the Luean Estate, No. 4, was acquired by the Congested Districts Board nearly twenty years ago; that the holdings are not yet vested; and that as a result of the failure of the Irish Land Commission to vest, the tenants will have to pay about 87 years purchase instead of 68½ years; and if he will state when the holdings will be vested, and if any refund of the moneys paid in excess of annuities for the past twenty years will be made to the tenants.</P>

      <P>The Lucan No. 4 Estate was vested in the late Congested Districts Board on the 3rd July, 1911.  One hundred and two holdings on this estate have been vested in purchasers on re-sale, and twenty holdings are in process of being vested.  The remaining holdings on the estate will be vested as soon as necessary rearrangements are completed.  It is regretted that it is not possible to make any refund of the rents paid in respect of this estate.</P>
