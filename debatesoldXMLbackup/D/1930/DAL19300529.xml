      <P>I am aware that the s.s. Smoland, direct from Konigsberg to the North Wall, landed 300 tons of white oats and proceeded to Belfast with part cargo.  I have heard that another smaller consignment is en route.  I have reliable information that the export bounty on oats from Germany was withdrawn as from yesterday.  More than 70 per cent. of our farmers feed all the oats they grow and purchase more oats or <Col N="168" /> equivalents such as Indian meal.  So far as these are concerned, the cheaper they can buy the raw materials the better.  With regard to the small minority of farmers who sell their oats, it would be better both in their own interests and in the interest of the country as a whole that they adopted the policy of the majority and fed their oats.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Go gceaduíonn an Dáil an Dreacht-chonnra chun a Thoirmease feidhm do bhaint as Geasanna Múchtacha no Geasanna Nimhe no Geasanna eile no Modhanna Cogaidh Bactereólaíochta i gCoga (1925) dar leagadh cóip ar Bhord na Dála ar an 12adh lá d'Fheabhra, 1930, agus go molann don Ard-Chomhairle gach ní is gá do dhéanamh chun aontú leis an Dreacht-chonnra san fé réir na gcoiníoll so leanas, viz.:</P>
      <P>(1)  ná fuil Saorstát Eireann ceangailte ag an Dreacht-chonnra ach vis-a-vis na Stát eile sin atá tar éis an Dreacht-chonnra do shighniú agus do dhaingniú no tar éis aontú leis;</P>
      <P>(2)  má thugann fórsaí armtha aon Stáit naimhdigh no aon chongantóra don Stát san faillí sa Dreacht-chonnra go scuirfidh Saorstát Eireann de bheith ceangailte ag an Dreacht-chonnra vis-a-vis an Stáit sin.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil approves of the Protocol for the Prohibition of the use in war of Asphyxiating, Poisonous, or other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare (1925), a copy of which was laid on the Table of the Dáil on the 12th day of February, 1930, and recommends the Executive Council to take the necessary steps to accede to the said Protocol subject to the following reservations, viz.:</P>
      <P>(1)  that Saorstát Eireann is bound by the Protocol only vis-a-vis those other States which have signed and ratified the Protocol or acceded thereto;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="170" /> (2)  that in the event of the armed forces of any enemy State or of any ally of such State failing to respect the Protocol, Saorstát Eireann shall cease to be bound by the Protocol vis-a-vis such State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Protocol referred to is one of the most humanitarian of those which have come from the League of Nations and there is no necessity to go into any details about it.  We were not a signatory to it at the beginning. It is proposed that we should notify the French Government of our accession.  About 29 States signed at the beginning, but only seventeen of them have either ratified or acceded up to a recent date.  We propose two obvious reservations: (1) that we are bound by the Protocol only vis-a-vis those other States which have signed and ratified the Protocol or acceded thereto, and (2)&mdash;which is a most unlikely contingency&mdash;that in the event of any State which signs failing to respect the Protocol then we cease to be bound by it vis-a-vis such State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be glad if the Minister would tell us how it was thought right to have these reservations to this Protocol: (1) that the Saorstát is bound only vis-a-vis those other States which have signed and ratified the Protocol or acceded thereto, and (2) that in the event of the armed forces of any enemy State or of any ally of such State failing to respect the Protocol, Saorstát Eireann shall cease to be bound by the Protocol vis-a-vis such State.  If the Government are satisfied that the use of asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases in warfare is not right, it does not become right when some other State proceeds to use them.  Obviously the reason why it is desirable that the use of this particular method of warfare should be prohibited is because it is liable to inflict damage upon persons who are not actual combatants; in other words the harm it does cannot be confined to those actually engaged in the combat.  If it is wrong to use asphyxiating gas <Col N="171" /> in war, the State I think should be willing to declare its intention of not using it under any circumstances whatsoever.  Why such reservations were considered necessary I do not know, and I should be glad if the Minister would tell us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reservations are considered necessary because the particular Protocol is phrased in a peculiar way.  Nearly everything which emanates from Geneva is put in the form of a definite undertaking, and the people who sign have before them what they are signing and the people towards whom they are bound.  This is put in the form of a general declaration.  The word which precedes the whole resolution is &ldquo;declare.&rdquo;  The declaration, therefore, limits the thing to a certain extent; at least it makes it rather vague, and it is desirable to know what our obligations are exactly towards other people.  What would happen is a different thing. The reservations state that we are not bound to this in the case of two particular events spoken of.  I should like to point out to the Deputy, however, that there is no such thing expressed as the view which he has expressed.  The preamble reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whereas the use in war of asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases, and of all analogous liquids, materials or devices, has been justly condemned by the general opinion of the civilised world; and</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whereas the prohibition of such use has been declared in Treaties to which the majority of Powers of the world are parties; and</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To the end that this prohibition shall be universally accepted as a part of International Law, binding alike the conscience and the practice of nations;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not follow because we put in the two reservations that in the two exceptional cases spoken of the use of asphyxiating gas and of bacteriological methods of warfare will be considered as right and proper. It is only that there will be no obligation binding in International Law <Col N="172" /> on the State vis-a-vis these people. It is considered right that we should have the exact obligation limited in that way.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil approves of the International Convention with the object of securing the Abolition of Slavery and the Slave Trade, signed at Geneva on the 25th day of September, 1926, a copy of which was laid on the Table of the Dáil on the 7th day of May, 1930, and recommends the Executive Council to take the necessary steps to accede to the said International Convention.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one of the conventions in which we have no direct interest. In fact, the decision was taken to bring a convention of this sort before the House because at this year's Assembly one of the Swiss delegates happened, at one of the meetings, to point out the position of his country in relation to two items, and asked if it would be considered desirable that a country which was clearly obeying the convention should formally ratify all the things ing the general application of the Committee, when that question was raised, was to the effect that the accession of a country like Switzerland, although clearly it was accepting the obligations, and clearly not, therefore, directly concerned in passing anything of the sort, would be a big moral asset towards ensuring the general application of the convention and, with that in view, <Col N="173" /> we bring this Convention forward here.</P>
    <P>The Convention itself is a marked advance on anything done previously because it deals with the suppression of slavery as a domestic institution. There have been conventions and resolutions up to date which simply contained a vague pledge with regard to the suppression of slavery. This deals with the suppression of slavery as a domestic institution and, therefore, allows nations to affect in whatever way they may think desirable countries which have slavery, or analogous conditions, as a domestic institution.  Up to date, the effect of the Conventions has been merely to deal with traffic in slavery &mdash;the sale of slaves from one country to another.</P>
    <P>There is a peculiar point on Article V. which deals with forced labour, which may seem to be a little bit of retrogression.  There is the recognition there that compulsory or forced labour may be exacted for public purposes.  There is an extension of what may be considered the retrogression in a further paragraph which recites the territories in which compulsory or forced labour for other than public purposes still survives, but then the pledge follows by which the contracting parties endeavour progressively, and as soon as possible, to put an end to the practice.  Even though it may be complained that this marks a point even more out of date than the practice of ordinary, civilised nations, still it is a good thing to have some definite obligation with reference to forced labour.  Of course, it is recognised that the majority of countries are very far beyond the minimum limitations set out here.  It is recognised that they are minimum limitations.</P>

      <P>There have been several articles recently in English newspapers, and one article at least in an Irish paper, describing the method of forced labour in operation in Bulgaria, which, I think, is one of the signatories to this agreement. There it appears that the population have to submit to giving <Col N="175" /> a certain period each year for national services&mdash;for roads and forestry, I think, and for other public works that are included in the programme.  Those articles that I have seen more or less idealised the scheme, and even in the organ of the Labour Party in Ireland no objection was taken to this system.  Are we to take it that under this agreement the State only would be allowed to put such an order into effect?</P>

In the White Paper that the Minister circulated there is no mention of any signature on behalf of the Free State.  I presume that we have signed this document.  I would like the Minister to tell us whether any of our colleagues in the British Commonwealth have ratified this Convention.  I understand that in Burma and in other sections of that part of the Commonwealth which are subject to Great Britain there is a continuance of some sort of slavery.  I notice in the papers to-day that in South Africa there seems to be a practice of obtaining Hottentots and other persons for forced labour.  I would like to know if we are the first members of the Commonwealth to ratify this.</P>

We are the last to join.  This Convention is <Col N="176" /> founded on the Report of a Slavery Commission which was appointed by the League in 1924.  The findings of that Commission were to the effect that slavery was still prevalent in South Morocco, South Tripoli, The Libyan Oases, The Hedjaz, Abyssinia, Arabia, Tibet, Liberia, and China.  It will be noticed that neither Abyssinia nor Liberia ratified this Convention.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil approves of the Protocol relating to the Accession of the United States of America to the Protocol of Signature of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice, signed at Geneva on the 14th day of September, 1929, a copy of which was laid on the Table of the Dáil on the 7th day of May, 1930, and recommends the Executive Council to take the necessary steps for its ratification.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the Protocol which permits of the accession of the United States of America to the Protocol of Signature of the Statute of the Permanent Court.  Up to date the United States, not being a member of the League and by reason of certain other considerations, has found it impossible to accede to the Statute of the Court.  They claimed that certain guarantees should be afforded to them, and most of the guarantees that they requested were based on the single matter of what is called advisory opinion which may be requested <Col N="177" /> and may be given by the Permanent Court.  The United States of America feel that on a matter that directly concerns it an advisory opinion may be requested and may be given and that it might lead to certain peculiar circumstances under the covenant of the League without the United States knowing that their interests were being affected.  Consequently, after many years' delay and after meetings and conferences, in February, 1929, it was finally intimated that a further exchange of views might lead to an agreement with regard to the fulfilment of the conditions upon which the United States would be prepared to accede to the Statute of the Court.  A committee of twelve jurists was appointed and they have drawn up the present Protocol.  That has been approved by the Council and also by the Assembly and the Special Conference. It changes the situation in the League and it must be recognised that it changes it in a peculiarly advantageous manner with regard to the United States of America. It picks them out for special reference and special consideration.</P>
    <P>Article 5 is most important from the point of view of that country. It establishes a rather elaborate procedure for ensuring that the United States shall always be informed when any request for an advisory opinion comes forward, and being so informed it is for the United States to decide whether their peculiar interests are involved or not.  If they decide that their interests are involved, then they bring forward certain representations.  There is a period allowed for an exchange of views, and even a further period by way of postponement, in which a better exchange of views may take place.  There is, finally, in the same Article a provision that if no agreement is reached and the United States is not prepared to forego its objection the United States may then withdraw from the Statute of the Permanent Court.  There is one other point.  Article 2 indicates that the United States shall be admitted to participate, through representatives <Col N="178" /> designated for the purpose and upon an equality with the signatory States members of the League of Nations represented in the Council or in the Assembly, in any and all proceedings of either the Council or the Assembly for the election of Judges or Deputy Judges of the Permanent Court.  That is simply to regularise the position of the United States by giving it the rights of a League member, although it is not in fact a member of the League of Nations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the Protocol for the revision of the Statute of the Permanent Court, signed at Geneva on the 14th September and presented to this House on a date in May.  It is a rather lengthy Protocol but the main changes are small.  The Statute of this Permanent Court was drawn up first of all in 1920, and the eight years that have elapsed between that date and the revision showed that the constitution of the Court was to some extent defective.  A resolution was passed asking for a revision <Col N="179" /> and a committee of twelve jurists was established to deal with the revision. The amendments relate mainly to procedure.  The important ones are that there is an increase in the number of Judges, from eleven to fifteen.  That is effected by raising the status of four who were previously described as Deputy Judges. The second point in which there is a change is that Judges, while they hold judicial office in the International Court are prevented from engaging in any other occupation of a professional nature.  There is a permanent session of the Court, allowing for vacations for groups of Judges.  There is an arrangement whereby the salaries of Judges are fixed, and there is a chapter relating to advisory opinions which follows on the Protocol that we have just discussed.  The amendments are mainly in matters of procedure. They have been put forward by the committee of jurists and they gained the acceptance of the Assembly.</P>

      <P>No.  There will be a national panel formed, and that panel will have the right to vote for members of the Court.  I would not like to say at this moment that there is or is not a chance that a Free State jurist will secure a position in the Court of International Justice. The Court is composed of jurists of very wide international reputation, and that reputation is mainly shown by a volume of publications.  So far it is undoubtedly a fact that although we have jurists of considerable reputation, that reputation is rather limited in its scope because of the fact that they have not had the time to get publications to their credit.  There is a younger school of jurists in this country who undoubtedly will come to the degree of reputation which is necessary to become members of the Court.  But having that reputation and the qualifications necessary to get on the Court and getting into the ranks of <Col N="180" /> the Judges are two different matters. It depends on a number of things.</P>

      <P>When the Adjournment was moved last night I was dealing with Deputy Lemass's remarks relative to certain changes that had been made in the personnel of the Electricity Supply Board and I was criticising the remarks that he thought fit to pass with regard to these changes.  The Deputy said that no statement could justify my action in this matter, and although the Deputy had gone in a very roundabout way to attack my action, I considered it a particularly peculiar thing that those remarks should come from a Deputy of Deputy Lemass's Party, because I rather gathered from the debates that have taken place from year to year on the Vote for my Department that that Party has a programme which includes the resuscitation of business in this country mainly through the aid and intervention of the Civil Service.  In fact I have heard my Department held up to odium and contempt in this House on criticism relating entirely to the point that the officials were not doing enough to revive business in the country. There is also, of course, the peculiar viewpoint which at one time was held and that we heard so much about, but about which we do not hear so much now, that civil servants, of all members of the community, should not be paid beyond a certain sum, and we got to the point that civil servants are to be used as <Col N="181" /> a medium for the resuscitation of business but at limited salaries that no business man would tolerate.  Yet when it comes to putting civil servants into certain positions criticism is made that civil servants are people who are trained in subordination and are not men of known independence. I dealt with that point at sufficient length last night and I do not intend to deal further with it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy criticised the Electricity Supply Board accounts on one point, and arising from that point he asked me a general question as to whether I was satisfied that the information given of the Board's activities was adequate, and particularly if I was satisfied with the published reports.  I am satisfied with the published reports dealing with the two years to which they refer.  I have already dealt at some length with criticisms of a helpful nature that were passed in the Seanad with regard to both the accounts and the reports, and have agreed that the reports and the accounts could be enlarged and clarified in years to come. I also had the agreement of the Seanad that it would be unwise to press or to have pressed the Board to include in each volume particular material.  As to the remarks that the auditor has passed with regard to house installations, it is not my business to decide whether that matter is satisfactory or not.  All I can do is to set out the form of accounts.  I cannot go into all the details that may be required in a big body like the Electricity Supply Board.  If in years to come similar comments were to be passed with regard to the allocation of expenditure on a single item like house installations, I think there would be something unsatisfactory, something wrong, about the development of the procedure of the Board.  But taking into consideration everything that the Board had to do in the period over which the accounts run, I think the fact that the two reports and the two sets of accounts are presented with only three comments by the auditor, adverting to three things that he considered <Col N="182" /> worthy of comment, is in itself rather a striking tribute to the work of the Board.</P>
    <P>I would have much preferred that if there was to be any discussion of the Electricity Supply Board's activities, as evidenced in the reports and accounts, it would have taken place on questions arising out of the reports rather than on this Estimate, because there has been a policy&mdash;a policy that has been very well adhered to, even when people asked questions in this House&mdash;of keeping apart as much as possible the Electricity Supply Board from the Executive Council, or even from the House, except on the yearly presentation of the accounts.  Bringing this in on a Minister's Vote rather tends to give rise to the belief that the Board is like a State Department&mdash;under the control of the Minister&mdash;and that is not a fact.  It is clearly not a fact as the law is at the moment.  It cannot be established as a fact, and nothing should happen in this House to give rise among people outside to the unjustifiable belief that the reverse is the case.  At any rate, I can say, with regard both to the Shannon Scheme project on the constructional side and the operations of the Board since, that there has been a very marked disinclination on the part of certain would-be critics to discuss these things here, where arguments could be dissected and met, and there is rather an inclination to have casual remarks thrown out thoughtlessly at hole-and-corner meetings in the country where no attention can be paid to them.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the Trade Loans Act.  The Minister for Finance, in dealing with the Finance Bill yesterday, said that the extension of that Act for a further year was under consideration.  The big fact that weighs against its extension is that there has not been a single application in the past twelve months under that Act.  Nevertheless, the whole circumstances of the time will be weighed and a decision will be taken as to its extension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was one application which fell away.  It was on the foot of one application alone that the extension was decided upon at a late point last year.  Deputy Goulding referred to an old balance.  I had stated to him that there was no balance.  Any payments made to the Waterford Corporation at any time in connection with the bridge were ex-gratia payments. As to his point that the sum of £93,000 was a gift for certain disadvantages which the people suffered as a result of the amalgamation of the Fishguard and Rosslare Railway system, the facts are against him.  The money was paid by the Fishguard and Rosslare line in view of certain advantages they were getting and it was a repayment of a debt due to the British Treasury.</P>
      <P>With reference to Deputy Nally's question regarding the Claremorris and Ballinrobe passenger service, there are certain old Acts which apply to that and other railways.  In connection with that particular line, it is believed that the railway company have a policy of substitution, that is, substituting buses for the present railway system.  But there are certain old Acts which bind the railway company and before freedom can be got from these Acts, certain formalities have to be gone through, and therefore there will be plenty of scope for the people concerned to have their view-points put before legislation can be got.  It cannot be done automatically under the 1924 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Reilly raised certain points with regard to the Mines Bill.  Although the Deputy has promised me an easy passage through this House for the Mines Bill, I am not certain that he will grant me that when the Bill comes to be considered. The Deputy emphasised that there will be no opposition to that Bill.  I think he had better wait <Col N="184" /> until it is introduced.  That Bill, as drafted now, allows interference to a very great extent with private property.  Quite a number of interests are involved.  It has been a very difficult Bill to draft, and though the draftsman passed it as complete on different occasions, we always found other things to add to it.  I am in a position to say that the Bill is almost Departmentally complete.  As to the date of its introduction I cannot say.  That depends entirely on the programme before the Dáil.  I still persist in repeating what I said to the Deputy in reply to a question.  I cannot see that the mineral development of the country is being impeded by the absence of legislation.  There are certain things brought forward for solution as if they were depending on that type of legislation.  In fact some of these things will require a court judgment to decide in whose lands the mineral deposits are.  It is very hard in a general discussion like this to identify applications to which the Deputy refers.  One of the cases to which he refers is Glenbeigh strand.  Then there is the application with regard to Cahirdaniel and another in regard to Valentia. In neither of these cases can it be said that it is the absence of legislation that is impeding work which is likely to give employment.</P>

      <P>Of Ardgroom I know nothing at the moment.  I got certain inquiries with regard to Valentia and Cahirdaniel after the answer to the first question was written.  It can quite clearly be stated that mineral development likely to give employment is not being impeded owing to the absence of this legislation to which the Deputy refers.  There are a great many other matters to be considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, there has to be determination about the property.  If it be determined that there are certain properties with mineral wealth underneath in the hands of the State, it is quite true to say that these cannot be worked until the terms of Article 11 of the Constitution have been complied with.  The legislation which I am bringing in will allow me to dispose of any property in the hands of the State, property that may be required for mines.  But it is only when we come to the point of determining the ownership of the properties, and the economic possibilities of the mineral deposit that the matters to which the Deputy refers will be appreciated.  Both of these things block at least one of the applications referred to.  Nevertheless, legislation is in train.  I think it will be found when this legislation comes forward that there will be an immense amount of conflicting interests and an immense amount of things to be reconciled before a proper measure can be got together.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy's point that the Department of Industry and Commerce should have money to carry out borings.  Legislation will give us power to grant leases.  If people have any investigations to be made beforehand which lead them to believe that there are mineral deposits underneath, they will make their own borings and get their own profits.  If I had money under my Departmental control for the carrying out of borings, no borings would be done in the country without the aid of the Department of Industry and Commerce. In every one of these cases the Department would come in at the beginning.  It is at the beginning that the prospects of commercial success are a little bit more clouded than when the results of the borings are known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Glenbeigh strand is a very difficult proposition.  Merely to say that the present regulatory leases should be withdrawn does not settle the question.  As far as my memory serves me, in that case there was a <Col N="186" /> dispute, which I think advanced some length towards investigation by the courts, as to the use of private property to get to the strand.  Even if that question were settled, every advice I was able to get at the time, advice coming down from olden times, and advice which was the result of inquiries made at the time that this was a vexed question, went to show that it would be wrong to allow any great removal of the sand deposit at that particular spot. There is a certain amount of sand which comes in at a particular tide and is washed out by a later tide. It may be said that the sand is thrown up there by the hand of God and should be made available for the farmers, but it would not supply more than a very small fraction of the demand in that area, and there would be something approaching civil war in the area if each man were confined to his proper proportion of this particular sand deposit. At any rate it would endanger the area around, and there is also the question of access to it being prohibited because it is through property privately owned.  It is a very complicated case, as the Deputy knows.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOReilly" hpid="Mr. T. O'Reilly Mr. T. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister not make a regulation under-which the sand thrown up there could be taken away?  Could not the Civic Guards give permission to farmers and others who want the sand to take it away?  The sand is thrown up there occasionally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This has all been argued in the context, that access to the strand is in some manner going to be permitted.  That does not lie with me; it lies with the private property owners.  Supposing that is the case, we come to a certain small amount of sand that is washed up by the tide and is washed out again later.  The advice I have received is that to allow the cartage of such sand would only lead to conflict and to local turmoil, because there is not enough sand to satisfy the requirements of the people around.</P>

      <P>I looked upon that as a matter that would have to be litigated.  I will have to look into the matter again.  The case has been made that there is a certain regulatory lease in some person's hand and that is prohibiting the people from getting the sand.  If that were not the case and if the lease were withdrawn my Department would become a regulating authority, and it would be quite as rigid as the individual is with regard to the carting of the sand.  We would have to think of the likely danger to the surrounding area.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £4,630 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1931, for a Grant-in-Aid of the Expenses of the League of Nations and for other expenses in connection therewith.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>We are opposed to the expenditure of this sum of £7,820 as a grant-in-aid towards the expenses of the League of Nations and a sum of £1,450 for the travelling and incidental expenses of Saorstát delegates to League meetings.  We cannot see that any advantage is being gained by citizens of the Saorstát through our membership of the League and, in fact, we are inclined to doubt the utility of the League from the point of view of international good-will.  The main purpose of the League, when its establishment was first determined on, was the encouragement of good international relations between nations, but it is becoming largely an institution for the propagation of free trade ideas.  The whole drive and purpose of the League at present appear to be the establishment of something in the nature of a European Zollverein.  That fact was adverted to by the Minister for Education, speaking at a meeting last year, as reported in the White Paper circulated by the Minister for External Affairs.</P>
      <P>He said that it was true that absolute free trade was not formally the doctrine of the League of Nations, but he was nevertheless of opinion that in practice the drive in certain quarters was towards full free trade. He also said that there was some justification for the view that if full free trade was not the expressed policy of the League there was ground for suspecting that it was the ultimate goal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not think that it helps to solve the serious economic problems of this country to have our Minister for External Affairs, and other representatives of the Saorstát Government, attending periodically at meetings at Geneva and there finding themselves in a position in which they are almost forced to apologise for the few and puny attempts made here to protect Irish industries.  It appears that international finance has got the League in its grip and is striving to remove trade barriers because their removal will be profitable to itself.  If the League of Nations is to be a useful institution it must be based on a clear recognition of the fact that nations exist. If nations exist, they exist for the purpose of providing for the welfare of the people who compose them. European free trade, or world free trade for that matter, might possibly help the people of Europe as a whole, or the people of the world as a whole, but it does not follow from that fact that it will help the people of the Free State in particular.  The <Col N="193" /> Government of the Free State should be primarily concerned with the welfare of the people of this country.  If the policy of the League of Nations is, as the Minister for Education described it, one of free trade, the sooner the Saorstát expresses dissatisfaction with that policy, and its belief that it cannot be made applicable to circumstances here, by withdrawing from the League the better.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to tell us whether he has taken action at any meeting of the League to assist the people of India in their struggle to obtain the independence of their country.  It will be remembered that it was at one time a strong argument used by certain colleagues of the Minister that the status obtained in the Treaty should be accepted by us because by doing so we would be putting ourselves in a position to assist the people of India and people of countries similarly circumstanced to obtain at least similar status.  That argument possibly had a considerable effect in influencing the very small majority by which the Treaty was passed in the Dáil, but it appears to have been forgotten almost immediately afterwards. The only indication of Government opinion given in this House on the subject of India has been the sneers of the Minister for External Affairs and occasionally those of other Ministers.  They seem to think that this matter is one for laughter, derision and scorn.  Of course, having become imperialists and having been consorting with those who guide the destinies of the Empire they cannot be expected to see things now in the same light as they saw them in 1922.  That would be asking too much, but we think that they should occasionally remember the arguments they used and the promises which they gave in connection with these matters or, at any rate, attempt to make a show at justifying them.</P>
    <P>One of the purposes for which the League is supposed to exist is to rectify the grievances of minorities.  There is a minority in <Col N="194" /> this country with a grievance.  As Ministers are aware a certain section of the population of the six north-eastern counties are of opinion that they suffer political disabilities which are imposed on them because of their religion.  It should be the duty of the Minister for External Affairs to take up with the League of Nations the question of these disabilities without waiting to be asked to do so.</P>
    <P>I would remind him that it was contended by his colleagues eight years ago that the Free State established by the Treaty consisted of the entire thirty-two counties of Ireland. In any case he has an obligation to the people of the six north-eastern counties which has not been destroyed by the subsequent betrayal of these people in 1925.  If it is a fact that political disabilities are imposed upon a section of the population of the north-east, because of their religion, and if the Minister can rectify that position by representation at the League of Nations it is his duty to do so.  Has he done so?  Does he propose to do so?  Does he consider this matter one for derision, the same as most other matters referred to here?  He is concerned with nothing apparently except these nice juridical points with which he occasionally deals when these Estimates are under consideration, or on the occasion of the consideration of Conventions like those which we have been asked to ratify to-day, which are of only academic interest to us.  There are certain matters which are of live practical interest to the country.  I have mentioned at least one of them and I want to know has the Minister done anything in regard to it at Geneva, and, if not, why he proposes to waste £9,000 of the taxpayers' money to keep the League in existence.  Have we gained anything by it otherwise than the assertion of what, in the Minister's mind, was the full nationality of the country?</P>
    <P>We never believed that it was necessary to spend any money or to send delegates anywhere to assert that fact.  The Minister is possibly aware of a doubt in his mind, and <Col N="195" /> he is anxious to remove the doubt in other minds by continuously appearing at international conferences as an equal with equals.  If that was necessary at any time, it has ceased to be necessary now.  Whatever international status was gained by the Free State is now freely recognised. This money can be better spent unless it can be shown that the machinery of the League can be at any time utilised for the betterment of the people of the country.  That has not been shown.  Heretofore the only activity of our delegates at the League meetings has been, as I said, to apologise for the ineffective measures of protection which public opinion forced this Government to concede to Irish industries some years ago.  We are opposed to this Vote.</P>

      <P>Very good.  If we are spending money in sending delegates to the Geneva Conferences, the first thing, I submit, they should do is to take up the case of the minority in the Six Counties and to see that that minority is treated in a proper manner.  At the present time, either politically or religiously, <Col N="196" /> that minority is not being treated as it should be treated.  Although they are compelled to pay rates and taxes, pound for pound, with everybody else, they are placed under this disability, that because of their religion and their politics they are only allowed for the building and the maintenance of Catholic schools, fifty per cent. of the amount allowed to the people of other religions. These people, under certain regulations arrived at, are being deprived of rights to which they are justly entitled.  Since they are a minority and since because as a part of that bargain, they are put under these disabilities, it is up to anybody sent to Geneva to fight their case to the best of his ability.  That is not being done, any more than our representative is fighting the case of any minority or any struggling small nation that may be under the domination of the British Empire.  It is principally in regard to that minority in the Six Counties that I have risen to speak.  My colleague has protested against this Vote.  I most emphatically endorse that protest for the reasons I have given, and until a certain representative of the Free State does a certain job in Geneva, in regard to struggling small nations and in regard to the minority in the Six Counties, we will continue to register our protest in this House.</P>

      <P>We are beginning to ignore the main purpose for which the League of Nations was established&mdash;namely, the promotion of mutual good will between the nations who are represented at its conferences from time to time.  On the question of the advocacy by one of the representatives at the League of Nations of world free trade, I understand that any of the delegates are not bound to abide by decisions taken on this particular matter.  It is merely an expression of opinion <Col N="197" /> made by one of those delegates representing one of the nations.  I do not know which at the moment, but it is, of course, a very debatable question whether world free trade would or would not be a good thing. We do know that the setting up of these trade barriers between nations has had very evil results in the past. It does not at the same time prevent this country from adopting any fiscal policy which it may choose, and I think, as I have already said, that we are beginning to get away from the main purpose for which the League of Nations was established.  I propose to support this Vote.</P>

      <P>The increase of £975 which is shown in this Vote is due to two things, first to the increase in the amount of Land Bonds outstanding and secondly to a transfer of a considerable quantity of second National Loan from New York to Dublin.  The cost of management in America is very small, because the loan in America is in the form of bearer bonds with interest coupons attached, and is in very few denominations, the lowest being 500 dollars. The consequence is that no clerical work is involved in dealing with the loan in America.  It is simply a matter of paying the amount of interest on the coupons as they are presented.</P>

    <P>The increase of £25,200 which is shown in this Vote is due to allowances for a certain small increase in the number of pensions and for a slight increase in the average rate of pension paid.  For instance, in the past year the average rate of pension was 9s. 3d. as compared with 9s. the year before.  There is also another factor which causes it to be necessary to provide an extra sum.  It is that in Dublin the pensions are paid on a Tuesday, and in the present year there will be fifty-three Tuesdays.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that the Minister, when submitting this Vote to the House, referred to the fact that some part of the increase was due to a slight increase in the number of pensions and a slight increase as well in the amount of the pensions. I would be glad if the Minister would give us any explanation of the increase in the number of pensions.  I think it is rather remarkable and interesting.  Is it due to the fact that the percentage of old people in our population is increasing, that the tendency which was manifested in the census and which was so fully set before us in one of the publications by the Department of Industry and Commerce, instead of diminishing was, if anything, becoming more <Col N="202" /> acute?  If so, it would seem to indicate that, notwithstanding the good qualities which the Government so consciously possess, there has not been under their regime that increase in prosperity and in national wellbeing for which they take credit.  I think the same might be said also as to the increase in the amount of the pension, because these pensions are based upon the destitution and poverty of the recipient, and it is to be assumed if the country were growing richer that, as a general rule, the average means of the applicant for a pension would increase, so that the pensions instead of tending to increase, as the Minister has admitted they are now doing, would tend to decrease.  I presume, in view of other cases, particularly those relating to the income tax returns, in which I endeavoured to secure figures from the Minister, figures which would be useful and would assist us in forming an accurate view of the real economic position of the country, if I were to ask the Minister to state the actual increase in the number of pensioners which he anticipates and the actual increase in the average amount of pension paid to them that I should be asking for the information in vain.  If the Minister can give it, I should be very grateful if he would do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the administration of pensions, I think there is a general feeling that the pensions officers interpret the regulations too stringently and with too little sympathy for the applicants.  I know cases where people who apparently, as far as I could judge, as a result of their appearance and as a result of inquiries which I made and of evidence which they furnished, were entitled to the pension, had to wait three or four months before the pension was granted to them. At the same time I do not wish to stress that point too much, because the present economic circumstances of the country are such that we must be careful not to pay pensions to those who are not entitled to them. On the other hand, there are the ordinary considerations of human <Col N="203" /> sympathy and human charity, and if persons at the age of 69 or 69½ years are in very poor circumstances it does seem a real hardship that the inquiries in regard to them should be so meticulously carried out that the payment of the pension to them is deferred often for six or seven months, during which time they may be in real need.  In that connection I should like to know what are the instructions that are issued to the pensions officers.  This matter becomes of importance when we remember that in the discussion upon the Bill to amend the Old Age Pension Acts, a Bill introduced from these Benches, the Minister for Finance stated that in calculating the means of an applicant, who resided in a working-class home the value of his or her board and lodging, of food and shelter, were not taken into consideration.  I do not know whether that is true or not, but I am informed that it is not true: that as a matter of fact these things are taken into consideration and that the pensions officers have instructions to consider them when reporting as to the means of the applicant.</P>
    <P>Again, there is a feeling&mdash;I do not share it, but I know that some people have it&mdash;that in practice the pensions officers tend to over-estimate means to the disadvantage of the claimant. Small farmers are hard hit by the method adopted for valuing land and farm produce.  I have heard it stated that, owing to the way the Act is administered at present, thrifty clean people who maintain an appearance of comfort on means far below the limit which would entitle them to the maximum pension, are likely to be penalised.  Of course, there is a great difference between just administration and unsympathetic administration, but I think if an inquiry into the means of an applicant is made, and if at first sight the general appearance of the applicant's home and of his surroundings appear to indicate that his means are such as to exclude him from the benefits of the Act, there should be a <Col N="204" /> very searching inquiry made on the part of the officer to assure himself that the appearance of comfort was not due to causes other than plentiful means.</P>
    <P>I think that the point which I have made has been mentioned year after year on this Vote.  Possibly, one would think that the Minister had been impressed by it, and would have had some revision made in the instructions issued to his officers.  I have no personal knowledge of the matter, but again I am informed by those who do know, that there has been very little improvement in the manner in which these inquiries are carried out, and that the things which were complained of years ago under this head are still taking place.  Another question that has come under my notice is the manner in which the age of applicants is being determined.  Many of us know that parish records and parish registers were kept in a very unsatisfactory way 60 or 70 years ago, for the reason that in many cases those who were responsible for them were almost illiterate, and often, possibly, those who should have seen that their names were entered in those registers did not attach any importance to the matter, and neglected it. Therefore, the question of determining the age of an applicant becomes a very difficult one, I think.</P>
    <P>I admit also that the position of the pensions officer who has to decide this question, bearing in mind his responsibilities to the State as well as the necessities of the applicant, is bound to be a difficult one. When I turn to the Report of the Old Age Pensions Commission of Inquiry, however, I find there that those who examined this question very carefully recommended that, so far as the age given in marriage certificates is concerned, &ldquo;that the pension authorities, more particularly in the case of women, should exercise great caution in placing reliance on such certificates when there is anything pointing to the possibility of their being inaccurate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That brings to my mind one or two cases which came under my <Col N="205" /> notice in which the age of the applicant was in doubt and in which the pensions officers, so far as I could see, in determining the age, relied solely on these marriage certificates. Now I think that is not right.  I suppose we all, male and female, have our share of vanity, and one form of vanity is that people believe they are younger than they are. That applies particularly to the ladies.  No doubt it is a delicate matter for some people to be asked to state their actual age at the time of marriage.  Investigation has shown that they have been in the habit of understanding their actual age.  Since that is the case, and since it is common knowledge that it is the case, surely it is not right, when there is a doubt in the matter, that one of the deciding factors against an applicant should be the age she entered on the marriage register? I should say that if you were to add possibly five years, or maybe ten years, you would be nearer to the poor woman's exact age at the present day.  I do not think that the Department or the officers allow for that.  I have known cases where one of the points made against an applicant was that the age mentioned in the marriage register was such as not to entitle her to the pension.</P>
    <P>Again, there is the question of the blind pensions.  I think the standard laid down in regard to them is that a person must be unable to perform any work for which eyesight is essential.  I do not think that is quite a fair standard.  I think a better standard could be fixed.  That where a man's normal occupation is of such a nature that he requires rather better than the average eyesight, and that where his eyesight now is such that he is unable to work at that occupation he should be entitled to a pension.  That is not putting it too high.  It means that special consideration should be given to those cases where good eyesight is essential to enable a man to earn his livelihood.  A man may have bad sight and yet be able to do a number of things, but if a man has spent his <Col N="206" /> time doing work of a nature where good eyesight is required, in nine cases out of ten his physique, general character and disposition will be such that he will be unable to do any other work than the particular type of work in which he had been engaged.  If through defective eyesight he is unable to earn his livelihood in that way, then I think he is entitled to an adequate pension. On behalf of Deputy Ward I move:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to vote for the motion to refer the Estimate back.  Some reasons for doing so have been mentioned by Deputy MacEntee, but I want to mention at least one particular reason for not voting for the Estimate.  I have had brought under my notice within the last couple of years many cases which in my view, and in the view of many persons who are qualified to judge as to the age of the applicants, the method of calculating or appraising means was rather questionable. I would like to have some information from the Minister as to the method of calculation of means. Many very deserving applicants for a pension have been turned down on the grounds that they are being maintained by a son or daughter, or in many cases by both.  It does seem strange that because a man or woman may rear a decent son or daughter who would not like to throw one or other of the parents on the street, and because of the sense of duty and filial affection, call it what you like, that son or daughter maintains in a decent and respectable way a mother or father, the calculation of maintenance is such as to preclude that applicant from getting the old age pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view that is an encouragement to a certain class in the community to forget the filial duty they owe to their parents.  I have found that where absolute neglect of the parent was shown the parent was able to get the pension.  It is very poor encouragement to the man or <Col N="207" /> woman who has a sense of responsibility and of duty as regards his parents, to find that perhaps in the same locality another man who has not had that sense of responsibility and duty is able to get that pension and comfort for his parents. Another point I would like to raise on this occasion is the order given by the Minister with regard to making personal representations on behalf of applicants for pensions.</P>

      <P>It does not affect the Minister for Finance.  It affects appeals.  We had a discussion on appeals generally on the Estimate of the Minister for Local Government.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I mentioned that is that in the case of illiterates we frequently get notice from the Department that their cases have been refused and that there are so many days allowed for appeal. In many cases the number of days allowed for appeal has elapsed before they bring the notice to some person who can read it for them, and then they find they are too late to make an appeal.  I suggest <Col N="208" /> to the Minister that some better arrangement should be made for the purpose of calculating the means of applicants for pensions, and we should have something definite from the Minister as to the instructions given to the pensions officers as to how they are to calculate these means.  Deputy MacEntee mentioned the case of applicants who because they were in decent surroundings were refused old age pensions. That again is no encouragement towards thrift, and it is one of the things the Minister should look into.</P>

      <P>I think that some years ago there were grounds for urging a more sympathetic administration of the old age pensions, but I do not think that to-day the same forces are at work against the sympathetic administration of the Act as there were four or five years ago, That, at least, is my experience.  For instance, a very large number of people came to me some years ago, I might say every week, about their pensions, and now only very rarely does anybody come to me on the matter of a pension.  Speaking of my own district, I do not hear any dissatisfaction in regard to the administration of the Act.  Of course, pensions officers have great difficulties to contend with.  In the first instance, it was a well-known fact that a large number of people at the beginning of the operations of the Act got pensions they were really not entitled to get. That was common knowledge, and once they were on they remained on, because it was very difficult to remove them, and to do so was a very unpleasant task for anybody to have to undertake.  Deputy MacEntee said he was afraid that an appearance of comfort militated against an old person getting a pension.  I do not know what it might have been in the beginning, but I do not think that is so now.  I will give a case in point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A man I know something about asked me to interest myself in getting a pension for him.  He struck me as being in too good circumstances. He turned himself out well <Col N="209" /> and his place seemed to be kept in very good order.  I was not sympathetic, I am sorry to say, about his case, and I confess I was quite wrong in that.  The pensions officer who investigated his case found that it was one of those cases where the very best is made of a very tiny income. When I heard the entire case I came to the conclusion that the pensions officer had gone to a very great deal of trouble to find out the facts of the case, and the man, rightly and justly, got his pension.  I am sure there are many other cases of that kind.  Whatever may have occurred at the beginning, I do not think that the pensions officers set out now to prevent people getting pensions.  They are only too anxious that those justly entitled to get pensions should get them.  Of course, one talks from one's own experience, and that is mine.  The pensioners are given every chance of making a good case for their pensions.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee seemed to regard the increased number of pensioners as being evidence of increasing poverty.  I think that is a mistake. I think it is simply that for five or six years past it has been very much easier to get the true ages of applicants; that the registers from the end of the 'fifties were kept in proper order, which they were not before, and that it is now becoming a fairly easy matter to get the true age of an applicant, whether by means of a birth certificate or a marriage certificate.  Previous to the end of the 'fifties it was common knowledge that the registers were kept in the most shameful way.  They were kept in the vestries of churches in many cases and were very indifferently looked after, if looked after at all.  That is not the case now and it cannot be for the future.  All these particulars are recognised to be of the greatest importance and are most carefully kept.  I think that in every way the Act is working well and is being appreciated thoroughly by old people.  In fact no other Act of Parliament has been more appreciated <Col N="210" /> by the people than the Old Age Pensions Act.  There is probably no Act that has done more good or that has reached more worthy people.  I am glad to think that everywhere, as far as I can judge, the Act is being administered honestly and well and is bringing forth, and will continue to bring forth, very good fruit to the State.</P>

      <P>I have nothing but approval for the Old Age Pensions Act and the way in which it is carried out in general, but there is one case that I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister.  An old man of 78 years of age, whom I had known about twenty years ago, came to me in the first week of April to say that he had received notice that his old age pension was being stopped.  He had been received into a home which provided him with housing, clothing and food, in addition to which he gets eightpence per week to supply him with tobacco. That eightpence would not go very far.  I do not think he would suffer from nicotine poisoning as a result of the three-quarters of an ounce of tobacco per week which he would get for it.  He is, however, left without anything for tram fares or other small things like that.  He appealed to me to go to the chairman of the pensions committee on his behalf. I said that I could not ask for a restoration of his pension as he was now in receipt of all the things that a pension would provide for, except that he had not got much money.  I said I would write to the chairman of the pensions committee and suggest that he should get a small sum, because I felt it was a pity that an old man like that should be left with only eightpence per week to provide for all the little necessaries he mentioned. I wrote to the chairman of the pensions committee suggesting that a very small amount should be given to him, but I received no answer.  I should like to know whether the Minister thinks that is a case in which I was entitled to ask that the man should receive a small pension.  I do not think it was quite <Col N="211" /> fair to cut off all the pension which he had been receiving.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Clery Mr. Clery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clery</NameTxt>
      <P>From time to time I have received complaints from members of old age pensions committees that recommendations made by them are very often not entertained by the Old Age Pensions Department.  Members of old age pensions committees are sometimes very hard worked. They meet fairly often, and in thickly populated districts have a large number of cases to go through. It is not very popular at times to be a member of one of these committees. I know that the members of the committees in many parts of Mayo are very conscientious, and do their best as far as the calculation of means and going into the circumstances and age of claimants are concerned.  When they make a unanimous recommendation that a pension of a certain amount should be allowed, very often their decision is opposed by the pensions officer, and the case is appealed.  The result is that they sometimes feel&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;that they are slighted when some of their decisions do not carry more weight with the Department. I know that pensions officers are very hard worked.  They have a large number of cases to inquire into, and the work does not seem to be very popular.  In fact, there is an impression abroad, which I believe myself is a wrong impression, that pensions officers are simply out to deprive as many old people as possible of the pension.  I do not hold that view at all, but it shows the atmosphere that they have to work in.  I think, however, I would be right in saying, in spite of the fact that pensions officers do work hard and conscientiously, that many of the officers sent down the country are young and entirely inexperienced. I know that some of them who are put in charge of districts and who are supposed to value the stock and produce and everything else of claimants for pensions, have no experience whatever of farming, <Col N="212" /> and know nothing as to the value of land, stock, crops and houses.  It is unfair to these pensions officers to place them in such a position.  I am convinced from what I know of the working of the Act that very often these young pensions officers make returns of claimants' means which are entirely too high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount paid out in old age pensions is very large, and when such an amount of money is involved and such a large number of deserving cases come forward, it should not be impossible to discover some means of improving the administration of the Act.  A committee of inquiry was set up some years ago to go into the working of the Act, and very valuable and helpful information was given by people in different parts of the country.  I think that the report of that committee has not been attended to by the Department. I know that some of the recommendations were impossible, but I think that information was given to that committee which would be very helpful to the Department in having the Act administered in a better and more sympathetic manner.  It is true that if a claimant keeps his dwelling-house neatly it has a lot to do with the calculation of means.  For instance, in the West of Ireland, you may take it that £7 is the average valuation in any part of the country, but I have had cases of people of only £7 valuation who found it impossible to get the old age pension. That is because they have neat dwellings, and because they were industrious in the past.  They have no large means at present, but the moment there is found the appearance of industry and neatness about a person's place, I have known it to be impossible for such persons, with farms of only £7 valuation, to get a pension to the value of ten or nine shillings per week.  I think the greatest drawback we have under the Act at present is the method adopted in the calculation of a person's means.  For instance, if, during the present month, means are calculated for the claimant of the old age pension, you will find that <Col N="213" /> they take into account the value of an acre or two of meadow, an acre or two of oats, and an acre of potatoes, and then they will value the amount of stock which has to be reared upon that farm for a year. They never take into consideration that the stocks bring with them the produce of the acre of potatoes and the two acres of oats and the two acres of meadow.  They value it twice over&mdash;the cattle that have eaten the produce and the produce itself.  That is one method.  I know they value things in that way, and I think it is wrong and unfair to the applicant for the old age pension.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Deputy Sir James Craig mention a case in his experience where a person who was taken into a county home or some charitable institution was deprived of his pension.  It is unfortunate that he and other Deputies did not express their views some time ago when an attempt was made to remedy that difficulty in the Act.  It is a very great hardship that an old person who is so helpless as to have to go into the county home should thereby be deprived of his pension. It was attempted by the Old Age Pension Bill recently to remedy that, but the Government opposed it.  I think they should endeavour to have that clause remedied, and if they did they would be doing a great deal to help a number of people throughout the country, and particularly in the West of Ireland.</P>
    <P>It has been said that this Old Age Pension Act is probably one of the most beneficent of all the Acts that are in force at the present time.  In fact, I know that where there are two old people in a house in the West drawing 18/- or 20/- a week between them, that sum practically goes to support the whole family of seven or eight or nine, supplemented with whatever little they get from the farm.  It certainly is an Act that is appreciated by the people, and I think it should not be impossible for the Department, having the experience they have now after a number of years through their Inspectors going through the country, to improve the working of <Col N="214" /> the Act in some little way.  When appeals are made, it takes a very long time before a decision is given. I know cases where six months elapsed from the date of the appeal to the decision.</P>
    <P>There is one other method I think by which a good deal of expense could be saved.  If a case was decided, say, last week on appeal against a claimant, it will be admitted by the Department that in connection with that appeal certain information is placed in their hands. In the same district, perhaps in a remote end of the West, within the next three weeks, there are other appeals and it is decided to send an Inspector down.  The Inspector is sent down to investigate two or three cases in a remote district.  The journey is a long one and it costs a good deal.  It may be that in that same district four or five applicants have been turned down by the Department, and simply because their cases are not before the Department at the moment, the Inspector has no power to go into these cases and thereby save the time, trouble and expense of having again to go into these cases in two or three months.</P>
    <P>I know what I suggest is against the rule.  The Inspectors know the working of the Act and are so efficient in carrying out the provisions of the Act that there is no danger they will allow their sympathy to carry them too far in the direction of the claimant.  When these people wrote to the Department, they were informed that their cases were decided and that nothing could be done until these cases came up again.  That is quite reasonable enough.  But I suggest that in cases where an Inspector is going to the same district he should look up the list for the last three months and see the number of cases that were turned down on appeal; then when down in the district he could easily inspect the ten cases that were turned down as well as the three or four cases that he is sent down to investigate.  I throw that out simply as a suggestion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="215" /> As regards the Department, I must say that they do deal swiftly and efficiently with any communications sent by Deputies.  Sometimes, I object myself when I get letters from the Department acknowledging anything sent them.  A lot of time must be taken up in the Department simply acknowledging letters from Deputies.  There is certainly no necessity, in my view, to acknowledge everything that is sent.  I would much prefer if they paid greater attention to what was stated in the communication than in acknowledging letters by return of post, which they usually do and for which I feel grateful at times.  As to the Committee that I mentioned already, if it did not make any recommendations which the Minister or his Department would think useful for the improvement of the Act, I think something should be done in the way of setting up some Committee of Inquiry.  With the help of Deputies, many of whom have wider experience now of the methods of calculating means than they had some years ago, I am sure very valuable information and assistance would be given to the Department in securing better administration of the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not suppose any Estimate will be passed more readily than that for old age pensions.  It has been widely discussed in the present year and I do not wish to take up time in repeating any of the things that have been said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing I would like to stress, and that is a more liberal interpretation of the Act.  There is a feeling in the country, not alone amongst applicants for the old age pension, but also amongst others who never expect to be applicants, that a drastic change has taken place since the introduction of the Act, and that they are dealt with rather severely, perhaps not with intent, but it works out that way.  At the time the Act was passed in 1908 a great many of us took an interest in it and examined its provisions.  It was clearly <Col N="216" /> pointed out at that time that it purported to benefit a class that the poor law did not benefit&mdash;that, in fact, to get the old age pension was to put the hall-mark of decency on the person who got it.  There is a feeling in the country now which, I think, in a great many cases is well founded, that applicants for the old age pension are taken on the lowest ground and examined as closely and on as low a level as if they were being examined for outdoor relief. The irony of the situation is this, that in considering cases one comes into contact with, it is found that when persons who have made no provision for old age or who squandered what they earned as it came along, apply for the old age pension they get it easily, whereas persons who have been industrious and who had to struggle to keep themselves in decency, and their homes tidy, are examined very closely and perhaps turned down.</P>
    <P>In common with others I would ask that border-line cases, which would not be very many, might be given a more liberal interpretation than that given at present.  I have never understood by what method pensions officers calculate the means of old age pension applicants.  I have a fair knowledge of conditions in the country, and I know what a farm might yield if it were worked by the owner, or if it were let.  In examining a few cases that came within my knowledge, I could not get the income anywhere near that which the pensions officer arrive at for elimination.  It would be interesting to know how it is arrived at, or what is the basis of calculation.  A great many places are let by public auction or privately for a season, and it is found that there is a very small margin after paying the rent and the rates.  That margin may be all the person has to live upon, and yet in calculating the means a much higher rate is fixed.  The number that are affected in this way is not great, and if, as was said in another connection to-day, those people who live with relatives and have just the bare means of subsistence were <Col N="217" /> allowed a few shillings for pocket money, something that they might call their own, it would be all to the good.  We will never ruin the State by extravagance of that kind to our old people, and the money will be spent in the country.  Anything we can do towards being charitable or considerate to our aged poor will have the sympathy of the whole community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOReilly" hpid="Mr. T. O'Reilly Mr. T. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to blind pensions, I consider that doctors sent down by the Department are altogether too strict with the applicants. I know cases in West Kerry where the local doctor certified that claimants were unable to do their work because of defective sight, yet none of these cases was passed by the inspector from the Department. I consider that the value put on a Kerry cow is altogether too high. I do not think any discrimination is made between claimants who are able to move about and claimants who are unable to do any work.  In the case of an applicant unable to do any work the value of a cow should be a little over the grazing value, or what a man would obtain from people who had cattle grazing on the land.  In the case of an applicant able to move around, the entire emoluments derived from a Kerry cow could not exceed £6 per annum. The valuation that has been put on a Kerry cow by the pensions officers is much higher than that.  I have nothing to say against the pension officers in my district.  Of course, they are bound by the regulations of the Department for which they work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to draw attention to another matter to which Deputy Clery referred, with regard to the appearance of the houses of applicants for the pension.  It is altogether wrong to calculate the means on the appearance of the houses.  If that system is pursued, the more claimants improve their houses and the surroundings the more they will injure their chance of getting pensions. The surroundings of a house should not militate against an applicant's claim to a pension.  As far as <Col N="218" /> my experience of the inspectors who are sent down to investigate these cases is concerned, I think they are waste of money.  One inspector who came down to my part never saw the cattle on the farm he came to inspect.  He asked a couple of questions and went away, and of course confirmed the officer's appeal.  I hope the Minister will bear in mind what I have said about Kerry cows, and that a proper valuation will be put on them, so that the old people will have a better chance of availing of the Old Age Pensions Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>As some Deputies are aware, there are about 27,000 claims and questions to be dealt with every year.  That is, there are 27,000 cases that have to be investigated and examined.  Of the 27,000 cases a great number are bound to be more or less border-line cases, and a certain number must be cases in which there will be some grounds for dissatisfaction with the decisions.  It is impossible to help that.  Supposing that of the 27,000 cases there are 8,000 border-line cases that are difficult to determine, then it is absolutely bound to happen that in a certain number of these there will be decisions in which persons other than those who decide them would say a mistake was made.  I can only assure the Dáil that the Acts are being sympathetically administered.  When the old age pensions were reduced in 1924 action was then taken, in view of the reduction in the amount of the pensions, to impress upon those charged with the administration of the Acts the necessity for taking as sympathetic a view of the cases as was possible.  No change has been made in that general direction, and I am satisfied that the officers who are concerned in administering the old age pensions are acting on that principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, the individual outlook of the officer will affect the treatment of a case.  You will meet one officer who may be rather easygoing, more inclined to be generous and more sympathetie than another. You will meet officers who are, perhaps, stricter than the general <Col N="219" /> rule, whose outlook is to follow rules rigidly and to examine into evidence. So long as you are dealing with individuals you cannot get absolutely uniform treatment.  If you have a particular officer in a district there may be complete satisfaction, but if he is succeeded by another officer you may have a number of complaints, although both officers were simply trying to do their duty with absolute impartiality, and to treat applicants fairly.  The outlook, as everybody knows, of individual men dealing with these cases, will be somewhat different.  But in spite of that fact I am satisfied, from everything I have been able to ascertain in following up representations that have been made to me, that the Acts are being sympathetically administered.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee asked by what number pensioners had increased. The increase is very small.  We are estimating for a possible increase in the present year of 250.  Whether that increase will be realised or not we do not know.  At least six or seven years ago those who were dealing with old age pensions administration in the Revenue warned us that the decline which had been taking place so rapidly in the number of old age pensioners had come to an end and that it was quite possible that within a year or two we would have an increase.  Such a thing as greater ease in proving age, as mentioned by Deputy Wolfe, might be one factor.  Another factor is that there has been a slight increase in the average age.  Measures that have been taken for improving public health, or other factors, have caused the prospects of life to increase slightly, and of course a very slight increase in that way brings about an appreciable increase in the number of pensioners. Maintenance in a working class home is not estimated at such a value as to render an applicant ineligible for a pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course there may be cases in which it would render a person ineligible for the full pension, but in the great mass of, say, the working-class homes of Dublin, maintenance would still leave a person eligible for a full pension. The value of farm produce is calculated by the old age pensions officers on a basis that has been arrived at as a result of consultations which have taken place more than once with officers of the Department of Agriculture.  But of course in dealing with the actual value of a farm which is being worked there are so many factors to be taken into account that there, more than anywhere else, the judgment of the individual officer comes in.  You can base nothing much on the valuation of a farm, and you can base very little on the acreage of a farm, as so many factors come into account.  A farm may have a high valuation and still the value may be very low.  A farm may be large but may be of such a character as to be of little value, and on the other hand, a very small farm of a particular quality of land and in a particularly favourable situation may be of a relatively high value.</P>
      <P>Many things have to be taken into account, and there the individual judgment of the officer comes in a great deal.  But the officer is always in consultation with his immediate superior, the surveyor, and while occasionally pensions officers are relatively young and inexperienced, one cannot help that, because new men have to be taken into the service and put on the work.  But the surveyor has always a considerable number of years service and is always a man of wide experience. There is close consultation between the officer and the surveyor, and in the case of a young and inexperienced officer the surveyor will take particular care to give assistance. Everything that can be done has been done to ensure that the calculations of the value of farms are fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that the appearance of a house is taken into account.  I would not like to say that it has <Col N="221" /> never happened, and I would not like to say that the appearance of a house may not create some prejudice or prepossession in the mind of the officer, but an officer always knows that a place may be clean and well tended although the people are very poor, and he also knows&mdash;he would have very little experience of the country if he did not&mdash;that a house may be the opposite of clean and well tended, although the people may not be too badly off.  I do not think people have their means assessed high because their houses are clean and well kept.  You have, however, to take into account the fact that people who tend their houses well have probably worked their farms well, and it is absolutely at the basis of the Old Age Pensions Acts that means are what count. One person may be needy because, as some Deputy said, he has squandered his money as it came into his hands; he may have drunk it, or he may have spent it in any foolish way that he liked.  Nevertheless, if he is in need and is without means he is entitled to a pension.  It may happen that some other person, who has just enough means to be ineligible for a pension, has those means because of extraordinary industry and as a result of practising economy during his entire life, and yet because need is the basis of the claim for a pension he is ruled out.  It is at the basis of our pensions code, and the only way we can get over that, which on the face of it does seem unfair, would be to remove the means qualification altogether.  But the removal of the means qualification would, I think, more than double our old age pensions bill, so that we cannot contemplate doing it, and we must be prepared to suffer the apparent unfairness of the person who has been thrifty and hardworking being penalised because of his thrift and hard work.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Deputy Wolfe say that the administration of the Act is more sympathetic than it was a few years ago.  That bears out my statement that the instructions which we gave some years ago have <Col N="222" /> been carried out in practice.  Deputy Sir James Craig asked me a question about a man who was 78 years of age, and who had gone to a home where he had housing, clothing, food and a small allowance.  The Deputy asked me if that man could be given anything.  Whether he could be given anything really depends on the value of his maintenance.  If the housing, clothing and food that he gets are of such a quality as to bring his means above the amount allowed in the Act, then he cannot get anything. It is really a matter of fact and the determining of the value of what he has.</P>
    <P>From the beginning of old age pension legislation, maintenance has been taken into account as means. Suggestions were made that the counting of maintenance was something that began since the Free State was established.  That is not so. Maintenance at all times was taken into account, and, of course, maintenance in an institution is to be taken into account, just the same as maintenance in the house of a relative or others.  Deputy Clery said members of old age pensions committees felt that it was a slight on them to have their decisons challenged, questioned or over-ruled.  I do not think that they need feel that. The pensions officer also has many of his appeals refused, and he has no grounds for regarding himself as slighted because the appeals officer refuses to uphold the appeal.  The pensions officer has a duty, and if he is not satisfied with the decision of the committee his duty is to appeal. I should say he is just as likely himself to be turned down as he is to get the decision of the committee reversed. I do know that the appeals officer pays a great deal of attention in considering appeals to the decisions of a committee which has got a reputation for doing its work well and carefully.  I know that there are committees which the appeals officer thinks less of than of others. There are committees which he regards as doing their work somewhat carelessly, and, in those cases, he would not pay a great deal of attention <Col N="223" /> to their decisions; that is, if he were in doubt.  If he were in doubt about the facts before him, he would not give their decisions much weight. On the other hand, there are committees which would influence him very much by what they had decided; he would be influenced by the result of their investigations.</P>
    <P>I am informed, and I am positive about it, that the system of valuing things doubly which Deputy Clery suggests exists, does not in fact exist.  Officers are sufficiently well coached in their business not to fall into that particular sort of error.</P>
    <P>As regards blind pensions, I had at one time in mind an amendment of the definition of blindness, but although a great many efforts were made to find a new definition, it was found impossible to devise a formula that would not be open to great objection. It was decided to let the words in the existing Act stand.  It was decided, however, to deal with applications, for blind pensions especially, very sympathetically.  I think that has been done.  I do not believe that doctors who are sent as inspectors by the Department of Local Government are too strict in the matter. There is no doubt that before the system of inspection was introduced, and when pensions were given on the certificates of local inspectors, large numbers of persons received blind pensions who were not at all blind.  In fact, hundreds of them received pensions to which they were not entitled.  I remember hearing, when the system of inspection began, that in one of the very early cases the medical officer, when he went to the house, found the &ldquo;blind pensioner&rdquo; with a newspaper spread out before him, picking winners.  A great many of them were able to live on their pensions, and tried to supplement that by selecting winners.  I know that there is no attempt to confine the blind pensions to people who are stone blind or nearly stone blind.  There is no rigid adherence to the very narrow definition of the Act.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, what Deputy <Col N="224" /> MacEntee asked me is going very far.  The Act says that no person shall be entitled to a blind pension who has eyesight sufficient to do any work.  That is adhered to; but, on the other hand, to say that a person is entitled to a blind pension because he could not do the particular sort of work he was doing before is going very far to the other side.  It might mean that a person with quite good eyesight, better than many people who never put in a claim for a blind pension, would be entitled to receive that assistance.  I think that nothing can be done except to administer the Blind Pensions Act as it has been administered during the last few years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be things a watchmaker could do.  There might be classes of work which he could do, although his sight might not enable him to follow the trade to which he was accustomed.  That is the sort of matter that is really taken into account to a considerable extent at present in administering the Act; but it would be wrong to give a pension to a man who might not be able to do the particular job to which he was accustomed, but who might have, perhaps, much better sight than quite a lot of his neighbours who never put in for a blind pension.  The only thing that can be done is to look as sympathetically as possible at each individual case, giving, where there is <Col N="225" /> doubt in the matter, the benefit of that doubt to the pensioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many suggestions are made from time to time in regard to the administration of old age pensions, and a great deal of thought has been given by Ministers and officials to meeting the wishes of Deputies and others in the matter.  I think as much as can reasonably be done is being done.  It has to be borne in mind that if a pension is granted it means an outlay of anything from £150 to £200 or more to the State. A proposition that is going to cost the State £150 or £200 has to be examined with a good deal of care. If it was the business of officers to grant pensions we might have the <Col N="226" /> pensions bill swollen, while we might not be giving any great assistance to people in particular need of it.  There is no other way of dealing with the matter except to have the officers deal with the proposals impartially, as they have been doing. Deputies, I think, could remember in that instance that there is no blame or discredit attaching to an officer for granting pensions or for letting pensions through, and he obtains no credit for stopping pensions. It is simply part of the ordinary duty which he has to do in an impersonal way.</P>

      <P>I already explained on Second Reading what the estimated cost would be to the Central Fund of the proposed legislation in connection with vocational education.  I indicated roughly that when the scheme was in full working order it would add a sum of between £150,000 and £160,000 to the amount of money paid out by the Oireachtas, or an advance of from £8,000 to £10,000, spread over a period of from fifteen to twenty years.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;To insert after the word &lsquo;pursuits,&rsquo; lines 28/29, the words: &lsquo;instruction in the Irish language and literature, national history, music, topography and folklore.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister has been considering this matter.  The purpose of the amendment is to secure that instruction in the Irish language and literature, national history, music, topography and folklore&mdash;such work as is being done in the national schools higher grade and in the Irish classes at technical schools&mdash;will be continued.  These schemes are not expressly excluded from the Bill, but I think that it would be advisable if they were expressly <Col N="229" /> included.  I should like to hear what the Minister has to say on the point.  Perhaps he would accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that I can accept the amendment because, as the Deputy said, I do not think it is necessary and I object to singling out these things in a Bill that is essentially a vocational training Bill.  I referred on Second Reading to a certain kind of propaganda that is being carried out in this respect.  I am not, of course, objecting to that in itself but I explained on Second Reading what my attitude was, namely, that I think that the section as it stands makes the matter sufficiently clear; but if there is any doubt it can be made clearer.  It is stated in the section that the expression &ldquo;continuation education&rdquo; means &ldquo;education to continue and supplement education provided in elementary schools.&rdquo;  Practically all the matters referred to in the amendment would come under that proviso.  Furthermore, I dislike seeming to expand formally, if I may say so, though not actually, the scope of the Bill. In the demand put forward in public in support of this and similar amendments, it was stated that they wanted not merely a Vocational Bill but a Vocational Cultural Bill. It is because I think that the amendment to some extent aims at doing that and would therefore give a wrong idea of the general purpose of the Bill&mdash;though I am not sure what the word &ldquo;cultural&rdquo; exactly means &mdash;that I resist the amendment.  It is true that on legal interpretation there may be some doubt about the phrase &ldquo;and includes general and practical training&rdquo; and as to whether it does not limit the previous words.  If, however, there is any such danger, I will have it cleared up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as Irish classes carried on at present are concerned, I gave my views pretty clearly on Second Reading. Where good work is being done, it is not proposed to interfere with it, but I hope that in a few years that will form portion of the <Col N="230" /> course, and that young people will be expected to attend courses in other subjects than those of a purely cultural character.  There is, however, no bar on adults attending, and there is no reason why they should not attend one course alone, such as that in Irish.  I want to make it clear that where effective work is being done there is no intention to interfere.  As I have said, I dislike formally to expand the scope of the Bill, as in my opinion it would raise far-reaching questions in educational control.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether this would be the proper place to raise the matter, but I would like to know whether the Minister would consider the case of teachers of Irish in rather remote districts in which this Bill might not be in operation.  I think that the Minister's phrase about formally expanding the Bill is somewhat ominous.  There is another point to which I want to refer, and that is in reference to scholarships given in technical schools, to Irish Colleges, or to the Gaeltacht.  Is there anything which says that they can be financed through the Bill? There are hundreds of scholarships given in Dublin to Irish Colleges and to the Gaeltacht for a fortnight in the summer.  That is good national work, and I would like to know whether such scholarships would be excluded.</P>

    <P>This amendment is put down for the purpose of eliciting some information.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this section will be to destroy the distincttive existence of one very important educational body in the country&mdash; the North Wicklow Joint Technical Instruction Committee.  I have received representations in regard to the proposal and in regard to the effect of the Bill on the Committee. It is pointed out that &ldquo;only three years ago the Government approved of this area with the consent of the local public bodies and it is now the general wish that a protest should be made against the abolition of the Committee under the new Bill. During the past three years the popularity of the technical instruction schemes in this area has been marked by increased enrolment, examination successes and attendance grants.  Under the administration of a large county scheme it will not be possible to concentrate on the development of this area and most of the past work would be upset and undone.  Bray Urban District with its rapidly increasing population is as important as many of the areas given in the first schedule and the people of Bray would feel obliged if <Col N="233" /> you propose that it with the adjoining No. 2 Rathdown Rural area would be added to the list of towns already given in the above schedule. The population of Bray is now over 9,000 and of the whole of North Wicklow area is approximately 15,000.  If the Minister would be so kind as to agree to this suggestion it would be necessary to add the words &ldquo;Joint Urban and Rural&rdquo; to the second line of Section 6 No. 4; the first line of (b) Section 7.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think that proposal deserves a good deal of consideration in view of the special circumstances that exist in Bray.  The present scheme has worked extremely well.  There is real enthusiasm in that town for technical education and the people who are working the scheme of the local committee are extremely keen on making the classes successful. They have been, I think, particularly successful up to the present. Hardly any town can show better results or better attendances and, as Bray is a town with no particular industry and with a large population who will mostly have to distribute themselves over the rest of the country, it would be important, I think, that the existing system should not be abolished without very careful consideration.  I may be springing the matter on the Minister. I do not know if he has heard anything about it before, and consequently I would not ask him, if that were the case, to give a decision now.  I do not think that he will turn down the proposal without some little consideration, because it happens that this matter is taken very seriously by the local committee, which, in my opinion and to my own knowledge, is one of the best committees of the kind in Ireland.</P>

      <P>There is actually no amendment before me, but in answer to Deputy Moore I might point out that if you split County Wicklow, as suggested, into two areas under the new system, you will have two uneconomic areas. It is absolutely necessary to have something like economic areas as far <Col N="234" /> as possible to work the scheme. There are other counties in which some of the best worked schemes, so far as counties are concerned, are carried on, and which can claim to be split up with much more force than Wicklow.  Take County Cork, for instance, where there is a remarkably well-worked scheme.  The actual size of the county, which was adduced by Deputy Moore as an argument at the opening of his statement, would not in itself be an argument there.  If what he urges were to be granted to Bray, there would be many other schemes in the country where the local town council might very well claim to take in a certain amount of the county area. In fact I have heard proposals of that kind put before me.  As a matter of fact I had a proposal of that kind put before me yesterday.  I think on the whole the scheme in the Bill is a very different scheme from that which has been suggested by the proposed amendment. Though I am quite willing to give every consideration to the point of view put forward by Bray Technical Committee, I cannot at the present moment hold out any hope that I will be able to meet it.  The suggestion that because there are no industries in Bray it should get a special scheme of technical instruction does not seem quite a good argument.</P>
      <P>If you had a number of specific industries in Bray it would be an excellent case, it seems to me, for starting a separate scheme.  The argument that Deputy Moore urged rather tells the other way.  However, between now and the Report Stage, I shall give the matter consideration, and if I think there is a case made out I will reconsider the matter, but at the moment at any rate I can only say that I will consider the suggestion.</P>

      <P>I am very much obliged to the Minister for his promise, but with regard to the argument I put forward, I have only got this representation to-day.  What I have in mind is you have there a town that has a very poor hinterland from the point of view of agriculture. <Col N="235" /> It has no industry of any kind.  Its technical education is more important to the people there than to most places.  They have nothing else to rely upon.  If they cannot get technical training they have no outlook in the world.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 5:</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), page 7, line 41, to delete the word &ldquo;eight&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;five.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment and the following three amendments are really provisional. They look forward to amendment 19 to Section 44.  Deputies who were here on the Second Reading will remember that I expressed a certain amount of doubt as to whether the actual provisions that stand in the Bill were really the best way of achieving the double object I had in mind, a satisfactory committee, on the one hand, and control of the rates remaining with the local rating authority on the other hand. I have since then had representations from different parts of the country objecting to the limitation on the choice of the council as to the type of member they should put forward. I had that from technical committees; I had it also from some urban districts, and I think these four amendments, together with amendment 19 to Section 44, achieved much more definitely the purpose I had in mind when I put forward the original proposals.  The suggestion now is that we reduce the number that must be members of the electing body of the county council <Col N="237" /> from 8 to 5.  In the case of the urban districts that form part of the county, as they are not for the purpose of this Bill rating authorities, full opportunity is given as to the members they will elect.  In connection with the rate to be struck, the proposal roughly is this: The Committee as a whole consider the scheme; they consider the cost of the scheme, how much they will require from the local rate and the corresponding grant, as I explained, from the Government.  They put up that to a special committee, called the estimates committee consisting of members of the committee who are members of the county council.  That estimates committee will have power not to reduce the rate but they will have power to refuse to increase the rate.  I think the new proposal meets the double object I have in view much more definitely than the original proposal.</P>

      <P>That is not my definition, but I have a doubt as to what it means and I do not know why cultural associations should be consulted more than any other associations connected with education. In fact, I do not know what body might not claim to be consulted under this amendment.  There is hardly a body in the country that does not profess at all events to be interested in education.  Possibly the interest does not always display itself very practically, but I can understand associations of primary teachers, secondary teachers, technical <Col N="239" /> teachers, managers, farmers' unions, trade unions&mdash;they are consulted definitely in connection with industry&mdash;possibly football clubs and the Gaelic League.  There is hardly an association that would not come in.  I think it is too vague and I think that this is really meant as a pointer to the county councils.  There is a very definite indication there that they should pay attention to persons interested in education, and I think that sufficiently meets the requirements of the case.</P>

It might be desirable to put it to the Minister for consideration that there should be some representative of the local body on every sub-committee to keep the committee in touch with the main body.

The point is that a sub-committee may be appointed which would never meet more than five times, and it seems a bit hard to exclude members of that committee who have attended every meeting from getting the expenses of attendance at the actual meetings which take place.  I would ask the Minister to consider whether that point does not require attention.</P>

In that Act it is definitely provided that the chief executive officers of local authorities shall be appointed by the Appointments Commissioners, through the machinery of that Act.  What the Deputy's proposal, therefore, amounts to is to repeal the Local Appointments Act so far as this particular office is concerned.  A committee of the Dáil sat recently on that particular matter.  They did not recommend any curtailment of the powers of the Local Appointments Commissioners.  In fact, they suggested an increase of these powers in so far as this is concerned.  I also suggest that actually deleting the section would not effect the Deputy's <Col N="243" /> purpose because this is a local authority according to the definition section of the Act of 1926.</P>

      <P>There is just one point in connection with this section. I think it would be a good thing, even though a dismissal could only take place with the approval of the Minister, that some regulations should be laid down for the security of those who are engaged&mdash;that a certain form of procedure must be gone through in any case of dismissal. That might be covered by regulations rather than appear in the Act.  I think, for instance, that it should not be possible that a dismissal could take place without due notice or that the person who is threatened with dismissal should not be given an opportunity of defending himself.  It would be possible under the strict letter of sub-section (4) at any meeting of the council without any notice whatever&mdash;it may be a snap meeting&mdash;to dismiss any particular servant or officer and the only safeguard is this one &ldquo;with the approval of the Minister.&rdquo;  I grant it is very good.</P>

      <P>The word &ldquo;officer&rdquo; occurs.  Take the ordinary officer or even the ordinary servant.  After all, they have a certain tenure of office.  They must get notice.  They have their remedy if they do not.  The notice varies in the different cases.  Take the ordinary person who is employed subject to a month's notice.  I do not know on what terms a hall porter or a person of that type may be employed.  What the Deputy suggests is really to give him longer than the ordinary month's notice.  It would amount in practice to that.  What is aimed at <Col N="244" /> in this section is not to give rights of that particular kind.  The ordinary officer has a long tenure and he has his remedy undoubtedly.  I cannot see how he could be effectively dismissed without the thing being fully ventilated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with the attestation clause which was put into the 1925 Act.  I think the Minister, or anybody else, will admit that the <Col N="245" /> time has now come when, in the interests of education and of all parties concerned, it would be well to remove that clause, and from this Bill in particular.  At the time it was introduced political feelings were running very high.  The imaginings of Ministers at the time about certain individuals who were employed by technical committees forced them to introduce that clause into the 1925 Act.  Its only effect was to remove certain individuals from appointments they held under technical committees.  That was the effect of it, though these people were doing very good work for the committees employing them.  I believe that if this section is insisted upon by the Minister it will have a bampering effect so far as the operations of this Bill are concerned.  It certainly will be strongly objected to by a number of people likely to be employed under the Bill.  If we thought that any good would accrue from the inclusion of it in the Bill we would accept it.  I think, however, it will be generally agreed that too stringent rules or anything calculated to have a hampering effect, particularly in the case of people employed on educational work, is not good at the present day.  There is a good deal of talk from time to time about the value of cultural education.  If, for instance, teachers are appointed under this Bill and are known, say, to be enthusiastic in language circles or in any other sphere in connection with education, is not their enthusiasm going to be sapped to a certain extent by having to subscribe to a political test of this kind, because it is nothing more than that?</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants proof of the sincerity of teachers in doing their work then let him include a test different from this one, a test, say, to satisfy the committee and the Minister as to the value of the work they do.  In the absence of a test such as this, if teachers do not give satisfaction the remedy for dealing with them is in the hands of the Minister because he can dismiss them. I believe that if this section were deleted it would be a good thing, and <Col N="246" /> would be regarded as a generous gesture from the Minister.  I hope the Minister now realises that the introduction of this test in the 1925 Act did harm in educational circles from the very beginning.  I believe, if he insists on its inclusion in this Bill, that it will continue to do harm.</P>

I should not like to take up the position that I could dismiss a person merely because he held certain views.

      <P>I object to its being attacked piecemeal here. The resolution is a reasonable one. They are only asked to declare allegiance to the Irish Free State and to its Constitution as by law established. The change proposed is to make the declaration a little more acceptable to their intelligence if not to their <Col N="247" /> feelings, because the actual declaration as it stands is to a certain extent not quite full of sense inasmuch as it requires the performance of duties to be done to the satisfaction not of the Minister for Education but the Minister for Local Government.  That is the Act as it was passed.  The only change I propose to make in the existing law is to substitute for the Minister for Local Government and Public Health the Minister for Education as the person who has to be satisfied with <Col N="248" /> regard to the performance of duties. That is much easier now when everybody more or less accepts the Free State than it was at the time when this resolution was introduced.  I am afraid I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: That Section 25 stand part of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDavis" hpid="Mr. Davis Mr. Davis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davis</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understand the section rightly it means the continuation of the existing law under which the local bodies have to bear the whole responsibility for the pensions of the officers.  I have always considered that unfair.  The number of officers under this Bill will be considerably increased, and there will be a corresponding increase in the amount that will have to be paid by the local authorities, and which will become unreasonable.  In these circumstances I hope the Minister will see his way to reconsider the position and make an arrangement whereby the State will bear a share of the responsibility now borne by the local authorities, who at present have to shoulder too much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a point that has been brought before me continuously under the existing law.  In practice, what it amounts to is this: whole-time technical teachers get pensions under the Act of 1925, which is referred to here.  It is simply proposed in this Bill to continue the existing provisions.  Strong representations were made to me on more than one occasion in the past couple of years that that was very unfair, because in practice it amounted to this, as things worked out, that if it were necessary to meet a pension there was no limit to the amount of rate that the local authority might raise for technical education purposes.  Consequently, it worked out that in the case of pensions and gratuities the total burden under the existing law, namely, the Local Government Act, 1925, was borne by the local authority.  Deputy Davis asks that I should change that; that, in fact, I should relieve the local authority of the burden that actually by the present law is theirs. The liability at the moment is not much, but he asks that I should relieve them of the liability that there is on them to meet the charges for pensions of those who are at present in office, who have not gone out on pension, but who are whole-time teachers entitled to pension.  I have often pointed out that in this country the State bears a very disproportionate charge for the cost of education.  Against that it was urged on me that if the State contributed to the salaries it ought to contribute to the pensions.  I will admit that the representations made to me were very strong, and I am prepared to reconsider between now and the Report Stage whether it could not be possible in the case of those in future going out on pension for the State to refund to the local rating authority some portion of the cost of the pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that this is connected with the whole question of State grants to these vocational committees.  Deputy Corish has an amendment to Section 51 which would authorise the use of some of the State grant for the general purposes and general costs of the vocational committees.  I do not say that would be the best way in which to proceed, but it seems to me that the two things are connected. I dare say we shall hear from the Minister later on as to the particular way in which the State grant is to be used.  From the point of view of the security of the person who gets the pension, I assume it is safe to take it for granted that, inasmuch as the pension really comes under the same category as a local officer's pension, precisely the same system will be applied in the calculation of gratuities and pensions of the <Col N="251" /> officers of the vocational committees as is applied to local officers in accordance with the instructions and letter issued by the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the last point, the actual grant of the pension is not in my hands, but in the hands of the Minister for Local Government.  As regards the other point, in the law as it stands, and in the law as it is supposed to be continued by this Bill, the liability for pensions is on the parent body&mdash;in the case of a county, the county council, and in the case of a borough, the county borough council. It would not be possible under the Bill as it stands for any deduction to be made from the rate paid over by the parent body to the committee. The rate settled must be paid over without deduction.  Therefore, I do not see how we can have provision for pensions by the rating authority on the one hand, as we have at present, under the Act of 1925 with regard to local officials, and pensions by the committee on the other hand.  Therefore, where the question of pensions arise, I am ready to consider between now and the Report Stage the bringing in of an amendment proposing that the State will refund a certain proportion of the pensions charged to the local authority.  I think that meets the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>One is glad to hear that, because it always struck me that the section in the Act of 1925 was an unfair one.  As the Minister will agree, 75 per cent. of the salary of an official at present is paid by the State, and 25 per cent. by the local authority.  When it comes to the question of a pension, the whole of the pension falls on the local authority; the State does not contribute any portion of it.  I always thought that was an injustice, and I am glad to hear from the Minister that, while he will not go as far as repealing the section of the 1925 Act, he will consider whether it cannot be met in some way out of State funds.</P>

      <P>Deputy Good did bring that matter before me on several occasions, and I think I answered him that I was quite ready to level up by suggesting that the State would not pay 75 per cent. He did not joyfully accept that proposition. I certainly am not going to promise that the State will bear 75 per cent., but I think we will get some accommodation between ourselves and the local authorities.  I certainly do not wish that the total cost of matters of this kind should be borne by the local authorities, and I think I will relieve them to some extent of the responsibility that actually is there under the present law.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="253" /> We have been considering sub-section (4) of Section 23 with regard to the Minister's powers, which he says are not absolute, and that, taken in conjunction with Section 44 of the Local Government Act, 1925, gives plenty of scope for removing from office people who are unfit.  Any officer removed from office cannot get compensation if removed for misconduct or incapacity. Under this section, as it stands, the Minister may do so if he thinks fit; the unfitness need not even be proved.  &ldquo;Unfitness&rdquo; is a very difficult term to define.  It is nearly as difficult as the word &ldquo;cultural&rdquo; which the Minister was discussing a while ago.  It would be very hard to define &ldquo;unfitness.&rdquo;  No proof is required. The Minister just considers him unfit.  I do not know that the section could not be deleted altogether, but, at any rate, I think that Deputies from all sides of the House will support this amendment that the Minister should not act without having some suggestion or complaint from the vocational education authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister should be empowered to act without getting a complaint from the local vocational authority, because he may be dissatisfied with the authority.  But it may meet the Deputy's point, to some extent, if we bring Section 26 that we are now discussing into touch with Section 103, which lays down the condition of the inquiry, and that the Minister should not act in this apparently arbitrary fashion without inquiry of the kind set out under Section 103; that he should have power to act if the conduct of the officer was reported as very bad, even though the Committee might be prepared to stand over the officer.</P>

This is a most extraordinary example of smashing the fly on the wheel.  There may, at one time or another, be a different grant for technical education than for vocational education.  The question is: does a certain subject come into one or the other?  But to suggest that it should be cause of action before the High Court is lifting the matter too much into the catalogue of a cause celebre.  The amendment is, I suggest, a bit out of proportion.  When I saw the amendment I was wondering whether there was not something else supposed to be behind the section. <Col N="257" /> It is merely a question of what category a certain thing should be put into, and to suggest that the High Court should decide that does not seem reasonable.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2), (a), page 18, lines 17 and 18, to delete the words &ldquo;two pence&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;one penny three-farthings.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The effect of this amendment, if accepted by the Minister, will be that the minimum contribution from a county council, which is now 2d. in the £, would be reduced to 1¾d. The reasons for the amendment were to a large extent dealt with on the Second Reading.  It is a question of the general financial provisions of the Bill and the burden it will place on local authorities.  In existing circumstances the burdens which a good many local authorities bear with regard to technical education is considerably less than 2d. in the £.  In some cases I think it is as low as 1d., and it is considered that a jump from 1d. to 2d. would be excessive, particularly as the local authority has no option with regard to the amount.  The amount in the Act will be the minimum amount that a local authority must provide. I would be very pleased if the Minister would accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I have considered <Col N="259" /> the matter.  The Parliamentary Secretary brought it before me, and I have considered the whole finances of the system since then, especially in county systems, and I find that a 1¾d. could work reasonably satisfactorily, but it certainly cannot go below that amount.  If I accept the principle of the amendment I would like to have it redrafted, because there are some areas for which I could not accept it.  Taking the country as a whole, I think it could be accepted in county areas without any serious damage, but there are one or two areas in which I will have to make special provision.</P>

      <P>There are already certain contributions made to local schemes by the State and by the local authorities.  It is not proposed to diminish in any way the State contribution there, even though the contribution is, I think, unfair to the State.  So far as future developments are concerned, I indicated that if a number of years were taken the idea is that the local authority's contribution and the State contribution would equal each other on the whole, so that there will be, on the whole, a £ for £ contribution.  There are a couple of schemes that may require something <Col N="265" /> more than that from their very nature.  The extra cost to the State at the opening might be £3,000 and the full development £10,000.  These are schemes which, from their very nature, no matter how high a rate is struck, could not work.  But the ordinary provision will be £ for £. That may not be necessary for the first year, but on the whole I should say&mdash;taking an average of years&mdash; the rates will subscribe the same as the Government.  We might be able to take, say, a three-halfpenny rate as a starting point and regard anything over that as a contribution from the Government.  As regards buildings and sites, all that may be met by means of loans raised by the committee on the security of the yearly income of the fund to which both the State and the local authority contribute, and no matter even if we continue with £ for £ for future development, it will always mean that into that fund more will be paid by the State in any year&mdash;in 1933, 1940 or 1950&mdash;than will actually be paid by the local authority.</P>

I explained on Second Reading that I thought an excellent method of dealing with it from many points of view would be that in those districts in which it may be advisable to have compulsory powers used, the summer should be set apart for the compulsory attendance of girls and the winter set apart for the compulsory attendance of boys.

      <P>There is a principle involved here which I have always been keen on.  I cannot compel the attendance of anybody in any individual school; that is clear. As regards full-time attendance in the national school, let us suppose the pupil has not reached the sixth standard, as often happens.  The obvious thing is for the boy to continue to attend the national school. What I said about the seventh and eighth standards was that if you have a highly efficient teacher you get some of the best education in the national schools in these standards; <Col N="272" /> not that the teacher is with the boy the whole time, but he is directing him, and some very good results, as I gather from the inspectors, are achieved in that way.  There is what I may call wise direction.  There is a tendency in that direction in other countries as well.  It is a system of wise direction rather than ordinary pedagogy, in the older sense of the word.  That is one reason why a student might wish to stay on, and there might be other reasons that would induce him to remain on in preference to the more practical type of education in the vocational schools.  He may have a different outlook.  He is compelled to attend only 180 hours.  If, off his own volition, he thinks it well to attend for 900 hours or 1,000 hours, he may have good reasons for it.  His liberty should not be interfered with, and that is the reason I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2), line 55, to delete the words &ldquo;twenty shillings&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;five pounds.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider that this is a very important section in the Bill because it deals with the facilities for attending courses of instruction.  If the Act is to be rigidly enforced and if these facilities are not given, I do not see what is the use of passing it <Col N="273" /> at all.  The fines mentioned in the Bill for defaulting employers&mdash; twenty shillings in the case of a first offence and a fine not exceeding forty shillings for subsequent offences&mdash;are entirely inadequate and will not conduce to the proper working of the Act.  If I were submitting this amendment myself I would certainly double these figures, but possibly Deputy O'Connell is not as severe as I am in the matter of fining people of this description.  This amendment might be taken in conjunction with amendments to Section 85, and here again I suggest an increase in the fines.  If you want to make the Act effective in operation you have to increase the fines.  The present fines will not tend to make the Act effective.</P>

      <P>There is a danger here of a very real kind.  A number of employers at the moment are not anxious to take in apprentices.  One would like to see a different feeling amongst those employers.  I do not at all like this principle of fines.  I would like to see the matter dealt with in some other way.  If we increase these fines I am quite sure it will only tend to increase the difficulty of getting these employers to do their duty with regard to apprentices.  I am quite satisfied that the fines mentioned in the Bill, although I do not like the principle, will be just as effective as larger fines.  I suggest to the Deputy that it would not be wise to increase the amounts.  I see the difficulty on the other side, and possibly I know much more about it than the Deputy does because I have an opportunity of going amongst employers and hearing their views. I was reading a paper the other day in which it was stated that only 53 per cent. of employers in a certain industry took apprentices.  That is very unfortunate.  I would like to see that percentage 95 and even up to 100: I would like to see employers doing their duty, but if we proceed along these lines and increase the penalties we will be increasing our difficulties and we will not achieve the object that we all have in view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is the first time since I came to the House that I heard a proposal from Deputy Anthony's Benches to increase a fine.  I am inclined to agree with Deputy Good.  I believe that we have put in a reasonable fine.  There is a certain amount of perturbation already amongst employers.  I know that Deputy Good would hold that this suggestion of a fine is unreasonable and not far-seeing, but the perturbation is there.  The fines are reasonable enough, I think, and I know they are not as severe as Deputy Anthony would inflict if he were to have a free hand.  We are dealing with apprentices, and I doubt very much if apprentices' time is so valuable for a couple of hours a week.  I doubt if it is of such great value that it would tempt an employer to incur the fine that is here in the section, with the other expenses involved in a prosecution. I think the situation is sufficiently met by the fines actually stated in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must admit that unless these apprentices get time to attend the classes they will not become efficient working men and, as a result, the money spent on technical and vocational education will be wasted.  I suggested previously to the Minister that some section should be inserted in the Bill to compel these employers to allow their apprentices to attend technical classes.  By doing so, the apprentices would become more efficient and their efficiency would be reflected in the employers' ledgers.  The same argument that I used then applies in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite admit the desirability of the Deputy's aim and I appreciate what he is anxious to achieve, but the whole question is whether a fine of £5. rather than a fine of 20/-, will tend to make the Act a success.  I should say that judging from the value attaching to the apprentices' time of six hours per week, a fine of 20/- on the first conviction, or a fine of 40/- on the second conviction is quite reasonable enough.  Some of the <Col N="275" /> other compulsory powers referred to by Deputy Anthony are actually already in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughColohan" hpid="Mr. Colohan Mr. Colohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colohan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister ought to give some consideration to this amendment.  I say that, because if the fines are trivial the employers will evade their duty.  I have very great respect for Deputy Good's opinion in this matter.  The Deputy has always taken a deep interest in the training of apprentices.  He has been keen on that all his lifetime. Still he admits that a certain number of employers do not take apprentices. In future I think it should be made compulsory on these employers to take apprentices.  I believe it will.  If employers can get bright young fellows who are anxious to learn their business I believe they will be eager to get them, but at the same time they might not be so eager to let them off to get instruction and make them competent workmen.  I ask the Minister to agree to increase the fines to 40/- for a first offence and 80/- for a second offence.  I think that would meet Deputy Anthony's amendment and it would help to ensure the success of the working of the Act amongst that section of employers who badly want to be taught their duty.</P>

      <P>Some time ago a Deputy on the Government Benches wanted to have the rates collected by the Gárda Síochána, and I do not know how many other duties he wanted assigned to them.  The purpose of introducing this amendment was to have economy in the working of the scheme.  It is not clear what sort of attendance officers would be appointed under the Bill.  I think, however, the Gárda Síochána would be able to discharge these duties. This would relieve the committees of expense and would leave more money to be devoted to education rather than having it spent on officials.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not now discuss whether the amendment should come in here or not, or whether the actual enforcing authority should be the vocational education committee or the Gárda. Elsewhere, except in the areas referred to, it is the Gárda that will enforce the Act.  I presume what the Deputy means is that the Gárda ought to be the enforcing authority everywhere.  The amendment, however, does not achieve that purpose. This is a matter that was discussed here at considerable length in 1926 on the debate on the School Attendance Act.  There was a very strong plea put forward for the utilisation of the Gárda everywhere through the country, but it was then pointed out that with the number of Gárda at our disposal it was impossible to <Col N="277" /> do that everywhere.  Since then further duties have fallen on the Gárda, and, in addition, their numbers have been reduced.  So far as school attendance is concerned it would be physically impossible for the Gárda at their present strength to undertake that duty in the districts concerned.  That is the reason why in the case of primary education, and also in the case of technical education, it has been found impossible to utilise the services of the Gárda everywhere.  It is really impossible that the Gárda should take on this work in addition to the duties they already have.  It would mean a considerable increase in the number of the Gárda.</P>

As far as we have the material, the policy outlined in the amendment will be carried out, and it will be our duty to provide the material so far as we can.  It might be rather unfair, however, to hold up instruction in any area until we are in a position to supply the material.  The policy is undoubtedly that of the amendment and I would ask the Deputy to be satisfied with that.  It would be unwise to put it so baldly into the Bill.</P>

      <P>I think I might also take the next amendment, which reads:&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first place I want to make sure that these scales will be prescribed, and incidentally to make it possible for these officers and teachers to be transferred from one committee to another, or from one part of the country to another, in the same way as civil servants might be transferred, and that by that transfer they will not suffer in salary or in any scale which they had reached. It would be an inducement to some committees if they could get cheap men all the time.  I want to ensure by means of these amendments that we will do something similar to what has been done in other countries.  The Education Act of Northern Ireland of 1923 states: &ldquo;It shall be the duty of the Ministry, after consultation with the <Col N="283" /> Ministry of Finance, to frame and from time to time as the occasion requires to alter minimum scales of salaries, etc.&rdquo;  That would perhaps make a very material alteration in the Bill, but it would be a very necessary alteration.</P>

      <P>These amendments go together although one belongs really to sub-section (1) and the other to sub-section (2). This is a different matter altogether. Besides the teacher the only person who in many of the schemes would <Col N="284" /> come into question would be the chief executive officer of the committee, and it would be impossible to prescribe scales of salary by formal resolutions for that one particular person or prescribe for instance for the chief executive officer in general in the country.  I suggest to Deputy Anthony that the chief executive officer in control of, and responsible for a scheme in Cork, might have to be a man of very different calibre from a man in control of a scheme in a small area. Therefore to prescribe the scales in general would be practically out of the question.  I take it for granted that when a man is being appointed by a committee, the question of the salary and increments will be discussed between the committee and the Minister.  That is inevitable. There are a few other schemes in which you may have other officials, but exactly the same arguments against a general prescription of the kind demanded by Deputy Anthony hold in their case as in the case of the others.  Therefore, though I am prepared to accept the principle of the two previous amendments I am not prepared to accept the principle of these amendments.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="287" /> The effect of this amendment will be, as indicated, to establish a shorter period within which the maximum amount contributed by the local authority to the vocational education committee shall cease.  In the existing schedule, the time at which the payment is to cease is the 1st April, 1947, and the maximum amount at that period is 6d. in the £.  In the amendment, the time at which the payment is to stop is 1st April, 1940, and the maximum amount to be paid in that case is 4d. in the £.  It will also be noticed that the first item in the amendment, that is, in the year commencing 1st April, 1931, the maximum number of pence in the £ is altered from 2d. to 1¾d.; that is to conform with an amendment the principle of which has already been accepted by the Minister. The scale on which the contribution advances is the same as in the existing schedule.  It is at the rate of ¼d. per year.  The only real difference the acceptance of this amendment will have on the Bill as it stands is the fixing of the maximum amount at 4d. in the £ instead of 6d., and the time in which the payment is to cease is 1940 instead of 1947.</P>
    <P>The reasons for proposing this amendment have already been stated on the Second Reading of the Bill, the general financial question and the increased burden which is being placed upon local authorities.  It might be pointed out that although payments under the Act will cease in 1940 there is no reason why an amending Bill should not be introduced <Col N="288" /> at that stage to increase the amount and to carry on to 1947.  In the meantime a good deal of experience and knowledge as to the working of the Act would have been gained in the country, and the people would have an opportunity of realising whether they believe the Act has been effective, not whether the Act should be carried on, but whether the payment should be increased in accordance with the scale in existence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated already on the Second Reading, I am satisfied to legislate for ten years ahead.  I put down the original scale to indicate what the maximum scale would be when the scheme is in full working order.  I think I said also that in a good many counties it need never reach the actual 6d.  I should say, in the majority of counties, it would not reach the maximum of 6d.  I have no objection if anybody wishes in these counties to stop in the year 1940.  Undoubtedly it can be reconsidered then, and undoubtedly a number of other things in this Bill will require amendment in the year 1940.  Therefore I will accept the principle of the amendment that there should be some adjustment in connection with certain counties.</P>

Also we would like to know whether under this Bill the vocational education committees will be empowered to give grants towards Feiseanna.

The amendment as a whole, of course, cuts across the whole finances of the Bill and my contention has always been that we will make more effective provisions for everything, including Irish, in this Bill than is made in the present haphazard fashion where the rate goes up and down.  I think on the whole the Deputy will see that for continuation education and technical education there will be an increase all round in the rate.  It will be definite and clear and not subject to the downward motions that it is subject to at the present moment, in certain counties especially.  I think <Col N="290" /> there is more effective provision for Irish and for other things in the Bill as it stands than there is in the provision that it is now proposed in this Bill to repeal.

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £666,000 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1931, to provide capital for the Local Loans Fund and to make repayment to the British Government in respect of local loans outstanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of capital which it is proposed to vote this year, £550,000 altogether, with balances at present available, will make it possible to sanction advances totalling £658,000 <Col N="291" /> during the year.  It is anticipated that the sanctions will be something like the following: Land Improvement Loans £20,000&mdash;these are loans for smaller holdings which are not being dealt with by the Agricultural Credit Corporation, such as loans for hay barns and land improvement&mdash; drainage maintenance under the Drainage Maintenance Acts, £5,000; Arterial Drainage, £50,000; Barrow Drainage, £57,000; Public Health Loans, £300,000; Arterial Drainage Minor Schemes, £10,000; Housing, <Col N="292" /> £180,000 Housing Gaeltacht, £30,000 and Harbour Loans, £6,000.</P>

      <P>We are compelled to vote against this Estimate on account of sub-head B, the payment of £600,000 to the British Government under Article V. of the ultimate financial settlement of 19th March, 1926. The payment of this sum is analogous to the payment of land annuities.  We do not believe it is obligatory on this State to make it under the Treaty, as amended by the Agreement of 1925, and we intend to express our view in the division lobby.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that this Estimate be referred back for reconsideration. The Minister for Finance, in moving the Vote, said there had been very little change in the Estimate as compared with last year.  There has been very little change, I think, in the purpose of the Estimate, very little change in the intentions of the Government when putting down the Estimate, very little change in their attitude towards these commissions since they first became responsible for this Vote in the year 1923.  The total amount to be expended under this Vote is £10,947, but that by no means represents the total cost of these particular activities to the people of the country.  I see that under other Votes, Nos. 11, 17, 22 and 24, there is to be expended an additional sum of approximately £5,000, bringing the total cost of these services up to £15,947.  What is the purpose of this Vote and of all these Commissions of Inquiry?  Take the Commission of Inquiry into de-rating.  I feel, and I think most of the farmers of the country by this time have become <Col N="294" /> convinced, that the purpose of that inquiry is to stave off the agitation, if the Government possibly can, for de-rating until such time as the farmers have given it up in despair.</P>
      <P>The Grain Inquiry Tribunal was appointed last year.  The manner of its appointment seemed to indicate that the Ministry considered this question of some urgency, but up to the present, notwithstanding the urgency of the question, there has been no report.  The Inter-Departmental Committee on coast erosion is to be provided for under this Vote. I do not know whether that committee has sat yet, but I do know that part of the coast of Wicklow and of Wexford&mdash;indeed, I might say part of the whole east coast of Ireland, has been melting away during the last three or four years at a rate which is making the problem one of grave public concern.  What is the outcome of these commissions likely to be in the year that is now current? If we are to make up our minds on that question by the experience of past years, then I think we can abandon hope that these committees and commissions are going to produce any tangible result, and that as a result of all this expenditure no material benefit will accrue to the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find, for instance, that in the year 1922-23, £846 was spent on what was described as the Canals and Inland Waterways Commission.  That commission published a report, but the report was carefully pigeonholed, and I am sure that by now the spiders have built their cobwebs over that pigeon-hole, so that it would remind one of the castle in which the sleeping beauty was supposed to have been discovered in the fairy tale.  In the year 1924-25 a commission was appointed to inquire into the question of the relief of the destitute sick and poor, including the insane poor.  I would like to ask any member of the House, as well as the Minister who was responsible for putting that Estimate before the House, what tangible benefit the sick and destitute poor of this country <Col N="295" /> have reaped as a result of the work of that commission.  We had a committee appointed in 1926-27 to consider the question of food prices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the House to determine whether, in view of the results that have accrued from former expenditures on commissions of the sort indicated in this Vote, they would be well advised to vote the money now asked.  I am entitled to refer to the number of instances in which similar expenditures of public money have been made without any useful result or material advantage to the State.  It is not with a view to criticising the desirability of having appointed particular commissions that I am now referring to this matter, but rather to point out that though those commissions were appointed to deal with matters which at the time were considered of extreme urgency and great public importance, and though money has been spent on them, nothing has been done. I am asking the House, in view of the fact that on former occasions money was spent on these commissions with no material advantage to the State, to refuse to be fooled any longer, and to refuse to authorise the expenditure of money again for a similar purpose with, I am sure, the same results.  The food prices committee was appointed in 1926-27. The printing of the report cost £904, and in addition there was the cost of the salaries of the staff temporarily lent which amounted to £1,060.  On that commission there was spent altogether a sum of almost £2,000.  It reported in 1926-27, but nothing was done since.  Here we are in 1930 asked to sanction the same sort of fruitless, useless expenditure. The Town Tenants Commission was appointed in the same year.  The report cost £163 to produce, and the cost of the salary of the staff amounted to £350.  What <Col N="296" /> advantage have the town tenants reaped as a result?</P>
      <P>
        <i>[An Ceann Comhairle resumed the Chair.]</i>
      </P>
      <P>The Committee on Milk Supply was appointed in 1926-27 and its reports cost £352 to produce.  Again the report was published and circulated to the members of the Dáil, but nothing was done.  In 1927-28 there was appointed a Road Traffic Committee.  That Committee cost £81 11s. 10d.  That sum is again thrown away so far as the members of the Dáil are concerned, for there has been no legislation introduced in this House based on that report.  In 1927-28 a Committee on the claims of ex-servicemen was set up.  It cost £212 7s. 3d.  It made recommendations which, I am sure, were praiseworthy and could be accepted by the Dáil, but as far as we know the ex-servicemen have reaped no benefit from the setting up of that tribunal. In the same year a special committee composed of the most capable persons, of persons most suitable for its purpose which the astute mind of the Minister for Industry and Commerce could select, was set up to deal with the urgent question of unemployment. The committee was described as a committee to consider measures for the relief of unemployment. It met and considered certain aspects of that problem, and published a report which cost £146 3s. 1d., but the committee did nothing, and the Government did nothing as a result of that report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A committee&mdash;this is the gem&mdash; was set up, a Party committee, I think, under the Chairmanship of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to consider economy in Government expenditure.  It cost £85, and we were told in the Budget statement for the year 1929 that as a result of the efforts of this committee there had been a reduction in the estimates of something like £500,000.  Undoubtedly if this Committee, as a result of the expenditure of £85, secured a real economy in Government administration to the extent of £500,000, none of us will gainsay that the <Col N="297" /> £85 was well spent.  But here is the rub, the fly in the ointment&mdash;that when the Minister came this year to introduce his Budget in the Dáil we found that the £500,000 which was saved last year was added this year, with increased interest for the fresh expenditure, and now amounts to something like £613,000, so that it would have been better so far as the general taxpayer was concerned if this particular committee on economy had never sat, because the Government services on which expenditure had been pruned down to the extent of £500,000 have swollen themselves again in the year 1930 to the extent of £613,000, with a net loss to the taxpayer of £113,000 as a result of the efforts of this committee.  As I said on one occasion, it is a clear proof that so far as economy is concerned the Farmers' Party, which were mainly responsible for the committee&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not in the Estimate, and even the Economy Committee is not in the Estimate.  The Deputy must bring himself away from the Farmers' Party now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I will leave them there, knowing that in a very short time we will not have any Farmers' Party to talk about.  What is the conclusion we must come to as a result of this history of this particular Vote and the activities under it?  That the Government have discovered there are more ways of killing a dog than choking him with butter.  Every time a question arises that threatens to become troublesome, the Government at once sets up commissions and inquiries.  At once that urgent and pressing problem receives a hypodermic injection which sets it to sleep for the rest of the Government's life.  Therefore, we find that in their first period of office, from 1923 to 1927, whenever a thing became particularly troublesome, the Government set up a commission, so that the people of the country would think the matter was receiving urgent attention. They forgot all about it then, and nothing was done during the period 1923 to 1927.  That is the course <Col N="298" /> they are pursuing in their second term, which began in the year 1927. We think it is time to have done with this foolery in the particularly stringent financial circumstances in which we live, and, as I said at the outset, judging by past experience, it will be folly on the part of the Dáil to pass this Estimate now, which will involve an expenditure, I believe, of not less than £10,947&mdash;an expenditure which, as I said with regard to similar expenditure before, will be fruitless of result, and will produce no material advantage to the people of the country.  It is for that reason I moved the motion that stands in my name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to get some information in connection with the committee on coast erosion as to whether they have held any meetings, either in private or in public, if they have received any evidence and when they are likely to issue their report.  Evidence has been submitted from my constituency, but we have not been given any opportunity of giving the evidence in public.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister stated that there was no provision made by the Government to assist any local authority in connection with coast erosion, and I think a definite statement should be made by the Minister so as to give public bodies an opportunity of dealing with the matter themselves if they are not going to receive any grant from the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee spoke as if the commissions provided for in this Vote were all commissions of inquiry and that the £10,900 was being spent on carrying out inquiries.  Something like four-fifths of that sum is being spent on commissions which are really not commissions of inquiry and only something like one-fifth on the type of commission about which the Deputy spoke.  The Central Savings Committee, for instance, is not a committee of inquiry but a committee to organise a financial and social movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It ought to devote <Col N="299" /> its first attention to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Manuscripts Commission is engaged in the editing and publication in various forms of matters of an historical character or of literary value in the Irish language. There remains, therefore, a sum of less than £2,000 for expenditure on inquiries of various sorts. The Deputy spoke as if a commission of inquiry is useless from a public point of view unless action immediately follows.  As a matter of fact, commissions are only set up where there is a great obscurity in regard to the facts and in regard to the action which would be in the public interest.  A commission which prevented action may have done most useful work.  I think that the commission on canals and waterways did recommend action, but consideration of the report as well as other factors convinced the Government that action should not be taken.  I think that action along the lines advocated very generally before the Treaty in regard to canals and waterways would have been a waste of money, and although the commission did not make recommendations along these lines, nevertheless, the attention that was brought to bear on the matter as a result of the inquiry had a very good result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many other cases the Commissions of Inquiry may not have presented reports which could be made the basis of legislation. But they may help very much in framing legislation.  The Commission which sat in regard to the problem of the government of the City of Dublin and surrounding districts presented a report which in many respects the Government were not prepared to accept.  But I would not say for a moment that the effort put into the work by that Commission was wasted, or that the money expended on that Commission was <Col N="300" /> wasted, because its report and evidence were availed of, sometimes positively and sometimes negatively, in framing legislation afterwards.</P>
    <P>There were other reports to which the Deputy referred which have not yet been acted upon but which are being used for the purpose of framing proposals which will afterwards come before the Dáil.  In no case has any Commission been set up for the mere purpose of postponing a problem.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred in that connection to the De-rating Commission. The De-rating Commission was set up because the question was one of very great intricacy and very great difficulty.  There is a demand for de-rating.  If that demand were to be acceded to it would not only involve considerable financial changes, but also, in the view of the Government, it would involve most radical changes in our system of local government.  We are convinced that the present system could not stand at all if de-rating were to be carried out.  Whether we would have a complete abolition of local government or not, it would involve changes in the system tantamount to that.  It is, consequently, a matter which requires the most careful consideration. It requires that people outside the circle of Ministers and Government officials should examine it in detail and put their opinions on paper before the framing of legislation could be begun, if it be decided to frame legislation on the subject.  It seems to me, in view of all the circumstances that exist in this country, and in view of the difference that exist between the conditions here and the conditions in England, where the de-rating proposals were originated, that it would be almost criminal to frame a Bill without the type of inquiry that is at present going on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister about the future policy of his Department in connection with Civil Service examinations.  I want to be reassured, at least on one point.  One of the avenues for entrance to the Civil Service on the post office side is by way of boy messengers. There is limited competition between a number of these boys for the positions in the clerical staff, and I understand it is now the only method by which young lads can enter the Civil Service as messengers. To qualify for clerical posts afterwards examination is held, known as a limited competition&mdash;that is the name it had in the old British Civil Service, and I think it has the same to-day&mdash;in other words, competition is confined to boy messengers.  Within the last few months a case was brought to my notice in which a young lad got first place in the examination for boy messengers.  He scored very high <Col N="304" /> marks in written and oral Irish.  Subsequently he presented himself for examination to become a boy learner&mdash;in other words, to enter the clerical grade.  There also he scored a very high place&mdash;in fact, the highest place; he got an aggregate number of marks of 531.  He scored very high marks in written Irish, but rather low marks in oral Irish. I want the House to mark this point, that the boy had already shown a desire to learn the language and had acquired a very good knowledge of it, both written and oral.  When he presented himself for the clerical grade he got a very high percentage in the written Irish, but rather low marks in oral Irish.  All the same, he came out at the head of the list. He got 531 marks, and the candidate whom I shall call B, who was second highest on the list, secured 500 marks.  The second candidate, who only got 500 marks as against the other candidate's 531 marks, was appointed to the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course it will be said that this is an attack on the language.  It is not.  It is merely an inquiry to know where we are.  Here is a lad who gave every indication of a desire to acquire a knowledge of the language, and who, no doubt, had a very good knowledge of it.  Here is the point I would like the Minister to explain. It may be the case, and I believe it is &mdash;I do not like to assert it, because I like to stand over everything I say here&mdash;that the lad was examined by a man from another area, who possibly had not the same blas or pronunciation of Irish words as the boy.  I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to this state of affairs, and to ask what his policy in this direction is to be in the future.  It is certainly a very trying thing for poor men to educate their children, and to do their best for them in very adverse circumstances, when the children acquire a knowledge of the language, and show every desire to learn it, that they should be turned down because some other boy has a better knowledge of the language, although he may not be quite so good in subjects that are more essential for clerical appointments, <Col N="305" /> such as writing and arithmetic. I can pass the figures to the Minister to show that this boy victim of the Civil Service Commissioners got in his first examination 67 marks in Gaelic, as against 34 marks secured by the other candidate.  In English he got 151 marks, as against 193; in Arithmetic he got 110, as against the successful candidate's 105; in Handwriting 143, as against the successful candidate, who only got a pass.  It will be seen that this is a case that should command the attention of the Minister, so that industrious parents in the State will know where they are in relation to the whole system of education, and particularly the system of examination. If it is to be the system in future that oral Irish is to be the all-important thing, then let it be known, and we will know where we stand.  I am quite sure that if the people are going to be told that, the Minister and the Government will have a very short shrift, indeed.  We want to know where we are.</P>

      <P>Deputy Anthony has referred to an individual case of which I never heard until he spoke, so that it is quite impossible for me to deal with it now.  But I am satisfied that the Deputy has not got the facts of the case quite accurately, because if there was a competitive examination, as he seemed to indicate, in which there were certain marks given for oral Irish and certain marks for written Irish, and the candidate succeeded in passing in oral Irish, but not as well as another candidate, the one who got the biggest aggregate marks would be appointed. It may have been that the Deputy's candidate, A, failed to pass&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in oral Irish, and it was necessary to do so to pass the examination.  In that case the next candidate on the list in aggregate marks would succeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of correction. The boy I referred to passed practically with honours in his first examination for boy messengers. <Col N="306" /> I do not know him and never met him.  The matter was reported to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the facts can be as Deputy Anthony gave them.  He has not got the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>The marks are here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>We want to know all the facts of the case.  There are certain examinations in which, in order to pass&mdash;I think most examinations, if not all&mdash;there is examination in oral Irish, but not a competitive one. In some examinations oral Irish may be competitive, but in many it is not competitive; it is qualifying, and if a candidate who is required to qualify in oral Irish does qualify, then his place on the list depends on the marks he got in the other subjects. If he fails to qualify, whatever marks he gets in other subjects are not sufficient to enable him to pass the examination.  On the whole the standard for oral Irish for candidates is a very low standard.  Very little is asked of candidates in the matter of oral Irish at entrance, but there is a provision whereby within a period of two years after entry to the Civil Service they must pass a reasonably hard examination, but not very hard, in oral Irish.  It has happened heretofore that candidates have been given two or three shots at this oral examination, which has to be passed within two years after entry.  The only penalty that has so far been imposed on a candidate who failed to pass that examination in oral Irish within the prescribed period was that his or her increment was stopped, that is, that a person who would have been due to receive an increment on the 1st June, having completed two years' service, but who failed to pass the oral Irish examination would have the increment stopped.  If that candidate succeeded by the 1st October or the 1st November, or by some such date in passing the examination, then the increment would be given.  I do not say that as much latitude as that will continue to be given, because any candidate who will make the attempt, <Col N="307" /> who has any knowledge at all of oral Irish and was able to pass a written examination in Irish, would be very easily able to pass the examination which is required to be passed within two years.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Anthony will give me sufficient particulars of this case to identify it I will write him on the subject, and if he is not satisfied with my letter and requires further information, then he can ask a question in the House.  But full regard is had to the whole facts of the situation in dealing with this matter, and it is well recognised by the Civil Service Commissioners that to impose a high standard of capacity to speak Irish at entrance to the Civil Service would be hard, that it would prevent people from entering whose lack of knowledge of the language was not in any way their own fault.  So that a very moderate degree of knowledge is required at entrance, and it is in order to enable that to be done and yet not make the regulations with regard to Irish farcical that the second examination within two years of entering the service has been arranged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation. I am not sure that this case was sent on to the Department but I think it was, because I got a letter addressed to an official, in the course of which this candidate says: &ldquo;I secured the highest aggregate of marks in the learners' examination. My failure in oral Irish was due rather to slowness than to an insufficient knowledge of the language.  In the boy messengers' qualifying examination I secured the highest marks and first place.  In the learners' examination I got 22 per cent. in Gaelic, and in the boy messengers' examination 53 per cent. in Gaelic.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>That answers the Minister's question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>That bears out what <Col N="308" /> I said, that it was not a question of passing in oral Irish and getting low marks, but that he failed to pass. What may have happened is that he did nothing between the first examination and the second and lost his knowledge to some extent, or that he failed to keep up his studies in this respect.  That may well be the explanation of the matter.  I do not know how long the interval between the two examinations was, but the boys entered on equal terms in the first instance, and if one of them pursued his studies for a period of two years and the other did not, then there would be a very great difference between them at the second examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>What I want to know is if the Government is going to emphasise the importance of oral Irish against written.  I can quite recognise the advantage of being able to speak the language, but surely, at present at any rate, due regard should be had to the fact that in an all-round examination there should not be too much insistence on the oral side of it, and also that the lad has done his best and is not living in an Irish-speaking district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I tried to tell the Deputy that there is no insistence, that so far as oral Irish is concerned the tests are extremely easy, and that attention is paid to the facts to which the Deputy refers.  But, of course, no matter how easy the test may be, if a boy will let some period elapse without preparing for it he is liable to drop some of his knowledge.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £168,000 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1931, for payments in respect of destruction of, or injuries to Property under the Damage to Property (Compensation) Acts, 1923 to 1926, and otherwise; and for payment of grants awarded on the recommendation of the Property Losses (Ireland) Committee, 1916, as compensation for buildings destroyed in Dublin during Easter Week, 1916.</P>
    <P>This is a Vote which will very shortly disappear from the Estimates. A very large sum was paid out last year, and if the amount in the Estimate is paid out in the present year only comparatively small sums will remain for discharge thereafter.  I think the only thing I need mention with reference to the Vote is the claims of Northern Nationalists.  It has been found that twelve cases are <i>prima facie</i> within the scope of the offer made by the President.  In these twelve cases the forms of statutory declaration have recently been completed by all the applicants, and investigation is being pursued, though there are certain difficulties, owing to the location of the property that was damaged and to the lapse of time, in completing that investigation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the House will be glad to learn that something is at last being done for <Col N="310" /> the Northern Nationalists.  In that connection I would like to know whether, included among those whose cases he has felt it possible to consider, the Minister has considered that of Mr. James McGuill of Dromintee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Because that was a case of particular hardship, the facts of which Deputy Aiken related to the House on the occasion of his motion.  I do not wish to make an ad misericordiam appeal to the Minister in connection with it, but I do think that if there is one man whose case deserves consideration on its merits for the services which he was willing to render and the assistance which he gave to the Republican Party from 1916 until after the Truce, that man is Mr. McGuill.  I do hope, even though it may somewhat exceed the conditions which the Minister laid down when he promised to consider the case of the Northern Nationalists, that he will give sympathetic consideration to the case of this man.</P>
      <P>In this connection also there is another case, with the facts of which I think most Deputies are familiar, and that is the case of Mr. Pat O'Byrne, whose premises in Henry Street were destroyed in 1916.  I know again that there are special difficulties in that case, but I think all of us who are familiar with the circumstances of Mr. O'Byrne would be glad, even though it might entail the introduction of a Private Bill, if the Minister could see his way to do something for him.  It is pitiable to think of the circumstances to which that gentleman has been reduced, in contrast with the circumstances in which he formerly lived and to feel that the primary cause of his present position was the Insurrection of 1916.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that we may regard him as being the only civilian who has suffered serious loss in consequence of the Insurrection, and whose lot has not been ameliorated, and whose loss has not been diminshed in any way.  Even though it may require <Col N="311" /> special legislation to deal with this case, I am sure that not only on this side of the House but from every section of the House action of that kind on the part of the Minister would receive a warm welcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWhite" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to join with Deputy MacEntee in his request to the Minister to take into consideration the case of Mr. McGuill.  This is a very deserving case and it is one that is worthy of sympathetic consideration.  I desire to impress on the Minister the necessity for making further enquiries with a view to giving the man some compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say anything about the McGuill case.  Perhaps it is scarcely relevant to this discussion, but it does seem to me that the entire blame in connection with this case falls on the shoulders of Deputy Aiken, and that we would really be taking responsibility arising out of any wrongful act by Deputy Aiken. However, the matter has not been put forward on that basis.  With regard to the Pat O'Byrne case, I would not hold out any hope at all. I considered the case myself, and it has been considered frequently by others and, looking at it from one aspect, the gentleman's misfortunes may have come out of the Insurrection, but from another angle they could have been due to his own lack of foresight and his own miscalculations. I think it is only to a slight degree that you can ascribe them to the Insurrection, though they might not have happened if the Insurrection did not take place.  I would not say his present position is due to the Insurrection of 1916.  The position might be different if he had a person who would act more wisely in regard to the award and in regard to the construction of the premises afterwards; perhaps he would not have suffered the same loss.  I am not sufficiently familiar with the details of the Pat O'Byrne case.  I was familiar with them because, owing to <Col N="312" /> representations put up, I found it necessary to read the file on a couple of occasions.  I would not hold out any hope at all in that case.  While the details of any of the cases have not come up to me, they are being examined in the Department, and I do not know what view is being taken departmentally.  The other case is a different type of case altogether from the Pat O'Byrne case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to what the Minister has said about Mr. O'Byrne, I would like to mention that that gentleman brought an action against the Post Office in 1920, and the judge was debarred from giving a decision in his favour because of the fact that one could not take an action against the King.  He did say in his judgment that Mr. O'Byrne's case was one of very grave and serious hardship and one to which the Post Office should give consideration.  The two facts which appear to me to be salient in the matter are, first of all, the origin of the man's misfortunes.  Whatever his own personal feelings may be&mdash;I do not know and I have not heard what they are&mdash;I believe the origin of his misfortunes was the 1916 Insurrection. The second fact is the recommendation made by the judge that the man's case should be considered favourably and that he should get some compensation for the loss he had suffered.  I think those two things ought to outweigh in the Minister's mind any folly or mistake which Mr. O'Byrne committed. These things appear to me to be things which ought to determine&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I did not give any impression that Mr. O'Byrne did anything except not handle the case well.  He proceeded to erect a building and had not the funds to do so.  His errors were of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that he had to proceed to erect the building in order to secure portion of the ex gratia grant given by the British Government at the time? Before he was able to build, the Post Office stepped in and took over the <Col N="313" /> property from him.  Though he had certain rights as a lessee in the matter he found himself deprived of those rights.  Like the Minister, I am not quite familiar with all the details, but I do remember there was one circumstance which was held against Mr. O'Byrne, and that was that he received what would be considered a fair offer to settle the matter. He denies that that offer was ever submitted to him; he denies, in fact, that the offer was ever made. If these were the circumstances, I suggest the Minister should inquire into them.  Mr. O'Byrne's contention is that this alleged offer never came to his notice.  Had it been, he possibly would have accepted it and it would have enabled him to retrieve his position, but he denies that it was ever made.  Then we have the judge's statement that in his opinion it was a case in which some ex gratia grant should be made by the Post Office, and we have also the primary and fundamental fact that the man's misfortunes arose out of the 1916 Insurrection. In view of these facts, I think the Minister ought favourably to consider the matter, and I am sure any proposal to mete out justice to this man would receive a warm welcome from every section of the House.  The Minister ought to see, even if it requires special legislation, whether he cannot do something to meet Mr. O'Byrne's claims.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to discuss the merits or demerits of these matters, but I hold in my hand a letter sent to me, and I understand that a copy of it was sent to the Minister. It is arising out of these property losses.  In this case, in February, 1922, a gentleman was taken from his home in his motor car and he makes up the amount of his claim to be £330 13s. 6d.  Out of that claim he received £75.  That man's case was across the Border, too.  Does that come under what the Minister has been speaking about?</P>

      <P>Damage to property was covered by the offer made by the President.  If the person to whom the Deputy refers thought he <Col N="314" /> had a claim, he should have sent it in.  We fixed, in the case of these losses, the last date on which we would receive claims.  I do not know the exact nature of the loss that was sustained.  Unless it was damage to property, it would not be included at all.  In any case, in order to prevent that matter dragging on indefinitely a date had to be fixed, and I think it would not be possible to admit the claim now if it has not been sent in already.  I do not know whether it has or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that under sub-head A there is an increase of £1,283 in salaries, wages and allowances. In that connection I would like to know whether that is due to an increase of staff or to the normal operation of the incremental scale? It seems to me that with the fall in the cost of living there should be a reduction under that sub-head.  The items under Appropriations-in-Aid consist almost entirely of the proportion of the cost of the annual revision of valuation to be paid over by the several counties and cities under 37 and 38 Vic.  That amounts to a sum of £6,295.  I presume these are charges on the local authority, fixed by statute.  I do not now when that was passed.  My knowledge of when that lady came to the throne is somewhat hazy.  I am told it was 1837, and it must be almost 100 years ago, or say 93 years ago, or something like that.  It would appear to me that the amount of fees which are recovered under that statute ought to be adequate to recoup to the Government the cost of making these revisions of valuations.  Of course no one likes to impose a heavier local charge than is necessary. <Col N="317" /> At the same time, since the local bodies reap the benefit of these valuations, I think it is only fair that this particular Department should be recouped the net cost of the revision.  I do not know whether the Minister has under consideration a revision of this scale.</P>

      <P>There has been a certain amount of changes in the staff owing to a change in the head of the office.  Certain people were moved up the scale.  With regard to the other point that Deputy MacEntee raises, I want to say that it has been under consideration, and in the course of a few years it may be possible to undertake something like a general re-valuation.  If it were found possible to undertake that re-valuation the system might be re-cast.  I do not say that we would necessarily have to wait for that before increasing the fee, but there would be many grounds for getting a valuation that was real and not purely conventional, as the existing valuation has become.  It would be a very long and a very big job.  At present the valuation put on property, apart altogether from the value of land, and the valuation of houses, has no relation at all to the real valuation.</P>
      <P>The valuations are simply made relative to the valuation of adjacent houses.  There is a great deal to be said for looking over that whole matter.  If we can come to a decision to do that, it will certainly require legislation and it would be the basis for modernising the whole system, including charges and all that.  I do not know whether we will do anything about this matter of fees pending the determination of the other matter.</P>

I am speaking personally in this matter now, but I feel that there are so many anomalies in the existing valuation scale that no one knows whether the general incidence of local or national taxation is justified.  I think we cannot get down to consider seriously taxation and rates until this thing has been done.</P>

I am not satisfied with the explanation which the Minister gave in relation to the corresponding sub-head in Vote 23.  He said that there had been a retirement of the gentleman who was at the head of the service, and that in consequence there had been a certain promotion.  It would seem that the gentleman at the head of the service would retire at the top of the incremental <Col N="319" /> scale and, instead of there being an increase in the amount aliocated for salaries, wages and allowances, there should be a decrease.</P>

      <P>Again, in connection with the Ordnance Survey, and with the Valuation Service but to a lesser extent, there is a sort of feeling that everything is not well with this particular Department, or rather has not been well with it up to this particular year.  I understand that a new head has been appointed.  I hope that that carries with it a promise that the organisation of the Department will be seriously investigated with a view to seeing that grievances that have from time to time been ventilated in the Dáil and the dissatisfaction which was supposed to exist will disappear. Again, in connection with this Department, I notice apparently that there is one Assistant Director. Am I to take it from that that at some time in the immediate future there will be appointed over him a Director; or to whom is this Assistant Director an assistant?  I would like to know in what relation this Department of the Ordnance Survey stands to any other Department and whether, in view of the fact that there is apparently an officer at the top known as an Assistant Director, there is any other Department of which this is a subordinate side, because it would appear to me, unless there are very good reasons for its not being so, that this Department should be more or less an independent service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work which it does is particularly important not only from the point of view of the civil administration of the State, but also from the point of view of the military defence of the State.  I do not want to make a plea that it should be attached to <Col N="320" /> the Department of Defence, but certainly I do not think that it should be anything less than an autonomous Department, under the Minister, of course.  I would like to know whether we are likely to have such reorganisation of the Department as will case the public mind in regard to it.  As I have said, there has been a feeling from the very beginning that the affiliations of this Department with the forces of the late British Government in this country were too close to make the people in general feel that they were secure. That is one of the reasons that I think that the Department ought to be autonomous and that it ought to have, as it now has, at its head an Irishman who will ensure that the Department will be so re-organised that every item of information which might be valuable to an outside State, or any other power, will be kept as closely as possible confidential. Of course, in view of the fact that the Department has been for a considerable time under the control of people of other nationalities and with a different outlook to our own, it might be difficult, but the very difficulty of the problem enhances its importance, and it is one to which I hope the Minister will give earnest consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The present position is that the Commissioner of Valuation is director nominally.  I admit that his appointment is rather nominal, but he does exercise a certain supervision and deals with certain points.  He was appointed to that position some time ago simply because of some of the difficulties to which Deputy MacEntee alluded. The Irishman who was appointed to the office, and who will ultimately become its head, is at present Deputy Assistant Director, not Assistant Director.  It is recognised that everything was not just exactly as we would like it to be in that particular office, but the position is, of course, that there is a staff there whom we inherited.  Great trouble arose between different sections of the staff.  I do not think that any one section of the staff was to blame. <Col N="321" /> As a matter of fact, I think that the gentleman whose agitation caused a Committee to be appointed by the Government some years ago, with a member of the Dáil as Chairman and with an engineer of the Local Government Department and a Professor of Engineering as members, undoubtedly spread a great number of false reports.</P>
      <P>The Committee found that he had deliberately lied about those who were his superior officers.  The Government took such a serious view of the position that, although he himself was at the time out of the Ordnance Survey and was employed in the Land Commission, having been for a period in the National Army, they thought it necessary to discharge him from the Land Commission. Some of the feeling, to which Deputy MacEntee has alluded, arose from the agitation that was carried on by this particular man and others.  For instance, the idea was put abroad that a great deal of material which should be in the office had been taken away by the British authorities before their departure. This Committee comprised Mr. O'Dwyer, Engineering Inspector, Local Government Department; Professor Purcell, of the National University, and the late Mr. Sears as Chairman.  The Committee found that that was not so, that there was a full complement of material there, and that things that ought not to be taken away had not been taken away.  We recognise quite definitely what while this Department should not be under the Defence Department it should be closely associated with it, and that its work is of great importance from the point of view of national defence.  Bearing that view in mind, it was decided that an Army officer, who received special training to fit him for this work and who has now left the Army, should be appointed to that post, which will result in his being ultimately the head of the Ordnance Survey.</P>

That Committee was regarded as being very competent to deal with the matter.  I spent a good deal of time dealing with the question, and I was prepared, in the absence of anything that would cast doubt on the findings, to accept the report.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this Estimate. One would have thought that in an Estimate such as this some more real and effective economy than a mere net decrease of £2,761 would have been effected.  The Estimate provides for a sum of £62,848 for the current year.  Under sub-head D one would have imagined that there could have been a much greater decrease than one from £12,000 to £10,500.  I do not know whether the amount provided for last year was expended or not.  A sum of £10,500 seems to be extraordinarily high as a provision for expenses of prosecutors, etc.  Does the Minister anticipate that in the coming year he will have as many prosecutions and that there will be as many offences in the country as occurred last year?  In regard to sub-head E we have the same figure fixed for this year as was fixed last year, for fees to counsel in connection with State prosecutions, namely, £6,000.  I would prefer, and I am sure that most Deputies would also prefer, that a system should be followed by which special counsel should be assigned for that work. That was the practice previously, but it was changed, and I do not think that the change has served any useful purpose.  The system now adopted is that cases are distributed among political adherents who may be knocking around the doors of the Government for some of the spoils. I think it is a bad practice by which counsel who may be engaged in other cases are taken over for State prosecutions and are not able to devote the same amount of time to such cases as they would be able to devote if they were permanent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If special counsel were assigned for State prosecutions, I think that that work could be done more cheaply.  The present system of distributing briefs has gone on extensively during the past six months. <Col N="325" /> Some briefs have apparently been given for charity and others for other purposes, and the system is being run in such a way that no one can see the purpose of it except, as I have stated, that these people were in a certain political alignment with the Government.</P>
    <P>A sum of £6,000 was provided last year.  Was this £6,000 spent?  If it was spent, does the Government anticipate that in the coming year we will have the same number of prosecutions and the same expenditure? They budget for exactly the same amount.  I do not know what basis they work on, and I do not know how exactly the Minister arrives at these figures.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head G&mdash;Defence of Public Officials&mdash;there is an increase of £600, from £200 to £800.  These expenses include actions taken against district justices.  So far as I am aware, action against district justices are very few and far between. They would chiefly arise where mistakes would have occurred with regard to accepting service where service might be bad.  There would then be certiorari proceedings, and the justice's decision would be quashed.  I do not maintain that district justices should pay these expenses out of their own pockets.  I think it is quite right where, in fact, a mistake is made, that the State should provide for payment of those necessary expenses incurred.  Then I come to where there are included payments for Gárda Síochána and other public officials for acts done by them in the execution of their duty.  The impression I have got would be that it applies to those cases that were not acts done in the execution of their duty, or could not be described as acts done in the execution of their duty.  They were illegal acts, encouraged by the Minister for Justice and his Department, for which the public is now asked to pay.  It is very nice to put them in the Estimate and give them the appearance of being acts done in the execution of duty.  One of the reasons I put forward this is that I asked the Minister here on the other Vote <Col N="326" /> in which the matters arose of the illegal acts, to state distinctly whether in view of the decrees that have been given by the courts, and whether in view of the finding of the courts that illegal acts are being committed by the Guards, they arose out of execution of duty or not.  It does not matter whether he has issued any circular directing the attention of the officers and Guards as to what their duties are, and the way in which they have to perform their duties.  The Minister has evaded that, and has not given me any reply.  Disregarding the consequences which have naturally flown from the encouragement of these illegalities, and his total disregard of any illegal or unlawful acts, he has evaded the question as to whether he has given any instructions, whether by way of circular or otherwise, as to how the Guards are to perform their duties in future.  I believe the Guards are sufficiently trained.</P>
    <P>We all hear about their being a young force, and so on.  I believe the Guards that have been misled by the Minister for Justice know their duties and understand their duties quite well, and if they were not encouraged to do unlawful acts by the Minister for Justice they would not have committed these illegal acts, but why is the country to pay for the illegalities which the Minister for Justice stands for and encourages? The people have to pay for them.  I do not think that anything like £600, even including costs, would have been incurred up to the present.  So that in providing this sum the Minister must be anticipating the infliction of further penalties as a result of those illegalities.  He anticipates that as a result of his action there are going to be further decrees and further actions.  If anybody should pay for these the Minister for Justice should be made pay for them himself.  The one person primarily and mainly responsible is the Minister for Justice.  As everybody knows, he is a lawyer, and he has no doubts whatever as to what is lawful and what is not.  In his interpretation of the law the Minister for <Col N="327" /> Justice has allowed his knowledge of the law to become flavoured with his political antagonisms and prejudices, and allows them to run riot with him. He encourages the Guards to commit illegalities which some of them, at any rate, would not have done if they had not got certain encouragement. The Minister is responsible for that, and no one else, by his attitude in this House.  Every time any question is raised on the adjournment or otherwise the Minister has taken up that definite attitude of encouraging these illegalities by talking about law and order, and so on.  Is this thing going to stop?  Is the country going to have to provide next year for an increased amount under this sub-head?  Is the Minister, even now, if he has not done so already, going to issue a circular to the Guards that these illegalities must stop, directing their attention to the fact that they are not entitled to commit these illegalities?  If there are members of the Guards who have certain political prejudices, and who are partisans, and see that they are backed up by the Minister for Justice, they will persist in these illegalities. They will be encouraged when they see that provision is made in this Estimate to pay their decrees.</P>
