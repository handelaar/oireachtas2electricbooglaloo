      <P>I am aware that allegations attributed to <Col N="933" /> the master and the crew of the vessel have been emphatically denied by the residents and it would appear that the master and the crew did not make any effort to look after the ship's cargo and equipment. My official concern, however, is limited to the salvage of the cargo and other contents of the wreck.  On an explanation of their obligations in respect of salved cargo the islanders generally have facilitated the receiver of wreck in the recovery of all the articles salved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that petrol is retailed in Dublin at 1s. 5½d. per gallon, and in Belfast at 1s. 7½d. per gallon, although in Belfast it is subject to a tax of 4d. per gallon; if the Government has made any recent representations to the oil companies concerning this discrepancy in prices; and, if so, with what result; and, further, if the Government is prepared to consider the advisability of controlling petrol prices should this unfair discrimination against the Free State consumers be continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The replies of the oil companies to my representations on the subject of petrol prices in the Saorstát have been under recent examination.  The differential which, after making allowance for the tax on petrol in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, exists against the Saorstát has been justified by the companies mainly on the grounds of higher transportation and distribution charges.  I do not feel satisfied that these grounds sufficiently account for the present <Col N="934" /> differential, but the subject is a difficult one on which to form a judgment.</P>
      <P>I am prepared to consider the control of petrol prices if and when satisfied that unfair discrimination exists and that a continuance of petrol supplies at controlled prices can be insured.</P>

      <P>The reason for this Supplementary Vote is described in a footnote in the White Paper.  It is the cost of a carpet for presentation as a State gift during the Jubilee Year.  The Jubilee Year has been marked by a great many States as a proper occasion on which to make a gift to the Holy Father.  Our concern was to make a presentation which would be distinctive in itself and which would indicate certain things characteristic of the country.  After consultation with the Vatican authorities it was decided that a carpet was the best form which the gift could take.  It will be laid in one of the rooms in which pilgrims ordinarily pass on the way to an audience with the Holy Father.</P>

      <P>The amendment mainly sets out that the moneys expended on the execution of works shall be included in the sums referred to in Section 15 of the Principal Act.

Should the Minister not be obliged to attach the conditions which are the result of an agreement between himself and the parties concerned?

      <P>Amendment 2, providing that the Minister for Finance shall advance money, cannot be moved by a private Deputy.  The amendment is, therefore, out of order.  The Deputy may perhaps make his point on the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose I had in view was to make explicit and to have sanctioned by the Dáil such a large sum as half a million pounds. The Minister himself might consider that.  I accept your ruling that it is out of order for a private Deputy to move an amendment involving expenditure of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will speak on the section in the light of the amendment that has been ruled out of order.  The amendment would mean that the sum of two and a half million pounds originally voted for the Board would be increased by half a million pounds.  There is no necessity for that.  The Board is not straitened owing to the outgoings to date.  The Board certainly ought to show that the money that is handed over to it is going to be remunerative, and it has to make a case why it should get more money.  To introduce this casually simply because the Cork station has been bought out is not justified.  The purchase of the Cork station was always before those who drew up the 1927 Act, and the purchase price was always considered to be included in the two and a half million pounds.  The whole thing was looked to.  I do not say that the exact price was definitely <Col N="940" /> arrived at, but a sum for the purchase of the Cork and other undertakings, and for the purchase by agreement of certain small undertakings, was always in our minds when we were arranging for this two and a half million pounds, and there is no reason to believe that that two and a half million pounds will not be sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Minister assures us that the Electricity Supply Board will not be in any way hampered in having to meet the charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to say that, because I do not know enough about it, but they always had before them the fact that they had to buy the Cork undertaking, and they knew that the two and a half million pounds granted to them contained a sum which we thought was sufficient for that and for the purchase of other undertakings.  I have no reason to believe that the two and a half millions will not be sufficient for all purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the £400,000 per half-year given to the Electricity Supply Board is not sufficient to meet this, will the Minister still be obliged to pay the difference, or what will happen the Electricity Supply Board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.  The very purpose of Section 4 of the amending Bill, while keeping an over-riding limit of two and a half million pounds, is to enable more than £400,000 to be advanced in any half-year. It is clear that if a single transaction will cost more than £400,000 and when the Board has other liabilities falling on it for the past half-year £400,000 would not be sufficient.  We meet that by Section 4, but we keep an over-riding limit of two and a half million pounds. The Deputy's amendment would simply say: &ldquo;Here is another half million pounds.&rdquo;  We do not think that another half a million pounds should be given so lightly as that.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1) (b), to delete the brackets and words &ldquo;(other than section 96 of the Principal Act),&rdquo; lines 45-46, and to delete sub-section (2) and substitute a new sub-section as follows: &mdash;&ldquo;Section 96 of the Principal Act is hereby repealed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that here the onus lies on the Minister to make a case against the amendment rather than on me to make a case for it, because it is obvious that an injustice is being done to a very large section of ratepayers in County Clare.  I want to be perfectly clear and perfectly concise on this matter.  Some six years ago certain lands were acquired <Col N="943" /> adjoining the Shannon, when the development of the Shannon power was in contemplation, and after a while a Bill was introduced transferring whatever power the Minister had to the Electricity Supply Board. The Bill passed all its stages in the Dáil, and passed all its stages in the Seanad up to the Report Stage, when the Minister introduced an amendment to exempt from rates what are known as the Shannon works.  Practically all these works are situated in County Clare, and when we realise the extent of the works and of the land taken over we will have some picture of the injustice done to the ratepayers of the county.</P>
    <P>I find myself in very good company in opposing this provision.  I am not referring to the company of Deputy de Valera &mdash; probably his character in certain quarters is as open to question as my own &mdash; but when I find myself in company with Senator Sir John Keane, Senator Barrington, Mr. Hewat and the Earl of Wicklow in advancing a case against this provision, I think I am in very good company.  In the Seanad Senator Sir John Keane said: &ldquo;Take County Clare, which is a poor county.  Clare has a very considerable property now established in the county.  The use of that property and all the attendant circumstances throw a charge on the local services.  The people connected with it use the roads; the employers use the hospitals; they re-act on the poor law; and the whole of that undertaking is to be exempt from rates.  Is that just?  It is a question of &lsquo;all hands to the pumps.&rsquo; At any cost this scheme must be passed over to the public &mdash; whether it is done by a dangerous precedent or sound finance does not matter.  The public has to bear it.  In this case the ratepayer, the small farmer, in West Clare has to subsidise this through free local services.  I really think it is time to cry halt to this wholly unprecedented way of proceeding.&rdquo;  We have had the Minister's own assurance that it is not a case of all hands to the pumps; we have his own <Col N="944" /> assurance that the scheme is safe and that it is now a question of further development, so that the argument that the scheme is not economic, is not paying its way, falls to the ground.</P>
    <P>Then we have Senator Barrington saying, &ldquo;as a matter of fact if this section is passed Clare will suffer considerable loss.  There is a considerable amount of property that will go to the Board and that at present pays rates in Clare.  That property is being acquired by the Board, and now, in future, it will pay no rates.  I do not think that is right.  I think that these works should pay rates to the immediate district in which they are situate, and which has incurred a considerable amount of expense in consequence of them.&rdquo;  Senator Sir John Keane went on to say that every bit of Government property pays rates. Civic Guard barracks pay rates.  It is significant that the Minister did then say something with reference to it.  He said that this scheme would be in exactly the same position as other Government Departments. But just as an act of grace, if the amendment is passed, the Board will be in exactly the same position as a Government Department.  It is interesting to know that, and in the light of that statement it is interesting to see that no ex-gratia payment of any kind has been made to Clare Co. Council for the last six years in connection with this scheme.  It is also interesting to inquire whether the Minister is going to make any payment to Clare Co. Council in lieu of the losses that body has suffered in rates.</P>
    <P>When the matter came back to the Dáil Mr. Hewat said: &ldquo;The Minister has argued consistently right through the Bill that the ratepayers and the consumers were not one and the same persons.&rdquo;  The Minister intervened to say: &ldquo;And I still hold to that.&rdquo;  Mr. Hewat went on to say:</P>
    <P>If that is so, what is the Minister's argument in this case in favour of this amendment?  It simply means that he is going to <Col N="945" /> charge the non-consumer a rate for something that he is getting no benefit for.  Taking the works as a whole, distributed over the whole country, why should they be exempt from rates?  I cannot follow the logic of this at all.  I can see why a local authority confined within its own area could argue that there was no use in making a transfer entry of a sum of money in favour of the local rates from its own electricity undertaking.</P>
    <P>The Minister repeated in the Dáil that the position of the Electricity Supply Board would be the position of a Government Department.  The Minister bases his case on what he calls the advantages of the county and the ratepayers derived from the presence in Co. Clare of the Shannon works.  It is interesting to know what we get in Clare as a result of the presence of the Shannon works. The Minister stated the other day that something like one and a half millions had been spent locally.  I wonder was the Minister serious when he said that?  Did he not know that most of the miserable wage, for which he was responsible, went to other parts of the country to help to keep the families of the poor men who were working on the scheme on a starvation wage?  Did he not know that the only place that might have got any of the money was the City of Limerick?  Did he not know that most of the food and a good deal of the clothing sold to the workers on the Shannon scheme was neither bought in the county nor made in the county, but was, to a great extent, imported?</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister is not serious in saying to the ratepayers that because the Shannon scheme was operated within the county they benefited? Let us see what has been the effect of the Shannon scheme on local rates.  We find that the expense on the board of health, which is responsible for the upkeep of hospitals, was £487 10s. for the treatment and support of patients consequent upon accidents and sicknesses contracted during the operation of the scheme.  We find that the <Col N="946" /> Shannon scheme tapped certain spring wells and interfered with pumps for which Clare Board of Health had to be responsible to the tune of over £100.  Let us take what the county council calculates as its loss in the matter of valuation.  We find from the county council books that lands marked &ldquo;exempt from rating&rdquo; in the valuation lists dated 1st March, 1930, represent 1,169a. 3r. 34 perches, of which the valuation was £739 1s. and on which the rates would have been £292 16s. 2d. We find lands marked &ldquo;Waste under water&rdquo; in the valuation lists dated 1st March, 1930, to be 368a. Or. 21 perches, of which the valuation was £283 6s., the rates on which would have been £115 7s. 9d.  The loss that will arise in connection with the de-rating of fisheries will be something like £203 13s. 1d., making a total loss in rates of £611 17s.  That is a serious loss to the ratepayers of Clare.  It is something they are entitled to talk about and to ask the Minister why, when he has an opportunity, now that he is re-opening, so to speak, the whole scheme in so far as it affects local authorities, he does not see his way to remove the injustice? If new buildings are to be erected in Athlone or Mullingar &mdash; I have no particular reference to these places in my mind &mdash; in New Ross or in some part of Tirconaill, they are not going to be free from taxes; they are going to pay rates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Make a definite statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I make this definite statement that the Minister had an opportunity of undoing the injustice he did to Clare ratepayers in 1927, but he made no attempt to do <Col N="947" /> it.  The advantages that the Minister says Clare derived were little or nothing.  The losses are very serious and very grave, close on £500 for the upkeep of the hospitals while the scheme was in progress, and close on £1,000 in the matter of the valuation of the county.  Let us see how it affects the ordinary user of electricity in Clare, where one would expect there would be some advantage given to those people who are paying to make the supply cheap. A house in Dublin with a valuation of £18 will get electricity cheaper, unit for unit, using, let us say, 240 units in the year, than a user in Ennis with a valuation of £6.  That is how we are being recouped for what we have done for allowing the Shannon works to go free of rates for the last six years.  I think the case for the amendment is that we have been getting no advantage from the presence of the Shannon buildings in the administrative county of Clare, that we are losing considerably in the matter of valuation and rates, and that as users of electricity we are getting no advantage whatever, and that as a matter of fact we are suffering a good deal when you realise that a man with a valuation of three times the amount in Dublin gets electricity cheaper than the man in Ennis.  That indicates what the advantage is to the Clare people, and when you realise that the Clare ratepayers, small farmers, cottiers and shopkeepers scattered throughout the length and breadth of the county will not consume electricity for the next ten years you realise why it is not fair that the Clare ratepayers should be asked to subsidise an electricity undertaking in order to provide cheap electricity for, say, Deputy J. J. Byrne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Hogan, I too would like to know on what principle the Minister for Industry and Commerce justifies this exemption from rates of the Shannon works.  It seems to me that it is altogether a wrong principle if we are to judge of it by the way the Minister is working it out.  It is <Col N="948" /> altogether a wrong principle to deal with an enterprise like this as if it were a commercial enterprise, and then on the other hand to make a hidden subsidy to it.  If it is so much property it ought to be dealt with as an ordinary commercial enterprise would be dealt with as far as accounts are concerned, and all these items ought to be shown up. That is number one.</P>
      <P>Secondly, it would appear that the Minister tries to distinguish between new works erected and works or occupation of premises where these have already been paying rates.  It would seem that this distinction is being made.  I find it hard to justify that distinction.  For instance, the Shannon scheme in Clare affects Clare.  There are natural resources in the proximity of that area and that area would ordinarily benefit by them if they were developed in the ordinary commercial way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know full well that this matter of the development of the Shannon was not the outcome of a special brainwave that struck a member of the Ministry.  As a matter of fact there were for a half century before various attempts and plans for the development of that on an ordinary commercial basis.  If that were done Clare would benefit by the rates accordingly.  Now the Minister has stepped in and he deprives Clare of the possibilities of the rates that would come from that development. That is dealing with it from the point of view of principle.  Of course there is no justification of any kind that I can see for not making good to Clare the rates it has lost.  The Minister has made that good in other cases.  He has in this very Bill introduced a section to remove all doubt and to make it clear that this enterprise is not and never was a State enterprise of the kind that would exempt it from valuation.  If that be so how is he going to justify this loss of £611?  I think that that is estimated as the yearly loss which the County of Clare has got to bear by the taking <Col N="949" /> away of lands and property which in the ordinary way would have paid rates to Clare.  The Minister's attitude in this is very peculiar, so peculiar that I find it difficult as I said at the very beginning to understand on what principle he is proceeding at all.  His whole attitude about the position of Clare seems to be one of utter disregard of the local interests that are involved.  We know that for instance in the case of fishermen who are deprived of their rights he has made no provision for compensation to them nor has he made any definite provision for lands that at the moment are being submerged by the backwater flow from the raising of the level in Lough Derg.  The reports to me at any rate have been that a number of people in these areas have had their lands submerged and no steps whatever have been taken to compensate them, and it is doubtful whether any definite provision is made for them except they proceed on their common law right to get compensation.</P>
    <P>At any rate it would appear that the Minister has paid very little attention to them.  In fact, it would seem that he has paid no attention to these particular items, at any rate, items of injustice upon the local people by the development of this scheme.  Even in regard to public buildings, we have here in the Estimates every year substantial sums that are being paid by the Government for Government property in lieu of rates.  If that be done in the case of accepted, definitely known and admitted State buildings and State services why should it not be done in the case of this commercial undertaking?  As I say, I appreciate Deputy Hogan's view in this matter when he stated at the start that it ought to be the Minister who would make the case for exemption.  The case for the refusing of this exemption is so clear to me that it seems like proving two and two to be four, proving that Clare should get the rates that are properly due to it.  Accordingly I <Col N="950" /> am moving jointly this amendment with Deputy Hogan.</P>

      <P>I would just like to say one word with reference to the very kind remarks of Deputy Hogan.  As I have already said in this House the City of Dublin always comes in for the worst end of the stick when anything in the nature of taxation or sacrifice for the national good is being discussed.  I would like to remind Deputy Hogan that we have made a sacrifice that the people in Clare have not made for the Shannon Scheme.  I would like to remind Deputy Hogan that our electricity scheme in the City of Dublin was thrown into the national pool without a penny compensation and that there has been no outcry as far as the City of Dublin is concerned.</P>

      <P>This is the most naive proposal that has yet come before the Dáil, that there should be got for Clare out of a scheme, always described as a national scheme, de-rating to the extent of about 40 per cent. of the entire rates that fall on Clare.  There are a few small points urged by Deputy Hogan that ought <Col N="951" /> to be attended to.  He said that if new buildings were erected at New Ross by the Board that rates would be paid on them.  I said &ldquo;no&rdquo; to that.  He then said I was quibbling. I do not know how a direct negative to a statement like that could be described as quibbling.  The Deputy is quite wrong in the point.  He said that users of electricity in Clare would get no advantage.  I would like to find any man in Clare who is paying more for electricity now or only paying as much for electricity now as he was paying a year ago. Nobody is getting any advantage! That is one of the Deputy's statements. He also went on to make the statement that &ldquo;we are not getting the same advantage as Dublin people.&rdquo;  Users of electricity in Clare are getting no advantage. Would he give me individual cases of people who are paying more now for the Shannon current coming to them than they were paying before the Shannon current came?</P>

I pointed out that a man with three times the valuation in Dublin &mdash; a valuation of £18 &mdash; who was using 240 units of electricity per year is getting electricity cheaper than a user in Ennis with a valuation of £6.

      <P>On the second point, as regards valuation, why should the Clare ratepayer on a valuation basis be put on an equality with the Dublin man?  Should the valuations be the same?  To start with, property valued at £6 in a particular part of Clare would probably be valued at £18 in Dublin.  Valuation in a country district is one thing, and valuation in the City is another.  Supposing what he said is right, that the man with a £6 valuation in Clare is paying more than the man with an £18 valuation in Dublin.  That may happen owing to the nature of things, but it is no injustice to Clare.  It will certainly happen as between Wexford and Dublin, and it will happen, but not probably with the same marked difference as between Wexford and Cork, and it is right that it should happen.  One of the advantages of belonging to the bigger community is that services can be cheapened. If the Deputy wanted to get that sort of thing changed he should have bethought himself of it when the 1927 Bill was introduced.  He should have said that the expenses of Shannon electricity all over the country should be borne by electricity consumers at a flat rate.  But we did make a difference.  The difference is there, and I think it is justified.  Deputy Hogan said that a tremendous loss is borne by the Clare County Council.  Of course, there are a whole lot of imaginative losses.  When we came to hard tacks, what did it amount to?  The Deputy's <Col N="953" /> best showing was £600, £400 by reason of land and some fantastic figure of £200 by reason of fisheries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the proposition of the two Deputies and no regard is to be taken of the considerable concrete advantages that Clare derived from the Shannon scheme while it was in progress. Deputy de Valera does not understand the distinction that is made between new and acquired buildings. The distinction is this: That the House in 1927 agreed, in the interests of electrical development, that new property into which the State was putting a sum of £5,000,000 should be exempt from rates, it being regarded that electrical development was a necessity for this country if it was going to make any progress.  When we came on to consider electricity not merely in its generation and long distance transmission aspects, but in its distribution side, I said as there were already Councils which had been relying on very big incomes from property that we would stereotype that for them.  That is what we are doing now, but we are still acting on the old principle that generating and long distance transmission equipment in the interests of national development ought to be free from rates.  That is the principle I am going on here.  At any rate, nobody is going to agree to the amendment, because if the amendment were carried we would have to re-cast the whole rating arrangements with regard to the Shannon. We would have to say that the Shannon has to be rated in the ordinary way and that we would have to have these rates struck not according to where the generating end of the property lies but according to the areas from which receipts are got.  That would not leave <Col N="954" /> Clare in any better position than it is in at the moment.  But it certainly would be an unjust thing to stereotype on the Board £50,000 or £60,000 for certain distribution works and then have a complete revaluation of the whole property, including the same distribution works and by reason of the locality in which certain of the generating plant lies giving a very big amount of the new rateable property to the County of Clare, giving them, as I say, in return for a loss of £400 or £600 a remission of rates per annum of about £50,000.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy has any idea of what his amendment would bring in it can be considered. On the basis of valuation or rating can he conceive that it would bring in to the County Clare only £600 per annum?  With regard to the £600 outstanding, I said that there would have to be a readjustment of the returns on the scheme eventually.  I said that the best time to do that would be 1931 or 1932 when the scheme was definitely paying its way.  I said then that the Board ought to be put in the position of a commercial undertaking, that it should not have all the bad effects of a commercial undertaking and at the same time have all the bad results of a scheme <Col N="955" /> financed from the Central Fund.  I want to repeat that we put everything except the generating and transmission plant in the position of an ordinary undertaking.  In fact, I said we stereotyped the valuation upon which rates should be paid, that even if the Board goes out of possession of certain property now rated they will continue to pay rates. We say further that they will be liable to income tax in the ordinary way and arising out of the fact that they are financed from the Central Fund, the Board has got to make repayments at a certain rate, sinking fund payments of a particular type and interest on the moneys not repaid in the way in which any commercial undertaking would face up to it.  That will have to be adjusted. Is there any hardship in the meantime on County Clare in carrying out the ordinary local government procedure, that for a period of years new buildings are exempt from rates?</P>
      <P>We applied the ordinary procedure as far as this £500 or £600 loss is concerned.  When Deputies accepted that &mdash; and all Deputies not merely accepted that but welcomed it &mdash; in other respects, why do they object to it in connection with the Shannon Scheme?  At any rate, we have got to this net point now: this £500 or £600 is the whole thing that is to be considered and, as I am advised, the effect of the amendment is to put into the hands of the County Council of Clare between £48,000 and £50,000. They are going to get de-rating in Co. Clare to whatever percentage that is of the total rates raised in return for a loss of £500 or £600. That is the proposition we are up against.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy has referred to fishermen. That matter will come up on another amendment and I shall not refer to it now.  As to the payment in lieu of rates, up to date no payment has been made in lieu of rates. If this property were still to remain in the hands of the Minister &mdash; to that extent, the property would still be regarded as Government property &mdash;<Col N="956" /> and if it were marked &ldquo;exempt from rates&rdquo; and if payment in lieu of rates were ordinarily to be expected, in fact no such payment would come because there is a limit in the ordinary law to the amount that can be paid in lieu of rates in any county.  Co. Clare is at present getting the full amount which it is possible for it to get by way of payment in lieu of rates.  As far as the Co. Clare is concerned, it is not losing anything.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be.  If the Deputy objects to Civic Guard stations, his councils do not object to taking the money in respect of them. They are getting, at the moment, all they can get in respect of the rating of Government property.  Again, there might be a better adjustment made as between the Civic Guard barracks and the Shannon Scheme as far as Clare is concerned, but if this scheme were to pay poundage in lieu of rates Co. Clare, situate as it is with regard to Government property, would not get anything in respect of the poundage so paid.  On those grounds, I ask that the amendment be rejected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the Minister's explanation.  It seems to me he is mixing up two things.  There are two questions involved here.  There is, first of all, the question of new works, so to speak, and there is the question of the definite loss Clare has sustained. As regards the new works, I put the amendment in the form in which it is because I had no means of finding out what amount Clare would be entitled to if this were an ordinary commercial undertaking and rates were paid accordingly.  Because this estimate is too high or because Clare would benefit by an amount which the Minister thinks too much, he is apparently going to end the matter by making no provision at all.  Which of us, I wonder, is guilty of the greater exaggeration? Is it the Minister, or is it I in putting down this figure, when I <Col N="957" /> had no opportunity of getting a definite figure, seeing that on general principles, unless something to the contrary can be shown, Clare is entitled to get the rates from this property? If a syndicate or some other body had come in and developed these works, it might be in the national interests generally but Clare would get the benefit of it. The Minister thinks he has a good point when he says that this is an exaggerated sum.  His exaggeration is to remove it altogether. Probably members of the House who wanted to see fair play on this question would strike a figure somewhere between us.  At any rate, whatever may be said about the question of getting the full value for new work, there is no doubt in my mind as to the right to restitution of the sum indicated by Deputy Hogan &mdash; the sum taken away from Clare.  What excuse does the Minister give for depriving Clare annually of this sum of £611 odd? These are rates that Clare was getting.  He is depriving Clare of those rates.  He is suggesting that the citizens of Clare are, somehow, getting a special advantage but he has not shown in any single respect where they get this advantage from this national undertaking.  What is happening is that Clare is subsidising the rest of the country and I do not think that that is fair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not introduced a comparison.  I do not know what the Deputy is talking about, and therefore I cannot answer his question.  I do say, in this particular respect, Clare is being asked to subsidise this scheme to the extent of £611 yearly, by way of rates to <Col N="958" /> which it was entitled and which it is now to give up.  Again, I am against this on general principle, because I should like to see the accounts of this undertaking brought out in the same way as the accounts of any ordinary commercial enterprise. I should like to know whether rates are being paid on the beet factory in Carlow.  That beet scheme was regarded as a national experiment in the beginning, but I dare say rates are being paid on the property now.  Ford's works in Cork are benefiting the community there, but I am sure they are paying rates there.  Whether they are paying rates to the full extent I do not know; they probably are.  Therefore, I ask the Minister what is the basis on which he is depriving Clare of these rates, and why is he making no attempt to make restitution for the £611 odd that Clare is shown to be losing as a result of the Shannon scheme?  These two questions are separate, and I should like to get a more definite answer than the Minister has given about each of them separately, particularly about the second one.  As regards the other questions of loss, such as the loss which they had to bear in providing hospital services for the workers on the Shannon scheme, these were definite losses imposed on Clare which would not have been imposed in ordinary circumstances.  What is the Minister's attitude with regard to them, and what is his attitude with regard to the pumps?  £33 in one case and £120 in the other case had to be incurred by Clare County Council in order to provide pumps where the Shannon scheme destroyed the existing water supply. What about the labourers' plots taken over?  About eight plots were taken over, and in two or three cases houses and out-offices have been taken away&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I ask Deputies who want to see fair play to vote for this amendment.  If anybody wants to amend the provision when we have definite figures, then that can be done on the Report Stage if we get the principle accepted now.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that fair play obviously demands that what is done in connection with new buildings on one part should be done in connection with new buildings in another part.  There is no case whatever for making new buildings in Clare liable for rates payable to the local authorities any more than for making them payable in the case of new buildings elsewhere.  The principle the Minister has adopted in other parts of the country is that rates will continue to be paid on old buildings as heretofore.  If it is the case &mdash; which I was not aware of &mdash; that County Clare will lose their rates on the valuation of the land which has been absorbed in the Shannon scheme, then there would seem to be a similar case for retaining from the Electricity Supply Board the amount payable hitherto on the lands now taken over by them.  That would seem to be on a par with what is done in other parts of the country.</P>

We found that there was no provision made in the Bill to restore to the County Clare what it had been deprived of by the Act of 1927.  We put down this amendment to give the Dáil an opportunity of saying whether it considered an injustice had been done to Clare and, if so, to what extent.  Nobody expected that the County Council of Clare would receive £40,000 or £50,000.  Nobody suggested that.  If the Minister says that is the effect, I suppose it shows that he cannot get away from the legal mind.  It is not the effect that I want and I venture to say it is not the effect that Deputy de Valera wants.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We had better get clear at once on this question of flooding.  If there is any land flooded under the Shannon scheme, compensation has to be paid.  There is no land being flooded in the sense that there is no land being submerged for a season, and therefore rendered liable to deterioration. There is no such thing as that happening under the Shannon scheme. The scheme has, in fact, benefited lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever we have taken land and definitely submerged it we bought it out.  That is the land included in the acreage to which Deputy Hogan referred, coming within a valuation of £400.  There is nothing beyond that.  If any man says there is land now being flooded, not flooded before, I want to be told the exact spot where it is, and I shall get surveyors to go down and make examinations and submit a report to me.  If land is taken by me and put in the condition that is described, in which it is submerged.  I acquire that land. That land always stands exempt from rates because it is the property of the Minister for Industry and Commerce acquired under the Electricity Act, 1925.  It is all included in the figure of £400.  There is no other land flooded for which we are responsible. If there is a claim for flooding at some part of the year, as there is with regard to the backing up of water at a certain culvert, that claim is examined.  Surveyors are, in the case I mentioned, on the spot, and compensation may have to be paid.  But if it is a case of land that is going to be permanently flooded and goes on deteriorating in value, that land will be acquired by me.  I may have to get rid of it and sell it, and if the sale takes place with all these evil conditions then I will get less for it, but I do not believe that that occurs.  The only land I acquired is the land that I took definitely in regard to the scheme and which I submerged. Except for the land that I took around Lough Derg, of very poor quality, and land that I took for the whole canal system, it can clearly be said of Co. Clare it has <Col N="963" /> benefited, and benefited greatly, by reason of the prevention of flooding. It is clear to anybody of commonsense who looks at it that, in fact, neither the river nor the Lough is held at any greater height than they would ordinarily rise to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If that were being done a claim for compensation would arise at once.  The scheme has been carried out very carefully as far as that side of the case is concerned.  At other places, where there was a bank of a particular height, where the water held at the winter flood in a particular way for a certain number of months, and where there was liability to flooding for a corresponding number of months, if we were going to hold it for four months instead of two, we built an embankment.  We have definitely bettered the land in Clare, and, if it is contended that that is not so we will have to get exact areas mentioned.</P>
      <P>Then there was some talk of a water supply.  I do not know what pumps are referred to, but if there has been a water supply damaged by reason of the operation of the Shannon scheme, I have to pay compensation or else remake the water supply.  If the authorities are not satisfied with the terms given, they can even force arbitration, and I am quite willing to have the matter submitted to arbitration.  In a great many cases, as far as the flooding of land is concerned, or in regard to some expense incurred by reason of pumping, they have been anxious to get arbitration.  That must be met under the Act when the damage is proved.  With regard to labourers' plots, if it is thought that the valuations on which they have been taken over is not fair, arbitration is there. It only means an application, and the arbitrator must be appointed by the Chief Justice.  Let us wipe these things out of this case altogether. Similarly, fishermen do not come into this as far as rates are concerned.</P>

      <P>It is the most direct thing possible.  Take away Section 96 and all the property is liable to valuation.  How would the generating plant be valued?  Take either of two things, constructional cost or the receipts that would be derived from that generating plant, in other words from the bulk supply of 137 million units of electricity all over the country.  Take either of these two approaches to it, and take away the exemption from rates given by Section 96, and the Deputy is certainly going to get more than the amount in the amendment.  The Deputy knows that there is a considerable number of thousands in the amendment.  With regard to the £500, if Co. Clare is losing anything at the moment I say that in Co. Clare money has been expended that came from all over the country, money raised on the credit of electricity consumers' payments for years to come.  That money was put out in shoals around Clare and Limerick.  In three years I should say they got at least one hundred times this £400.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know when Deputy Hogan talked about hospital cases is it that Clare Board of <Col N="965" /> Health calculates the difference between the cost of keeping the patients and the payments made for them by the contractors?  At any rate, that is a separate item.  With regard to this £400, Clare has got more than that in three years. There is a period according to ordinary local government practice during which new buildings are exempt from rates.  Clare should stay out during that period.  What was land taken over for?  For the purpose of the canal, and the purpose of the canal was the power-house. In the ordinary way, apart from being Government property, the power-house would be exempt from rates for a number of years.  I think that whatever adjustments have to be made had better be made at the time when one sees the Board's finances clearly and exactly in late 1931 or the early part of 1932.  So far as rates are concerned, the principle was decided on here that in the interests of electrical development these new works should be exempt from rates.  If they are not to be exempt from rates the way to achieve what is sought is not to have an amendment down to this Bill but to amend the whole section, and simply to say that the Shannon property and everything on it shall be liable to rates.</P>
    <P>That will then be divided according to the way the Valuation Department will approach it, how they will assess liability for rates over the different counties.  It would be unjust to have imposed on the Board a sum of £50,000 or £60,000 by reason of old buildings acquired and then have the entire property revalued. If the Valuation Department valued the whole works they would value on the basis of profits received and net gains.  They would distribute that over certain counties.  Possibly in the case of Clare they would take something off.  Certainly Clare would not get anything like the £50,000 which this amendment would give them.  I am pleading again that the amendment should be rejected.  It has no relation <Col N="966" /> to the small sum of £500.  That sum should be left as it is and not paid to the Co. Clare for, say, two years. There is a longer period ordinarily covered by local government practice in regard to the exemption of new buildings from rates.  As far as the other thing is concerned, if and when we decide to have the whole property valued and put on the ordinary basis we would have to see how the valuation procedure would distribute the rates derived from the whole property, and in addition the Board would have to get relief from certain harsh conditions imposed at present as regards repayments by reason of the fact that this is voted from the Central Fund.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that I asked Deputies to split the difference.  I did not do anything of the kind, taking the expression splitting the difference to mean what it ordinarily does.  What I said was that, as between the amendment in my name and the name of Deputy Hogan and the Minister's attitude to give nothing, the Minister estimated our amendment would give Clare £50,000.  I had no definite means of reaching any figure that I could rely upon, neither am I satisfied that I can rely on the Minister's £50,000, but assuming there is some figure like that, what I said was that fair-minded Deputies, realising the resources which are being taken away from Clare now, and which if exploited in the ordinary commercial way to the benefit of the Co. Clare, would have produced a large additional revenue for the Co. Council, would estimate some figure between the zero of the Minister on that matter and the £50,000.  As regards the other matter, it does not directly come in, except as indicating what the attitude of the Minister towards Clare has been.  That is the sum of £400 with respect to land and the £200 added in respect to fisheries, the rates on which they are going to lose also.  That is a separate matter.  I did not bring it in here as it is not relevant, but as things stand Clare is not merely losing the advantage she would have in the possession of <Col N="967" /> these natural resources but the Clare County Council is also losing this definite sum, and in order to rectify that I am going to stand by the amendment.</P>

      <P>If the Minister is in earnest about the contention that in one or two years' time there will be some readjustment of the position, why is not provision made for that in the Bill, that the ratepayers in Clare who have been mulcted for the six years would have their position reconsidered?  The Minister talked about the gains to Co. Clare.  I dispute that there is any gain to the county, but even if on his assumption there has been a gain, surely he will admit that that has been to a limited area.  He cannot say that the ratepayers in Ballyvaughan or Kilmihill got any advantage from it.  They should not be taxed to subsidise the electricity undertaking.  With regard to arbitration, the Minister says it is there.  We have heard that so often from the Minister that we accept it as part of his stock-in-trade. I asked for arbitration twelve months ago in respect of land taken by the Minister and I am still waiting for any development in that direction.</P>

      <P>The reason for this amendment is that if these words were to stand it might happen that certain property, which should be separately valued, would not be separately valued and the exemption would apply to a piece of Shannon property to which we meant it to apply and to some other property which happened to be in with it.  It is better to leave out these words altogether.  The effect would be that if a mistake were made property which it was not intended to exempt might fall under the exemption clause.  It would then be for the local authority, if this subsection were left out, to see that the property which they want to have liable to rates is kept apart from Shannon property which will be exempted.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That this Bill be read a Second Time.&rdquo;  The Housing Act of 1929 provided a sum of £200,000 for housing.  The net effect of the present Bill is to provide another £200,000 in respect of houses that will be begun before 1st April next and completed before 31st October, 1931.  Of the £200,000 provided under the 1929 Act about £16,000 was utilised to give grants in respect of houses that had been approved under the previous Acts but in respect of which there was no money.  At present there is a sum of £18,391 left.  The equivalent of that sum in houses would be 360 houses.  In respect of the remaining sum of £166,000 under the 1929 Act, grants have been provided in respect of local authorities for 989 houses, private persons 2,097, and public utility societies, 188, so that the total number of houses provided under the Housing Acts from 1924 to 1929 is: &mdash; local authorities, 4,975; private persons, 12,906; and public utility societies, 991, giving a total of 18,872, to which we have to add 360 houses, being the equivalent of <Col N="972" /> £18,000 unallotted, bringing the total to 19,232.  The sum of £200,000 now asked for will provide another 4,000 houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes to continue the terms of the 1929 Act with this addition: that whereas under the 1929 Act the Irish Soldiers' and Sailors' Land Trust was excluded as a person entitled to grants, we propose to include the Trust under the present Bill as being entitled to receive grants in respect of houses begun subsequent to the passing of this Bill and before 1st April, 1931.  It will be remembered in regard to the Trust that complaint was made before the Committee which was set up to deal with the claims of British ex-Servicemen that they were not given the grants under the 1924 and subsequent Acts.  The Committee came to the conclusion that it was reasonable to exclude the Trust. The general position in regard to the Trust is that when it was originally set up there was a definite amount of money allocated to it and a prescribed number of houses &mdash; 2,626 &mdash; were to be built.  Since the passing of the 1924 Act, the British Treasury regulation governing the limit of the number of houses to be built, has been removed and there is now no limit to the number of such houses.  They have already completed 2,187 houses.  The number under contract is 260 and plans are ready for the building of 150 while they are waiting proof of title in respect of another 55.  They estimate that, in all, they will be able to build 2,690 houses and their ambitions go further than that.  Reconsidering the housing position and the urgency of housing needs, we have come to the conclusion that for the purpose of assisting the Trust in its endeavour to build more houses than the number originally intended and, for the purpose of inducing them to speed up their operations, we think that it is reasonable to include them in this Bill and to give them the same grants as given in respect of private persons in the case of houses that will have been begun subsequent to the passing of this Bill and <Col N="973" /> before 1st April, 1931.  I quoted figures in the case of the number of private persons and local authorities that were allotted grants under the 1929 Act.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to private persons is pretty well maintained. The following figures may be of interest to Deputies.  During the month of September, 1929, grants were allotted in respect of 249 houses; in October, 171 houses; in November, 215 houses; in December, 183 houses and in January, 1930, 21 houses.  The reason for the small number in January is that the figure is net and that a certain number of allocations, 66 allocations in fact, were cancelled because the conditions under which the allocations were made were not completed.  That is, the houses were not completed before October 1929.  In February grants were allocated in respect of 163 houses; in March, 161 houses; in April, 221 houses, and in May, 300 houses, making a total of 1,684 during the nine months.  That is as regards private persons and public utility societies.  As regards local authorities, the position is that in September, 1929, grants were allotted in respect of 493 houses, including 434 in Dublin; in October in respect of 17; in November in respect of 165 which included 75 labourers' cottages in Co. Dublin and 35 in Co. Cork.  There was no allocation in respect of December. There was an allocation in respect of one house in January, none in February, 10 in March, 136 in April and 214 in May.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the subject of housing on the Estimates, I mentioned the fact that we had made a census of the housing wants.  I said that urban local authorities gave as their estimated requirements 42.880 houses.  After having examined 34 of these districts, that is, having sent medical and engineering inspectors to examine the situation there, we reduced these requirements by about 27 or 28 per cent.  We estimated the total requirements in urban districts as 31,000 houses.  Since then local authorities, particularly as a result <Col N="974" /> of the Local Loans Fund being opened, and financial provision by way of loans being made, have got busy on their plans.  Out of 93 authorities, 27 have already acquired sites and have had plans approved in respect of 1,591 houses.  In the case of 22 others, sites are being acquired and plans are being prepared in respect of 363 houses.  So that if you compare that movement with the position indicated by the figures I have quoted, from the tail end of last summer to the beginning of this year, we see that there is a very definite move on the part of local authorities to take advantage of the present loan facilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>As an instalment of the housing policy of the Government I have no particular objection to the proposed Bill, but I do think that, seeing the urgent nature of the problem of housing, the Bill is not at all adequate to the situation.  We have had recently here, and in fact we have had for several years, frequent discussions on this question of housing.  I have taken part in a number of them, and I have always emphasised that, with the possible exception of the question of unemployment, the housing question is the most urgent problem that faces the Government in this House.  I think that it is realised on all sides of the House that the question of the provision of proper houses, particularly for the poorer classes, is a grave, urgent and pressing problem. While I think that is realised on every side and every Party has done its best to impress on the Government the urgency of the problem, the Government does not seem to have realised how necessary it is to do more than is being done to solve this problem, that is to do more than is being done by the provisions of this Bill, which proposes to provide a sum of £200,000 to help the housing situation here in the coming twelve months.  I do not like to have to go back over the old story and to have to talk in what would seem an exaggerated way on this problem, but I think it is necessary to hammer at it, and to keep hammering <Col N="975" /> at it if anything is to be done and if we are to do anything to induce the Government to realise the seriousness of the problem and to face it in the fashion in which it must be faced if it is to be solved within a reasonable time.</P>
      <P>Not long ago I read in the &ldquo;Irish Independent,&rdquo; dated 30th October, 1929, an article.  I have no idea what could induce that newspaper to interest itself in the subject of the Dublin tenements. The article is headed &ldquo;Dublin Tenements.&rdquo;&ldquo;The Word Inhuman Not Too Strong &mdash; Some Appalling Facts.&rdquo;  I will not read it all.  It says here in the course of this alarming article: &ldquo;An &lsquo;Irish Independent&rsquo; representative who visited the Gardiner Street district saw for himself the conditions under which the people housed here have to live. A few minutes' walk from O'Connell Street, the principal thoroughfare of the City, and one is face to face with the appalling poverty of housing accommodation that the tenement system entails.  Here every house, with its average of twelve rooms, shelters its ten families, many of them five and six in number, and the hall-doors, open day and night, give the occupants but little privacy,&rdquo; and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a condition of things that is known to the members of the Government, and probably ought to be particularly well known to the Minister who proposed this Bill.  In that article &mdash; and I did not read much of it for you &mdash; strong language is used in describing the conditions.  But that language or any language that any journalist sent by the &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; newspaper or any newspaper into that area could not exaggerate in describing the horrible conditions under which the people live in the constituency represented by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health amongst others.  Nothing that has been done by this House since it was called into existence has in any way helped to eradicate the evil that exists in <Col N="976" /> that part of the City, without talking at all of the conditions that exist in other quarters of the City as well.  As a matter of fact, these conditions have worsened in the last twenty years, and Bills of this kind, however useful they are or however necessary they are as a palliative, are not going to help to get rid of these abominable housing conditions in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Government, the Minister told us recently, is enshrined in their Housing Bills.  In the Housing Bills proposed by them here and adopted in the last six, seven or eight years their policy, he said, is enshrined.  If that be so, God help the slum-dweller.  God help the poor in the tenements in the City of Dublin and those in the insanitary dwellings in almost every urban area in the Free State.  I say God help them, for there is no hope for them.  This Bill and the other Bills introduced here and the Acts passed have not faced up to the question.  The Minister gave us figures as to the number of houses that have been built.  A considerable number of houses &mdash; nearly 19,000 houses &mdash; have been built.  In the City of Dublin alone fifteen years ago a great deal more than that number were required in order to house the poor of the City of Dublin.  In 1919 as many as 29,000 houses were required, and no attempt has been made to meet that situation adequately.  I think the figure then given was 29,500.  That was, I think, the exact figure taken from the report of Mr. Cowan, the inspector of the Local Government Board at that time.  He said that 29,500 houses were absolutely necessary and urgently required in 1918.</P>
    <P>If that were so in the old City of Dublin twelve years ago, what must be the conditions now, even taking into account the number of new houses that have been built in the meantime?  There have been houses built that have been urgently required for people improperly housed, people with large families.  But whatever has been done has not touched the sore spot in the City of <Col N="977" /> Dublin, which is the slum problem. Houses for the real poor have not been built.  The Government has subsidised the building of houses in many cases for people who could well afford to build houses for themselves. But the poor are left, and they are left in conditions which are going from bad to worse.  I do not know what the prospect is.  The prospects are black anyhow for the slum-dwellers of the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I know that the problem is a difficult one.  We all know it is a difficult one.  We all know that there are obstacles to be overcome, but we know that the Government have made no serious effort to tackle the obstacles in this matter.  They have made no effort in the City of Dublin to tackle the problem of the slumdwellers. The Minister may say that is a local problem &mdash; a problem that ought to be dealt with by the local authorities.  Well, that is so, to some extent, but the situation in Dublin City is peculiar, and if it were left solely to the ratepayers of the City of Dublin the burden would be very heavy, and it would be perhaps more than the City alone could bear without assistance.  I think that will be accepted on all sides. The Minister had a peculiar opportunity of showing that the Government were serious about this problem and of showing that they intended to tackle it and to eradicate it when, in 1924, the municipal authority was abolished and the Commissioners &mdash; very efficient men, we are told &mdash; put in their stead.  The Minister had an opportunity then, through his own officials, of setting a headline and showing what could be done.  The best that has been done since is that about 500 houses per year on an average have been built in the City of Dublin.  That is the best they could do.  That is the best the Minister evidently could get his officials to do with the big subsidies that were at the disposal of the Commissioners in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>It is not just to the Minister's own constituents; it is not just to Dublin, and it certainly is not just to the Free State that more has not <Col N="978" /> been done.  If there is anything that would bring down the dignity and credit of this State, it is to allow the conditions that have existed here so long to continue &mdash; that is, the conditions that exist in the slums of Dublin.  Visitors coming to the City of Dublin have been told what a wonderful change has taken place, and they have been told about the corners we have turned, according to the President, and the wonderful prosperity that is everywhere evident in the City of Dublin. I have heard some Americans, great admirers of the President and his Party, who visited the slums of Dublin last year, speak about these slums.  Who brought them to these slums I do not know.  But I met one or two of these Americans, and they certainly had their eyes opened, for like conditions of poverty and general insanitary conditions they had not seen even in the worst slums of New York, and there are some bad slums there too.</P>
    <P>[<i>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle took the Chair.</i>]</P>
    <P>These things are known, or at least they ought to be known, to the Government as well as to me or the other Deputies who represent Dublin. I only wish it was from that side of the House that speeches of this kind were made so that the Government might be pushed if they are not willing to tackle in a desperate way the desperate ills that exist in these slums.  It is an ill that requires a drastic remedy. Light medicine of the kind that is prescribed in this Bill will not cure that ill.  I have been over this ground before, but I will go over it again.  In 1926, when the census was taken, there were 46,902 families living in one-room tenements, or 140,061 persons living in one-room dwellings in the Free State area. There were 44,131 persons living in two-roomed dwellings in Dublin City alone out of a population of 316,000 odd.  There were 23,655 families or 78,920 persons living in one-roomed dwellings or one-roomed tenements.</P>
    <P>That is on the increase.  If it were <Col N="979" /> on the decrease, even if the decrease were slight, I would say nothing, because I know as well as others here know that the problem of housing in Dublin is not the problem of to-day or yesterday, or of the last ten years.  This problem has been given to us to solve, but in eight years we have done nothing to solve it, and that is my complaint.  In 1911 there were 21,133 families living in one-room dwellings, and in 1926 the number had increased to 23,655, or an increase of over 2,500 families.  The fact is that 27.8 per cent. of the population of the City of Dublin now lives in one-room tenements.  Over 50 per cent. of the total population of the City is now obliged to live in one or two-roomed dwellings.</P>
    <P>That is an old problem, but instead of decreasing under the magnificent statesmanship of a Government presided over by that distinguished Dublin man, President Cosgrave, it is increasing.  As a result of the rotten housing, he sees the infants of the poor of Dublin dying at an alarming rate.  They are dying because of the rotten housing conditions that he and his Government permit to continue and to increase. If there is anything else that he can claim credit for in the Government of the country during the last eight years there is certainly no credit in regard to housing coming to him or to anybody in this House who has any responsibility &mdash; myself included. We all should hide our heads in shame, those of us who have the duty sometimes of visiting those areas.  We should never talk of prosperity or of turning the corner as long as we cannot show, or clearly demonstrate, that we are tackling the problem and reducing the numbers of people who are obliged to live in these insanitary surroundings in our capital City.  It is a disgrace to everybody.  Whatever houses may be built elsewhere &mdash; and God knows they are necessary elsewhere, too &mdash; there is no place in the country, no rural or urban area, where conditions are so disgraceful, <Col N="980" /> so shocking or so inhuman as in parts of Dublin City.</P>
    <P>I have a lot of cuttings here that I took from newspapers within the last six months or so.  Different local authorities report on housing conditions in their own areas, and God knows they are bad.  There is one cutting here dealing with housing in Bray.  It is from the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; of the 6th November last. One of the headings reads: &ldquo;383 Houses Unfit for Human Habitation,&rdquo; and another heading reads: &ldquo;Ten Persons in One-Room Dwelling.&rdquo; The report states that 39 were one-room houses which were occupied by 136 persons, and one of them was occupied by ten persons, and six by six or more persons.  They considered that the conditions disclosed an appalling state of affairs, and they suggested that immediate steps should be taken to remedy the insanitary and immoral conditions of the housing.  The Commissioner in Bray say they should get the Minister for Local Government to take up the housing scheme for the area. Over the whole Free State area you will find similar conditions reported. These reports were probably made in answer to the request of the Local Government Department or the Minister that a survey or census should be made.  As regards Sligo, at a Corporation meeting Doctors Rouse and Moran reported that 269 houses in Sligo Borough were unfit and could not be made fit for human habitation.  As regards housing conditions in Dungarvan, it was reported that 250 houses at present occupied were unfit for human habitation, and Dr. McCarthy, at a meeting of the Urban District Council, said there were 500 houses in the town which will be unfit for human habitation in five or six years, and 20 houses were in danger of collapsing.</P>
    <P>In Thurles Dr. MacCormack, Free State Local Government Medical Officer, and an Engineer from the Department, made a detailed inspection of the town.  To replace the houses which are unfit for habitation there it is stated that half the town needs to be rebuilt.  As regards <Col N="981" /> Drogheda, at least 850 new houses are required to solve the housing problem, and it would take from eight to ten years to complete the programme, according to a report submitted to the Drogheda Corporation by Mr. J.J. Burke, Borough Surveyor.  I could say a whole lot more about the conditions in Drogheda, but I think that Drogheda is making some effort to tackle its own housing problem.  Dealing with housing conditions in Ballina, the &ldquo;Sunday Independent&rdquo; last October reported that housing conditions in Ballina were appalling, and in other towns in Mayo they were so bad that the surveyors' reports would touch a heart of stone. That statement was quoted from the remarks of Mr. McGrath, the Chairman of the Ballina U.D. Council. He added that if the conditions continued as they were in Ballina the cemeteries would soon be filled.  Another extract deals with the housing problem in Cork.</P>
    <P>I have a whole lot of other extracts here, but the conditions of houses are better known to Deputies from these areas than they are to me.  What I have said with regard to Dublin is to some extent equally true of other parts of the country.  Perhaps in many areas the conditions are not quite as bad as they are in Dublin.  Others may say that their areas are worse off, but I can speak for the Dublin area and I can say that the conditions here are appalling.  We have also the statement of Dr. M.J. Russell, Medical Officer of Health, Dublin Corporation.  He bears out my remarks that conditions in Dublin are getting worse.  Speaking at a city hospital recently, he stated that notwithstanding all the houses that have been built in or around Dublin it would be news to some to learn that there are more insanitary rooms in dwellings to-day than there ever were in the history of the city.  He went further to say that many of the underground kitchen dwellings, though they were condemned by his predecessor, are still inhabited.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="982" /> That is the condition of the Free State with regard to housing.  Useful as palliatives of this kind are, they are not going to touch more than the fringe of the problem.  I would like to urge the Minister and the President, because the President, I believe, is interested in the subject and knows a great deal about it, particularly with regard to the City of Dublin, to make a serious effort to grapple with this problem.  Let them get down to the root of it with the experts they have at their disposal from the Local Government Department; let them sit around a table and examine closely the number of houses that are required. Even as to the estimated number required you will find great differences of opinion.  But whatever the number is, whether 40,000, 50,000 or even 60,000, let the Government get down to it and tackle the problem with a view to ending it within, say, ten years.  That is not too early a date for the elimination of the slum problem in the City of Dublin, and it certainly would not be a day too soon.  Even if the number of houses required properly to house the people in the Free State were 50,000 or 60,000 I believe it would be possible to have that number built in that time.  People will say that there would be a difficulty in finding a sufficient number of skilled men to do the work, but in 1918 Inspector Cowan reported that to his knowledge 1,600 houses could be built annually in Dublin, and I believe that no more than 500 houses on an average have been built in the city in the last five or six years.  If there were a sufficient number of bricklayers, masons, painters, carpenters, and all the other men required for house building in Dublin in 1918 to build that number of houses, there must be a considerable number of them unemployed at present, and as we have often emphasised before, by taking the course I suggest not alone would you eradicate the housing evil, but you would help to solve the unemployment problem as well. If I thought that the President and the Minister were really in earnest <Col N="983" /> about the matter I would not have said anything, but if this Bill is the only evidence we have of their sincerity it certainly is not very deep and does not go very far; it will certainly not make any more impression on the problem in the next twelve months than was made in the last five years.</P>
    <P>I know that outside of the City of Dublin, in agricultural districts, labourers' cottages are very badly needed.  According to the figures that the Minister gave last night, 114 labourers' cottages were built between 1927 and March 31st, 1930 &mdash; 38 cottages per year, or one and a half cottages per year for each of the twenty-six counties.  Men from agricultural areas are flocking into the cities who would be happy to remain in the country at agricultural work if they could get houses and get married, but they cannot. I know that there are financial and other difficulties to be overcome in that connection also, but my complaint is that no serious effort is being made to overcome them in the rural areas any more than in the urban.  I certainly cannot congratulate the President, the Minister and the Government on the progress that has been made in house-building in the last eight years.  I think that the present state of the City of Dublin is the most damning indictment of the Government that anybody who wished to get evidence to damn them could produce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan (Clare)</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure proposes to continue the old bad system of house-building that was introduced some four or five years ago.  I did not quarrel with the Minister for introducing that system at the outset; I did not quarrel with him for having given it a trial; but I do quarrel with him because he has not made any analysis of the position consequent on the introduction of that system, and because he has not made an examination of it in the light of what the results have been with regard to solving the housing difficulties of the country.  He gave us a set of figures on the Estimates, and <Col N="984" /> he has now given us a set of figures, but I suggest that if any figures are to be valuable in the examination of this problem they would be found in a comparison of the number of families that have been removed from insanitary houses into sanitary houses since the introduction of the measures for which the Minister stands.  He told us that the local authorities had built close on 5,000 houses and that private people had built 12,906.  I have no quarrel whatever with the giving of grants to private people for the building of their houses, but I suggested on the Estimates, and I want the Minister to examine it and see whether it is not true, that most of these grants went to the speculative builder.  I suggested that we should examine the position to see how many new houses have been built locally, to see how far the erection of forty, fifty or sixty new houses in any district has contributed to the solution of the slum problem in that district.</P>
      <P>I know districts where grants have been given and houses built, but in the main the building of these houses has not released one good house for a dweller in a slum, a lane or a side street in the town concerned.  An examination of the number of families who have been taken out of insanitary dwellings during the five years in which these Acts have been operating would be useful, but the Minister has not given us any such information.  We hear a good deal of talk about the City of Dublin and the slums in it.  I know something about the slums in Dublin; I lived in Dublin for about ten years, and I know that the slums are disgraceful. But I also know that there are districts in Co. Clare where the housing conditions are as bad as, or probably worse, than what one finds in the Liberties of Dublin.</P>

      <P>Not impossible at all.  I have gone through tenement houses in Dublin on business and I know that they are wretched, but in some of the towns in my own country there are houses <Col N="985" /> just as bad, just as miserable, just as impossible to rear children decently in as in the case of these wretched tenement houses in Dublin. The Minister has not considered that problem at all.  In my own county there are only two urban areas, but there are eight or nine other towns. What steps is the Minister taking to deal with the housing problem in these eight or nine towns?  What grants are available for the County Board of Health to deal with them? What provisions are made for long-term loans for that purpose?  The Minister is making no attempt to deal with the housing problem in country areas.  The towns to which I refer vary in population from 2,000 to 4,000, and there are houses in them that are not fit for human habitation.</P>
      <P>We have repeatedly suggested that the only solution of the problem for the whole country is a national housing board, with power to borrow and power to build.  If such a board were working for a number of years it would make some inroads on the housing problem.  This piecemeal method will not solve it, and the Minister knows it.  It would be interesting to know how many of the 5,000 houses built by local authorities were built in the City of Dublin, and how many of them were built by the new disciples of administration who have been introduced as commissioners.</P>
      <P>Of course the Minister is not making any efforts to solve the problem. That is the terrible difficulty. He proposes to hold a conference of local authorities in the near future. Is he prepared to submit to them a questionnaire as to conditions in their districts?  Is he prepared to ask for their proposals for a solution of the housing problem?  If not, he has no right to come here with this piecemeal proposal.  He has a right to make some honest effort to solve the housing problem and not to talk about it as he does on some occasions.</P>

      <P>With much of what Deputy O'Kelly and Deputy Hogan said I am in agreement.  I am quite <Col N="986" /> satisfied, and I have said so frequently, that we are scarcely keeping pace with the depreciation in housing, and scarcely dealing with the problem at all.  There is common agreement between Deputy O'Kelly and Deputy Hogan and myself on that point.  I do not know that there would be agreement with us on the Government Benches.  But while we agree that far, when we come to the question of the cause &mdash; that is why no real effort has been made to deal with the problem &mdash; it is there and from there we differ. Deputy O'Kelly says that the reason we have made no appreciable effort, beyond making good the depreciation, is because the Government has not done enough.  That is his explanation, &mdash; that the Government has not done enough and should do more.  When we come to Labour we find that Labour has said quite frankly all the time that the present policy is an entirely wrong one, that a big housing board is wanted, a big authority to deal with housing.  They want an authority that will have little regard for what the expense of building will be, the main object being to get houses, no matter what the cost.  That solution is a very shallow one.  If we are going to occupy houses we want to know what they are going to cost; we want to know whether we can afford the cost.  But if we are going to adopt Labour's policy and erect houses regardless of cost the two items are going to clash and you will not get tenants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>We will see what the conversion is and where the solution lies.  I agree that what the Government has done during the last five years has been to alleviate the problem for one section of the community and one only.  Let me be quite frank and quite fair.  We have spent some millions &mdash; I do not know how many &mdash; up to date on an attempted solution of the housing problem.  All that money has been <Col N="987" /> spent to provide houses for one class, and one class only, the well-to-do tradesmen.  Nobody could afford to live in these houses, or to pay the rents except well-to-do tradesmen.  Looking at the problem from that point of view, let us examine the Labour solution.  Their solution is that they would provide houses at a higher cost and at higher rents.</P>

      <P>I think I have said sufficient to show the hopelessness of the solution that has been offered by Labour.  I said on many occasions that nothing at all has been done to deal with the problem of the slums. I have gone as far as to say that in dealing with houses we commenced at the wrong end, that we should have commenced at the slums, and that any money available, either through the local authorities or provided by the State, should have been given to those really in need of assistance.  Those to whom it has been given are not as a class in need of assistance through subsidies from the State.  We have been told by <Col N="988" /> Ministers that the slum problem is such a serious one from the economic point of view that it is almost impossible to touch it while building costs are so high.  That is apart altogether from Labour's proposal to raise the cost still further. Even as the cost stands, we have been told here and outside by those in authority that it is impossible to deal with the slums from the economic point of view.  If it is difficult from the economic standpoint it appears to me that any money the State can give should be given to those who are in need of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us face this problem.  We have got to a stage in connection with housing when it is time to take stock and to consider whether the line we are moving along is a sound line, whether it is likely to solve the problem we have in view.  Anything I have heard to-day from either Labour or Fianna Fáil goes to show me at all events &mdash; and I hope I am somewhat impartial on the problem &mdash; that the line we are moving on is not a line which is going to lead to a solution of the problem.  We have been at it over eight years. We have burdened the local authorities as far as we can, and the State as far as we can, but still we have made no headway in connection with the problem.  Therefore I think it is time to take stock and consider whether this is the right line we are on.  I have said quite recently that in pre-war days housing was not provided by the State or by the local authority and still there were plenty of houses.  I was reading a little while ago from an authority that knows the question that private enterprise in 1906 had provided so many houses that they got in excess of the demand.  After 1906 the politicians got to work at the problem. They killed confidence; they killed the speculative builder and they stopped the production of houses.  Now I am quite satisfied if we are going to get a solution of this problem, we are not going to get it through State grants or through local assistance or through the policy put forward by Labour. <Col N="989" /> The only one line on which we can hope for a solution of this problem, therefore, is a return to the policy that had produced, may I say, a sufficiency of houses for all classes of the community up to almost pre-war days.  If we are to get back to that condition the very first step that is necessary is to make housing a sound and wise investment.  Instead of having people investing their surplus earnings in motor cars and in stocks of a very speculative character in most cases &mdash; I will not say riotous living but living at a rate which they cannot afford &mdash; what we want to do is to try to get people to see that the homes in which they live and rear their families are possessions of their own and have a first claim on any surplus moneys they may have.</P>
    <P>That was the position very largely as it existed in pre-war days, but it is not the position as we know it to-day. We give large moneys from the State; we support those in many cases with an equal sum from the local authorities.  Still we find that we are not meeting in that way the difficulties of the situation.  As far as my limited knowledge guides me in this matter, I am satisfied that there is only one likely road to a solution of this difficulty and that is to get back to the conditions that existed in pre-war days.  To establish that confidence that I spoke of, where houses will become almost a first claim on any surplus cash that is available for investment, there is a long way to go.  Housing as an investment has been badly shaken by politicians in pre-war days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I will leave that other point for a moment.  As I said a few moments ago, we have got now to the stage when we have to take stock of the problem and see really what the difficulties are that lie in our effort to get a sufficiency of houses.  I have said that very largely the difficulties are economic ones.  I go further and say that one of the greatest difficulties at the moment in that connection is the high cost of building in this country.  I do not want to speak of this particular aspect of <Col N="991" /> the problem in any irritating way.  I want to try and speak of it as a difficulty that can and ought to be solved, and that can only be solved by giving it calm and fair consideration, and I have spoken on more than one occasion on this problem about the importance of building costs.  I do not know whether Deputies are aware that every four pounds additional of capital expenditure in connection with housing adds one penny per week to the rent &mdash; that is, taking a loan over 60 years. If rents are too high the cost of building is too high.  That is a problem that ought to be calmly inquired into.</P>
      <P>May I give one or two figures that have been given before to show the serious situation of the question of building costs in Dublin?  In 1914 the tradesmen in our city received 4/2 less per week than was paid in a corresponding city in Great Britain.  In 1930 those same tradesmen received 16/4 per week more than is paid in the corresponding city on the other side.  Now let me look on this from another point of view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>We will deal with that in time.  I am not dealing with this in an antagonistic spirit, but, as I pointed out, we ought to try to inquire into this and make an effort to meet the difficulty.  Let us look at this from another point of view. In 1930, the tradesman in this city of ours gets a wage that is 136 per cent. over pre-war level.  A tradesman in a corresponding city in Great Britain gets at the moment 75 per cent. over pre-war.  Now let us look at the cost of living in the Free State, according to the last returns. Deputy Lemass will correct me in this, as he has been recently inquiring into it.  We are 168 over pre-war, <Col N="992" /> that is, 68 deducting the 100. In Great Britain the rate is 57.  The increase in the tradesman's wages is 136.  The increase in the cost of living is 68.  In other words, that is profiteering, if I might use that term, in no antagonistic spirit, to the extent of 80 per cent.  Herein lies, I am satisfied, a great deal of our difficulty.</P>

      <P>Herein lies one of the serious difficulties in connection with the cost of living, and if we can, without quarrelling over these figures and without throwing back corresponding difficulties or making further difficulties, get a calm inquiry into the situation, I am quite sure we could do a lot towards the solution of the housing problem.  It is along that line that I would like to see something done.  Wages, as I have pointed out in the past year in this House, form 50 per cent. of the cost of any housing scheme.  They are the most material factors in connection with housing at the present time, and not alone do they affect the wages side of the problem, but also to some extent they affect the material side of the problem, because the influence of wages paid in the building industry extends to allied industries that produce the material for the building industry.  So this is one of the real problems in connection with the situation that demands inquiry, and I am not without hope that in the near future some effort will be made by those interested in this particular matter to see if <Col N="993" /> something cannot be done to help housing in a most important direction.</P>

      <P>I thought when Deputy Good proceeded to tell us that, in his opinion, the various solutions of the housing problem suggested from these and the Labour benches were obviously inadequate we were going to get a cast-iron solution from him which could not fail and that, therefore, we would at long last commence the solution of the housing problem.  I find, however, that his solution of the housing problem is that the Government and the local authorities should get out of the business altogether and leave it in the hands of the speculative builders and to reduce wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy, but I said, I think quite clearly, that anything that either the local authorities or the State could give should be in the direction of helping the slum dwellers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And the direction in which the State is to help the slum dwellers is to get out of the business altogether, to induce the local authorities to do the same thing, and leave the whole matter in the hands of the speculative builders as it was in the great and glorious days before the Great War.  The Deputy's solution is based on the fundamental error that the housing problem did not exist before the Great War.  In fact, the housing problem that we are now faced with is not the creation of this Government at all.  It is a problem that this Government inherited. It was undoubtedly aggravated by the cessation of building during the War years, but it existed almost to the same extent in the years before the great war when the speculative builder had the field to himself.  In the year 1911 there were 21,123 families in Dublin living in single-roomed tenements.  If the number has gone up since it has gone up only slightly in comparison with the total.  It has increased by 2,500.  The fact remains that in 1911 <Col N="994" /> the housing problem was there to an extent almost as great as it is now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though labour was cheap, and cheaper at that time than it was in England.  The fact that we have got to face is that we have got a housing problem here that the speculative builder has failed to solve, and that the Government has failed to deal with in anything like an adequate way.  We have, in fact, reached a position in which we are forced to the conclusion, as Deputy Good has apparently been forced to the conclusion, that we are scarcely keeping pace with the growth of the problem, much less wiping anything off the arrears that we inherited from the great and glorious days before the Great War.  The Government came into existence with these arrears of housing there.  Instead of having reduced the arrears, they have, in fact, increased the problem by not adequately tackling it.  The number of houses for the construction of which they have been responsible has been apparently less than the number normally required by the population during that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Year after year we come here to the consideration of the housing question: we find similar arguments advanced from each side of the House; we find the attitude of the Government unchanged.  However, we find ourselves in the position that our knowledge of the problem is growing, that the information available concerning its extent and the success that has attended the measures of the Government is greater than it has been at previous times. Since we discussed the 1929 Housing Bill we have had published the census returns.  We have had also a census of the local authorities taken by the Department of Local Government to ascertain the housing needs in their respective districts. In the past the Minister kept telling us that 30,000 or 35,000 houses would meet our requirements.  He took a census, and the figure which he ascertained <Col N="995" /> as a result of that census is something on which we can base argument.  The local authorities estimated that on the 1st April this year 43,000 houses were required in the Free State for the accommodation of the working classes.  The Minister discounts that figure by 30 per cent., but without having any good reasons to believe that they were exaggerating their needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of the inspection carried out by officers of the Minister's Department the Minister discounted the figure ascertained by 30 per cent.  He now tells us that in spite of the efforts of his Department and the money the Government has provided since 1922 there are 31,000 houses required for the accommodation of the working classes.  Does the Minister seriously think that this Bill now before us is going to provide 31,000 houses? Does he seriously think that if he introduces a Bill like this every year it will produce 31,000 houses within twenty years?  That is a fair question. If the method which the Minister is working on at present is not going to wipe off the arrears, much less provide, in addition, for our normal requirements in twenty years, then the Government's policy stands condemned.  The Minister told us that between the 1st April, 1929, and the 1st April, 1930, 1,960 houses had been provided.  That figure represents a considerable reduction on the number provided in previous years. It appears, therefore, that not merely are we failing to provide the normal requirements of the people or to wipe off any of the arrears which the Government inherited, but we are, in addition, slackening our rate of progress, so that the problem is growing at a more rapid pace than heretofore.</P>

      <P>The figures which the Minister himself gave some time ago in reply to a question.  The number of three, four and five-roomed houses built in 1926 under the Housing Acts was 3,381; in 1927 it was 3,644; in 1928 it was 2,124, and for the last year, according to the figures which the Minister gave when introducing his Estimate, it was 1,960.  These are the figures which the Minister himself gave me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of houses built to the 1st April last was 14,774.  That represents the number of completed houses.  The number of houses approved by the Minister's Department in respect of which grants have been allocated was 17,830 up to the 31st March, on which date according to the Minister 31,000 or 43,000 houses were required for the accommodation of the working classes.  Obviously to introduce a Bill of this kind to deal with that situation is like trying to bail out the ocean with a child's bucket.  Even if we build at the rate contemplated by the Bill every year for twenty years, at the end of that time we will find ourselves with the same 31,000 houses required, because such legislation as this will only provide for the normal demand for houses caused by deterioration and the movement of the population into the towns.  One thing is quite clear, that we have got to clear out the speculative builder. He has failed.  We cannot rely on him to do the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His knowledge, his experience, his assistance will be very useful to us, but we cannot leave on his shoulders alone the provision of 30,000 houses.  He could not do it. We have got to clear out the local authorities as well.  The system of trying to build houses by giving small grants to private individuals, public utility societies and local authorities is not going to succeed. We are faced with a national problem and it is only by national <Col N="997" /> means that we can tackle it.  In no other way can it be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister's policy is framed upon a number of theories which he has announced from time to time in the House.  He holds, for example, to the theory that he has succeeded in reducing building costs by reducing the subsidy.  He thinks that, following each reduction made by him in the subsidy available to private individuals, he has succeeded in forcing down building costs.  To a certain extent that is correct, but the Minister's theory is based upon a misreading of the figures.  If you put in parallel columns the amount of the subsidy available each year and the average cost of building each year, you will think there is a correspondence between them.  But when you relate both sets of figures to the number of houses built in each year, you find that the cost of building has been reduced, not because the subsidy was reduced but because the number of houses ordered by private individuals and local authorities was reduced, and consequently, there was keener competition between contractors for these orders.</P>
    <P>The average cost of building various types of houses now appears to have become stabilised.  According to the figures which the Minister gave, there was a slight increase in 1929 over those for 1928, in respect of four-room houses and five-room houses.  The Minister could not give me the figures for three-room houses. The average cost of building four-room houses in 1928 was £374, and in 1929, £376.  The average cost of building five-room houses in 1928 was £448, and in 1929, £530, which figures shows a more substantial increase. We may take it now that the cost of building is stabilised. Unless we proceed to tackle the root causes of high prices we have got to base our policy upon these figures, because it is useless to think of reducing building costs merely by carrying out sweeping reductions in wages or builders' profits.  There are, undoubtedly, high prices ruling for building at the present time <Col N="998" /> which could be reduced, but they cannot be reduced so long as this system of subsidies to local authorities and private individuals is the basis of our policy.  The only method by which a national problem of this kind can be tackled is by organising the resources of the State for that purpose.  That requires leadership and organisation more than anything else.  That leadership and organisation can be provided by the central Government and by the central Government only. It is not a local problem; it is a national problem.  The provision of 30,000 or 40,000 houses for the accommodation of our people is a thing that should command the attention and energy of everybody interested in national welfare.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, I asked the Dáil to contemplate the situation which would exist if we had enough houses for our people and if, as the result of a great disaster &mdash; a fire or flood, or an earthquake &mdash; 40,000 houses were demolished and that number of persons were forced to inhabit outhouses or similar dwellings considered unfit for human habitation. Everybody would agree that this, being a national disaster, all the resources of the State should be mobilised to tackle it.  We have that situation here.  There has been no disaster, but the need for 40,000 houses is there, and the State should tackle it as a State problem.  It should not leave it to the local authorities who, in many cases, are unable to deal with it in an adequate way.</P>
    <P>There is a lot to be said for Deputy Good's opinion that in this matter we have started at the wrong end.  The houses that are resulting from the housing policy of the Government are being occupied not by the people in most urgent need of proper accommodation but, as he says, by the artisan class who can afford to pay the rents that are charged.  The slum-dweller is being left untouched.  In fact, the number of slum dwellings is increasing in Dublin and in certain towns.  Nothing has really been done to tackle the problem of the slums at all.  It is <Col N="999" /> useless to think that the problem of the slums will be tackled by anybody except the national authority. The speculative builder will not go in there; he never did and never will. That class of building is not remunerative. It cannot be carried out as a commercial proposition at all.  It has got to be carried out as a social service in the same way as the State provides national health services and old age pensions and services of that kind.  Here is a social need which cannot be profitably met by ordinary commercial enterprise, and which can only be provided by using the resources of the State for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin claims that they have converted Fianna Fáil to the Labour policy, which reminds me of the story of the big man who married the little woman &mdash; the story of Mary and Pat.  As they were walking down the church Pat said to Mary, &ldquo;At long last you and I are one.&rdquo;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;and I am the one.&rdquo; The Labour Party and the Fianna Fáil Party are one on this question and the Fianna Fáil is the one.

There is the obvious failure of Deputy Good's policy.  There is the obvious success of the policy we advocate when adopted in other countries. With the establishment of a national housing board, financed and controlled by the State, equipped with the necessary powers to order supplies of building materials, and engage in the construction of houses either by contract or direct labour and planning so as to complete its programme of 30,000 or 40,000 houses within a definite period of, say, ten years, you would, in any event, get a move on.  You might not provide houses at an economic rent &mdash; that is another problem &mdash; but you would be getting houses built as cheaply as at present, probably more cheaply, and that would be an advance on the present position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall quote for the President an authority that I think he will not dispute.  I have here by me &ldquo;The Star,&rdquo; a paper which describes itself as his paper.  I do not know whether he reads it or not. In an issue of about six months ago &mdash; I did not take the date &mdash; they reprinted an article which appeared in the &ldquo;Manchester Guardian&rdquo; weekly concerning the method which was adopted by the municipality of Vienna to meet the housing shortage that existed there.  They established a housing board.  They proceeded along the lines I have indicated and these are the results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1001" /> The Vienna Town Hall calculates the rents in such fashion that only the cost of maintenance and not of amortisation are included in the rents.  Even so, the rents appear remarkably low, especially if we take into consideration that building costs have increased 70 per cent. over pre-war and that the interest rates on loans are enormous: the official discount rate of the Austrian national bank is 8 per cent., so that no building loans can be had at less than 10½ per cent.  But the new municipality is building those houses not out of borrowed money but out of taxes.  This reduces the building costs.  The real secret of the cheapness of construction is, however, the collective buying of building material and the direction of building operations through a central office.  A director of the building department of the Vienna municipality gave me the following information concerning the low building costs: &mdash;&ldquo;We buy wholesale.  We ordered our brick supply for five years ahead and for so huge an order, guaranteeing the brickworks ample occupation for years, we got greatly reduced prices.  We can order 35,000 windows and 25,000 doors at the time.  Instead of consulting architects and incurring heavy fees we have twelve architects employed on salary and similarly we have one engineer on salary for every three buildings. Consequently the average cost during the last four and a half years of a flat of about 47 square metres surface amounted to 11,500 Austrian schillings or about £340.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It was the post-war problem they were dealing with.  I cannot give the date, but I have taken that article from &ldquo;The Star,&rdquo; and Deputies can see it.  There is a file in the library where the President can look at back numbers if he so desires.  The problem of the high cost in building is the big problem we have to face.  We can get organisation and leadership subject to a change of Government, but no organisation will be able properly to tackle this problem unless it deals first with the question of cost.  There are two main factors contributing the cost.  As Deputy Good told us, the net cost of a house is represented as regards 50 per cent. by wages paid, and 50 per cent. price paid for materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy represents a class of the community which cannot see any way of increasing building costs other than decreasing wages.  But the remedy is not to decrease wages. Nobody wants to get back &mdash; not even Deputy Good I am sure &mdash; to the wages that prevailed here pre-war. The Secretary of the Dublin Master Builders' Association stated in the Press some time ago that the average wage for a carpenter in Dublin in 1914 was £1 17s. 6d.  He complains that the wage has now gone up to £4 3s. 8d.  I am very glad it has gone up and I hope it stays at that figure.  To ask a skilled workman to give 50 hours work for £1 17s. 6d. would be contrary to the engagement which this State entered into when it approved of the international convention for the abolition of slavery.  We can reduce building costs in other ways than by reducing wages.  It is a question of output. I believe there is a certain restriction of output by workers engaged in Dublin.  Under present conditions I do not blame them for restricting <Col N="1003" /> output.  The average worker knows that when he finishes building the house on which he is engaged he is going to be unemployed and that he will not be able to provide all the requirements of his family on the amount he will get under the Unemployment Insurance scheme&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>What section of the building workers does that refer to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  I am only stating my belief.  It is only human nature that a worker knowing the termination of his present task is going to mean his unemployment should endeavour to make that task last as long as possible.  If that worker can be guaranteed continuous employment, then the incentive to restrict output is removed, and we can get from him as high an output as is got from workers in other countries.  The position is that we have a large and growing number of building trade operatives unemployed. The number of skilled building workers unemployed on October 4th, 1926, in Dublin was 891.  That number has since been increased by 44 per cent., until, on November 4th, 1929, it had reached 1,286.  According to figures made available by the Department of Industry and Commerce there are in the Free State some 24,000 persons normally engaged in the building trade.  If we could give these 24,000 persons continuous employment and double the present output over a period of ten years, we would still leave ourselves with the present housing problem not fully solved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that could be done we could abolish for a very long time, at any rate, the prospect of unemployment in the building trade.  Unemployment exists at present because of lack of organisation, because the building of houses by local authorities and others is spasmodic, with long stretches of inactivity intervening. If there was a national board carrying out a programme designed to construct a definite number of houses in a definite period, it could give permanent and continuous employment <Col N="1004" /> to the 24,000 building operatives that there are at the moment in the Free State.  If these persons knew that they were in the permanent employment of the housing board they would have no incentive whatever to restrict output. They would, in fact, have an incentive in the opposite direction, because any man engaged in a job likes to get that job done well.  We would have building costs, the 50 per cent. which represents the wages paid to labourers, reduced in that way.</P>
    <P>We have, in any case, the fact that the building trade representatives who attended the conference which met following the deliberations of the Unemployment Committee, of which Deputy Rice was Chairman, stated their willingness to give a guarantee that labour in this country would give at least as good a return in house building as is obtained from labour in England, if the jobs were organised in a similar manner, and if the general facilities for efficient production were equal.  That guarantee was given by the representatives of the building trades unions. The fact that continuous employment would be available should give us reasonable ground to hope that if this job were properly tackled in an organised way the factors operating at present to make building costs high would be removed.  We would then contemplate houses being constructed here at a total cost equal at least to the existing total cost in England.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a fallacy there in the Deputy's argument if he will allow me to point it out.  At the moment tradesmen here receive 16s. 4d. per week more than tradesmen of the same class receive in the English cities.  Even if the output be the same, there is still that extra charge of 16s. 4d. a week to be met.</P>

I hope that the Dublin carpenter will succeed in maintaining that position.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In quite a number of industries that I know of there is a guarantee of continuous employment. It is much easier to give such a guarantee in relation to such an industry as this, than in the case of other industries, because in this case there is an obvious demand for the products of the industry.  Even with production at its maximum all the houses that are required could not be supplied in ten years' time. You have spasmodic unemployment in certain industries at the present time in consequence of what economists call over-production.  There is no over-production in houses and will not be for a decade no matter how hard we work producing them. That is our guarantee.  I think that is the surest guarantee that anyone could ask for, that it is possible to give continuous employment over a ten-year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us turn to the other 50 per cent. of the total costs for houses represented by the cost of building materials.  I think it will be obvious to anyone that a reduction in the cost of materials could be effected by the combined purchasing of them. There must be a certain amount of waste at the present time due to the fact that you have one authority in Cork buying materials for the erection of 40 houses, another in Dublin buying materials for the erection of 500 houses, a person <Col N="1006" /> somewhere else buying materials for the erection of ten houses and a number of private individuals buying materials for the erection of single houses.  In that way there must be a certain amount of waste going on.  Even if the builders' providers were anxious to restrict their profits there would still be higher costs involved in consequence of the fact that they were sending out their goods in small quantities and irregularly.  If we could get the building trade properly organised and could arrange for the combined purchasing of the materials required, then I think it is obvious, too obvious to need demonstration, that a certain reduction &mdash; it may not be a very substantial reduction, but it will be some reduction &mdash; could be effected.  It has been effected in Vienna according to the quotation I read.</P>
    <P>That is the idea which is behind rationalisation, the process that is now going on in certain European countries &mdash; the idea that by mass purchasing and by dealing with these problems in a big way economies in overhead charges can be effected.  I think it is quite obvious to anyone that with proper organisation economies could be effected in overhead charges if you had rationalisation in house building by the combined purchasing of materials.  Incidentally, we can get a number of these building materials here at home.  In 1926, the year in which the census of production was taken, we produced here bricks, certain stones, rough or only partly prepared, slates, certain paints and varnishes.  With the exception of timber, we could produce most of the articles required here for the construction of houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt that.  Undoubtedly at the present time there are very few brickyards in the country that could be worked economically. At the present time building <Col N="1007" /> materials are purchased in a spasmodic way by individual purchasers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, in 1926 the number of bricks produced here was double the number that we imported. We get that information from the returns that were published that year.  In 1926, we imported 4,654,000 bricks, while the home production was 9,364,000.  These figures are taken from returns furnished by the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell the Deputy that in pre-war days we had four brickyards working in the immediate vicinity of Dublin.  The position to-day is that we cannot keep one working the whole year round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for that is, I think, quite obvious.  We get a remarkable illustration of it when we turn to the question of slates.  I think I mentioned here before that the Glasgow Corporation, in the case of a housing scheme that it recently embarked upon, a scheme that provided for the erection of 2,000 houses, specified the use of Irish slates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It did not merely indicate that it was prepared to consider the use of Irish slates, but it actually specified Irish slates, and the contractor undertaking the building of the houses had to bind himself to use Irish slates.  The Minister for Local Government, I understand, is prepared to make recommendations to the Dublin Commissioners and to ask them to consider the use of Irish slates.  There is a difference between these two attitudes.  The Glasgow Corporation has no concern about the state of employment here, or the development of Irish industries. <Col N="1008" /> It is using Irish slates because it considers them the cheapest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>That is where the fallacy exists.  Has the Deputy ascertained whether they can get a cheaper cover in Glasgow than Irish slates?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They are cheaper, but they are guaranteed water-tight for only twelve months, whereas the Irish slates are guaranteed for 100 years, and should they prove not to be so they will be replaced free of charge by the producer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference between twelve months and 100 years is considerable, but the mere fact that you can buy these paper slates which last twelve months at a lower initial cost than Irish slates that will last 100 years is something of importance, for we must consider the slate in relation to the houses, which, if they are not built by a jerrybuilder, will last for sixty years.  It is proved that we can produce slates.  We can also produce bricks, and we used more bricks in 1926 produced here than we imported. If we had a scheme in hand for the building of 40,000 houses in 10 years, orders could be given for Irish bricks that would enable the four brickyards to be worked economically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>The houses would cost more than the houses constructed to-day with cheaper material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That has to be demonstrated. I say that with no housing board in existence in 1926, or any housing scheme planned, we used double the number of Irish bricks as compared with the number imported, and presumably that would not have been done except they were cheaper.  Anyway, we have to take into consideration more than the <Col N="1009" /> actual cost of the houses.  This should be a State service, and the State must reckon as against the cost of imported bricks the amount it has to pay in unemployment insurance benefit or home help to those unemployed people who could be employed in producing bricks here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a policy of giving employment on home production, and using the money now spent on maintenance in that way.  We can produce cement, but it is not produced at present.  There is a cement works at Skerries which is remembered at every general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that there is one at Skerries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that there is, but we expect after every general election that there will be one.  There is lime there which makes it possible to produce cement, and the same thing applies to Limerick.  I understand that the German firm that bought the deposit in Skerries approached the Tariff Commission, but when they saw them they decided to give the enterprise up as a bad job.  We can produce stone, and do produce it.  We can and do produce paint, and we can even produce glass, but we are not producing that.  With the exception of timber, there is nothing that we cannot produce.  Although I am not advocating that we should embark on the building of houses for the sole purpose of promoting the production of building material. I maintain that a national board, adequately financed and organised, with this market for houses available, can so organise its requirement of building material as to make possible the economic production of these materials within the country, and consequently provide a considerable <Col N="1010" /> increase in the number of persons employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The combined purchasing of building materials is going to reduce the cost in any case, and a guarantee of continuous employment will increase the workers' output and also reduce the building cost, if properly organised. We are going to continue as at present with a decreasing output and a growing number of houses needed so long as the policy of the Government is to be represented by the repeated introduction of Bills of the kind we are now discussing.  We have also to consider the question of money.  Since the last Bill was introduced the Government made the Local Loans Fund available to urban authorities for housing purposes, and they are lending money at 5¾ per cent. for 35 years.  Deputy Hogan asked as to the position concerning towns without local government. These places are, in many cases, as badly in need of houses as towns with local government, but they cannot avail of the facilities offered in the Local Loans Fund.  Although the fact that a local authority can now borrow money for 35 years will enable it to reduce the rents it must charge for the houses it constructs, at the same time 35 years is too short a period.  If we are going to have houses that we can rent at a figure the average workman can pay we have to get money for a much longer period than 35 years.  According to the leaflet issued by the Civics Institute of Ireland a house costing £465 to build could be rented at a total weekly rent of 17/6, exclusive of rates, if the money was borrowed for 15 years at 5½ per cent.  If borrowed for thirty years, at 12/6; if for 40 years, at 11/6; for fifty years, 10/11, and for 60 years, 10/7½.  The 2/- difference which is represented in the rent of houses on money borrowed for 35 years in one case and 60 years in another would make all the difference in the world to the persons who live in the houses. If longer term loans for the building of houses were available that would automatically reduce the rent, but so long as they are to borrow money for 35 years at 5¾ per cent. they have <Col N="1011" /> to continue charging 12/6 per week for an average four-roomed house.</P>
    <P>We have to get money cheaper, that is, less than 5¾ per cent., and longer term loans than for thirty-five years.  Only the State can do it, and the State, I think, cannot possibly lend to local authorities at a cheaper rate than at present, at the price it has to pay itself, but the State can borrow money on more favourable terms and make that money available for the building of houses, and a reduction of rents in the houses constructed can be effected.  If a subsidy is to be given by the Government that subsidy could better be given in the way of an annual contribution than in the way of a lump sum at the beginning. I think there is possibly something in the Minister's theory that the giving of a building subsidy keeps the cost high, not because of an economic but a psychological law.  If a local authority gets instead of a lump sum an annual contribution representing the interest on that amount towards the rent of that house it would result in costs and rents being reduced.  I am not certain whether that is so or not, as I am not an authority on the matter, but I think the suggestion that has been advanced in quarters more informed than I am should be adequately considered.  Certainly, we should build for the artisan houses at an economic rent which he can pay.  For the casual labourer, the unskilled labourer, the man who got 30/- a week on the Shannon scheme, we cannot build houses at a rent they can pay unless we are prepared to lose on it.  We must be prepared to lose on it.  We must recognise that the provision of these houses is a social service to which the State must contribute, just as it contributes to unemployment insurance, to national health insurance, and to old age pensions.  We have, as I have frequently stated here, 68,000 people in Dublin living in dwellings which are unfit for human habitation, and to put these people into proper dwellings is a task to <Col N="1012" /> which the whole State should be asked to contribute, and contribute fairly substantially if necessary. Most of these people cannot afford to pay more than 5/- or 7/- per week in rent, and some of them cannot afford even that.  A large number of them are subsisting on old age pensions, unemployment insurance, or, perhaps, disablement pensions under the national health insurance, and a rent of 5/- or 7/- per week is a big proportion of their total income.</P>
    <P>If we could provide three or four roomed dwellings, either in flats or separate houses in Dublin and similar cities throughout the country for five or six shillings a week we would have gone a long way towards solving the problem.  That cannot be done under a Bill of this kind. The State will have to contribute fairly substantially in the majority of cases and it is the duty of the Government to do so.  The people are maintaining the machinery of government here, in order to tackle problems of this kind and, if those who are responsible for the running of that machinery hold up their hands in despair at the magnitude of the problem we must either abolish the machinery or get people with more courage to use it.  Such people are there.  They may not be in this Party.  I do not say that we are anything but common clay.  We are not like Deputies opposite who are inspired by archangels.  If the present Government will not tackle the problem we will have to get people who will do so and who will run the machinery because the job has to be tackled somehow.</P>

      <P>The housing board would have to take on the job of providing on a national scale the 43,000 houses which in the opinion of the local authorities, who are the best judges in such matters, are required for every type of citizen.  The Minister appears to have a holy horror of dealing with national problems in a national way by the Government.  Does he forget the fact that when the dairy industry was almost dead the Minister for Agriculture came here with a socialistic scheme to hold it together, and he induced the majority of the House to vote a huge sum in order to save that industry?  Surely the Minister for Local Government does not forget that when the Government wanted to supply light and power to the citizens of the State, even those who live in slums as well as houses occupied by carpenters and other skilled tradesmen, he did not disapprove of that scheme.</P>

      <P>I would be glad to close the discussion if the Chairman who was appointed by the Government to preside over that Conference would give a report of its proceedings to this House and to the country.  Deputy Rice has, so far, only contradicted the different versions given by different individuals who were associated with that Conference as to what took place inside it.  He has never come before the House to tell us what the decisions of that Conference were and who was responsible for its failure.  We challenge Deputy Rice to do that, and we are not afraid of any statement he may make regarding that Conference.  Deputy Good may say, as he previously said, that the scheme to which I am referring was submitted three months after the closing of the Conference.  I am not sure that the Conference is yet closed, because we have heard nothing from the Chairman about it. So, I suppose, we may take it that it is still alive and kicking but doing no work.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter of opinion, really.  We are very glad that the Fianna Fáil Party has, so long after we adopted that particular scheme, taken it over and agreed that it is the only sound way of dealing with this particular problem. I am delighted that Labour and Fianna Fáil are in agreement as to the manner of solving this question of housing, and I am hopeful that between the two of us we will succeed either in driving out of office the Government that has refused to adopt that scheme, or we will force the scheme on them.  The people of the country are taking a much more intelligent interest in the matter of housing now than heretofore, and that will, in the long run, mean the forcing out of office of a <Col N="1016" /> Government which refuses to deal with this question seriously, and the putting into office of a Government that will deal with the problem in a way in which the country desires it should be dealt with.</P>
      <P>I am very glad to know that in my own constituency there are two very progressive boards of health which are extremely anxious to get the necessary assistance to build the houses that are urgently needed there.  We all know perfectly well, if we only admit it, that a local medical officer of health does not exaggerate the position locally so far as the housing needs of the district are concerned or so far as it affects the number of houses in his area that are unfit for human habitation.  The medical officer of health, generally speaking, is at the mercy of the slum owner and he does not like to condemn the houses of the local slum owner because he knows that if he does so he will lose the income which he had from that particular individual and his family.  That is the reason that I am prepared to back every time the appointment of a county medical officer of health, because I know that such an officer will pay special attention to the sanitation of an area and will express an independent point of view and show the facts as they are in regard to the housing position.</P>
      <P>In one county in my constituency 400 houses are urgently needed and in the other 600 houses.  Both boards of health have applied to the Minister &mdash; Deputy Boland, who is a member of one of them, will bear me out in this &mdash; for reasonable facilities to enable them to carry out a scheme for the provision of the houses that are so badly needed.  They were told to make the best possible terms they could with the local treasurer but the local treasurer is not prepared to give them a loan for more than fifteen years.  Everybody knows that houses cannot be built and let at an economic rent by local authorities on the conditions offered by the local treasurer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard of a case quite recently and I think it was mentioned in this House where the North Tipperary <Col N="1017" /> Board of Health prepared a scheme for the building of a number of houses in their area and made application to the Minister for facilities for a loan.  They were told to negotiate with the local treasurer and that whatever terms would be offered would be sanctioned by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  They declined to proceed with the scheme on those terms and the Royal Liver Friendly Society, which is only a partly controlled Irish society, has since offered them a loan of £18,000 to be paid off in 60 years at 5 per cent.  Here is a Government that in regard to urban areas will sanction a loan to be paid off in 35 years at 5¾ per cent. and a semi-Irish insurance society can offer money for 60 years at 5 per cent.  A Government of the day that cannot give better terms for the building of houses that are badly needed all over the country than a semi-Irish controlled company, should get out of office if it is unable to offer as good or better terms.  It is a shame at any rate that the particular body to which I refer is going to get from an insurance company better terms than it can get from a home Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass has expressed in general terms the view of the members of his Party in regard to the whole question of housing and of the methods which should be adopted to provide the houses which, in the opinion of the Minister and everybody else, are sadly and badly needed.  The Minister, in the address which he delivered to the Chamber of Commerce, appears to have a holy horror of local authorities becoming bigger houseowners than they are at the moment.  He quoted the exaggerated case, I suppose, of Tralee, where, he said, a very high percentage of houses were controlled or owned by the Tralee Urban Council.</P>

He has no hope of <Col N="1018" /> extending any greater facilities to local authorities to enable them to do the job to the best of their ability. Deputy Good, of course, talked about figures so far as they affect the wages of the workers employed in the building trade.  However, for a very good reason, I am sure, he never gave us the other side of the story. He never told us about the average profits of the speculative builder in 1914, and the average profits for a similar builder in 1930.  If Deputy Good is prepared to submit the average balance sheet of one of the biggest builders in the city to the housing conference, over which Deputy Rice presided, I am sure he would not be ashamed to submit the balance sheet to the House for the information of those who are interested in the question.  There is no use in Deputy Good presenting a side of the case to the House about which he knows nothing, and in refusing to tell the House and the country the side of a case about which he knows more than anybody else &mdash; that is, the question of the profits of those engaged in the building trade.  He wants an inquiry as to why the wages of those engaged in the building trade are so much different from what they are in Great Britain.  Is he prepared to demand a general inquiry, and are he and his colleagues in the building trade prepared to submit their side of the case to a general inquiry which might be held for the purpose of endeavouring to find a national solution to this whole question?</P>
      <P>There is no use in demanding an inquiry into one side of the case without submitting the other side of the case with the balance sheet for the information of everybody concerned.  Perhaps he will answer that question.  Perhaps also for the information of a person such as myself who knows very little about the question of building costs, he will give the House in plain English the terms of reference of the inquiry that he would like the Government to set up to inquire into this.</P>

      <P>No. I am just intervening to answer the query addressed to me or to Deputy Good. It seems to me that the terms of reference of an inquiry that would get at the heart of the whole problem would be something like this: to inquire what is wrong with the building trade in this country which although it pays high wages to its employees, cannot build houses for which these employees can pay an economic rent.  I think that would bring out the whole heart of the situation.  Until people look at that aspect of the problem we should be very careful as to what particular direction we should step off to solve this great problem.  We have listened to a lot of talk here, and we have had it pointed out that there is a very great problem to be solved, but if we were to depend simply on the talk we have had this evening to suggest what the problem is, we could back about nine or ten different horses.  It may be a question as to the clearance of the slums in Dublin or of the insanitary areas in different parts of the country or a question of the provision of houses for a worker who is paid 30/- or 36/- a week or, it may be the problem of providing 43,000 houses throughout the country together with the problem that would arise as a marginal problem to that, as to who was going to provide houses which came outside the particular classes you are serving there.  Deputy O'Kelly had nothing particular to say to the situation except that the Government should hammer at the problem and should deal with it.  Deputy Lemass suggests a housing board and he goes into statistics about different aspects of housing, but he leaves us with the idea that his solution of the problem is to set up a housing board.  He is not quite as specific as Deputy Davin about the housing board and as to how they are to set about providing the 43,000 houses that are required.</P>

      <P>At any rate we are not there, and the problem that confronts us must be worked out in the sweat of our brain.  The Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party must sweat their brains a lot more than they sweated them up to the present, to the point of simply saying, &ldquo;Let us have a housing board.&rdquo; I would like to hear a lot more about what that housing board is going to do, and a lot more as to what are the implications of it.  At any rate, the Bill before you proposes to continue in respect of the houses begun before the 1st April next, the subsidies that are contained in the 1929 Act.  One big side of the Government's policy that is enshrined in its Acts is to give the building industry in this country a chance of getting on its feet.  In 1922 there were in this country a large number of houses wanted.  Something like 2,000 odd houses were built at that particular time, but the State contributed two-thirds of the costs of over 2,000 houses, each of which cost over £700 to build.  Was the housing problem to be faced in 1922 in a way that we were to build 43,000 houses in five or ten years with the building machinery in a condition that it cost so much to build a house at that particular time?  Was the problem of building 43,000 houses to be solved by setting up machinery to build <Col N="1021" /> with costs such as they were in 1924-25, when we gave as much as £100 to each house as a subsidy?</P>
      <P>What we have been doing by our subsidising policy to private persons and local authorities has been to get the building industry moving and keep it on its feet.  It is for the building industry on one side and for the people on the other side to give serious thought to the housing problem and to say whether we are going to accept the situation that the building industry is not going to be a normal industry in this country. If we are to take over the whole of the provision of our present housing shortage, then you are going to take over the whole provision of building houses throughout the country generally.  Until it is shown in a much clearer way than it has been shown up to the present, that the industry as far as building is concerned, has so collapsed as Deputies would suggest, then it is not going to be any part of the policy of this Government to plunge along to a socialisation policy such as the suggestion made by the Fianna Fáil and the Labour Deputies definitely implies. I say that because if Deputies will simply forget the housing statistics completely, and get down to face the problem of the building of 43,000 houses and what that means throughout the country if it is going to be done by Government machinery, I think they will stop short in their proposals to set up a housing board now, to deal with the whole question of housing, and with the motto enshrined on their banner &ldquo;scrap the speculative building industry&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked did we do that with the Shannon scheme.  The Shannon scheme is a very different matter.  I think five minutes' thought would suggest to the Deputy that there was no private enterprise that we would allow to come in and take the waters of the Shannon under their control for their own private ends, even <Col N="1022" /> though they served the needs of the country.  The Shannon scheme is going to completely pay for itself, and the electric light that the people are going to use from the Shannon scheme is a light that they will pay for.  Even as we are at the present moment with the facilities that we are providing to local bodies in the matter of loans, let me say with regard to the remark of Deputy Davin that an outside insurance company or some Irish insurance company is able to give money at a cheaper rate than the Government are giving it, I want to say this, that any subsidy that this Government is going to give to housing is going to be an open subsidy.  It is not going to be a hidden subsidy and we are giving the local authorities at the present moment money at a rate that the price at which we borrow money ourselves warrants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether a Government socialising the housing industry and wiping out the speculative building industry is going to be able to borrow money at a cheaper rate than the present Government is able to borrow it, I will leave the Deputies to ponder over.  Such subsidies as we have to give will be given in an open way, so that everybody concerned, the ratepayer, the taxpayer, and the ordinary person interested in the social development of the country will know what is happening.  What is happening at the present moment? If we take a sample of some of the housing schemes that are being gone ahead with in the urban districts with the assistance of the Local Loans Fund we will see what happens. Let us take Clonmel, with its scheme of 50 houses.  The net cost per house is going to be £311.  The State is going to contribute £60 per house of that cost.  At a rent of 5/- each house the Clonmel Urban District Council, with the rent that they are going to charge the person living in the house, is going to pay £140 for each house, and the local authority is going to pay £111 per house.  Apart altogether from the effects that might otherwise accrue from having local bodies the landlords <Col N="1023" /> of the houses of the workers in urban districts, I do shrink from a policy like this by which, with a rent of 5/-, the State is to pay £60 and the local authority £111.  I want to clear our minds as to what is wrong there, because if one person in Clonmel is to have the State and the local authority paying that amount of money for him, how many other people in Clonmel are entitled to be put in the same way?  How many other people throughout the whole country are entitled to be put in the same way?  Where, and from whom, are the State and the local authority to get the money for that?</P>

      <P>If the Deputy will look at the figures with regard to interest, and see them applotted in a graphic kind of way, he will see there is very little to be gained immediately by extending the loan over 35 years, and there is a tremendous lot to be said for wiping out your capital indebtedness at 35 years, rather than carrying a considerable portion of it for another 15 years. Thirty-five years hence people will have their own problems, and we ought not to risk being in the position in respect of our urban housing schemes initiated now that some people find themselves in in respect of labourers' cottage schemes initiated ten or fifteen years ago.  There is no use in piling up debt unnecessarily. People should be made face the realities of the present situation, and exercise themselves to overcome their present-day problems.  I, in response to those Deputies who asked if this is a solution of our housing problem, say no, in the light of the £60 from the State, £111 from the local authority, and £140 from the rent-payer.  I question whether <Col N="1024" /> that house in Clonmel should be let at five shillings a week.  At any rate, we are allowing local authorities a certain amount of discretion; we are giving them a certain amount of help at the moment.</P>
      <P>If our object in doing that has to be put in one or two or three phrases, I may remark that in the first place we would have to say we are doing it in order to enable our building industry to settle its own problems; in the second place, we are doing it in order to bring out whatever loose capital there is in the pockets of private people, and induce them to solve their own housing problem, and thirdly, in so far as the slum, the insanitary house is concerned, the pressure of the want of housing is a matter seriously affecting the people from a human point of view, and in that connection we are doing something to enable local authorities to react to the situation, and to do as much, at any rate, as they feel driven to do by the knowledge of what is wrong in their own locality, and by an understanding of what their financial resources are.  There are local authorities that have done a considerable amount for themselves, but there are other local authorities that have not, and it would be a very interesting matter to examine why.  If local authorities cannot respond to the needs of their own area, and do not take advantage of the facilities provided for them now, it is very difficult to accept it that a situation exists that should make us cry or whine here about it.</P>

We cannot stretch out to do more than we are doing at the present moment in order to help the type of towns that Deputy Davin speaks about when the position financially is as I say it is in Clonmel and when the number of houses that are said to be wanted by urban authorities in their districts is the number that I have quoted.</P>

      <P>There is no use in talking about what was done in Vienna.  I apologise to Deputy Lemass that &ldquo;The Star&rdquo; has not a better correspondent on housing matters.  At any rate, I was glad to see that the Viennese description was taken from the &ldquo;Manchester Guardian.&rdquo; There are places in Europe other than Vienna that we might look to in order to compare our problems with, our immediate post-war problems and the problems of the last few years, and there are places other than Vienna that we might look to in order to get some inspiration for the solution of our housing problem. There is one point that I would like to stress in connection with the present Bill, and that is that the houses that will become entitled to the present grant will be houses that will be begun before 1st April of next year.</P>

      <P>I believe that the Minister for Local Government has not made a real effort to solve the housing problem in Limerick city and county.  We have slums there just as bad as in any part of the Free State; just as bad in proportion to the slums in Dublin, and they are bad enough in Dublin.  I believe that thousands of extra houses would be built only for the niggardly way that the Minister acted in connection with grants for houses.  If a house is a foot more or less than the standard size the Minister or his inspector will <Col N="1026" /> refuse to give a grant.  The person concerned will tell his neighbour or neighbours that he would not get the grant after building the house.  That is very bad encouragement for the neighbour or neighbours to put up a house or houses.  They will say: &ldquo;If you did not get the grant I am not going to build a house and possibly be refused the grant, too.&rdquo; I think the Minister should be prepared to allow the grant in a case like that; the inspector should pass the house and give the grant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the thing will go on the records anyway and the Department can deal with the matter afterwards.  My criticism on this Bill is that it does not deal with the bigger problem.  It does deal with the problem of the house suited to persons who have either a very high wage or a salary or income of over £200 or £300 a year.  The kind of houses that have been mostly built under these grants are not for the poorer classes at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The kinds of houses that are being built under these grants could be built just as well if loans were given to those who want to buy houses. Most people interested in housing agree that the principle of subsidising the builder is wrong, and that what should be done would be to help people to buy houses by giving them credit.  Builders would put up more houses if they were sure of finding purchasers.  There are many cases where people have tried to buy houses.  They tried to get money from insurance companies with <Col N="1027" /> which they had insured their lives and which will give them two-thirds of the purchase price, but they were not able to get the balance, and they could not buy the houses because they were unable to find the initial few hundred pounds.  If the Government could arrange to lend the money rather than to give subsidies to these people it would really facilitate the builders, and the utility societies would build houses for this class of person.  On a debate on an earlier Act of the same nature, I made a similar suggestion, and the President said that he proposed to do something of the kind in the Town Tenants Bill, but as the Town Tenants Bill has not yet appeared nothing has been done.  I suggest to the Minister that if he continues this kind of piecemeal legislation, which deals only with a limited number of houses, he should consider very carefully a scheme for making loans to persons who want to buy houses. The great delay &mdash; and delay is a terrible thing in reference to the building of houses &mdash; is due largely to the fact that people cannot find money to buy houses.</P>
    <P>There has been in some cases an unaccountable delay on the part of the Department in granting sanction to schemes put forward by local authorities.  In one case, of which I have some knowledge, a scheme was passed by a very large majority of the urban district council last February, but up to yesterday sanction has neither been granted nor refused, with the result that a number of these houses may never be built, and, if they are, they will have to be sold at higher prices than were expected by the public utility society which has been promoting the scheme.  When a scheme is put forward by a local authority, all the objections made in writing or verbally to it, or the representations made against it, should be brought to the notice of the local authority and made public immediately, because suggestions are current that backstairs methods and influences are being used in these cases.  If a public <Col N="1028" /> utility society enters upon an enterprise, it is essential that it should be carried through with the greatest rapidity, because there is the contractor to be considered, there is money to be raised, and there is interest running up against the society, and any serious delay must have the effect of killing the enterprise.</P>
    <P>The very fact that the money earmarked has not been exhausted this year, that a sum of £18,000 out of £200,000 has been left over, shows that the present scheme is not satisfactory, because that money should have been exhausted if the scheme had been running smoothly and had been dealing adequately with the problem.  I hope that the Department will carefully consider my suggestion that loans should be made, even if they were only of such a nature as would fit in with the insurance companies schemes.  Incidentally it is worth noting that the English insurance companies are giving the best facilities to persons to purchase houses on life insurance schemes, and I think that the Government should try by some means or other to work in with Irish insurance companies so that they would be able to compete with these enormous English companies, thus assisting persons who want to buy houses by making them initial loans, and at the same time encouraging people who have reasonable prospects of earning steady salaries by giving them greater facilities for insuring their lives in Irish companies. If loans rather than grants were given money would be saved to the State, and at the same time the commercial matter of building houses for those who can afford to buy them would be speeded up.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to touch the other problem that has been so adequately dealt with by Deputy O'Kelly and Deputy Lemass.  The Bill does not deal with that big problem at all; it only deals with a very limited class, and I have confined myself entirely to suggestions which I hope the Minister will consider.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBroderick" hpid="Mr. S. Brodrick Mr. S. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>This big problem <Col N="1029" /> before us which we have discussed for some years is a difficult one to solve.  It should be a national problem. We had from Deputy Lemass a large number of figures with reference to the setting up of a housing board.  He pointed out its advantages and said it would solve the problem in about ten years.  We were told that 17,000 houses had been built within the last seven or eight years, and they were built without any housing board.  I think Deputy Lemass said that in ten years a housing board would have built about 43,000 houses, and he referred to combined purchasing under such a board.  Combined purchasing may be all right in the case of such institutions as mental hospitals, industrial schools and county homes, but in the case of an ordinary farming area, where you have one house here and another a mile away, the problem would be difficult, unless you could get merchants to supply material within a radius of eight or ten miles of them.  It is easy enough to supply materials to institutions, but to supply them to people building is another thing, because the materials are different, and the buildings would be dotted here and there all over the country.  It would take some time to solve that difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass also said that houses should be built of Irish materials.  We would all like to see that, and we would all like to see stone used, but at present I do not think there are a sufficient number of men in the country to use stone. I am afraid that, owing to the heavy cost of stone work, building in stone as against building in concrete is impracticable. The Deputy also suggested that we should have our own brickworks instead of importing bricks.  I think we used 9,000,000 bricks last year, and we imported only 4,000,000.  Bricks may be all right for particular classes of work, but if people are building houses which in the ordinary way would cost £400 or £500 and if they use bricks, even Irish bricks, the cost of the houses would be about £600.  If it is <Col N="1030" /> proposed to force such people to use such materials I think great damage is going to be done to the building industry.  Houses cannot be built unless people can get the class of houses that they have the money to pay for.  I think bricks cost about £4 10s. a thousand and cement 50/- a ton.  Deputy Good will know this better than I do, but I think the difference in the cost of a cubic yard of building between brick and concrete would be about £2.  I agree with Deputy Lemass that we should use more Irish slates.  They are a very good class of slate, and there is very little difference in the price compared with the price of Welsh slates.  I do not believe the Minister for Local Government was right in saying that the difference in the cost of a house would be about £20.  I think the Minister was referring to asbestos slates, which are not up to the quality of Irish or Welsh slates. I am in agreement with Deputy Lemass that, as far as possible, Irish slates should be used.  I do not agree with him about bricks, because, at the present time, they are too costly, and in the next place we have not the men to work them.  The same applies to stone work.  Paints are a small matter.</P>
    <P>I would like to bring before the Minister for Finance the question of dealing with engineers' fees in rural districts.  As far as I know, a site plan has to be prepared and paid for, and the engineer who inspects the house has to get £2 2s. That means that the man who is building the house has to pay £3 3s., which is taken out of the £45 grant.  I think the Minister should try to meet portion of the engineering expenses, seeing that the grant is so small.  At least the State might pay portion of these expenses.  I know that plans are provided, but site plans are not, nor is there provision for the engineer who issues the certificate.  I will ask the Minister to take that into consideration, as in the case of a large number of houses, costing from £250 to £400, the grant is only £45.  I do not agree with Deputy Little's suggestion to <Col N="1031" /> give loans to people to buy houses. Deputy Lemass said that houses must be built before loans are given to buy them.  According to Deputy Lemass, no houses can be bought at present.  I think loans for houses do not arise now, but that what we want is to get the houses built.  Deputy Little said that loans would be much better than subsidies.  We all agree that we have not sufficient houses, so that I think the subsidy is badly needed.  When the houses are built, if loans were available to purchase them the Minister might consider that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the majority of the Deputies who have spoken on housing, I consider the way this important question has been dealt with has been disgraceful.  Coming from a rural district, and having had some connection with a board of health, I remember that on many occasions when a labourer's cottage was vacant we had up to 25 people with large families looking for it. It would take a modern Solomon to decide which of the 25 people was best entitled to the house.  It is thought that there is no housing problem except in the cities and towns.  The question is equally serious in the rural districts.  If sufficient houses are not provided there, how are the people to be housed?  The people in the rural parts are the backbone of the nation and they should be properly housed. The subject has been discussed from the point of view of cheapness.  Deputy Good attributes all the faults to the workers in general.  Deputy Good is an expert in this business. He told us that the cost of labour was retarding the progress of house building, but the Deputy was expert enough not to tell us about the profits of the house builders.  Some time ago Deputy Anthony quoted the case of an English contractor who came to Cork and built houses 50 per cent. cheaper than any house builder in Ireland could build them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Anthony stated that the English contractor paid better wages to his workmen than the Irish contractor, although he had taken the contract at 50 per cent. less than Irish contractors.  This question is a National one, and if we are going to be quibbling about a subject that affects the health and happiness of the people, the housing problem will never be solved.  Dealing with it in a shilly-shally way, and bit by bit, will advance us no further.  No houses have been built in the rural areas except by private individuals for their own use. There are vacant workhouses in Callan, Thomastown, Urlingford, and Carlow that could be turned into flats, with a view to housing people in these towns.  And at present the county council or the boards of health cannot interfere with the old unions, because they are not legally entitled to.  I contend that the Minister for Local Government should at least do something in this way whereby the county boards of health could do something with these old unions for the purpose of alleviating the conditions with regard to the inadequacy of housing in this country.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Local Government spoke of the scheme suggested by Deputy Lemass as a socialistic solution of the problem. I do not like the word &ldquo;socialism&rdquo; in some of the interpretations given to it, but I certainly say that a socialistic solution would be better than no solution.  The Minister has asked us many questions.  I suggest it is the Minister's duty to offer a solution, and if the Government cannot do it they should let someone else in who would at least try to do it.  Deputy Brodrick referred to the number of houses built.  I think the Department of Local Government will admit there have been a number built, but that they have done nothing towards meeting the arrears of 43,000 houses which are required.  They are keeping up <Col N="1033" /> with the current requirements, but not meeting any of the arrears.  I think if the Minister would tell us what he intends to do to make up these arrears, then we would be getting somewhere.  You had schemes in Fairbrothers Fields, Donnycarney, Marino and other places.  Still they do not seem to relieve the congestion in the slums.  Slums exist in towns in Co. Galway as well as in Dublin, and houses can be built.  Still there seems to be a great number of people in the slums, in dwellings condemned as being unfit for human habitation. Will the Minister tell us what alleviation there has been in this problem, and if there has been none what he intends to do to solve the problem, or does he intend to leave it there for all time?</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke of enabling the speculative building industry to get on its feet.  Would he mention some period of years during which he is prepared to allow the speculative builders to get on their feet to tackle the problem?  Could they do it in five, six or ten years?  So far, the speculative builder has not met the problem.</P>
      <P>Regarding loans, I have had discussions with builders and builders' providers.  They were strongly of opinion that the grants are given to the wrong type of person, which is proved by the fact that the slums are not being wiped out.  Houses are being built; certain types of people get them, but there is no relief in the slum problem.  The slums are still as congested as ever.  Deputy Brodrick did not seem to understand what Deputy Little was coming to, and that was, instead of giving £100 or £50 as a grant towards the building of houses no grant be given, but the Government should, one way or another, get loans to provide houses.  If the builder were quite sure he had a purchaser for his house the house would be built.</P>

      <P>The speculative builders. if there were such loans, would get <Col N="1034" /> people to buy the houses before they had the foundations of them laid. That is the problem.  No one wants to lend money to buy houses that do not exist.  I do not know that Deputy Lemass suggested the building of these houses with stone.  He referred chiefly to brick.  Deputy Brodrick contrasted brick with cement.  Our suggestion is, make the cement here.  The figures quoted by Deputy Lemass do not refer to last year for brick.  They were for some years before; however, that is immaterial.</P>

      <P>Regarding the agricultural people, agricultural labourers are, in some cases, coming into the towns because they have no houses, and it is a problem the Government ought to face.  It is one of the reasons why the towns are getting crowded.  You have them coming in three or four miles in some cases to get a place to live in.  These are a few points I wish to refer to, and I would ask the Minister for Local Government to examine the question of Irish slates.  Deputy Brodrick knows something about the matter. He states that there is not a difference of £20, that that difference would only exist where you have artificial slates.</P>
      <P>I take it he is correct because he has some knowledge on the point.  I join with him in asking the Minister to look into the question of recommending Irish slates, and if there is very little difference in the matter to specify that they would be used in building.</P>

      <P>I would like to suggest to the Minister that in the building of groups of houses in urban districts care should first be taken that the districts are properly supplied with water.  I think where some houses are being built there is no proper water supply and consequently no proper sanitation.  The place I have particularly in mind is Clondalkin.  I think there has been a good deal of building out there and the water supply is most inadequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to emphasise that no effort whatever is being made to deal with the very big problem of housing in the rural areas.  I know that building schemes are applied in a general way to houses in rural towns, but apart from that there is a problem which the Government have recognised in so far as they have introduced a special scheme to deal with it in the Gaeltacht. The Gaeltacht scheme was intended mainly to deal with housing in rural areas, where the economic conditions were such that the people were not in a position without substantial assistance to engage in the building of new houses.  That scheme is confined to Irish-speaking areas, but the economic conditions are just as bad in a much wider area, what might be termed the old congested districts area.  There is an area that lies between the Gaeltacht and what was originally included in the old congested districts.  Nothing has been done for that area and I would like to emphasise the necessity for the Government making some provision for the people in that area and not merely be pandering to pressure that is brought upon them in regard to the slums in Dublin or in some of the larger towns in the country.  And it should not be done in a stingy or niggardly fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the Government have made no real attempt to deal with the question, and that they have left one particular class of people who are as much in need of assistance as the people of any other area, entirely out of consideration. The Minister for Local Government and Deputy Good appear to be of one view on this question of housing. I do not know whether the Minister is in agrement with him on the question of wages or not.  If wages are reduced, workers will not be able to pay rents that will make the building of houses economic.  I think that Deputy Good is asking too much from the State and that the State is wrong in meeting his point of view.  The State should seriously consider the proposition of providing houses by getting material <Col N="1036" /> and men together to provide them and discounting the contractors' viewpoint and the capitalists' viewpoint upon this matter.</P>

      <P>When the last Housing Bill was going through the Dáil a special plea was made for a number of families in Greystones who had been the victims of a calamity. They lost their houses through an act of God and not through any fault of their own.  An amendment was inserted which it was thought would specially apply to the case of these people to enable houses to be built for them soon afterwards. These people, unfortunately, are still waiting for houses; so far indeed there has not been even a site chosen and as far as I can see there is still going to be considerable delay.  It would not be in order I suppose to enter into the question as to who is responsible for that delay.  I think there is amongst those most closely concerned a general feeling that the Local Government Department are not free from blame, that their method of fulfilling their function in the matter was not one that they could well defend.  It certainly appears that the application for approval of a particular site was turned down on evidence that was not given at the public inquiry, which is a rather remarkable state of things.  But I only rise now to state the position with regard to this question.  There are a number of families that through no fault of their own have been without houses for some two years past.  They had to go through the terrible ordeal of dismantling their own homes and assisting to pull them down, and in view of that, the Local Government Department should show rather more sympathy than they have shown heretofore in regard to applications they may receive concerning these victims of misfortune in the near future.  I understand an application for approval of another site will shortly come before the Department, and remembering the circumstances of the families and remembering that they have not been bereft altogether of the things of most <Col N="1037" /> value to them in the world, that they have received no charity or sign of public sympathy in any way, it is to be hoped that the Department will at least do all in its power to facilitate them in obtaining houses to replace those they lost and that it will not be responsible, for one day's delay more than will be necessary. When the previous negotiations took place with the Local Government Department there was at least the full amount of delay that usually takes place in such cases.  I think it would show no lack of dignity on the part of the Local Government Department if, in the circumstances I have mentioned, they made a special effort to expedite the local authority or the private builders or whomsoever may be responsible for the building of houses to meet the requirements of these people.</P>

      <P>The giving of loans to individuals is not a matter that the Government could undertake. Unless we were merely to go to an extent that would not meet the view of Deputy Little at all, the difficulties that would arise would make it impossible for the Government to administer the scheme properly at all.  People would be unable to pay, and ordinary steps, which ought to be taken if the matter was regarded as a business proposition, could not be taken. While progress, and very considerable progress, has been made in dealing with the housing problem, there are people whose needs have not been met, but the problem there is more than a mere housing problem. It is a problem which is nearly a hopeless problem in every country &mdash; to provide for those who are, for one reason or another, in a condition of economic distress and cannot afford to pay any sort of reasonable rent at all.  That is a problem which a housing policy will not meet; it has to be met by progress in a particular direction.  Deputy Maguire asked that the Gaeltacht scheme should be extended over a much wider area.  I think the provisions of the Gaeltacht scheme <Col N="1038" /> are, perhaps, the most generous contained in any housing measure of any Government, and they are more generous than could or should be given on an extended scale.  These conditions are given in the Gaeltacht for two reasons: first, because, broadly speaking, the economic need is greatest there.  Secondly, because there are national reasons why something extra should be done for the people of that district.  But if it were to be suggested that such a scheme should be widely extended, the only result would be, ultimately, some cutting down of the scheme itself, and some curtailment of the generosity of that scheme.</P>
      <P>I understand the position in regard to Greystones housing has been previously explained by the Minister for Local Government.  Any delay that has taken place in the matter is delay for which the Department of Local Government is in no way responsible. The responsibility for delay, so far as there has been delay, is the responsibility of the local people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Currency (Amendment) Bill, 1930, be now read a Second Time.  The most important section of this Bill is Section 2.  It is introduced because the choice of methods of investing the Legal Tender Fund at present open to the Currency Commission is not wide enough.  The Currency Commission, at present, can invest legal tender notes in gold bullion or gold coins, in British legal tender, and British Government securities maturing within twelve months, or <Col N="1039" /> by way of deposit in banks.  When the Currency Bill was first introduced there was no such proviso as is at present in the Act with regard to British Government securities.  It was allowed to have British Government securities of any maturity that it thought proper.  In the Seanad an amendment was inserted in spite of the opposition of the Minister for Finance putting in the words &ldquo;maturing within twelve months.&rdquo; Now the position has been reached where there are practically no British securities available to the Currency Commission other than Three Months Treasury Bills, on which the yield of interest is very low, and it is felt that the Act should be restored, so far as this matter is concerned, to the form in which it was introduced originally.  The Banking Commission did not recommend any such limitation as that now in the Act as a result of the Seanad amendment.  It certainly is a matter of some importance from the point of view of the earning powers of the fund that the Currency Commission should have a wider choice of securities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a second change proposed in this section.  It is proposed that the Currency Commission should not be limited, as it is, to British securities, but should, also, be free to invest in securities of the Government of the United States.  It is unnecessary to say that the securities of the Government of the United States are as good and as sound as any securities which could be found. I do not think it is likely at present that the Currency Commission will actually invest in securities of the Government of the United States.  As things stand at present as good a rate of interest could not be obtained from those securities as could be obtained from British securities, and consequently, while the whole matter is within the discretion of the Currency Commission, I would say it is not likely at the present time that they will avail of the power which it is proposed to give them in this section. But circumstances may change <Col N="1040" /> and it may at some time later on become clear that it would be profitable and wise for the Commission to invest in the securities of the Government of the United States.  We feel it is well, as we are making a change in the law now, that we should avail of the opportunity to give the Currency Commission a choice in these securities.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know the whole basis of the Currency Act is that instead of, as other and bigger countries I think do, holding gold or anything of that nature behind our legal tender notes we hold interest bearing securities against legal tender notes.  That can be done by a small country.  I do not think it could be done by a big country.  It is one of the few advantages a small country has in its financial arrangements.  So long as we hold the securities of the British Government or a Government, say, like the United States, we have something as good as gold for all practical purposes and at the same time producing an annual income.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill simply provides that the Currency Commission may make an interim valuation of the securities in the legal tender notes fund, instead of being confined to the half-yearly valuations, as at present.  Section 4 of the Bill makes provision similar to that found in British legislation, and in Dominion legislation, against the defacing of legal tender notes or making them unsightly, which involves actual cost to the Currency Commission or the banks and makes the more frequent renewal of the notes necessary. Under the Canadian Bank Act, 1923, it is provided:</P>
    <P>Every person who mutilates, cuts, tears or perforates with holes any Dominion or bank note, or who in any way defaces a Dominion or bank note, whether by writing, printing, drawing or stamping thereon, or by attaching or affixing thereto anything in the nature or form of an advertisement shall, on summary conviction, be liable to a penalty not exceeding twenty dollars.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1041" /> The British Currency and Bank Notes Act, 1928, provides: &mdash;</P>
    <P>If any person prints or stamps or by any like means impresses on any bank note any words, letters or figures, he shall, in respect of each offence, be liable on summary conviction to a penalty not exceeding one pound.</P>
    <P>The Commonwealth of Australia Bank Act, 1911-24, provides:</P>
    <P>Every person who (a) defaces or disfigures any Australian note by writing, printing, stamping or drawing, anything thereon or (b) makes on, or attaches to, any Australian note any advertisement, or (c) designs, makes, issues or circulates any advertisement in the form of or resembling or apparently intended to resemble any Australian note shall be guilty of an offence and liable to a penalty of twenty pounds.</P>

      <P>Without committing ourselves in any way to approval of the Principal Act we are prepared to assent to the passing of this Bill because we believe that the amendments to the Principal Act which it proposes constitute an improvement. Neither do we propose to discuss, even if it would be in order, the principles underlying the Currency Act of 1927 although we hold the view that the time has come or will come in the near future when it would be of service to have the operations of that Act reviewed by an independent body established for <Col N="1042" /> the purpose.  The only matter arising out of the Bill before us that does not seem particularly clear is that relating to Section 3.  Section 3 authorises the Currency Commission when it realises a profit upon the sale of assets in the Legal Tender Note Fund to transfer the amount of that profit from the Legal Tender Note Fund to the Note Reserve Fund in any one or more of the forms mentioned in sub-section (2) of Section 62 of the Principal Act.  The forms mentioned in sub-section (2) of Section 62 of the Principal Act are similar to those mentioned in sub-section (3) of Section 61 of the Principal Act with this difference, that when this Bill becomes law they will not include securities of the Government of the United States of America.  Is there any reason why assets of the Note Reserve Fund could not also be held in the form of securities of the Government of the United States as well as the assets of the Legal Tender Note Fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is possible this is a drafting error, because I notice in sub-section (2) that on losses arising in the Legal Tender Note Fund &ldquo;The Commission may transfer to that fund from the Note Reserve Fund capital assets in any one or more of the forms mentioned in sub-section (3) of Section 61 of the Principal Act,&rdquo; which, of course, now includes securities in the Government of the United States.  As there could not be any of the assets of the Note Reserve Fund held in that form, obviously they could not be transferred in that form.  I would be glad if the Minister would tell us if there was any deliberate intention to preclude the Currency Commission holding assets in the Note Reserve Fund in the form of securities of the United States of America, or whether there has been some confusion between the two sections.  There is no other matter in the Bill that calls for attention.  We approve of the proposal to delete the words &ldquo;maturing within twelve months&rdquo; in sub-section (3) of Section 61 relating to British Government securities.  There does not seem to be any special advantage <Col N="1043" /> in holding British Government securities maturing only in twelve months, particularly as there would be a substantial loss due to the lower yield.  We approve also of the proposal to include securities of the Government of the United States of America in the form in which the funds can be held.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should the United States securities be the only ones chosen for investment outside British?  Why should the securities of other governments which seem equally stable with those of the United States of America be excluded?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no deliberate intention to exclude United States securities.  That is merely a drafting matter.  With regard to the question put by Deputy Moore, I do not think there are any other securities that are really in the same class with the securities of the Government of the United States.  As we are resting our currency on securities and not on gold, as is usual, we do not want to include securities which, even though they seem to be all right at present, might be liable to be in jeopardy at some future time. We feel that the securities of the Government of the United States are not securities that will be in any jeopardy, and the same cannot be stated with conviction about the securities of many other governments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands and Fisheries (Mr. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill which proposes to carry out one of the recommendations of the Gaeltacht Commission, by extending to certain <Col N="1044" /> parts of the Gaeltacht the provisions of the earlier Acts of 1914 and 1917 relating to meals for school children. These Acts apply at the moment only in urban areas.  The Gaeltacht Commission, in paragraph 63 of its report, said:</P>
      <P>In many parts of the Gaeltacht, school children have to travel long distances over bleak country, and the hardships they thereby suffer, particularly in the winter time, are such as render them unfit to profit to the fullest extent by the education given.  The Commission recommends that provision be made for a free meal each day in schools where the managers and teachers consider such provision advisable.  No distinction whatever should be made in the case of any of the children in this matter.</P>
      <P>The parts of the Gaeltacht included in the Schedule to the Bill are those to which these conditions apply. They have been settled after very careful consideration by officers who know the Gaeltacht generally, and they embrace the districts in which the conditions of the people are bad, the distances to be travelled to school by the children are longest, and the journeys most exposed.  In order that Deputies might be able to see readily what districts are covered by the Schedule, I have had a map prepared and set up in the hall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that, at this stage, I need say much in support of the general case for providing a hot meal for school children in the middle of the school day, especially in districts of the type with which we are dealing. The hours of school attendance are normally from 10 in the morning until 3 in the afternoon. In the districts under consideration, the children have to go long journeys, sometimes taking half-an-hour or an hour to reach school.  The work on which they are engaged in school is just as exhausting as that in which adults mostly engage.  It will be readily understood that at 12.30 or 1 o'clock &mdash; 3½ or 4 hours after they have left home &mdash; if a hot meal of <Col N="1045" /> some sort is not provided, the child ceases to be able, either physically or mentally, to take advantage of the teaching.  That is shortly the case for seeing that the school child has some sort of hot meal during the school day under the best conditions. In the winter, the case is very much stronger.  The child may have walked a long distance in drenching rain, and may have had to sit throughout the day in partly dried clothes or in clothes not dried at all.</P>
    <P>It would be more agreeable to me to bring in a Bill which extended this benefit to the whole of the Gaeltacht, but there are several strong grounds against such a course.  For reasons which I will explain later, it might well defeat the realisation of the purpose which the Bill will, I hope, achieve.  In the first place, one must bear in mind that the principle of public assistance in the provision of meals for children has not been conceded in rural areas elsewhere in the country.  Besides that, I am glad to be able to say that there are many portions of the Gaeltacht where the conditions of the people and the accessibility of the schools are just as good as they are in portions of the Galltacht.</P>
    <P>In the second place, the putting into operation of this measure will depend on the goodwill of the county councils and county boards of health, by whom the actual arrangements for the meals must be made, and by whom half the cost of the food must be borne. I believe that the limitation of the area to those districts in which the need is most obvious will go a great way towards ensuring that goodwill and towards facilitating the councils in taking an early decision to put the measure in force.  I cannot help thinking that any extension of the area might have the effect of postponing such a decision, or indeed of rendering the measure a dead letter.  While the claim of the Gaeltacht for special treatment in this and other matters is generally admitted, I believe that the interests of the Gaeltacht are best served by moderation in the pressing of that <Col N="1046" /> claim, and by the immediate realisation of those purposes which are most pressing.  In this way we can hope for a continuance of that general support in the carrying through of the measures for the benefit of the Gaeltacht which still lie before us. The form of the Bill follows broadly the lines of the earlier Acts, which have been found in practice to answer.  The two most important differences between it and former Acts is that this is an extension to rural areas.  The Act in the past applied only to urban areas.  In former Acts there was a provision for payment by parents for meals supplied in schools.  Section 2 of the Act of 1914 says:</P>
    <P>(1)  There shall be charged to the parent of every child in respect of every meal furnished to that child under this Act such an amount as may be determined by the local authority, and, in the event of payment not being made by the parent, it shall be the duty of the authority, unless they are satisfied that the parent is unable by reason of circumstances other than his own default to pay the amount, to require the payment of that amount from that parent, and any such amount may be recovered as a civil debt in the manner provided by the Summary Jurisdiction Acts.</P>
    <P>(2)  The local authority shall pay over to the school meals committee so much of any money paid to them by, or recovered from, any parent as may be determined by the authority to represent the cost of the food furnished by the committee to the child of that parent, less a reasonable deduction in respect of the expenses of recovering the same.</P>
    <P>There is no such provision in the Bill before us.  The provision of meals will be carried out by the county councils through the boards of health acting with the assistance of committees, which may consist entirely of members of the board of health, or they may enlist the services of persons outside.  Section 7 provides that it shall be no part of <Col N="1047" /> the official duty of a teacher to assist in the provision of meals.  I anticipate that this measure will be borne largely on the shoulders of the teachers, but they will do this service not as part of their duty to the State but as a voluntary act.  I know there is a desire on the part of the teachers to assist generally in the matter, and the assistance given in the way of voluntary work in a matter of this kind is likely to be more valuable than if given as part of their official duties.  The measure will not be without value to the teachers, as I am confident it will lead to better educational results, which will make it easier for the teachers to impart knowledge to the pupils, but, as I have said, there will be no compulsion on the teachers to assist in the provision of the meals.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides a limit to the amount of the State contribution, which is not to exceed £10,000.  The number of schools in the scheduled area is 337, and the average attendance last year was 19,032.  The cost of providing a meal would amount roughly, on an average, to 1¼d. per child.  This estimate is supported by previous experience in other parts of the country, when assistance in the provision of meals was given out of relief funds some years ago.  It is also supported by experience in urban areas.  In the latter the average cost has been lower, as the cost of the commodities in these areas is somewhat lower.  The average urban cost in 1927 was 1.1d.; in 1928, 1.18d.; and in 1929, 1.19d.  It is not a large sum, but I contemplate that it will enable a cup of hot cocoa with milk and sugar and a substantial slice of bread and butter, or jam, to be supplied to each child. That is the maximum we could provide, but in many cases children will bring home-made bread and butter or other food as a contribution to the meal.  Ten thousand pounds will be ear-marked for the boards of health affected, and each board will have some discretion as to the expenditure of the money, subject to the condition that only half the actual cost of <Col N="1048" /> food provided will be repaid to it.  If any board of health should fail to put the measure into force its share of the £10,000 will come back into the Exchequer.  The whole annual expenditure is not very much, but I feel it is money well expended and that it will give a better return in the physical and mental equipment of the children turned out from the schools in the scheduled areas.  The measure will, I hope, with the cooperation of the county councils and the boards of health, be brought into actual operation in a number of areas on 1st October.</P>

      <P>This Bill will, I am sure, be welcomed by all Deputies.  As the Minister says, it carries out, or partly carries out, one of the recommendations of the Gaeltacht Commission. It applies, of course, to the districts in which the need is most obvious.  The Minister says that moderation in the pressing of such claims would be likely to lead to a more general acceptance of the putting into operation of other recommendations of the Gaeltacht Commission later on.  The elimination of the section compelling parents to contribute in such cases is very good, for not only were the costs difficult to recover but it lead to inquiries which were not desirable very often, and in fact to certain schools refusing to put the powers into operation. I am also quite certain that the teachers will do most of this work. The greater portion of the burden will fall on them, and in that connection it is wise not to make it obligatory on the teachers to do the work.  They will, I am satisfied, do it voluntarily.  This is really an educational measure, for, as Napoleon said, &ldquo;an army marches on its stomach.&rdquo; Certainly, children going to school cannot take advantage of the teaching if they are hungry.  If we spend £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 on education it would be worth spending a few thousands to enable the children to take advantage of that education.  I would be inclined to plead for a larger contribution from the Government.  I believe they will contribute fifty per cent. of the expense, <Col N="1049" /> and their total contribution will be £10,000.  Anybody looking at the map on which the scheduled areas are coloured will know these are the very poorest districts in the country outside the slums of Dublin, and their need is very great and obvious. I think no objection would be taken by any Party in this House if the Government decided to be more generous and to contribute say three-fourths of the cost of supplying these meals.</P>

      <P>This Bill is long overdue.  The idea behind it is good. I do not agree, however, with the financial arrangements in the Bill. I think that to ask boards of health to contribute one-half the cost of the administration of this Bill is to ask them to take on a burden which, in many cases, will be more than the over-taxed farmers in the country can well bear.  I think that the Government should have contributed two-thirds of the cost.  I think that one-third of the cost would have been quite enough to put on boards of health.  Unless that is done, I think this Bill will be unpopular. That is to say this Bill will be unpopular if the boards of health are asked to contribute one-half of the cost.  I am glad to see that the teachers are free to do as they please, either to help or to remain neutral. With regard to the electoral divisions, I do not agree that sound discretion has been shown in their selection. For instance in Kerry, Caragh is omitted.  Caragh is one of the electoral divisions in the congested areas where the valuation per head is less than £1 1s.  Kilorglin is another that is omitted.  Cromane as the Minister knows is as poor a district as there is in Ireland.  Other poor areas excluded from the Bill are Boolteens, Keelgarrylander, Castlecove.  I think the provisions of the Bill should be extended to embrace at least these electoral divisions.  I hope the Minister will take a note of them.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom, ar nós Phroinséis Uí Fhathaigh, Teachta, fáilte do chur roimh an <Col N="1050" /> mBille seo ar son na Gaeltachta.  Tá mé ag ceapa gur bhuail an tAire an tairnge ar an gceann nuair adubhairt sé an fáth is mó atá faoi seo, an t-achar atá ag na páistí a dhul chun na scoile, cuid acab trí no ceathar de mhíltibh.  Bhí muid uilig óg roimhe seo agus tá fhios againn dá gcuirfeadh muid lón beag in ar bpóca nach mbeadh mórán le fáil againn sa phóca nuair a bheadh na trí míle siubhalta againn.  Is beag páiste sa nGaeltacht nár bhféidir leis ruaine bheag aráin do thabhairt leis agus nach dtugann leis é, ach tá faitchíos orm nach móran bhíonn fágtha aige dhe nuair a bhíonn sé ag teach na scoile, mar bíonn ar na páistí an baile fhágáil go moch. Mar sin, is maith an rud é, agus is rí-mhaith an rud é, go bhfuil an Rialtas ag cur i ngéill go gcaithfe siad lón te d'fháil i lár an laé.</P>
      <P>Rud eile, is iomdha maidin fhliuch go mbíonn ortha dul amach go dtí an scoil sa mbáistigh agus bíonn siad fuar fliuch agus duine againn féin a bheadh mar seo ba mhaith leis é féin do théitheamh le lón te.</P>
      <P>Anois, faoi na ceanntracha gur chuir an tAire faoi fháinne, ní féidir le duine ar bith a rá nach iad na ceanntracha is Gaedhealaí agus is boichte sa tír íad.  Tá mé cinnte go mbeidh na ceanntracha eile fá fheirg nár tógadh isteach freisin íad.  Ach má thagann siad leis an mbochtanacht agus leis an nGaeltacht ní fhéadfadh siad mórán a rá.  Tá dhá cheanntar in Aontas Uachtair Aird gur mhaith liom go leigfeadh sé isteach sa bhfáinne iad.  Is iad san togh-roinn Uachtair Aird agus toghroinn Pholl na Péiste.  B'fhéidir nach bhfuil an dá thogh-roinn seo chó bocht amach is amach leis na togh-ranna eile ach in sna togh-ranna seo féin tá corr-bhaile bocht ionta. Ar chaoi ar bith, ní féidir le duine dá ghrinne focal a rá in aghaidh na gceanntracha atá sa bhfáinne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Níl a thuille le rá agam ach go bhfuil, ní hamháin baochas na Gaeltachta ag dul don Aire ach tá mé cinnte go mbeidh baochas na tíre ón tuaisceart go dtí an deisceart agus ón oirthear go dtí an t-iarthar ag dul do.  Mar tá sé <Col N="1051" /> ráite, duine ná tír ar bith a thugann congnamh don bhocht go gcuireann Dia an seacht n-oiread ina bhealach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I welcome this Bill.  At the same time I do not think that we can congratulate the Minister on being over-generous in this matter. I have been looking at the map showing the areas included, and the areas described as partly Irish-speaking which are excluded.  When I take some examples of the areas which are described as partly Irish-speaking I find that the vast majority of the people in these districts can speak and understand Irish.  The people in them who do not speak Irish form a very small minority. Take, for example, North Mayo and some of the districts that have been excluded from the Schedule.  Take the district of Lacken.  Everyone in that district can speak Irish.  They may not speak it at every moment of the day, but except for a few people who may have wandered in there from outside areas all the people there can speak Irish.  In the Bally-castle area the same thing applies These are two of the poorest areas, I suppose, in the whole constituency. The great majority of the people in these districts speak Irish, and practically all of them understand Irish, and yet they are described on the map as partly Irish-speaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other areas excluded are Glenhest and Addrigoole.  In the latter area we cannot get the Land Commission to give any help, but one would imagine that some little assistance would be forthcoming from the Minister's Department.  The people there are extremely poor.  There are 700 acres of land there, and the Land Commission simply leave it in the hands of one individual, who will not farm it or do anything with it.  The Land Commission will not do anything to assist in alleviating the distress that prevails amongst the people there.  One would imagine, since that position is taken up by the Land Commission, that some effort would be made by the Minister's Department to do something to alleviate <Col N="1052" /> the distress amongst these people. Then you have areas such as Attymass and Callow and Shraheen, as well as other areas excluded, in which the majority of the people are Irish-speaking, and at the present time are in deplorable circumstances. It is no unusual thing to see children all through the winter going to school without boots on them.  While the unfortunate parents have not the wherewithal to provide boots for them during the winter periods, they are prosecuted if they allow their donkeys to go without shoes.</P>
    <P>The amount that would be required to enable all these areas to make provision for meals for the children would be very small.  The areas that are excluded, and in which we contend the majority of the people are Irish-speaking, are equally as poor and in as bad a condition as the people in the areas that are provided for in this Bill.  I would suggest to the Minister that he might consider making provision for all those areas in which he is satisfied that the majority of the people are Irish-speaking, and in which the conditions are very bad.  While we welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister we think that he should have gone farther than he has.  The amount that would be involved in extending its provisions to areas such as I have suggested would not be considerable, and such an extension would make the Bill more satisfactory than it is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughALaw" hpid="Mr. Law Mr. Law">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Law</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill. It appears to me to be a necessary corollary so far as it goes to the Act passed by the Oireachtas some time ago making attendance at primary schools compulsory for children throughout the country.  I am not very much enamoured of the principle of compulsion.  When the State took upon itself to compel parents to send children to school it should also I think have been prepared at the same time to see that the children were in a fit physical state when they arrived at school to profit by the instruction given them.  Had the choice been mine, I should have preferred to see provision made for <Col N="1053" /> the feeding of necessitous children everywhere, as well as for the medical inspection of school children, than to see the State stepping in and making attendance at primary schools compulsory. However, it seemed well to the Dáil to do otherwise.  As the Dáil decided to compel children to attend primary schools, I welcome this step, so far as it goes, in the direction of seeing that the children should be in a proper state to receive instruction when they get to school.  Having said that, I want to ask the Minister one or two questions.</P>
      <P>I am not very clear as to the meaning of Section 4.  That Section says: &mdash;&ldquo;Every board of health to whom this Act applies may, subject to the provisions of this Act, provide meals for children attending national schools in the scheduled area of such board of health.&rdquo; I would like to know what we are to understand that section to mean. Does it mean that it is to be mandatory upon each board of health to provide meals for every child attending every school in the scheduled area?  If that is so, it seems to me that you will be imposing an unnecessary charge in many cases, because, undoubtedly, in the scheduled area there will be many districts where the schools are recruited from children coming from homes in which sufficient food is provided.  Or does it mean that they are to provide for such children in such schools as are necessitous?  I may have overlooked it &mdash; the point may be cleared up in some other section of the Bill, but I would be glad to have explanation of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I turn now to what has already been the subject of debate, and probably will be the subject of further discussion before we are finished, namely, the Schedule of the Bill.  I should be glad to be informed what is the principle on which that Schedule has been based.  Is it the proportion of Irish speakers in the district, or is it, as I should think would be more natural, having regard to the subject matter of the Bill, the necessity of the child?  I believe that, from whatever point of <Col N="1054" /> view we look at it, we shall find that the Schedule is in need of amendment. Undoubtedly we shall have Deputies telling us, as they have already told us, where the Schedule should be amended to suit their own particular parts of the country.  I shall confine myself to two or three instances in which it strikes me the Schedule requires amendment in relation to my own county of Donegal. I notice that the Schedule does not correspond in any way with the Schedule of the Gaeltacht Housing Act, that many districts included in that Act are excluded from the Schedule of this Bill.  I will mention three.  First, there is the whole of the area of Fanad, in which I think Deputy Blaney lives and which undoubtedly contains many Irish speakers and, to my knowledge, a great many poor townlands. Secondly, there is the entire peninsula of Rosguill, which contains some of the poorest townlands in the county and the bottom end of which, the far end sticking out in the Atlantic, contains some very poor townlands indeed.  Finally, there is the whole of the electoral division of Dunfanaghy.</P>
    <P>If a person were set the task of preparing a Schedule to a Bill of this kind, and if his knowledge of that county were confined to a knowledge of maps, valuations, and, perhaps, to a tour in a motor car along the main roads, I can well imagine his coming to the conclusion that in such a district as Dunfanaghy there would be no need of any provision for school children.  It is a district which for a considerable part, especially along the high roads, consists of what are, for Donegal, relatively good lands, good houses, and fairly prosperous people, but he would not have to deviate very far from the high road in the direction of the hills when he would find, along boreens running up to the mountains, townlands containing wretched houses, miserable holdings, and children who bear every evidence of being half-starved. Considering, on the one hand, that in the areas which are here excluded you have undoubtedly considerable <Col N="1055" /> districts in which most, if not all, of the children attending school will be found to be underfed, and having regard to the fact that, on the other hand, you will undoubtedly find in the scheduled areas schools in which nearly all the children come from comparatively comfortable homes, though geographically their homes lie in poor areas, it would be better to enlarge the areas.  If I read the Bill aright it is permissive and it is open to the board of health, on evidence taken, either to give or refuse provision in any particular case on the advice of the manager or local people. Where, then, can be the harm in extending the area, at any rate to the extent that would be implied in making the Schedule similar to that in the Gaeltacht Housing Act?</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, I look on this Bill as a first step.  I am quite sure that we cannot stop here and that we must include help for the whole of the Gaeltacht.  We will not stop even there, as I am quite sure that, having once adopted the principle, we will have to go on and meet the case of necessitous school children wherever you find them, whether in the Gaeltacht or outside.  I am, of course, always prepared to take what I can get.  I realise that it is necessary to limit our financial responsibility, but I would ask the Minister, and the Government generally, to consider whether they could not go a little further, even in this first step, than they appear to be inclined to go.  I would ask them to consider enlarging the Schedule, always on the understanding that it remains within the discretion of the board of health to decide as to how far they will put the Act into operation in each particular area.</P>

Ach isé mo thuairim agus do réir deabhraimh sé tuairim an Teachta o Thír Chonaill atá tar éis labhairt &mdash; go bhfuil baol ann go ndéanfaidh cuid de sna Búird Sláinte Puiblí faillí san obair seo.  Tá na búird seo i n-aghaidh breis airgid a chur ar lucht díolta na rátaí agus tá faitchíos orm nach gcuirfidh siad an Bille seo i bhféidhm. Ba mhaith liom rud éigin d'fheicsint san mBille ag tabhairt comhachta don Aire iachall do chur ar na Búird an tAcht do chur i bhféidhm.  Muna bhfuil comhacht éigin mar sin ag an Aire, creidim nách gcuirfear an tAcht i bhféidhm in áiteanna áirithe mar gheall ar an mbreis airgid a cuirfear ar na rátaí.  Tá cuid de sna háiteanna seo ana-bhocht &mdash; áiteanna mar Leitir Mór agus Inis Bó Finne &mdash; agus ní bheidh muinntir na n-áiteanna san in ánn a chur d'fhiachaibh ar na Búird an tAcht do chur i bhféidhm.</P>

Ach, do réir mo thuairime, má tá airgead le tabhairt ar aon ní, níl rud ar bith níos tabhachtaí chun airgead do chaitheamh air na sláinte na bpáistí sna háiteanna bochta i n-iarthar na hEireann.  Cuig bliana deag o shoin do chuir Ruaidhrí Mac Easmuinn scéim mar so ar bun san iarthar.

    <P>Is éigin níos mó do dhéanamh ar son na gceanntracha so na mar adeintear ar son na scoileanna i mBaile Atha Cliath agus áiteanna mar sin.  Tugtar leath an chostais do sna bailtí.  Is dó liom go mba chóir níos mó 'ná sin &mdash; an méid iomlán b'fhéidir &mdash; do thabhairt don Ghaeltacht, go háirithe na h-áiteanna bochta in iarthar na hEireann.  Tá faitchíos orm nách mbeidh na Búird Phuiblí in ánn an tairgead do sholáthairt agus mar gheall ar sin nách gcuirfear an tAcht i bhféidhm. Dá dtiocfadh leis an Aire a thuille airgid d'fháil on Aire Airgid ní amháin ar son na gceanntracha atá ar an liosta ach ar son na Gaeltachta, mar tá sé socruithe i dTuarasgabháil an Choimisúin; dá dtiocfadh leis an méid airgid d'fháil ón Aire Airgid agus a dhiolfadh dha dtrian de'n chostas, is dó liom go gcuirfaí an tAcht i bhféidhm i ngach Contae. Muna ndéanfar san, tá faitchíos orm nách gcuirfear é i bhféidhm.  Beidh tuairim is £1 le díol ar son gach páiste atá sna scoileanna so.  Iocfar an méid sin idir an Rialtas agus na Búird Sláinte Puiblí.  Dá dtabharfadh an tAire 15/- de'n mhéid sin, is dó liom go mbeadh na Búird sásta an tAcht do chur i bhféidhm.  Ach má tá sé ortha 10/- an duine d'íoc, ní bheidh mórán brí san Acht sna háiteanna in a bhfuil gá leis.  I gContae na Gaillimhe, i dTír Chonaill agus i gContae Mhuigheo, tá geurghá <Col N="1058" /> leis agus i gContae Chiarruighe, b'fhéidir, fosta, ach má cuirtear mórán airgid ar na rátaí tá faitchíos orm nách dtiocfaidh mórán maitheasa as an mBille.</P>

Tá siad ag fanúint anois le hocht mbliana agus is anois atá an Bille seo á thabhairt isteach.  Ar nós an Bhille eile, is dócha go bhfuil an tAire ag súil le baochas on Tigh de bharr an Bhille seo.

      <P>B'fhéidir go bhfuil daoine annso nár thuig mé ar dtuis.  As I was saying, it is full time this Bill was brought in.  When Roger Casement started a fund to feed the starving children of the Gaeltacht he did a work that we thought would be continued in the Gaeltacht when an Irish Government came into power.  An Irish Government has been in power now since 1922 until this day, and no action was taken by them for the betterment of the people of the Gaeltacht until they brought in this Bill and the Gaeltacht Housing Bill.  I had an experience of the Gaeltacht before Roger Casement came there.  I remember the time when we distributed a fund for feeding the children attending the schools there.  I saw the children coming to school in the Gaeltacht, and I know that they go there even to-day without their breakfasts, and I think it is past time that the Government should have brought in a measure of this kind to give a free lunch to the children in the Gaeltacht.  This thing should <Col N="1060" /> have been done years ago.  For that reason I do not like to hear the Minister saying that it is very hard to please Deputy Tubridy.  It would be hard to please me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will change off the Irish version now.  The Roger Casement Fund for the feeding of school children in the Gaeltacht was finished some years ago, about 1921 or 1922.  We expected that the home Government would at that time have given some concessions and continued this work that was carried on at that time by the Roger Casement Fund and by a number of charitable people &mdash; charitable Quakers and other people in England &mdash; to feed the children in the Gaeltacht, the Gaeltacht where they had their reserve of the Irish language, the place where the language was to be preserved and from which it was to spread to the rest of Ireland.  The children in that area were fed by the Roger Casement Fund.  This fund was subscribed by his people and by subscriptions got by Roger Casement at that time.  This fund was originated by Roger Casement. We do not know yet what happened that fund.  For some time it was utilised for the purpose of feeding school children in the Gaeltacht. For years that work has been neglected by the present Government. We have been pressing them on the matter.  The Cumann Cosanta na Gaeltachta has been pressing on the present Ministry for years past to continue this work.  Up to this day eight years have elapsed before this Bill has been brought in.  At last they have brought in this Bill which allows the local county council to strike a rate of a certain minimum amount which, I take it, will be supplemented by a grant of a certain amount by the Government.  Now the Gaeltacht has been so long neglected&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wish to mention that if the people of the Gaeltacht were so poor that there had to be a special Housing Bill and a special Bill to feed the children going to school, if they were so poor that both these Bills had to be brought in here, one would have thought that when it came to a question of giving free lunches to the very poorest of the children in the Gaeltacht that the ratepayers in the different portions of the Gaeltacht should not be asked to contribute.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I have over-stressed the point.  The people of the Gaeltacht are not at all thankful to the Government for this Bill, which is entirely inadequate.  Some measure dealing with this matter should have been brought in long ago.  We are judging it on the lines of the Gaeltacht Bill, the Bill under which they promised in one parish 400 houses and where we find now we can only get over 20.  We are very suspicious.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Tubridy</NameTxt>
      <P>All your principal supporters.  The people down there were told what was going to happen and how the money was going to be distributed; they would get forms <Col N="1062" /> to fill in their names and they would get a new house each because they supported the Government in the election.  That applied to four or five hundred people in a parish.  Now it turns out that only twenty-four or twenty-five people got houses. We are naturally suspicious and we rather expect that the same thing may happen in regard to this School Meals Bill.  I do not want to go into that much further, because the Ceann Comhairle may not like it.</P>
      <P>There are a few points I would like to mention in connection with the administration of this Bill.  I do not think the meals can be prepared without the help of the teacher.  I have had some experience of the administration of school meals already and I do not see how these things can be done without the help of the teacher.  There is no doubt that the preparation of the meals would interfere with the teaching in the schools for perhaps an hour or two each day.  I suggest that it might be possible to erect some sort of a little out-kitchen attached to each school.  If the meals must be prepared in the school it will mean that the work of the school will be upset for about two hours.  The erection of a little building such as I suggest would cost very little.  It would be erected in the very poor portion of the Gaeltacht and it would be a great advantage to have such a building attached to each school.</P>
      <P>I think that the services of some of the domestic instructresses in the Gaeltacht should be utilised for the preparation of these meals.  I know that one or two instructresses have been appointed for some years, and there are five or six others to be appointed for the Gaeltacht.  Their services could be utilised in the preparation of these meals, and the meals could be associated with cookery classes in the schools.  It is only a suggestion to the Minister, but it might result in some advantage in the preparation of meals for the poorer children in the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill even though I do not approve of the <Col N="1063" /> idea of a boundary between one part of Ireland and the other.  There are poor children in other parts of Ireland too, although they may not be able to speak the native language, and I think they should get the same consideration as, for instance, the children in the Gaeltacht.  There is one aspect of the matter which has not been touched upon.  Take the case of a poor man with four or five children.  He has a miserable pittance of about 25/- a week.  He has to buy school books for his children who are going to school.  I know of such cases, and it is really impossible for the man to purchase the school books.  There is no use in sending children to school if you cannot supply them with the material by which they can learn.  School meals are certainly essential for the poor children.  It is impossible for a teacher to impart education to children who are not at least well fed. Little children going a distance of two or three miles to school, as has been explained by Deputies from the Gaeltacht, probably on a wet day, should receive some nourishing food. I fail to see how such children could progress in their education if they are not well nourished.  They certainly ought not to be asked to cover such distances and attend school under such conditions as now exist. I am sure it is not a good thing for the teacher either.  I have no doubt at all about the teachers' co-operation in this matter. I think it is much better that this should not be made compulsory, as it would work better voluntarily.  As a representative of Labour I welcome the Bill, even though I think that it should be extended to the rest of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter what schedule was drawn up to a Bill of this kind arguments would be put forward for the inclusion of other areas.  As Deputy Doyle has pointed out, if the whole Gaeltacht were included he would want districts in Carlow and Kilkenny included, with perhaps as good a case as for putting in some part of the Gaeltacht.  As I said, there are many portions of the <Col N="1064" /> Gaeltacht where the people are, at least, as comfortable as those in the Galltacht.  It would be absurd to treat persons in the Gaeltacht more favourably than persons similarly situated in the English-speaking area. I was asked if the scheme on which the Schedule was drafted was on the basis of the proportion of Irish speakers or on the basis of poverty. The fact that it was the Gaeltacht was first taken into consideration.  In that sense Irish-speaking was involved, but after that the question of the poorest areas in the Gaeltacht was the deciding factor.  I think when he looked at the map Deputy Fahy was satisfied it showed that meals were to be provided in the poorest areas.  The Schedule was not drafted in an arbitrary manner in my Department; it was drafted by a Committee on which were represented the Department of Education, the Department of Local Government, the Department of Agriculture and my Department.  Nobody could suggest that the officials of these Departments do not know what they are talking about, as far as the Gaeltacht is concerned.  The inspectors of national schools do not merely motor along the highways where they see nothing but the bright side of things. They are going into the poorest districts, and into the types of school in which they can judge things for themselves, in the same way as inspectors from the Department of Agriculture go into the poorest areas, and similarly the inspectors from the Department of Local Government.  It was a Committee consisting of representatives of these Departments that eventually agreed on this Schedule as being the fairest all round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that there are pockets to the east of the red line on the map where you would find greater poverty than there is in some parts of the west.  No matter where you drew the line you would find the same thing.  Taking it generally, I think the line has been drawn as fairly as possible, having regard to conditions in the areas, and to the fact that we do not want to put too great a burden on the local authorities.  The Bill, of course, is <Col N="1065" /> not mandatory; we deliberately avoided making it mandatory.  I have no reason at all to fear that the boards of health and the county councils will not co-operate in the matter.  I think there will be no difficulty about that.  I prefer to give them the opportunity to do the thing voluntarily at the start rather than to make it obligatory.  If we find that there is dereliction on the part of the county councils it will then be time enough to come along and introduce a mandatory measure.  But, as a beginning, I would much prefer to show some confidence in the county councils' willingness to tax themselves to some extent for a service of this kind.</P>
    <P>As to the proportion that the Government is putting up, where you start from the position that nothing at all is being put up at present, where the present position is that it is only in urban areas there is any provision for school meals, I think we are going sufficiently far. Where half the amount is being contributed by the State, I think it is quite reasonable to expect that the local authorities should put up the other half.  I have pointed out that I thought it was better we should confine the areas as much as possible, as there is more likelihood that the county councils would co-operate when the amount involved is small.  The maximum amount all the local authorities involved can spend will be £10,000 &mdash; the same as the State contribution.  We estimate that the whole scheme will cost about £20,000, and the maximum to be contributed by the local authorities will be £10,000.  By keeping to a figure of that kind you are much more likely to get the co-operation of the local authorities than by extending it much more widely and by involving them in an expenditure of perhaps £20,000, £30,000 or £40,000. A question would arise if you were extending a measure of this kind over the Gaeltacht as a whole and the rest of the country.  Deputy Doyle suggested that it should extend over the whole country, and there is a great deal to be said for <Col N="1066" /> that.  When that kind of Bill comes along it will not be my duty to take charge of it.  Then the question of the proportion of the State contribution to the contribution of the local authorities would have to be considered, because the amount involved might be a burden that the local rates could not bear.  Deputy O'Reilly was a little mixed when speaking about the cost of administration. That is not considered in the Bill at all.  The £10,000 is intended for the cost of the food.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  There are two interpretations of that.  Section 8 says that the vocational education committee for a borough shall consist of fourteen members.  When the Bill was introduced it stated that <Col N="1068" /> eight of these should be members of the council.  The Minister has changed that to five, and that does not leave the rating authority with a majority on the committee.  The purpose of this amendment is to secure that the rating authority shall have a majority on the committee, which will, of course, draft the scheme of education for the area and more or less bind the rating authority. On reconsideration we thought it advisable to restore the eight, if the Minister would agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated my purpose on Committee.  I had a double purpose, as I said then, in proposing the change.  On the one hand, I wanted to make it more clear that the county council representatives on the vocational committee would have control of the rating; on the other hand, I wanted to give some liberty to the county council in their choice of members.  As the Bill originally stood it provided, as the Deputy has pointed out, practically for a majority from the county council on the vocational committee, but that did not give them control of the rates, and it limited them in their choice of members.  As I said, one of the most important tasks that the committee will have to do will be to draw up an educational scheme.  The county council might be very strongly of the opinion that they were not the people to do that.  Therefore, I wish to give them more freedom, and, on the other hand, I wish to give them fuller control over the rates, and that is the reason why I reduced the eight to five, but, on the other hand, gave to these five the final word in the matter as to whether or not any additional rate should be struck.  I am afraid that, to a certain extent, the Deputy's amendment would go back on the principle that we agreed to in Committee, and that is the reason why I cannot accept it.  If the House wishes it, I have no objection to accept Deputy Anthony's amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 13, before Section 25, to insert  new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Every vocational education committee shall be deemed to be a local body within the meaning of Part IV. of the Act of 1925, and that part of that Act shall apply to vocational education committees and their officers accordingly, subject to the modifications hereinafter mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Section 50 of the Act of 1925 shall not apply in respect of vocational education committees and their officers, and in lieu thereof it is hereby enacted that every sum payable under the said Part IV. of the Act of 1925 as applied by this section in respect of an allowance or gratuity granted thereunder to a person who was previously an officer of a vocational education committee shall be paid by the local authority which under this Act pays the annual local contribution to the expenses of such committee and shall be raised by means of the same rate and be paid out of the same fund and be charged on the same area as such annual local contribution is raised by means of, paid out of and charged upon, but no such sum <Col N="1071" /> shall be reckoned for the purposes of any enactment (including this Act) limiting the amount of such rate.</P>
    <P>(3)  There shall be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas to a local authority paying any allowance or gratuity in pursuance of the foregoing sub-section, in aid of the rate or fund out of which such allowance or gratuity is so paid, one-half of every payment made by such local authority in respect of such allowance or gratuity.</P>
    <P>(4)  Section 47 of the Act of 1925 as amended by Section 9 of the Act of 1927 shall not apply in respect of vocational education committees and their officers, and in lieu thereof it is hereby enacted that &mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  whenever an allowance or a gratuity is payable in pursuance of sub-section (2) of this section by a local authority (in this sub-section called the paying body) to any person under Part IV. of the Act of 1925 as applied by this section in respect of his ceasing to hold office under a vocational education committee and in ascertaining the service of such officer at the date of such cesser any service under another local authority (in this section called the contributing body) has been aggregated and reckoned, the contributing body shall refund to the paying body a part of one-half of such allowance or gratuity reckoned according to the service and pay of such officer under the contributing body and to the circumstances under which he ceased to hold office under the paying body, and such part shall be settled by agreement between the two bodies, or in default of agreement by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, and</P>
    <P>(b)  for the purposes of the foregoing paragraph an officer's <Col N="1072" /> service under a committee of a contributing body shall be deemed to have been service under such contributing body and an officer's service under a joint committee of two or more contributing bodies shall be deemed to have been service under every such contributing body.</P>
    <P>In pages 13 and 14, Section 25, to delete sub-section (1).&mdash;</P>
    <P>These amendments I propose to take together, because the second amendment proposes the deletion of the first sub-section, and the first amendment really proposes a new section instead.  This is to carry out the promise that I made in Committee, that whereas up to the present in practice the total burden of pensions was borne by the local authorities, in future the State will recoup the local authorities to the extent of 50 per cent.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9: &mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 14, to insert at the end of Section 26 a new sub-section as follows: &mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  The Minister shall not remove under this section from his office an officer of a vocational education committee unless and until he has caused a local inquiry to be held under this Act in relation to the performance by such officer of his duties as such officer and considered the report of the person who held such local inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will remember when this section was under discussion that from various parts of the House objection was raised that it gave too much power into the hands of the Minister.  Apparently without any reason or proper inquiry he was empowered to dismiss an officer without any complaint having been made and on the vague grounds that he contended he was unfit.  I promised on that occasion to bring Section 26 into harmony with Section 103.  It is now provided that such action will not be taken until an inquiry <Col N="1073" /> is held in accordance with Section 103 of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I think it was Deputy Thrift who raised the objection that Section 33 as it stands seemed to be rather lob-sided and unreasonable, on the grounds that it gave power to the committee to do in an outside area what apparently it could not do within its own area.  I was under the impression that other sections of the Bill gave power to the committee to do it, especially with regard to the provision of scholarships under Section 38 of the Bill as it stands, but in order to remove any doubt I have inserted the words the Deputy suggested.</P>

    <P>An amendment was moved by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs on the occasion of the Committee Stage reducing the minimum fee from 2d. to one penny three farthings in the case of the counties.  I pointed out I was quite willing, on the whole, with a certain amount of hesitation, to come down to one penny three farthings as the minimum rate, but that an exception had to be made in the case of one particular county, because there already a rate of 2d. is being struck for the purposes covered by this Bill.  This amendment and the corresponding necessary changes in the Schedule, namely, amendment 28, are in consequence of a promise I then made.

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Anthony I move amendment 13: &mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 21, Section 50 (4) (b), after the words &ldquo;(Ireland) Act, 1878,&rdquo; line 60, to insert the words &ldquo;and may where it thinks proper borrow money for the purposes of making a grant under this section from the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland and these Commissioners may, if they think fit, lend such money to such council under the Public Works (Ireland) Acts, 1831 to 1866, and notwithstanding anything in those Acts such loan may be made for such term as the Commissioners think fit.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the amendment is to secure that a rating authority which borrows money to provide buildings for its vocational education committee may be empowered to borrow on terms equally as good as those given to the vocational education committee itself.  As the Bill stands the rating authority is empowered to raise only what must <Col N="1075" /> be a short term loan with annual repayments.  As it stands the Bill discourages the rating authority from borrowing as the money may be raised on better terms by the vocational education committee.</P>

      <P>Deputy Anthony suffers from a certain lack of vision in these things.  He only sees the City of Cork.  This is the second time he has forgotten that there are counties in Ireland as well as the City of Cork.  I must confess there is not as much likelihood of this happening in the case of the counties as in the case of the county boroughs.  However, I am quite willing to accept the principle with a slight change in the drafting, and as this is the Report Stage I have redrafted the amendment.  My amendment will solve the difficulties and it is as follows: &mdash;</P>
      <P>13a. In page 21, to insert at the end of Section 50 a new sub-section as follows: &mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)  A rating authority borrowing money for the purposes of making a grant under this section may where it so thinks proper borrow such money from the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland and those Commissioners may, if they think fit, lend such money to such rating authority under the Public Works (Ireland) Acts, 1831 to 1866, and notwithstanding anything in those Acts such loan may be made for such term as the Commissioners think fit.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That meets the Deputy fully.  It is only a mere question of a slight change in the drafting.  I am not quite sure whether the amendment is necessary or whether under the existing law the commissioners of public works would not have power to lend to a rating authority.  They would not have power to lend to a vocational committee without special provision, but it is probable that under the existing law they have such powers.  However, to put the matter beyond all doubt, I am quite <Col N="1076" /> willing to accept the amendment in the form I have indicated.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14: &mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 21, to add at the end of Section 50 a new sub-section as follows: &mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)  Whenever a rating authority which has borrowed money for the purpose of making a grant under this section pays any sum in repayment of the money so borrowed or in payment of the interest thereon, the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, make to such rating authority in aid of the rate or fund out of which such sum was so paid by such rating authority a payment of such amount as the Minister with the consent aforesaid shall think proper but not exceeding one-half of the said sum so paid by such rating authority.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a point which was raised by a few Deputies on the Committee Stage.  At that time I expressed the view that I thought that the provision under Section 60 of extra grants by the local authorities was a pious hope and aspiration expressed in the Bill, but I gather that is not so, that it is not merely an indication to the councils of what we would like them to do, but that there is a possibility of this section being made use of, especially in the case of some of the county boroughs and some of the urban districts.  Accordingly, I am moving that the Minister will have power, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to make grants to the local authorities to help them to repay portion of the loan if the local authorities make additional grants of this kind for the purposes of this Bill.</P>

    <P>I think Deputy Goulding, amongst others, expressed some anxiety as to the effect of sub-section (6).  It was really unnecessary in the Bill.  It <Col N="1078" /> did apparently give rise to a certain amount of anxiety because bodies representing officers who would be affected have made the same point to me that Deputy Goulding made. I thought and the draftsman agreed the best way to meet the situation was to propose the deletion of sub-section (6).  In that case the position of the officer is fully safeguarded by the Local Government Act of 1925, which says that the officer can count his service under various local bodies and not merely under one.  It is really to meet a point made in Committee that this amendment is introduced.</P>

It includes people who at the moment hold their positions on possibly the condition of a weekly or monthly notice, and brings them into the same lines, so far as tenure of office and rights are concerned, with those who have certain statutory rights and whose position is more definitely certain, namely, the officers.

      <P>I would like to support the amendment.  In the Committee Stage I pressed the Minister to introduce an amendment of this kind himself.  Since then very strong representations have reached the Minister, I believe, and there is no doubt that there is very considerable local feeling on this matter. There would be no great sacrifice of principle.  I suggest to the Minister that he is going to lose a great deal of concentrated enthusiasm by the abolition of the present North Wicklow Technical Education Committee. There is no town in which public men have given more of their time to developing an interest in technical education and there are very few towns where there has been more success attending these efforts.  If the town of Bray is now merged in the county it means that a great deal of that enthusiasm will be lost, since the town will be only entitled to two representatives on the county committee and it will inevitably result in a decline of interest in the classes.  I hope the Minister will be able to make a favourable statement on the subject.</P>

      <P>I suppose this would be <Col N="1082" /> an appropriate place in which to refer to other towns as well as Bray, merely to elicit information from the Minister.  I noticed a letter in the Press the other day from the Tralee Technical Committee in which they stated that when amalgamated with the county council their income would be £450 plus £450, pound for pound grant from the Government, or £900 in all, and that their present income is £4,000.  If that is true, of course, Tralee technical education would be very hard hit and as Bray seems to be in much the same position and desires to get on the First Schedule the Minister may discuss the two points together and give us some information upon them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the last point that has been raised, I have some slight knowledge of the Tralee situation.  The Tralee argument was not quite as stated by the Deputy but was somewhat like this.  They fear that owing to the finances of the Bill they would be forced into an amalgamation with the county.  As the Deputy indicated, they pointed out that at present they have an income of £4,000, that in future they could only raise so much from the rates and only get so much from the Government.  They pointed out that with the amount made available in that way they could not run the school and therefore would be forced into amalgamation.  It is possible that what I said on the Second Reading of the Bill and also on the Committee Stage was not fully reported.  I cannot say that because I do not read my speeches in the papers.  Anyhow there are no grounds for that fear.  If we schedule an area here it is not to buoy up a committee with the hope that they are going to continue in existence and then when we get the opportunity to wipe the committee out of existence.  Of course, there would be no such intention.  I think I indicated pretty clearly on the occasion on which we discussed the Bill before that it was not proposed to interfere with the present grants <Col N="1083" /> and that the 50-50 proposition did not apply to present grants. That apparently was not noticed by those who expressed fears in the case of the Tralee scheme.  On the Committee Stage Deputy Fahy utilised another amendment and section to extract information from me and I then indicated that the 50-50 would apply to future improvements, but that, in addition, there would be a number of smaller schemes in which it might be necessary to give more owing to the fact that a penny rate produced so very little.  A number of urban schemes such as Cork, Limerick and others might require more than 50-50, but Dublin would not.  There are, therefore, no grounds for the fears expressed in the case of Tralee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want, however, to make myself quite clear on this.  I am not quite sure &mdash; Deputy Doyle, of course, is only deputising for another member at the moment &mdash; that Bray wants an amendment such as this, because Deputy Moore made it quite clear in his speech &mdash; at least, there was the hint in his speech &mdash; that he wanted something different.  To schedule the urban district of Bray would undoubtedly be in keeping with the general provisions of the Bill, with the general plan of the Bill.  I might consider that if the Bray authorities put it up to me as to how far they could be met in that particular case. But this amendment is a different thing altogether from the present Bray scheme, and from the Tipperary scheme, where you have an urban authority forming the nucleus of a district which does not belong to the urban area.  That is a difficulty which cuts across the whole rating principle of the Bill.  You are putting Bray under an urban scheme with portion of the county rate.  That is my difficulty.  We could have set out to draft the whole Bill on these principles.  We might have made a city like Drogheda or Dundalk the centre of a scheme of that kind.  It could have been done, but the whole Bill was drafted on entirely different <Col N="1084" /> lines.  That is why it is found difficult to accede to the request of the Bray Committee, but if Deputy Doyle, who has spoken for Deputy Everett, or Deputy Moore, or the Bray people, think that to some extent their wishes could be met by scheduling Bray Urban District, I would be willing to consider that. They cannot get a rate from the county.  There might be some diminution of the actual grants they get.</P>
    <P>They will probably read what I am saying, and if that would in any way meet their wishes I will indicate that to them.  It might be possible in the Seanad to get an amendment of this kind inserted, but I wonder whether it is really worth it.  Blackrock and Dún Laoghaire, assuming the Greater Dublin Bill passes, will be amalgamated, but if you compare Bray with some of the other places, such as we have scheduled here, the case is not by any means as strong for Bray from the point of view of technical education, as some of the other smaller places that appear in this schedule.  There is a case in Bray for continuation education, but, if so, that is no barrier to their being absorbed into the general Wicklow scheme.  I ask Deputies to consider the general effect on County Wicklow as a whole.  It is not a big county and not thickly populated, and it is possible to run a combined scheme for the whole county, including Bray.  We find no difficulty in that way in Cork where we are absorbing Cobh into the whole scheme for the County of Cork, but if Bray puts up a case for being scheduled as an urban district, while I do not promise that I will accede to their wishes, I will certainly consider them.  I will write to them to that effect.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he will state if he has in his Department a list of subscribers to the Dáil Eireann (Internal) Loan (1919-20), from the Hospital, Co. Limerick district; if the name of Mrs. Margaret Power, Main Street, appears thereon; and, if so, will he state the reason why payment is withheld from this subscriber.</P>

      <P>The name of Mrs. Margaret Power does not appear in the lists of subscribers to the Dáil Eireann (Internal) Loan, 1919/20, in the Hospital, County Limerick, district, which have been received in my Department.</P>
      <P>One of the lists, however, contains particulars of a subscription by a Mr. Thomas Power, now deceased, and an application for repayment in respect thereof has been received from a Mrs. Margaret Power, of Hospital.  Particulars of this subscription were not furnished to the Dáil Department of Finance during the period in which the loan was raised and it does not therefore appear in the primary register of subscribers. The application referred to is at present under consideration and I hope to be in a position to arrive at a decision thereon at an early date.</P>
