      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries if it is intended to take over the Going Estate, Ballyphilip, County Tipperary, which is now in the possession of Mrs. Hughes, who also owns a large farm in the County Wicklow; if he is aware that there is not one acre of the Ballyphilip Estate under tillage at present; and if so, if he will state when the Land Commission intends to take over this estate for distribution amongst the small holders of the district and to relieve the distress that prevails at present in the locality.</P>

      <P>The Land Commission acquired from Mr. E.A. Hughes some 190 acres of the lands of Ballyphilip, Earlshill and Killeheen, which have been divided.  The circumstances of the remaining lands <Col N="1228" /> of the owner have been fully considered by them in court, and having heard counsel on behalf of the objector, Mr. Hughes, and the evidence produced, judgment was given allowing the objection.  Since then Mr. Hughes has died, and in the altered circumstances the matter is being further considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing the Budget which was submitted to the House yesterday, may I say at once that it reminded me of nothing so much as of a ragman's bag, a collection of odds and ends, yielding to the taxpayers neither pleasure nor profit?  It is a Budget of impotence and despair, and the only message it <Col N="1229" /> conveyed to the harassed people of the country was an admonition to abandon hope.  We may not hope, said the Minister for Finance, for any remission of taxation in the near future nor for any improvement in the social services nor for any economy in public administration nor even, after this year, to balance the Budget without recourse to fresh taxation.  After such a recital, people may well ask what have they to hope for from this Government. The price of butter may go down, farmers may be beggared and impoverished, but the giddy whirl of Governmental extravagance must go on and taxation, so long as the Minister remains in office, remain at its present high level.  The Minister's speech was a confession, not only of material, but of mental and moral poverty.  As previously, the Minister refused to face up to the facts and to set them plainly and truthfully before the people.  As previously, we were told &ldquo;that there is no longer any sign of shrinkage in the revenue,&rdquo; when, in fact, the yield from taxes on incomes and profits, from customs and excise and from stamp duties, exhibits in each case a decline from last year's figures&mdash;and the yield from these taxes represents 90 per cent. of our normal tax revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only main heads of tax which returned an increased yield were the death duties and the motor vehicle duties, accounting last year for 5.73 per cent. and 4.12 per cent. of the tax revenue respectively.  The Minister pins his faith and his hope of balancing the Budget on these two taxes.  But the death duties are too uncertain and too fortuitous in their return to justify the hope that in future they will make good the deficiencies of the other taxes.  Thus, while in 1923-4 they yielded £996,000, in 1924-5 they only yielded £787,000. In 1925-26 the yield rose to £1,022,000, but in 1926-27 it fell to £952,000 rising again in 1927-28 to £1,285,000, only to fall once more in 1928-29 to £1,044,000.  Last year the yield rose to £1,180,000.  It is reasonable to assume that next year, as in previous years, a decrease will follow <Col N="1230" /> an increase, and the yield in this particular tax manifest a decline.  That, however, is not the view of the Minister.  Just as his colleague, the Minister for Justice, takes his stand against the laws of the State and procures men to commit crime, so does the Minister for Finance defy the law of probability and budgets next year for a second successive increase in the death duties, a phenomenon which he has not experienced since he first became responsible for the finances of this State.  Two years ago the Minister's Budget was saved from disaster by an epidemic of sickness and disease. Next year his hope of salvation is reposed in the Angel of Death.  What a ghoulish Minister!</P>
    <P>Again, the Minister refers to an increased yield from the motor vehicle duties and offers it as compensation for the decrease in income tax and in the customs and excise. But the proceeds from these duties are ear-marked for the Road Fund, and are not available to meet other expenditure.  They must, therefore, be eliminated altogether when considering the prospects of future revenue.  We are now in this position, that last year the yield from the principal taxes, the taxes which furnished, as I have said, over 90 per cent. of the normal tax revenue, manifested a decline.  The sole remaining source of revenue available to meet general expenditure gave an increased return last year and is, therefore, most unlikely to produce a further increase next year.  Even if this unlikely event were to happen, that particular tax would not account for more than 6 per cent. of the revenue.  Notwithstanding that the Minister, with these facts before him and familiar to him, declares that there is no longer any sign of shrinkage in the revenue.  A Minister, who makes that statement in face of the facts which I have recited, is fooling the people, is false to the people, unworthy of their trust and unworthy of his office.  He is here as custodian of public finances.  He is here to present them truly to the House and to the people.  He is not here to mislead the people by false <Col N="1231" /> hopes, but to make them aware of the position in order that they may make such efforts as will be necessary to redress it.</P>
    <P>Now, let us consider the Minister's account of the public debt.  He fixes the total figure for this at about £20,250,000 after including a liability of £5,000,000 to the British Government and allowing for certain Exchequer assets.  Is that a true statement of the position?  Are the Exchequer assets taken at their real value?  What is the present value, for instance, of the £5,496,000 expended on the development of the Shannon or the £957,000 supplied to the Electricity Supply Board?  I am not criticising that expenditure.  I am not criticising the proposal to develop the Shannon.  I have no doubt it will be successful, but that success has not yet been attained, and however hopeful we may be, from the very nature of things, may never be attained.  If these advances are to be credited as assets, they must be taken into account at their present value, at their value at this moment when the prospect of repayment is still more or less uncertain, and not at their value at that indefinite future date when their full recovery is assured.  The same criticism may be offered in regard to the advance for the purchase of creameries.</P>
    <P>I notice an item for £100,000 advanced to the National City Bank in connection with guaranteed loans. That advance is to be repaid, and it is typical of the Minister's financial methods that while in the early part of his statement it is treated as a capital asset, we find that later on he proposes to utilise it to defray current expenditure of the kind which he himself admits is not abnormal and therefore should not be met by borrowing nor by the realisation of assets.  But apart from this, it is to be noted that the Minister in his statement makes no note of the contingent liabilities which the State has contracted in respect of these loans.  I do not question the wisdom of the loans nor the amount nor any single circumstance <Col N="1232" /> in relation to them, but I do say that since the amount of the loans and the probable real liability in respect of every one of them is fairly well known, it is wrong not to include this item among the State liabilities.</P>
    <P>There is one other item which the Minister, I presume, has credited as an Exchequer asset and that is the investment in the Industrial Trust Company of Ireland.  What is the present value of the shares in that concern and is the Minister satisfied with the purposes to which the capital which he has subscribed has been devoted?  I understand that the Minister is strongly represented on the board of the company, and I should like him when replying to give some information as to the present value of this investment.  There are rumours in circulation in regard to it, and I think it would be well either to set the public mind at ease or let them know the worst in regard to this particular project.</P>
    <P>The points to which I have referred are comparatively unimportant when we remember that the Minister's statement discloses only about one-sixth of the public liability, or rather I should say about one-seventh.  What is the use of talking about a public debt of only twenty millions when the Minister has not taken into account his commitments in respect of land annuities, R.I.C. pensions, civil pensions, compensation allowances, pensions to ex-British Judges, pensions to resigned and dismissed R.I.C. men and local loans?  Are these liabilities or are they not?  Are they an obligation upon the people and upon this State?  Are they to be met by the Exchequer of this State?  Do they not recur year after year?  Will not some of them continue to recur for over thirty years?  Can the Minister get up and say that the land annuities, as he at present accepts liability for them, are not part of the public debt of the State, rightly or wrongfully, under his regime?  In my opinion, our present liabilities in respect of these items should be capitalised at not less than £130,000,000, of which land annuities would represent about £116,000,000 <Col N="1233" /> and R.I.C. pensions about £9,000,000. It is those concealed items, those items upon which the Minister does not dwell, those items to which he does not call public attention, which make the truer presentation of our economic position, and it is the annual charge in respect of these items which is crippling our people.</P>
    <P>We paid last year for the services of what the Minister describes as the public debt a sum of £1,708,000, but practically the whole of that amount was paid to the inhabitants of this country! It was distributed here and went to finance industry and to maintain our people.  But, in respect of the land annuities, local loans, and damage to property annuities, R.I.C. pensions, and other items we paid last year to Great Britain no less a sum than £5,365,000.  Of that sum only about £1,200,000 in respect of dividends on land stock and £960,000 by way of pensions to ex-R.I.C. men resident in this country found its way back here.  The balance of £3,200,000 was permanently withdrawn.  I wish to make it clear that I feel that these two items&mdash;the dividends on the land stock and the pensions to ex-R.I.C. men resident in this country&mdash;would probably have accrued to us in any case, and that, therefore, the direct burden upon our people represented by the payments to Great Britain to which I have referred is not less than the total sum of £5,365,000.</P>
    <P>But apart from this aspect of it, the transaction is one which represents in the present circumstances a net withdrawal from this country of gold, or the equivalent of gold, to the value of over £3,200,000, and is, therefore, accompanied by an increase in the cost of money and a restriction in the volume of credit, and all the handicaps and burdens which those two factors impose upon industry and enterprise.  So long as these payments continue there is no hope of an economic recovery in this country; no hope that we shall be able to maintain our social services even on their present standards. I think that that, from the point of view of the future of our country and of our people, is a significant <Col N="1234" /> and vital factor in this whole ultimate financial settlement. The fact is that if it continues, and if we are under it to have to find this £5,300,000 annually, we shall not be able to maintain here the same conditions of life that people enjoy in neighbouring and even in more distant countries.  I think that that would be disastrous.</P>
    <P>Our people are hardy and enterprising and courageous.  They will not be content with poverty and misery in their own country while they may win comfort and affluence elsewhere.  They assuredly will be called, as millions of our race have been called, to those other lands where their qualities will ensure them an adequate livelihood.  The best of them will go, and we shall be left with a race not only decreasing in number but deteriorating in quality. Whatever may be the cost, we shall have to strive to make life in this country at least as attractive for our youth as it is in other countries.  I think that that must be one of the guiding principles of those who have the direction of this State, of those who have the government of our people; that life here must be made as attractive for our young people as it is in other countries.  That may be very difficult, but it is the burden which their obligation to our race imposes upon our elder generation.  To shirk that burden would be to commit race-suicide. And if that burden cannot be shouldered and those obligations fulfilled so long as the Ultimate Financial Settlement stands, then the Ultimate Financial Settlement must go.</P>
    <P>The Minister is as well aware of the realities of this position as we are.  He knows how this agreement is crippling our people, how, so long as it stands, there is no hope of a revival, and yet, instead of coming out boldly and telling the truth to them, at whatever the cost to him or his associates in the Government. he prefers to mislead them and to lull them by presenting an entirely fallacious account of the public debt. As I said, the Minister's speech was a confession, not only of material, but of mental and moral poverty.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1235" /> Yesterday, I described the Minister's speech as a defence of squandermania, because a large part of it was devoted to justifying an estimated expenditure of £26,002,000 upon various services.  Of this amount no less than £16,180,000 was earmarked for services which the Minister described as unavoidable. Let us consider three of them only: superannuation, accounting for £2,065,000; the Army, accounting for over £1,500,000; and police and prisons accounting for over £1,800,000.  Of that £2,065,000 spent on superannuation, no less than £1,170,000 is paid to Great Britain in respect of pensions to the ex-R.I.C. That expenditure admittedly is unavoidable, but only unavoidable so long as the present Government remains in office.  But if there were another Government in power which would question those payments and show, as it can be shown, that they are not obligatory even under the Treaty, there would be an immediate reduction in this item of expenditure, which the Minister classified as unavoidable, of £1,170,000.  Similarly in regard to the Army, which costs £1,574,000, the Minister yesterday pleaded that this expenditure cannot be reduced until the possibility of internal armed attack on the State has disappeared.  Quite so.  So long as the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Justice, spends public money fomenting disorder and goading men to violence, the Army must be there to suppress the results of that vile policy.  But, suppose the Minister for Justice were to be swept away, back among the debris of the Law Courts from which he never should have emerged, and suppose the Minister for Finance and this Government gave place to another, which secured a revision of the Constitution, so that all sections of the people might avail of it to secure by peaceful means their political aims, then all possibility of internal armed attack, which I do not believe exists, but which the Minister makes his excuse, would have disappeared and a reduction in the cost of the Army by about half a million pounds would <Col N="1236" /> be made possible.</P>
    <P>The same can be said of the police and prisons.  If there were another Minister than the present Minister for Justice, and another Government in office, the cost of police and prisons could be reduced by at least £300,000.  So that when the Minister states that expenditure upon these services is unavoidable and must be maintained at its present level, and continue to absorb over £5,500,000, what he really means is that so long as he is there the expenditure of that amount is unavoidable.  But displace him and his Government, and at once it will be possible to reduce the expenditure under these heads by not less than £1,970,000, which would become at once available for the relief of taxation, or the extension of those social services of which the Minister despairs.  Furthermore, I feel if the reorganisation of the present administrative services were seriously undertaken, it would be possible to save at least another £300,000 without diminishing the efficiency of those services or the benefits which people derive from them.  If, therefore, there is to be no retrenchment in Government Departments next year, it is not because savings are not possible, but because the Minister refuses to make them. Similarly, if there is to be no relief to the taxpayer, it is because the Minister will not do those things which would enable him to grant those reliefs.  In both cases, it is not lack of power nor of opportunity but of will which is at fault.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech yesterday the Minister, in dealing with the question of allowances to smaller income taxpayers, stated that to grant the relief asked for would increase the burden of taxation on the poor for the benefit of those who had the good fortune to be income taxpayers. Coming from the Minister, that remark makes it opportune to consider the taxation policy which the Minister has pursued since 1923-24. According to the last available report of the Revenue Commissioners 1,500 persons share between them seven and a half millions of the aggregate of individual incomes in this community, <Col N="1237" /> which I put at, say, £158,000,000.  About another 63,500 persons take £58,822,000.  And there is left £91,967,000 to be divided amongst 1,242,662 other persons gainfully occupied in this country.  There is, therefore, to be devoted to the support of 7,500 persons, say, £7,500,000, or £1,000 each; to 317,500 persons the sum of £58,822, or £185 each, and to 2,647,000 persons the sum of £91,967,000, or £34.36 each.</P>
    <P>If we take as a family unit a household consisting of two adults and three children, the families of the twenty-six counties may be ranged in three classes:&mdash;(a) families with average incomes of £5,000 per annum; (b) families with average incomes of £926 per annum, and (c) families with incomes of £172 per annum.  It will be noted that over 89 per cent. of our people are included in the last category.  It will not seriously affect the comparison if, for its purpose, we take families with average incomes of £5,000, £1,000 and £150, respectively, and see how the Minister for Finance has dealt with these since he came into office in 1923-24.  We shall take the poorest family first.  In 1923-24, the average amount of taxation paid by a family with an income ranging from £150 to £350 was £26 6s. 3d. per annum.  In 1924-25, this amount had fallen to £24 14s. 3d., and in 1925-26 it had been still further reduced to £21 18s. 10d.  In 1926-27, the tide turned, however, and the taxation imposed upon such families began to increase, reaching £23 Os. 7d. in that year; £23 12s. 9d. in 1927-28, and £23 14s. 7d. in 1928-29.  So much for our poorest families.</P>
    <P>Let us now consider an average middle class family with an income of £1,000.  In 1923-24, that family paid £148 4s. 8d. in direct and indirect taxation.  It was decreased to £146 12s. 8d. in 1924-25, and to £119 17s. 5d. in 1925-26.  It rose slightly in 1926-27 to £120 19s. 2d., but in the next year (1927-28) it fell to £97 11s. 2d., rising a little to £97 13s. in 1928-29.</P>
    <P>We now come to consider the spoiled darlings of the Minister's <Col N="1238" /> heart.  In 1923-24, the fortunate person who enjoys an income of £5,000 paid in direct and indirect taxation, full allowance being made for estate, legacy and succession duties, £1,558.  In 1924-25, the burden was slightly reduced to £1,556, and again in 1925-26 to £1,528.  But in 1926-27, the Minister began to be really moved, and, full of compassion for this hapless individual, he reduced his burden to £1,217, and in 1927-28 he reduced it still further to £996, at which it remained in 1928-29.</P>
    <P>Let us look at it in another way. In 1925-26 the amount of taxation paid by a family with an income of £150 was £21 18s. 10d., but in 1928-29 the taxation of that family had risen to £23 14s. 7d.&mdash;that is, it was increased by about 7.5 per cent. The £1,000 family in 1925 paid £119 17s. 5d. in taxation, and in 1928-29 this had fallen to £97 13s., or a decrease in the burden of about 18.5 per cent.  In 1925-26, the five-thousand-pounder paid £1,528 in taxation, and got off in 1928-29 with £995, or a decrease in his burden of 34.8 per cent.  A gentleman with £3,000 was even luckier, because while in 1923-24 he would have been paying at the rate of £726 per annum, in 1928-29 he would have paid at the rate of £351, a reduction in his case of 51.65 per cent.  We can see, therefore, that from the family with an income of £150 per annum the Minister for Finance took £1 15s. 9d. more in 1928-29 than he did in 1925-26, but from the family with an income of £5,000 he took £533 less than in 1925-26.  It is, therefore, not unjust to say that the whole trend of the Minister's taxation policy has been to make the poor poorer and the rich richer.  There have been admirable ruffians in history who have been loved and remembered because they robbed the rich in order that they might relieve the poor.  But the Minister will go down to posterity as the Minister who plundered the poor in order that he might relieve the rich.  It is clear that before a taxpayer may hope for any sympathy from the Minister he must possess an income of at least <Col N="1239" /> £1,000.  If he should be in that fortunate position and come pleading, as he did come pleading in 1926-27 and 1927-28, to the Minister for a remission of taxation, the Minister will weep golden tears on his behalf. If he be a farmer pleading for derating, or if he be an old age pensioner asking for restoration of the conditions which prevailed here in 1922-23; if he be a shop-keeper asking for relief of his rates, or a land annuitant asking for time to pay, the Minister tells him the State cannot afford it, that there can be no extension of the social services, that, as a matter of fact, we are scarcely able to pay our way without imposing further taxation.  He hardens his heart, closes his pockets, and lets the poor of this country starve or emigrate as they may.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. Shaw Mr. Shaw">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shaw</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is to be congratulated on the Budget for many reasons, but firstly because, after all the gloomy predictions we heard, there is to be no increase in taxation.  While we might all like or appreciate a reduction, it is pretty evident from the figures that on this particular occasion such a thing could not occur.  In the second place, there have been no surprises or stunts of any kind that would interfere with business development.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the tax that the Minister imposed on what are known as travelling motor shops.  This tax will go a long way to save the smaller towns from extinction, because I am personally aware of the grave injury that has been caused by the unfair competition of these people who pay no rates, rents or taxes and give no employment.  They come in there and sell their goods and take away the money to some other place.  It has been certainly unfair, and I am very pleased that the Minister has partially met the matter.  I do not agree that £10 is enough, and I hope to see the amount increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's announcement in connection with simplifying the income tax code is very welcome.  He stated that it should be possible to have a Bill for the simplification of <Col N="1240" /> the income tax code prepared and passed by the Dáil before the next Budget.  I believe that any such Bill will certainly have a speedy passage through this House and be highly appreciated throughout the country, because the present forms are very complicated, and there are very few persons, no matter how intelligent they may be, who are able to fill them up.  I know very many cases in which they have not been filled up simply because the people did not understand them.  A great many persons are penalised not for any fault of their own, but through the very great difficulty experienced in filling them properly.  I certainly hope that the Committee will bring to this House as soon as possible this simplified code.  The country will appreciate it, and the Dáil will lose no time in passing it.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister did not make any allusion yesterday to the removal of the betting tax on race-courses.  The Betting Committee made a unanimous recommendation to this effect, and now that the Tote is in operation and the Minister will obtain a very large revenue from it, I hope he will see his way speedily to remove this tax, which is undoubtedly causing grave injury to racing in Ireland.  The Tote or PariMutuel was in operation last week at Fairyhouse.  There was over £10,000 invested, and the Minister obtained in revenue £250, as he received 2½ per cent. on the turnover; as there was £10,000 invested at Punchestown he backed a winner there for a similar amount and got £250 more. I would like to ask the Minister also when it is his intention to introduce the Betting Bill, because there are many matters of importance on which the Committee made recommendations. I hope there will not be much delay with regard to that.</P>
    <P>As a director of the Irish Tourist Development Association, I regret very much the remarks which Deputy Lemass made here yesterday with regard to attracting or bringing into the country wealthy people who have money to spend.  The Irish Tourist Development Association are doing everything in their power to <Col N="1241" /> attract those people here and this would bring about a large circulation of money and much-needed employment.</P>

      <P>There are two such people there, the Earl of Longford and the Earl of Granard, and they are giving enormous employment. In fact, in the areas where they reside there are no idle persons, and, in addition to that, they give huge sums to every possible kind of charity.  I am very sorry those remarks were made and I do not think that there are very many people who will agree with them.  I consider that the country is well satisfied with the Budget, because we all thought there must be an increase in taxation.  It is perfectly apparent that we have reached the stage now when the position is stabilised, and in the future we certainly can look forward to a considerable reduction. This will give people who want to develop their business and invest money in this country the courage to do so.  I repeat that the country is well satisfied with the Budget which the Minister introduced yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is desirable that I should make it quite clear that I have no objection to millionaires coming into the country, but I do object <Col N="1242" /> to attractions being held out to them for which the poor working men of Dublin have to pay.  The speech which the Minister made yesterday in relation to the proposal to give allowances to the smaller income taxpayers with families was to the effect that he could not see his way to do so because if he did he would lessen the attraction to his titled friends in England to establish their residences here.  I do not want to say anything against Lord Longford or the Earl of Granard, or any other similar individual in the country, but I say the first concerns of this Dáil should be to protect the interests and preserve the happiness of the men who build up the wealth of the country, and they are not dukes, earls or millionaires. They are plain, good, honest-to-God working men whose interests were neglected when this Budget was being framed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount required to put into operation the scheme of allowances devised by the Departmental Committee was £100,000, according to the Minister for Finance.  The yield of income tax last year worked out, I think, at almost £100,000 per penny in the standard rate.  It does not seem to me an extravagant suggestion that the inducement of 1/6 in the £ which these millionaires and lords in England have at present to establish their residences here will not become inoperative if the inducement is reduced to 1/5.  Yet for the additional £100,000 we could give reliefs that have been long promised, and in fact long overdue, to one of the most important classes in the State.  Although we have a standard rate of 3/- in the £ here, in comparison with a standard rate of 4/6 in Britain, the fact is that a man with a family with an income of less than £1,000&mdash;certainly less than £500&mdash;has to pay more in this country than a man in a similar position in England.  The interesting speech which we have just heard from Deputy MacEntee confirms the statement I made yesterday, that the whole tendency of Government policy during the past six years has <Col N="1243" /> been to transfer the weight of the burden of taxation from the shoulders of the rich to the shoulders of the poor.  It is the poor who pay the greater part of the indirect taxation.  It is the rich who pay the greater part of the direct taxation.</P>
    <P>If any Deputy chooses to work out the percentages in each year since Mr. Blythe became Minister for Finance, he will find that the percentage of direct taxation has been diminishing and the percentage of indirect taxation has been growing. In other words, the amount which the poor are asked to contribute to the maintenance of the State has been increased, whilst the amount which the rich are forced to give has been considerably reduced.  That may be good policy from the point of view of the Tourist Development Association, but I doubt it.  It certainly is not good policy from the point of view of the Irish people. Any Government that was anxious to preserve conditions in this country as they should be for the great bulk of the people, and not quite so much concerned about dukes and Iords as Deputy Shaw and the Minister for Finance are, would, I think, have tended to move in the opposite direction.  There was not merely a general hope but a general expectation that in the Budget statement of this year the allowances recommended by the Departmental Committee would have been given.  All the political correspondents of the newspapers for the past week have been foretelling that these concessions were to be given.  I am quite certain that the majority of the members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party anticipated that they would have been given and are just as disappointed as we are at the barren nature of the Minister's statement.</P>
    <P>The only tax remission that has been given is the one on champagne. This Budget should go down to history under the title of the Champagne Budget.  The Minister's only concern was to reduce the cost of the banquets which he and his colleagues give to the lords and the earls or other distinguished foreign visitors <Col N="1244" /> who occasionally come to our shores. I do not say that these distinguished foreign visitors should not be properly entertained, but I do say that the reduction in the cost of their entertainment is a much less important matter than the granting of concessions to the small taxpayers with large families.</P>
    <P>The Budget statement which the Minister made was, as Deputy O'Connell described it, an indication that the Minister's stock of ideas has become exhausted.  He was apparently quite satisfied when he found that the revenue from existing taxation would be adequate to meet the slightly increased bill for Government services.  It did not worry him in the least that the great problems which we discussed here on this resolution last year&mdash;the problem of inadequate housing, the problem of unemployment, the problem of emigration, the problem of trade depression&mdash;are as serious, or more serious, than they were twelve months ago.  That was only a matter of detail.  The Minister was satisfied so long as the Budget could be made to balance by the simple process of deducting from the Estimate for supply services an arbitrary sum representing what he calls abnormal expenditure.  If this State is going seriously to tackle its problems we have got to have increased expenditure.  An expenditure, however, which will provide the houses and give the works which are needed cannot obviously be met out of taxation. The Minister was boasting yesterday about the low level of the national debt.  It is true that he gave a figure for the national debt which left out of account several big items which have been referred to here today by Deputy MacEntee.  The low level of national debt as defined by him exists because the Government has failed in its duty to the people in the provision of such essential services as housing.  It is not, I think, a matter on which this Dáil can pride itself that we have a dead-weight debt of only £20,000,000 while we have at the same time 68,000 people in the city of Dublin living in dwellings officially condemned as unfit for <Col N="1245" /> human habitation.  It is not a matter of pride that we had in 1926, according to the Census, 55,000 houses urgently required for the proper accommodation of our people, and that the only reaction of the Government to the publication of that figure was to reduce the grant available for the encouragement of building.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, taking the purely orthodox finance view, may be quite satisfied with the uneventful nature of the Budget statement he made yesterday, but the people of this country who are looking for a change of Government policy because the existing policy has not met their needs have no grounds for satisfaction with this Budget.  Expenditure designed to remove the social evils that exist amongst our people, the lack of houses, bad drainage, inadequate water supplies, and other evils of that kind would be productive expenditure which could be met out of borrowed money without necessarily increasing the burden of dead-weight debt.  It is certainly expenditure that should be undertaken in any case, because the first duty of a modern State is to ensure that these services will be provided.  The attitude of the Government is similar to the attitude of the average Farmers' Union member of a county council. So long as they can keep down the rates they do not care what happens to the social services for which they are expected to provide.  That was the attitude of the Minister for Finance yesterday.  He was quite satisfied, because it was unnecessary to alter any existing taxes.  It did not matter to him, and apparently it does not matter to members of the Cumann na nGaedheal, that the Budget statement was in fact an admission of the Government's inability to do its job.  The Budget was made to balance by a very simple and very old trick.  The Minister found himself with an Estimate for expenditure that was some £1,200,000 in excess of the estimated revenue.  Instead of taking steps to increase the revenue, he merely proceeded to deduct from the Estimate a number of <Col N="1246" /> items of expenditure amounting to £1,200,000, and, calling it abnormal, made provision to meet it by borrowing. When introducing the Budget in 1929, the Minister for Finance said:&mdash;&ldquo;We may reasonably hope that in the year 1930-31&rdquo;&mdash;that is, this year&mdash;&ldquo;the expenditure of the kind which has hitherto been classed as abnormal will include very little in addition to whatever sum may be required for the Local Loans Fund.&rdquo; That was the Minister's intention last year, but this year, finding that the Estimate for supply services had been increased, he forgot what he said twelve months ago, and he proceeded to deduct from that Estimate, for the purpose of meeting it by borrowing, a sum which actually exceeds by £653,000 the amount required for the Local Loans Fund.  He is in fact deducting from the Estimate this year, as representing abnormal expenditure on supply services an amount which exceeds by £155,000 the amount which he deducted last year, although he told us last year that he would not again deduct any such amount except it was required for the Local Loans Fund. That is high finance! A plainer word could be used outside, but the Ceann Comhairle would not allow me to use it here.</P>
    <P>In each year it is obvious that there will be a number of items of expenditure of a non-recurrent nature, amounting in the aggregate probably to the same sum every year. Although the individual items might reasonably be described as abnormal, they would be concerned with expenditure of the same type, and should therefore be provided out of normal revenue.  I hope I am making my meaning clear.  In each year's Estimate for the supply services there will be a certain number of abnormal items, and because of that fact provision for these abnormal items should be made out of normal revenue and not out of borrowed moneys.  It is, I think, tricky finance to argue that because some such item as that which the Minister included yesterday, like the provision of a capital grant to University College, <Col N="1247" /> Cork, is not a recurring item, it can be provided for out of capital.  It is undoubtedly true that no item of that kind is likely to appear in the Estimate for the next year, but some other non-recurring item of a similar nature will appear.  The aggregate of the abnormal items in one year's Estimate will be the same as the aggregate of the abnormal items in another year's, and we can reckon as a normal phenomenon in our financial life the existence of these abnormal items.  Therefore it should be the duty of the Dáil to take steps to provide that they will be met out of normal revenue and that, if necessary, taxes should be imposed which will enable that revenue to be realised. It is untrue to say that this Budget has been balanced.  It has been balanced only by the trick of passing on to posterity the charge which should be met in this year.</P>
    <P>We had hoped that the Minister might be forced by circumstances to do something on this occasion that would ease the industrial depression and help to find work for the unemployed. Reference was made yesterday to the coach-building industry. For four years the representatives of that industry have been hanging around the doors of the Tariff Commission trying to get the protection which would have meant the preservation of their industry in this country.  In 1926, when their application was first made, there were 1,290 hands engaged in coach-building factories.  The giving of protection then would have meant additional employment for 2,000 hands in the coach-building factories and 600 hands in subsidiary industries.</P>
    <P>According to the statistics published by the Department of Industry and Commerce, the number of persons engaged in the manufacture of motor bodies on July 1st, 1924, was 249.  An inadequate duty went on those bodies in that year, and in consequence the employment given by the industry increased, until on September 1st. 1928, it was 569.  But last year, while the representatives of the industry, as I said, were hanging <Col N="1248" /> round the corridors of Merrion Street asking for protection, the employment given by the industry decreased by 47 per cent., some concerns were shut up, a good deal of the invested capital was wasted.  The industry is not now in a position to take the same advantage of protection, if it were given to-morrow, as it would have been in 1926.  The value of the products of the industry imported in 1928 was £750,000, and in 1929 it was about £900,000. This is an industry which all Governments seek to preserve within their shores, because the relationship which the amount paid in wages bears to the value of the gross output is higher than in any other industry except house building; it is not less than 50 per cent.  The loss in wages, therefore, in the year 1929, because the protection asked for by those engaged in the industry was not granted was about £450,000.  The loss in wages to the Irish workers since 1926, due to the vexatious and unnecessary delay in presenting the Tariff Commission's Report, exceeds £1,000,000.  That long-delayed examination of the application is now at an end, we understand, and I think it is even possible that the Minister has the report in his possession.  We did hope, however, that he would take steps to ensure that the Report would reach him before he prepared his Budget statement, and that if the recommendation is, as we believe it must be, in favour of the application, we would now be considering the necessary financial resolution imposing the duty.  However, no reference to the matter appeared in the Budget statement, and from that people are concluding that the Tariff Commission, in this matter as in others, has considered, not the welfare of the industrialists or the workers here, but the theories which they have learned from the text-books of British economists and which they are apparently determined to apply here, irrespective of their effect on the wellbeing of the people.</P>
    <P>I was recently afforded an opportunity of visiting a large factory in the Midlands that is devoted to the construction of furniture and coach <Col N="1249" /> bodies, and I was struck very forcibly by the fact that there was considerable evidence of activity in the portion of the factory which was used for the manufacture of furniture, on which there is an import duty, but when I came to the part of the factory that had been utilised for the manufacture of motor bodies I saw a large empty space, and I was told that it was only twelve months ago since there had been 50 and 60 skilled workers employed in that room, where now only two were maintained.  That situation is reflected in practically every coach-building factory in the country, and the Government appears to regard the whole situation with indifference.</P>
    <P>The coach-building industry is, of course, not the only one that has been pleading for protection from this Government and has not got it. The paper-making industry is also engaged in promoting an application before this infamous Tariff Commission.  I have said in the past, and I repeat it now, that this Tariff Commission appears to have been established for the sole purpose of delaying and impeding the granting of protection to Irish industries, and the action of the Government last year in placing upon its members the additional duty of conducting the Grain Inquiry appears to point very directly to that end.  There are, possibly, 50,000 people unemployed at this moment in the Free State.  I make that estimate subject to correction. I do not know the number unemployed.  Twelve months ago I commented on the fact that the figures relating to unemployment ascertained in 1926 had not been published.  I can make that comment with greater force now.  Can we learn the reason why these unemployment figures have been suppressed? Surely it was more important when the census was taken that the figures relating to matters of that kind should be made available before we were told the number of persons of different religions living in each town, village and townland. The number of persons of various <Col N="1250" /> creeds living in different parts of the country is only of minor interest. The number unemployed is a matter of major concern, and still we find ourselves, four years after the census was taken, without the information that was ascertained then. Can the Minister tell us why that information has not been made available?  It is certainly my belief that it has been deliberately suppressed, because its publication would not suit the political interests of Cumann na nGaedheal.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Government towards this and all the big problems that are confronting the Irish people to-day appears to be one of absolute futility.  On every occasion when any matter is raised here, or any project mooted which would benefit the Irish people, they talk, not about the advantages which would be gained by success, but about the administrative difficulties which would result if an attempt were made to put those projects into operation.  Every member of the present Government, with one or two exceptions, appears to have long since exceeded his term of usefulness, and to be content now with merely carrying on the routine functions of his Department, without bringing any element of originality or initiative into the consideration of the problems with which they should be dealing.  The situation this year is likely to be even more serious than it was last year, owing to the slump in agricultural prices, which is taking place, not merely here, but throughout the whole world.  For us that slump is much more likely to have serious consequences than for others, because, under the influence of the present Minister for Agriculture, we have been encouraged to put all our hopes on the prospects of one or two branches of the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>It is a long time now since Deputies on this side of the house advocated the adoption of a scheme for the encouragement of wheat-growing. A certain scheme was submitted to the Economic Committee and rejected by the majority.  That scheme <Col N="1251" /> was the best that the Fianna Fáil members of that Committee could devise, but even admitting that it may not have been perfect, its rejection by that Committee should not have ended the matter.  I think even the Minister for Agriculture is learning to regret now that he has not, during his term of office, taken some steps to encourage the production of that cereal here.  The only encouragement that it requires is the guarantee of a market to the farmers if they grow it, and to a lesser extent, the guarantee of a fair price.  We spend over £7,000,000 a year on foreign wheat and on the products of foreign wheat, a large part of which could be kept at home and which would be a very considerable benefit to the Irish farmers, while they are tiding over this crisis in the dairying industry.  I have already pointed out that in this matter of developing the production of wheat at home the Free State Government will soon occupy a position unique in Europe.  The Minister for Agriculture has his eyes turned on Canada, Australia and the United States; but, in fact, there is more wheat grown in Europe, excluding Russia&mdash;and I would like Deputies to keep this fact in mind&mdash;than in Canada, the United States, the Argentine and Australia added together. Every Government in Europe is taking steps to encourage the production of wheat within its shores, except the Free State and Britain, but it has been officially accepted as the policy of the party that at present constitutes the Government in Britain to put such a scheme into operation there.  The members of that party are engaged in advocating a scheme very similar &mdash;in fact, almost identical&mdash;with that submitted by Fianna Fáil to the Economic Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On this occasion the Labour Party have done us the <Col N="1252" /> honour of copying our scheme.  If the Labour Party here did the same they would be taken more seriously than they are taken at the present time.  The consequences which the crisis in the dairying industry are likely to have for the farmers are due to the fact that the Minister for Agriculture has been working all the time with his eyes on the British market, and neglecting the much more valuable market for Irish agricultural produce which is available at home.  There was published within the last three weeks a little booklet by the Department of Industry and Commerce giving statistics relating to the agricultural output which I hope Deputies on the benches opposite will study very carefully.  There is one fact in that booklet which I would like to refer to now, and that is that one worker employed in Ireland is worth to the Irish farmer fifteen workers employed in England.  That one fact alone indicates that it is directly in our interests to give employment here in the production of goods required by us in preference to giving that employment in England, even if the production of these goods at home could not be done at as low cost as it could be done in England, where mass production methods are in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the situation as serious as it is, I think it is no wonder that a large number of people are beginning to despair of the possibility of revival.  There are people who are apparently of the opinion that the vitality of the nation has been so weakened by this Government during the past eight years, that a revival would not be possible, no matter what Government is in office, or what policy is in operation.  I do not think these people are right.  I do not think that the damage done has yet reached the stage at which it is irreparable.  I think that if any Government went into office determined to put into operation a pro-Irish policy in economic matters, they would be able gradually to build up the resources and strength of the country again.  I know that the members of the present Executive <Col N="1253" /> are all supermen, inspired by heaven, and incapable of doing wrong, but even if an Executive Council composed of ordinary individuals was elected by this House, these ordinary individuals could produce better results if they worked on a better policy.  It is not, perhaps, the men who are wrong in the present Government.  It is the policy that is wrong, and so long as that policy is in operation, it does not matter if they were all archangels. The results will be no different to those that now exist.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there will be a vote on the motion we are now discussing. It is a very innocuous form of motion.  It merely suggests that there should be a change in the law and the purpose for which it is moved is merely to give us an opportunity of discussing the Budget.  If there is a vote, and I think it is advisable that there should be, I take it that a vote against the motion will be an indication of dissatisfaction with the Budget and with the policy of the Government in general. I hope that those who were elected to represent the plain people and not the lords, those who have the interests of the plain people and not the lords at heart, will indicate that fact by voting against the motion and, consequently, against the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the criticism which the Budget has called forth, I think I must come to the conclusion that it is a highly satisfactory Budget.  I do not propose to analyse it for what it contains or for what it omits.  I think that on the whole the people in the country will say that the Minister for Finance has done his work exceedingly well.  Many people will be surprised that he has been able to balance his Budget so well.  Deputy Lemass's main criticism of the Budget was as to its want of originality. Well, no doubt there is a lack of originality about it.  It satisfies the people outside who expected some new taxation.  Deputy Lemass said that if some statistician went into the proportion of indirect <Col N="1254" /> taxation paid by the poorer people in the State as against the amount paid in direct taxation he would find that the burden of indirect taxation fell very largely on the poor.  That is quite true, I believe, but it is an extraordinary statement coming from what I may call a whole-hog protectionist.  If Deputy Lemass had his way the burden of indirect taxation would be still heavier on the poor.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a line of argument that I cannot follow.  For that reason, I think that the whole criticism of this Budget has completely broken down.  I think that the Budget will be a most satisfactory one to the people of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy O'Hanlon would look at the example of Australia he would find that the Labour Party, which places first in its programme the welfare and advancement of the workers in the towns, has a strong protectionist policy, and that the Farmers' Party in Australia as well is pretty protectionist, unless it can be shown definitely that a particular measure of protection is going to injure the farming industry.  The Minister for Finance has told us that he is setting aside the amount of money collected from wireless licences and wireless tax for the purpose of developing a broadcasting station.  He thinks it is a good principle that the money he collects from that particular amusement should go to develop the amusement further.  It is a pity that, in other spheres, the Minister would not earmark the revenue he <Col N="1255" /> collects from particular sections of the community and spend it for the benefit of those people.  If Deputy O'Hanlon, or any other member of the House, can show us any other policy except whole-hog protection which will remedy the present situation, which will do something to stop emigration, and relieve unemployment, let him do so.  No other policy has been suggested.</P>
      <P>As to the policy which Deputy Lemass has referred to, of waiting for the patriotic exiles who left this country when a native Government began to function in it, but who are coming back because they have found that they were nobodies while they were across the water, and feel that if they return here they may shine in the ranks of society&mdash; those who say that kind of thing is going to affect economic upliftment in the country are simply fooling the people.  No doubt, if these people do return and take their places, as they ought to have taken them, when the change was originally made in the country and contribute to its welfare as citizens&mdash;not only themselves but their ancestors in the last 100 or 200 years ought to have done that&mdash;then we will be very glad.  If they do that it will show that they are beginning to recognise that this country is their natural home, their cultural home, and not some other country.  If they decide to make their home their sphere of interest, and their sphere of influence in this country, nobody will be more delighted than we will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far we have not seen any results in that direction from the lower rate of income tax charged in this country as compared with other countries.  The Minister referred to a few cases of that kind, but I think they are very few.  I think it may happen that some people whom the Minister has in mind may not be of such advantage to the country.  They may not be so wealthy as the Minister would have us believe.  It is very unlikely that people of the very wealthy classes, no matter how they are taxed in England, if they prefer <Col N="1256" /> to live in that country are going to leave all their amenities, all their comforts, and all their other connections behind them and come over here merely for the sake of getting the benefits arising out of the remission in income tax to which the Minister referred.  If they do come, if there is a change of front on their part and they consider that at this hour of the day it would have been better for them to have stayed in Ireland and to have worked for Ireland&mdash;they got very little thanks for going where they went&mdash;we will all be very pleased.  The position at present is that these taxes which are being collected are not being set aside for a particular purpose.  Protection, if it means anything, should not alone mean that you want to keep out foreign products, but that you will utilise revenue in order to develop the home situation, to increase employment, develop business activities and commercial prosperity.</P>
    <P>In Australia there is a tariff which would absolutely shock the Irish Farmers' Party out of existence. Australia has a tariff on butter.  The extraordinary thing about it is that the Australian working man is prepared to pay a tariff of 4d. a pound on Australian butter and of 6d. a pound on New Zealand butter in order to help the Australian farmers, it being understood on the other hand that, when Australian industries are being protected, that when measures are passed in Parliament for the purpose of developing industries in the towns, the farmers on their part will make a corresponding sacrifice.  If butter is to be taxed for the special benefit of agriculture and the working man is prepared to pay his share of that burden, he demands in return for that that the farmers of Australia will help him to build up industries and not object when tariffs are imposed&mdash;tariffs which have been successful in developing Australian industries.</P>
    <P>You have as well as a tariff on butter a tariff on agricultural implements. That means the farmer will have to pay more for his Australian implements, but he will get a special class of agricultural implements <Col N="1257" /> which will suit his farm and which he could not get elsewhere. If we were to develop on these lines in this country I think we would be on the right road.  Undoubtedly this money that Deputy O'Hanlon has referred to is collected mainly from the farmer, and at present the farmer is not benefiting from it in any way.  It is not going to benefit or give any relief to agriculture, and it is not making people in the towns more prosperous.  There may be some slight increases in employment here and there, but they are not commensurate with the extraordinary increases which have been made in taxation, as far as protective tariffs are concerned.  As far as the industries themselves are concerned, we find from looking at the figures, that substantially the same amount of materials or commodities are being imported in some of the most heavily taxed articles as some years ago.  In the case of clothing apparel I find that in 1927, according to finance returns, £661,000 was collected in taxation in customs dues, and in 1929 the amount was £645,000.  Therefore, there is practically no improvement as far as the clothing industry is concerned.  The same amount of taxation is being paid, and we may take it that substantially the same amount of foreign material is coming into this country that ought to be manufactured at home.  If that material cannot be manufactured at home, speaking for myself, I say that tax ought not to be called a protective tariff but a revenue tariff and dealt with as such.</P>
    <P>In the case of boots and shoes the taxation raised last year came to £257,000, and in 1927 it came to £264,000.  The figure, as far as I can see, is practically stationery, so that imports of boots and shoes are coming in in as large quantities as some years ago.  Therefore, the farmer is paying, as in Australia, but the corresponding advance to that which is made in Australia in building up industries, in having large boot factories, and in having thousands of people employed, is not being made.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1258" /> It is due to these people, the farmers or the town labourers, who are paying their share of this taxation, to have it explained to them what exactly is the effect of this tax.  Is it really building up industries or is it a revenue tax?  Take the case of furniture.  Foreign furniture ought to be excluded altogether.  I have referred already in this House to the tremendous advantage the foreign furniture manufacturer has when he can send over here and sell a suite of furniture on a deposit of five shillings or something like that.  It would be quite impossible on whatever tariff you give to make up to the home manufacturers for these extraordinary credit facilities these distributors for foreign manufacturers are able to give.  Irish manufacturers, in my opinion, considering that the whole wholesale trade has been in the hands of foreign manufacturers, have already had a sufficient burden to contend with, and if those big shops are going to open up throughout the country with the special facilities they have they would do away completely with whatever advantage the furniture tariff is giving.  It is no wonder that in that particular case whereas £45,000 was collected from the furniture tariff in 1927 in 1929 it went up to £50,000.  That is, £5,000 more was paid in 1929 than two years previously as a tax on foreign furniture. That is a clear indication that the tariff is useless.</P>
    <P>Not alone have we the same amount of stuff coming in in the shape of boots, shoes and clothing apparel, but actually an increased amount.  The same applies to small commodities like bedsteads and blankets, on both of which the Minister for Finance has collected an increased revenue.  In 1927 £3,800 was collected on bedsteads and in 1929 £4,700.  In the case of blankets, in 1927 £4,400 was collected and in 1929 £7,300.  Even in the case of comparatively simple commodities, either we are thoroughly inefficient or those industries we are seeking to protect are absolutely hopeless, or else irrespective of the effect on the industry and <Col N="1259" /> unemployment figures, and the expansion of enterprise here, the Minister is allowing the present state of affairs to continue because he can see all this money coming to him.  In the case of sugar and soap the amount available has decreased.  You have certain large foreign firms coming in and drastically reorganising and buying out the native industry.  In that case as well as the disadvantage of having a foreigner taking charge you have the loss of revenue, because there is far less material coming in. However, it may be that is the only way we will ever get our industries efficient and into a position where they will supply practically our whole internal needs.  If that is so it is a pity, and it is a pity that our Shannon power scheme and all our dreams and imaginings of technical education and what native industry could do to give the Irishman employment in his own country comes to this, that we have what is called protection, but what is really and simply the collection of revenue on a large scale from, as Deputy O'Hanlon said, very often the poorest class in the country, without any corresponding advantage as far as I can see.</P>
    <P>If we are going forward for protection, let us go forward for it sincerely and realistically, and not be looking at it from the point of view of collecting revenue, and see that side by side with it money will be given towards the advancement of education and the development of our industries by whatever other means the Government may have at its hand to help these enterprises. The Minister has told us that he does not want to put any fresh burdens on agriculture.  The Minister claims that £24,500,000 is the minimum limit within the field of which economies cannot be made, or, at any rate, economies worth speaking of.  When he talks of fresh burdens and the necessity of fresh taxation in the event of further services being given to us, it is up to him to show that agriculture is getting value for its money out of the £24,500,000.  That money is out of all proportion to <Col N="1260" /> what was generally expected when this country got a native Government. It is out of all proportion to what the people who had been looking for self-government for this country expected it should be.  Although we must agree that under the post-war circumstances, and under the circumstances in which the present Government took control, they were faced with heavy expenditure and had to do things perhaps in an unnecessarily expensive way, it is not right now when things are normal that the Minister should tell us we are stabilised at £24,500,000 without telling us exactly what value we are getting for the money, without telling us exactly what service we are getting, and without letting us know in some more detail than he has what this economic committee of his has done. Has it merely gone into ridiculous and petty proposals like taking the boots off the Civic Guards, or has it viewed the whole position of certain Government Departments with regard to their general working?  Is the Minister satisfied that some of these Departments, which seem to be filled up with people who do not want to work for a native Government, are giving the best service to the country?  Is the Minister satisfied that these Departments, with these types of people predominating in them, are helping him or are giving to the Government the best possible service that can be given? If the Minister can give us that assurance we shall be delighted.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Minister that there are several Departments in which it is believed friction is going on.  We have the old class of civil servant and the new class of civil servant, and I think before we are told things are now definitely fixed and that we cannot expect any changes in future we ought to have at least some information as to what ground has been covered by the Minister in his investigations and what ground has been covered by his Departmental Committee.  Is the Minister satisfied that no reorganisation is necessary in any Department, that the Departments <Col N="1261" /> generally are giving the best possible service, and that there is no necessity for any change to be made?  We know that civil servants have been given very important offices of a trading nature.  We know that certain civil servants have had responsibilities placed upon them which in the normal way they should not have.  I have one particular case in mind in which a considerable amount of Government trading activity is placed in the hands of a civil servant who has had no previous training in trade matters.  I think that is a thing which should not have occurred.  The Minister ought definitely to assure us that he has gone through the Departments one by one and is satisfied that the best men are in the responsible jobs.  If he tells us that, we will be satisfied.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that if we view the position from the point of the total salaries and bonuses involved we will find that the percentage in regard to full expenditure is very small.  I think the percentage is 16½ of the total amount spent.  There is another side to that. Until we get certain assurances from the Minister we have to look at the fact that there may be whole Departments that need thorough reorganisation and there are several changes that could still be made.  Let us take the case of the Broadcasting Station.  Is the Minister satisfied that that is the best way in which the money could be expended, while we know that money is urgently needed in other directions?  I think the Minister will find very little support in the country for the proposed new Broadcasting Station, and on examination he will find that the £85,000 proposed to be spent on the new station could be more usefully expended elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Then there is the case of the External Affairs Department.  That is a Department that is costing substantially the same amount of money &mdash;a total expenditure of £85,000.  As the years go on that amount will increase; the expenditure will be greater.  I wonder are the people <Col N="1262" /> getting value for the money?  I have not heard any definite results accruing so far from our foreign representation. One of the things we would like to know is, what value exactly are we getting out of foreign representation?  Even in the case of the Army and the Civic Guards, two items that naturally appeal to us, the amounts are unnecessarily large. There has been a considerable reduction in the cost of the Army.  Is that reduction effected from the point of view that we must always have the Army, and that every year we can make only a small reduction, or are we to view it from the point which I think the country expects the Minister to adopt&mdash;that we have definitely settled down to peaceful conditions here, and once the Army Reserve has been established and is functioning properly, the standing Army as such could be cut down to a very small and very nominal standard? If we are going to reduce the Army expenditure by a few thousands every year we will have to face the establishment of vested interests, the continuance of the maintenance of buildings, overhead expenses, rates, stationery and all these other things. All these expenses will have to be paid, and they will be all the greater in proportion to a very small Army than if they were applied to a comparatively larger force.  I agree with Deputy MacEntee that there is no reason why steps could not be taken to abolish the Army within the next few years.  The Ministry have placed the Army Reserve in the hands of Army officers.  When they have that Reserve properly equipped and under their control they ought to be quite satisfied; but I think very poor progress has been made in order to bring about that transition.  There has not been much progress made in carrying over the Army Reserve and definitely establishing it.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister can be in earnest when he says he wants definite proof, apparently from this side of the House, that the last shred of danger of an internal rising against the authority of his Executive has passed.  How can the Minister get that assurance, and what kind <Col N="1263" /> of assurance does he want?  It shows that he was not sincere when he stated that even if we found that all danger of internal conflict had disappeared we would still have to consider our position with regard to the League of Nations.  It is talk like that that makes the country believe that the Ministers are really not sincere.</P>
    <P>What does the League of Nations or the Great Powers care about this small State of ours?  What influence can we have beyond the fact that we are here, and that we may see our photographs occasionally in the papers?  What real influence can we have at the League of Nations or at the Naval Conference?  If we are going to go on that line, I think we are adopting a very wrong policy. We are told that there is no money available for certain social services and for the building up of industries; yet here we are faced with increasing expenditure on matters which do not constitute the really big issues of interest to our country. The expenditure on representation abroad, just as expenditure on the proposed new Broadcasting Station, ought not be made while there are general complaints of bad business and general distress in the country, together with a great scarcity of money.  If Cumann na nGaedheal members believe that the country is not in a bad state and that it is fairly comfortable; if they are satisfied that because the entertainment tax and other taxes of that sort have increased it indicates that the people are better off, they are simply off the rails.  These increased taxes are, no doubt, due to big advertising that is being carried on relative to all these luxuries.  We must consider the growth of new ideas; the people have new ideas and new standards. The fact that we are getting more money out of these luxuries does not prove that the country is better off, because it certainly is not. The ordinary worker or businessman in 99 cases out of 100 is worse off than he was five years ago.  The Minister may have his Revenue Commissioners <Col N="1264" /> to tell him that they have found out somebody who had money hidden in England or somewhere like that, or that some prominent Cumann na nGaedheal supporter was suddenly found to have defrauded the Government for a great many years&mdash;perhaps back to the time of his grandfather.  Things of that sort may suddenly be found out, but that does not prove that the country is well off.  You will always have those isolated cases of people defrauding the revenue just as you will have people spending on a vast scale, on a scale out of proportion to the wealth and conditions, as you have here in Dublin, as compared with corresponding cities in other countries.  I call attention to the case of the police because there has been an increase of £45,000 this year. The only real economy made was the closing of a few small barracks.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested on this side that with the advent of the telephone, the motor bicycle and the motor car, more economies could have been effected.  We can run this country with a much smaller police force than we have at present.  It is not necessary to run this country with a police force greater in numbers than the police force in the whole of Scotland. Our police force is costing far more money.  Surely the Minister is not serious when he tells us that public morality in this country has not advanced sufficiently to enable a small village in the West of Ireland to get on and its people to be regarded as lawful and peaceful citizens unless they have a Civic Guard barracks to look after them. I think that is quite wrong.  In the same way as they got on when there was no R.I.C. barracks there, they can get on now.  If a serious offence is committed, with the advantage of the telephone and the motor car these things can come under notice in a very short time and far more quickly than they could a few years ago, though you had a barracks in every single village.  Barracks in these villages are not necessary.  The only offences in these villages are cases of strayed donkeys.  Cases like that are <Col N="1265" /> being attended to by the Gárda.  The Minister talked about poteen.  Poteen will be easily abolished if the Minister spends money in these areas and gives the people something to do. The demoralisation arising from poverty and ignorance is responsible for the poteen evil.  If people had self-respect, clean houses and employment, they would have no poteen. The present policy of exterminating poteen and having the Minister for Finance regarding himself as a new grand inquisitor to scourge the Gaeltacht of this dreadful evil is quite wrong.  I admit it is necessary to wipe out the poteen evil, but we ought not to look at these unfortunate people as being criminals. Even the worst of criminals can say that circumstances and environment have led them to it.  The argument that these large Civic Guard forces are necessary, and that they must be kept on on account of the poteen evil, is not a sound argument.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee has called attention to the fact that the Minister has completely ignored all the other commitments in regard to local loans and land annuities for which this State is responsible to Great Britain.  He has definitely ignored them in his annual statement on the national debt.  He has tried to gull the people into the belief that because our national debt is only £20,000,000, or less than one year's revenue, the country is a paradise.  The service of that debt compares very unfavourably with the amount of the debt. The total amount that we are going to pay this year for the service of that debt comes to £1,883,000.  We are paying that amount on our national debt.  If we are going to go on borrowing, and if we are going to proceed on the belief that no economies can be made, that only through fresh taxation or borrowing can anything big or real be done to relieve the situation in the country, we had better keep in mind also that that in itself imposes a very heavy burden upon us.  The amount is now practically £2,000,000, and if the present rate of borrowing goes on it will pass on and go to nearly £3,000,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>At a time like this, when the Budget is introduced, there are generally great expectations and a certain amount of excitement. Except for the daily Press, I think the introduction of this Budget was free from excitement.  The main policy that underlies the introduction of the Budget would seem to be a certain inducement for people with capital&mdash;not necessarily capital to be employed in production, but capital to be expended here in this country &mdash;to come to live here.  That would seem to be behind the introduction of the Budget.  But there was no consideration whatsoever given to the question of the relief of production in this country.  To my mind the particular form of protection that underlies the Budget will have a certain amount of demoralisation.  I believe we have been living long enough under that system.  I believe that wealthy men living in this country did very little more than demoralise the surrounding workers.  I believe that we have reached a stage now when we should take a different outlook. That is, that we should have our own production and that taxation, as far as possible, should be worked so as to encourage that production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember some time ago the Minister for Finance making a very true statement here on the question of tariffs.  He told us that tariffs were an investment.  That, I believe, is perfectly correct, and if he had stuck to that, and stuck to it in a system of taxation.  I am quite convinced that good results would accrue.  But the Minister seems to have left that line and gone on the other one&mdash;that is, the policy of bringing into this country wealthy people who will hunt and tour the country while we, incidentally, shall get the alms.  It is nothing more.  I think he should go back to the other policy and, as far as possible, try to encourage or stimulate production. After all, we have a series of heavy debts to pay out to other countries for production.  We are actually paying out large sums of money that we cannot afford to pay. We are paying that money in general <Col N="1267" /> for what we could really produce here ourselves.  That has gone on now for some sixty or seventy years, and I believe that that arises largely through this particular system of taxation.  The Minister for Finance spoke some time ago on the question of £1 per head being put on Irish cattle if certain things occurred in this country.  The Minister wanted the people in this country to believe that they would have to pay that £1 per head if it were put on Irish cattle.  But I do not see the logic of the argument that the English people, being the consumers, could avoid paying that £1 per head.</P>
    <P>If a tax is put on foreign produce coming in here we are expected to pay it, but if a tax is put on our cattle going into England the English people are not expected to pay it, but we are expected to do so.  That would seem to be the reasoning.  I believe, and I have stated before, that the Minister for Finance has shown a great deal of ability in the selection he has made of his Revenue Department.  That Department is certainly most efficient in its methods of collecting money by all means.  It leaves no stone unturned to make that collection, and as often as not, whether the money is there or not, it has to be found in some way or another, and everything goes well.  I wonder if the Minister could lend himself to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  There must be more men of ability to be found, and perhaps he would try to select some team or body of men who would be trained to endeavour to solve some of the economic problems with which we are faced.  On my journeys throughout the country I see any amount of good food.  The country generally is stored with any amount of good potatoes which are to all intents and purposes unsaleable. Going through the streets of Dublin one notices many people in want of such food.  You have the farmer who cannot sell it, and you have people here hungry who cannot <Col N="1268" /> get it, while those who can get it must pay an enormous price.</P>
    <P>Potatoes in Dublin are selling at one shilling a stone, whereas in the country I do not suppose that they can sell them for threepence.  They cannot feed them to pigs, because pigs are nearly useless at present. The Minister should apply himself to that problem.  He should give a lead. We have the ability to collect money, but we have no ability to stimulate production in any way.  It has been taught to us here for generations that we are purely an agricultural country and that the moment we leave agriculture we are lost, because God Almighty never intended us for anything else.  We have been told that if we enter into any industrial production we must of necessity be a failure.  I think that the Minister for Agriculture is convinced that under no conditions, certainly not under present conditions, can he make a success of agriculture.  We will not be able to make a success of agriculture until we develop other industries.</P>
    <P>I believe that direct assistance to farmers will not do anything, and that the assistance that farmers can get, to do them any good, must be indirect assistance.  That is largely the reason that you find all through the country such indifference amongst all farmers.  There is no doubt that there is that indifference.  They were indifferent about this Budget.  I suppose they heaved a sigh of relief when they found that there was no increase in taxation.  That, however, is all; they are not jubilant about it. All that they say to-day is: &ldquo;This is stabilised.  Here we are.  We are not going to have it any higher, but certainly we are not going to have it any lower, nor is any effort going to be made to increase or encourage our production.&rdquo;  That is the reason that all through the country during the last winter the agricultural classes, with their highly paid and efficient instructors, were so poorly attended. I believe that all that demoralisation and indifference arises absolutely from the system of taxation which we have inherited but from which <Col N="1269" /> we are making no effort whatever to get away.  When we come to examine the system of taxation and when we read its history we generally find that it sprang up because of some abnormal conditions, because there was a big war or something of that kind.  When money was wanted in a hurry Ministers of Finance found that this was a very convenient and handy method of getting it.  There was no trouble about it so far as they were concerned.  There it has remained. That is the present system and no change has been made.</P>
    <P>Local rates, for instance, are nothing but a tax, and every effort is being made to collect them to-day, so much so that if they are not paid and if a man is not capable of paying them immediately, he is not allowed to make an effort to pay. No heed whatever is paid to the question of production there.  It means that he is locked up and held there until such time as somebody may lend him money to pay his rates.  That local tax is raised on a basis which undoubtedly is not equitable, and, furthermore, a good deal of ordinary taxation is still raised on that basis.  You find that our main producers, the farmers, are taxed, either centrally or nationally, on that basis, which is completely inequitable, but no consideration can apparently be given to it.  This year we have come to the point of stabilising that.  I hope that the Minister only means that the amount he wants, between £24,000,000 and £26,000,000, is stabilised, and that he does not mean to stabilise this particular system.  Before he does so, I hope he will have an inquiry into the whole subject in order to try and find means to stimulate production rather than to stimulate what is, to all intents and purposes, luxury.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the poorest people in this country pay the heaviest amount of taxation.  There is no use in saying that such taxation is based on their capacity to pay.  The capacity of some of them to pay is practically nothing, but still, if they want to live at all, they <Col N="1270" /> must try and find some means of paying such taxes.  In general, such tax is paid before they start to earn or produce anything.  You have, for instance, the tobacco tax.  That was mentioned by the Minister yesterday, and there is no doubt that it is a very handy way of getting money. From his point of view the Minister is perfectly right, because he has not the slightest trouble with it.  Before such commodity is removed from bond, if it is home produced, the manufacturer has to pay 6/8, even if he only takes out one pound of tobacco. The man has to pay that 6/8 before he manufactures anything. He is taxed long before the article is produced and much longer before it is consumed.  On the other hand, we have imported tobacco and the tax is paid by the manufacturer on the leaf.  What is the position with the consumer?  He pays practically half the value of the article he consumes directly to the Government, and it is collected by the shopkeeper. That is a very economic system and there is no doubt that it is quite right because it saves the State the cost of collection.</P>
    <P>Who are the people who have to pay that tax and who have no means of avoiding it?  They are the very poorest people we have.  There is no difference made, no preference given to them whatsoever.  This commodity was called a luxury, and that was the ostensible reason it was taxed, but that was not the real reason.  The real reason was that it was simply a handy means of raising revenue.  I believe that on certain classes of that commodity consumed by the very poor, the Minister should consider giving some form of rebate. It would be very easy to differentiate, as the very poor generally smoke the strong class of tobacco. I think the Minister might consider giving some small rebate on that strong class of tobacco, if not this year certainly in next year's Budget, and so afford these people an opportunity of indulging in that little luxury, if he calls it a luxury.</P>
    <P>I made the statement that tariffs were to a large extent investments. <Col N="1271" /> and if we ask farmers in this country to pay duty on foreign goods and if the proceeds of that duty are invested in the development of production in factories in this country, the farmers are sure to get the benefit of such a tariff at some future date.  Not alone that, but according to the policy which we are pursuing to-day it will be necessary to provide some form of production in which the sons and daughters of farmers will be absorbed.  If the tariff or duty is properly imposed and properly adjusted so that it will become an investment, the Minister for Finance gets no benefit.  It is then perfectly right.  The proceeds are invested in that industry so that it may be developed and its produce efficiently marketed, and finally in order that the sons and daughters of the small farmers, a class which is rapidly increasing, may be engaged in that industry.  Whether the Minister, this Government, or any other Government that may follow them, like it or not, they will be faced with that problem, because we have innumerable small farmers springing up in each county.  These small farmers will eventually have children. They will have sons and daughters who will be faced with the problem of securing some position in life. Certainly the thirty acres of land or so which the father of a family may possess will not be sufficient to divide amongst his children.</P>
    <P>Unless we continue the policy of emigration there is no other avenue of employment left to these people. Unless we make a determined attempt to absorb them in industry emigration is bound to continue. There is no other means of preventing it.  We are not wealthy enough to give them gratuities or bonuses, and no matter how many people of the wealthy class we may encourage to come in here, they will not be able to absorb them as servants, grooms or chauffeurs.  There seems to be no means of keeping them here in Ireland except through the establishment of other industries.  The agricultural industry alone is not able to provide for them.  It cannot <Col N="1272" /> of itself employ the number of people that we have been hitherto persuaded it could employ.  For instance, in our present condition.  I take it that we have more cattle and sheep in this country per 100 of the population than in any other country in Europe.  We have even more than they have in Canada and the United States, and still we are in the condition in which we now find ourselves. Emigration continues, absolute poverty exists, and no attempt is made to increase production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire, speaking on the general Resolution, to make some inquiries in regard to the tariffs already in force, and particularly in regard to the tariff on wearing apparel.  I would like if the Minister would tell us what was the intention of the Dáil when the tariff on wearing apparel was imposed.  Recently a case came under my personal notice regarding material brought from England for cricket&mdash; batting gloves, wicket - keeping gloves and leg pads.  These were held up at the port of Waterford as wearing apparel.  I was notified about their arrival, and I went down and saw them.  I had subsequently an interview with some official of the Department of Finance, but I heard nothing more about it until I heard that if these articles were not removed within a certain date they would be sent back to England, and they have been sent back.  Was it ever the intention of the Minister or the House to rate articles of that description as wearing apparel?  We have been told that these are borderline cases, but it is left to the Commissioners or some of their officials at ports down the country to say whether this tax is to be imposed or not.  Are they to be the judges? Surely the House had some definite object in mind when imposing the tariff, and surely the Minister who proposed it had also something definite in his mind?  If it is to be the law that these articles should be subject to a tariff, let that be stated definitely, but if it is not, what is the use of holding up articles which it was never intended should be <Col N="1273" /> taxed?  I think I am voicing the opinion of the House when I say that it was not intended to rate these articles as wearing apparel.</P>

      <P>I do not know about that.  Surely commonsense should have some bearing on this matter, and the officials of the Department of Finance down the country who see these goods should use a little commonsense in their examination of them.  It is not too much to expect them to come to some standard of commonsense.  There is a large number of other voxatious details in connection with this that ought to be put right.  It is annoying to people when they think the tariff is being strained too far, and they resent it.  Let it be stated definitely what is and is not dutiable.  Let definite articles come under the heading, and let us have a decision in law in those border cases which are reported from time to time, so that there will be no further disputes between the people to whom goods are consigned and the officials.  This House made the law and they should make it clear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take up a few details here more than any question of large principle.  There is the question of harbour boards and other authorities and their trading profits.  The Minister said that relief could not be given in this particular case unless it was extended to the trading profits made by all local authorities and by the Electricity Supply Board.  I understand that the profits of the Electricity Supply <Col N="1274" /> Board are already immune from that particular tax.  It seems to me that the question of relieving a harbour board from income tax upon its income is not covered by the question of ordinary trading profits of a municipality.  The income of a harbour board is all taken from dues and to the extent to which it is relieved would be relieved from dues, and therefore relieved from an addition which is invariably and inevitably put upon the cost of goods. Any taxation on the revenue of a harbour board is simply a direct increase in the cost of service.  You can justify a tax upon coal or upon oil used for industrial purposes on exactly the same ground.  A tax upon any other portion of the effective production could be justified on exactly the same ground as income taxation upon harbour board revenue. It has certain work to do, and if the Government take out of its revenues any sum of money by means of income tax then it has to get that money from other sources. It does not matter whether it is income tax deducted from the interest upon its stocks or upon what might seem nominally trade profit, the effect is exactly the same.  It is a direct increase in the cost of production, in so far as the production is represented by effective transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has taken £180,000 of the accumulated interest of the Post Office Savings Bank.  This has been accumulating over a period of years. He now proposes to take 75 per cent. of the accumulated amount of that interest as income in this particular year.  Needs must, I suppose, when the devil drives, and if one were to regard that transaction alone and separate there might be something in the case which he has put up; at any rate, he has a British precedent for doing so.  But, having regard to the fact that in another portion of revenue largely collected through the Post Office, that is, Savings Certificates, he told us last year that he was in arrear in his provision of interest to meet his liabilities under that head by over £400,000, it does seem very extraordinary book-keeping, to say the least of it, that he <Col N="1275" /> takes that asset of £180,000 and converts it into revenue this year instead of putting it to meet the liability which he has on his books of over £400,000 The principle of &ldquo;heads I win and tails you lose&rdquo; seems to be the Minister's method of dealing with recurrent and non-recurrent obligations.  This £180,000, on any system of sound book-keeping, having regard to the fact that he owes the savings certificates people this money, ought to be put to that purpose.</P>
    <P>The Minister has gone through the list and has told us that of the total expenditure of the country the whole lot is irreducible.  Having said it is irreducible two or three times, he is quite satisfied that he has proved it is irreducible, and therefore, we must accept it and start on that basis.  But absolutely no evidence of any sort, kind, or description has been given to us except his own declaration to that effect.  Deputy Derrig has called attention to a very extraordinary statement made by the Minister for Finance and one of which I hope the Minister for Agriculture will take very careful note. He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think it will be agreed by most people that expenditure on the Army cannot safely be reduced below the figure at which it now stands, at any rate until the possibility of internal attack on the State has completely disappeared. Even then it is questionable whether much further reduction would be justifiable until the sanctions of international law and the institutions of the League of Nations have grown more powerful than they now are.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here we have a statement by the Minister for Finance that the statement made by the Minister for Agriculture as to the purpose of the Army is all nonsense.  If that statement means anything, it is now a direct answer to anyone who says that any organisation in this country, due to its threat of disorder, is causing any cost under the head of the Army.  The Minister for Agriculture said that Army exists only, <Col N="1276" /> and that £1,500,000 is paid only, because there is this threat from inside.  The Minister for Finance said that even if that threat from inside was not there the expenditure would be the same.  What I want the House to ask themselves is: What do they think of a Budget of £24,000,000 that is justified by a Cabinet, two members of which, in relation to an item of £1,500,000, make statements so absolutely different and then, on the face of these two absolutely contradictory justifications of the same expenditure, say it is irreducible?</P>
    <P>As far as I can see we have to look for a third explanation of the irreducibility of this £1,500,000.  That explanation, apparently, is one given by the newspaper which has as its directors practically the whole of the Front Bench opposite; that is, that an Army costing £1,500,000 is maintained for the purpose of seeing that when this particular Government goes out of power there will be left in this country a power which will assert over any Dáil which is its successor the right to see that the policy of that and all succeeding Dala shall be the policy of Ministers opposite.  It is irreducible because the only guarantee they have that the policy of Cumann na nGaedheal will be maintained after Cumann na nGaedheal has disappeared is this particular Army which costs £1,500,000.  That is an irreducible sum.  I do not know whether the average member of Cumann na nGaedheal is willing to go into the division lobby to say that £1,500,000 should be spent in building up a military organisation here in this country which will rule the succeeding Dáil, and which will prevent the succeeding Dáil altering its policy to any policy other than that for which Cumann na nGaedheal to-day stands. That is the only justification, as far as I can see, for that £1,500,000 and that seems to be utterly inadequate. I do not think that any honest member of Cumann na nGaedheal would defend that.</P>
    <P>The whole question of what this £1,500,000 is spent for is, apparently, absolutely in the air.  And unless <Col N="1277" /> the three or four or twenty-four voices of Cumann na nGaedheal can come to an agreement as to what the purpose of it is, it is futile, impossible and stupid to put it forward as an organisation for which an irreducible sum of this kind should be provided.</P>
    <P>Amongst the assets of the Government there are various things, such as shares in the Agricultural Credit Corporation, and that &ldquo;Crown and Anchor&rdquo; establishment called the Industrial Trust Company of Ireland. The Industrial Trust Company of Ireland was a special inspiration from heaven.  Inspiration from heaven is not confined, apparently, to the Minister for Local Government.  The Minister for Finance gets it also.  The Industrial Trust Company of Ireland is one of &ldquo;the banking institutions of a new character&rdquo; which was to take the place of the effete organisations of that type in this country, and which was to do for Irish industry what the Minister for Finance, at that particular moment, did not think the existing banking institutions were doing.  Into that organisation the Government put £50,000, which is included amongst their miscellaneous assets.  It is included as £50,000 amongst their existing assets.  What is the value of that £50,000?  Of course, it is making a profit.  It made a very respectable profit of £14,851 in the year ended 31st March, 1930, on a capital, I think, of £250,000.  That is not at all bad. But in making up that profit it shows investments in industrial and other undertaking of £271,547.  Apparently, lest the auditor might have insisted on alluding to it, there is a footnote that shows that the market value of these investments which they value at £271,547 was £199,000. In other words, they make a profit of £14,851 in that particular year by including £72,000 of assets that they had not got, and that they knew they had not got.</P>
    <P>Now, the Government, I understand, have two representatives on that particular board.  Is this the type of accounting that is shown here also in the Budget?  If the Industrial <Col N="1278" /> Trust Company of Ireland has balanced its budget to the extent of a profit of £14,851 by including £70,000 worth of assets which they know they have not got, is that a type or sample of the finance of the Minister for Finance, who includes £50,000 worth of shares at par that he has in that company?  I think we shall have another opportunity in this House&mdash;I certainly think there ought to be another opportunity in this House&mdash;in which we will go into exactly what is done, by whom it was done, when £271,000 was invested, how and where it was invested. I think it is time this House knew why £50,000 of Government money was invested in a purely gambling transaction.  In the previous year, investments by this company were put down as £291,000 when they knew their value was £233,000.  Then also they showed a profit.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the finance of the subsidiary companies of the Minister for Finance, the House will not be in the least bit surprised to know that he includes amongst his assets what really are debts.  He values &ldquo;advances to the unemployment fund&rdquo; at £563,000.  Among the assets which make this country more solvent is included the fact that industries will have to be directly taxed in the future to the amount of £563,000.  That is the plain meaning. He might just as well include £400,000 for a petrol tax which he has not put on.  You know that is the sort of finance which gave free board and lodging to Hooley, Hatry and Whittaker Wright.  There is no difference except the size of the sum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I did not hear you.  I do not think I am losing much, but I want to give you an opportunity.  I had, on another occasion, an opportunity of going through some of these other assets which he has laid out here.  I do not propose to go through them again.  You do not need to go past this one single item.  If a man includes amongst his assets the assets <Col N="1279" /> of the State, the fact that he is to tax industry in the future he is capable of anything.  National Loan Sinking Fund, unspent balance, £197,000.  Last year that was £122,000.  I would like to know where that is, and what has been done with it, whether it is invested, whether it is providing income, or whether it is not.  At the present moment it is a very vague figure.  I can quite see the Minister's position. National Loan is at such a level he does not want to buy it.  I think that is quite good justification for him to say that he will wait until it is cheaper, or something of that kind, but I certainly want to know what is happening and what is being done with the £197,000 that he has.  On one occasion, a very critical occasion in the credit of this country, he allowed National Loan to drop one-and-a-half points, and to remain one-and-a-half points down for five most critical days, when £7 10s. would have saved it.  He had apparently £122,000 somewhere about that time. He certainly does seem to be very careful of the finances of this State when he saves £7 10s. at the cost of letting the credit of the country be depreciated at a particular moment of that kind.  The Deputy from Kilkenny, Deputy Gorey, objected to the fact that the Minister for Finance has not shown common sense.  He ought not to be surprised at that.  Why should he ask the Minister for Finance to be exceptional among his comrades?  In a particular case in the courts in which an official of the Minister for Justice was concerned, when the magistrate said that a Civic Guard should exercise common sense in the discharge of his functions, the Minister for Justice appealed to a higher court; so that, I think, Deputy Gorey will feel that perhaps he has been unjust to the Minister for Finance in suggesting that he is in any way exceptional among his comrades or in any way breaking the tradition of the Government which Deputy Gorey supports, when he failed in common sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister tells us that he does <Col N="1280" /> not propose to make any definite changes in the income tax position. He apparently forgets that two years ago he gave us a promise, or an engagement, which would at any rate justify an action for breach of promise, that he would consider very favourably the proposal to exempt from income tax moneys put back into business.  He has not done so now.  A few days ago he suggested, in relation to the milling situation, that possibly he would deal with it by discrimination in taxation, presumably income taxation.  There is no sign of that.  There is no sign of what you might call a constructive method at all.  It is purely and simply the book-keeping of a man who, hard driven, collects any unconsidered trifle and sells it for revenue.  He takes £180,000, which he certainly has no right to take, just as in the previous year he took about £250,000 of brewers' credit, and I think about £50,000 to £100,000 of currency conversion money which does not appear this year.  He balances his Budget every year on exactly the same principle that a lodger might balance his weekly budget&mdash;by selling one week his landlady's clock, and, if she did not notice it, next week his landlady's dog, eventually, no doubt, acquiring a right to free board and residence at the expense of the whole community.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance performs on a larger scale exactly the same kind of function.  He finds, for instance, that he has a few million pounds' worth of stock which is now giving him only interest.  He sells it and regards it as income.  He has done that to the extent of many millions of pounds.  Some American once wrote a story.  &ldquo;The man who stole the National Debt.&rdquo;  The Minister for Finance, in the pretence of balancing his Budget for the last few years, has in fact stolen the national debt.  He has put to current expenses purposes capital resources equal to what he stated to be the net national debt.  No doubt, as he says now, he is coming to the end of his landlady's furniture.  He will have either to live on his income or get out. I have an idea that the Minister for <Col N="1281" /> Finance is budgeting for a deficit next year.  I think he knows what is coming to him and to those who supported him here, and he has decided to leave the cupboard absolutely bare for his successor, having sold out everything that was of movable value.  This Budget is not honest. It is not as dishonest as some of the previous ones, because there was less movable property to be disposed of. When the Minister for Finance has reached the stage that there is no movable property then he will be honest and remove himself, as my friend behind says.  It is not the worst of his Budgets.  It would be an inspired thing if he could repeat some of his expedients in this Budget.</P>
    <P>This Budget will not contribute in any way, as far as I can see, to the increase of any industrial activity in the country.  There is no suggestion whatever of any encouragement. He has up his sleeve, which he ought to have included with the £563,000 advances to the Unemployment Fund, a petrol tax with which he hopes to buy some support in some subsequent by-elections on the pretence that he is going to de-rate. Apart from that he seems now to have reached his limit.  A man with no sense of responsibility or of sound finance has now apparently reached the end of his tether.  Personally, I hope the end of that tether will come soon.  A Minister for Finance is not merely an accountant; he is not merely a person charged with the duty of keeping books; he is charged with the duty of organising the finance and resources of the country so as to stimulate wealth production in the country.  There is no sign whatever of any such purpose or intention in this Budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Clery Mr. Clery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clery</NameTxt>
      <P>To me, at any rate, the Minister's statement yesterday in introducing the Budget was disappointing, and I am of opinion that it will be read with very great disappointment throughout the country in general.  In listening to the Minister yesterday, I felt that I was listening to a tired man who had very little energy and certainly no <Col N="1282" /> enthusiasm to face up to the situation that exists in the country to-day. There were, in the past year at any rate, many suggestions as to how certain economies could be effected in administration.  Perhaps there were so many that the Minister got bewildered and rather than face up to the situation he threw up his hands in despair and decided to leave things as they were.  During the past year we have read discussions in the papers as to the taxable capacity of the people of this State. I followed the discussions as closely as I could but, unfortunately, I found myself, after I had read them, in a greater mess than before.  I felt that the Minister might give some indication in his Budget statement as to what our taxable capacity is.  It surely is a thing which cannot very well be passed over by Deputies.  I think some authoritative statement should be made on that matter.  Does the Minister for Finance hold that we have not yet reached the limit of our taxable capacity or does he think that we have overreached it?  I think that matter, in a young State of this kind, should be considered.  The Minister, for instance, stated that we could not expect for years to come to have social services in this State up to the standard of other countries that are longer established.  That is quite reasonable, but my impression is that it is only certain social services which are of benefit to the ordinary taxpayer of this country that are to be inferior to other countries.  At the same time we are to have what might be termed governmental luxuries which are far ahead of similar institutions in other countries, particularly when we take into account the wealth-producing resources of other countries compared with ours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister can certainly not claim as he did yesterday that he has reached the bedrock of economy as regards certain services under Government control.  He stated yesterday that it was impossible to make any further economies in certain Departments.  I think that before this Budget was introduced we might at least have had a report <Col N="1283" /> from this Economy Committee which was set up some years ago by the Government.  We should at least know what they have done and if they have come to the conclusion, as stated by Mr. Blythe yesterday, that no further economies in certain services are possible and that it was wrong and might be a loss in the long run to reduce certain individuals' salaries, Ministers' or others. We had the statement by the Minister that excluding teachers, police and army, the salaried list of this State amounts to 16.5 per cent. of our total estimated expenditure, both Central Fund and Supply.  I think that is rather high.  I have found that it is very much higher than the estimated expenditure in at least one other State.  I think the Economy Committee cannot claim to have done its duty while leaving that position as it is.  Of course if we had a statement from that Committee we would know if they had considered this question and we might view it from a different standpoint altogether.  I think it is unfair of the Minister to forestall the Economy Committee's report and state that he has reached the bedrock of economy in that respect.  We are aware that economy is being practised very rigidly in certain services.  Take for instance Old Age Pensions or the Land Commission or Public Works.  I find that very rigid economy and praiseworthy economy from a Government point of view is being practised in those Departments.  I could appreciate that economy very well if the same economy were practised in other Government services, but I find that the more economy they practise in services that give the greatest public assistance and that are of the greatest interest to the people, the more lavish they are in dealing out public funds to certain other petted services of the Government.</P>
    <P>It cannot be claimed on this question of economy that the Government, by a pure accident a few years ago, when it established itself, hit the happy medium.  Surely that would <Col N="1284" /> be too much for them to claim, and when they could have a show-down on the question of old age pensions and other matters, I think it is only reasonable for us to claim that they could have a show-down on the Departments. At least we might expect a statement from the Minister as to what economy was attempted in certain Departments, in what we claim to be overpaid services.</P>
    <P>The chief thing which I want to emphasise in connection with the Minister's statement yesterday is the fact that for the coming year the total amount to be expended on Gaeltacht services amounts to only £87,000.  This is the first time we have got the amount that is to be expended on all Gaeltacht services for the coming year.  I think that is very unfair to the congested districts in the West of Ireland.  If only £87,000 is to be expended in Gaeltacht services, taking into consideration the new Gaeltacht Housing Act. taking into consideration also the long-promised measure for fishery development, I do not think we can get much ahead in the coming year. My impression is that from County Mayo alone applications have already been lodged for the major portion of the money under the Gaeltacht Housing Act.  Again, in the Gaeltacht services I find that there is the extraordinary amount of £37,000 &mdash;it may be a few hundred pounds more or less&mdash;to be expended in the coming year on salaries, sea fisheries protection, and travelling expenses, leaving only £50,000 for the Gaeltacht services.  Surely there is something wrong there.  I think that the Minister for Finance, realising that we have been promised some measure for the development of the fishery industry and that we have the Gaeltacht Housing Act already in operation, is not dealing fairly with the Gaeltacht services in the congested districts in that respect. I did expect, too, that at least the recent Government defeat in this House on a certain measure would have had some effect upon the Minister when he was preparing his Budget. Surely it is not too much for us to expect that the moral effect at <Col N="1285" /> least of that defeat should have been reflected in the Budget which the Minister was preparing at the time.</P>
    <P>I think that the time should have come, at least if the Government is to learn any lesson at all, when the Minister should make some effort when introducing his Budget to come nearer to the wishes of the majority of this House and to come nearer to the requirements of the ordinary people of the country.  I am of the opinion that no effort at all has been made in that respect.  The Government seem always to be anxious to cater for the people who are very well able to look after themselves. You have people in the Gaeltacht and in the congested districts tied down absolutely within a very narrow margin.  You have the statement that a large number of Civic Guards are to be kept in these districts to watch the people for whatever breaches of the law they may be tempted to commit.  I think that, generally speaking, the Minister has made no effort whatever to extract revenue from the people in a manner which might be said to give justice to every section of the community. We have, of course, fresh taxation this year&mdash;a tax of £10 on travelling shops.  That is a thing I am opposed to.  If I could feel that the Minister's idea in imposing that £10 tax on lorries doing business in the country was to make some endeavour to bring back to the smaller towns what they had lost in trade I would view it from a different standpoint, but my impression is that this tax on the travelling shop will not make the least difference to the smaller towns in the West of Ireland or perhaps in any part of the country.  Surely if this pays a merchant, if he is energetic enough to do business in the modern fashion as it is done in other countries, he can easily obtain by some means or other the £10 that will enable him to do so.  I believe that this will be of little benefit to the business people in the towns, and that the tax is levied because it is a very simple method of collecting revenue. That is as it appears to me. It has been stated here that people were delighted when they read the <Col N="1286" /> Minister's statement with regard to this proposal, but I believe that it has been received with as great disappointment, and possibly with greater disappointment, than they recently received the news of the return of President Cosgrave to power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been wondering for some little time past during this debate what is the matter with the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, because during some of the speeches there were only two members of that Party in the House, and they were not even members of the Party; they were attached Independents.  There was only one Minister present, and he was obviously interested in maps, or some other matter which had nothing to do with the subject.  I have a sort of feeling of sympathy with the Minister for Finance because he received so little support from his own Party in the defence of his Budget.  If his Party felt strongly in favour of his Budget they would certainly have attempted to answer the very telling criticism of it which has come from these benches.  I have no doubt that Deputy Gorey will take the opportunity of defending the Budget, on which he has been so silent up to this.  The only interpretation I can put upon this continued silence of the Government Party and its various sub-parties&mdash;they are in a rather indescribable condition at the moment, and I think they will be in a more indescribable condition after the next election&mdash;is that the Fianna Fáil policy of tariffs has won a complete victory, and that only the consideration of holding the Government Party together, on the principle of hanging together for fear that they might be hanged separately, has prevented them from expressing frankly their views on the question of tariffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The modern State must take up an attitude on economic matters quite different from the attitude taken up by States of 100 or 150 years ago. There was a time when all that a Minister for Finance had to consider was the levying of taxation for the purpose of paying for certain <Col N="1287" /> essential services.  Now a Minister for Finance is in a different world in a sense, on account of syndicates, trusts, cartels, and so on, great companies whose turnover, whose actual income in a year even, is sometimes equal to the revenue of the State, and especially in the case of a small State, the responsibilities of a Minister for Finance extend far beyond the mere matter of levying taxation. He has to protect the individuality of that State, and the rights of the individual within that State.  Most countries at present carry out that duty by way of tariffs.  They protect the individual and they protect the State against the invasion of enormous economic interests which would wreck the State.  Europe is full of examples of that sort of thing being done, and on the other hand, the greatest example of where it was not done was in Ireland during the nineteenth century, when absolute wreckage was created because we had not got the power of framing our own finances in such a way as would protect the economic interests of the people and of the individual.</P>
    <P>One has only to compare the time of the Repeal Clubs when Davis had a great audience in Ireland to write for and to speak to.  At that time there were in every town and village small industries which were supplying the needs of the people, such as nail-making and other small industries. The men working these industries were all independent.  They had leisure, and a capacity for giving themselves in their leisure time to the interests of the nation.  Because Ireland had not got the governmental machinery at that time to protect its economic interests, these industries were destroyed by the economic policy imposed by the predominant interests in England.  In the actual results of government, there is no difference since 1921; there is no difference in the economic history of the wreckage of this country, there is no change from that period in the 19th century, and the Minister for Finance is largely to blame.  I do not say that he is entirely to blame.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1288" /> I think I have noticed indications of an attempt on his part to do the right thing, but it has been checked by other Departments.  I can take a very small example of that.  It was quite obvious from what the Minister said last year that he would have liked to give exemption&mdash;and this is probably one of the smallest concessions asked for&mdash;or, rather, a drawback on motor parts coming into this country which would be made into motor cars here.  Such a concession as that would not have done any harm.  It could not have done any harm to the revenue; it could not have done any harm to those people who are taking advantage of the protective tariff for the purpose of making the parts here, and there are a certain number of workshops scattered here and there that are making parts.  But the reason given by the Minister is the worst criticism of his own attitude.  He says he does not know of any companies that would do it, that it would only be done on a small scale.  Well, if it was only done on a small scale it could not interfere with the other industry of making parts, it could not interfere with the amount of revenue coming into the country, while the effect would be very gradual, and when the time came if these companies found it was to their interests to buy parts made in this country, they would immediately switch over to doing so, rather than introduce the parts from other countries, because the freight would be saved, and it would be handier for them to get what they wanted on the spot.  Here there was an opportunity of creating a small industry. Small industries would have sprung up in this case just as they have done in other cases where tariffs have been put on, such as furniture.  The Minister, although quite satisfied to consider the matter favourably last year, apparently referred it to some other Department, which turned it down.  I guess it must have been the Department of Industry and Commerce, because when I mentioned the matter yesterday he said that the application should be made to that Department.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1289" /> Now, that particular application was made to that Department at least two years ago and no satisfaction was received from it.  Apparently, there is some influence working which is preventing the development of small industries and which is sacrificing the individual in this country to much greater interests outside the country.  Even the Government Party is apparently realising that there is something so radically wrong in the financial policy of the Government that its members are not prepared to get up in the House to defend the Minister.</P>
    <P>It would be quite possible for two parallel Budgets to be framed by a Minister and to produce the same amount of taxation, and while one Budget would have a wrecking effect on the prosperity of the nation the other Budget, producing about the same amount of money, would have the effect of fostering industry.  My criticism is not directed so much to the amount of money produced, as to the quality of the Budget.  I need not go over the ground that has been gone over already.  I will merely say, in a general way, that the Budget is not one to help the small man to progress, the small man with initiative who, if he had an opportunity, would remain in the country. On the other hand, you have a pathetic, hat-in-hand policy towards rich persons who left this country, or towards persons who, the Minister thinks, might come to live here.  I do not object to anybody coming to live in Ireland provided he is going to carry out the duties of citizenship in a proper way.  What I do object to is a policy which tends towards paying so much attention to the rich people, and which neglects the interests of the poorer people, which will not encourage the poor man with a large family by giving proper rebates on income-tax, which will not aim at developing small industries, but which, on the other hand, looks to getting revenue by reducing income tax and super tax, and thereby inducing rich people to come back to this country.  A Minister for Finance should aim at improving the quality of the life of the people, should aim <Col N="1290" /> at distributive justice, to see that prosperity is well spread over the whole people.  A happy country is a country where the people are more or less upon equal terms financially; the most unhappy country in the world is the country where there is a small class with an enormous amount of riches, and a large class with very little of the goods of this world.</P>
    <P>No doubt the Minister is handicapped by the fact that an important portion of the area of taxation of this country is excluded from his jurisdiction. There are six counties from which the Minister can draw no taxation. Taxation has been levied on the Six Counties amounting to £10,000,000. If, under the one Government, the cost of governing these six counties could not add more than we will say&mdash;and this is making a generous estimate&mdash;an extra £5,000,000, that would leave for the benefit of the country £5,000,000, or we will say less than £5,000,000.  At any rate it would be a considerable relief and would afford opportunities for a great reduction in taxation.  It is important in these debates always to remind the Minister of the economic effects of partition.  Goods coming through Belfast, and coming down here, must necessarily in price be subject to double taxation. Ultimately, the consumer is the person who pays a very large proportion of all taxes.  The person who handles the goods coming through Belfast has to pay a certain amount of tax.  What that person pays asserts itself in the price of the goods coming through.  The person selling the goods here must allow, consciously or unconsciously for the tax, and so the consumer has to bear, in the price that he pays for the goods, this double taxation.  I do not know whether the Minister is likely to make any general change in policy, but certainly the country will not be able to stand, for another five years this completely negative policy for which he and his party have been hitherto responsible.</P>

      <P>I am not in the least disappointed in the Minister's Budget this year because I expected <Col N="1291" /> nothing else.  I did not expect that he was going to do anything whatsoever for the agricultural community. I had hoped, when I saw Deputy Gorey getting up, that he was going to make some appeal for the party which he once represented in this House, namely the Farmers' Party. I do not know exactly what Deputy Gorey represents now, for he changed from the Farmers' Party and joined the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, but lo and behold! to-day apparently on account of a new alliance he spoke from the Front Labour Benches.</P>
      <P>Apparently he has now become a Labour representative.  I do not know whether the Labour Party is to be congratulated or not, but I was amazed when I heard no word from Deputy Gorey with regard to the present position of the farming community, no appeal from him that the farming community should at least be placed in as favourable a position as their colleagues and fellow-farmers across the Border.  Deputy Gorey was only concerned to-day with cricket.  I can easily picture Deputy Gorey marching down Grafton Street in white duck trousers, with shin guards and rubber gloves and canvas shoes and a yellow shirt.  I think the Minister for Finance and the customs officials ought to be congratulated in saving us from that.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister ought to be congratulated in saving us from that.  Last year I made an appeal to the Minister for Finance to look for revenue from the large amount of agricultural produce that is brought into this country.  But, apparently, those who paid so freely to the election fund of Cumann na nGaedheal and who are expected to pay freely in the future have a right to call the tune.  Messrs. Guinness, for instance, who in the year 1928 imported into this country barley to the value of £120,000, in the year 1929 imported barley to the value of <Col N="1292" /> £220,000&mdash;an increase of £100,000 worth on the quantity of barley they imported the year previous.  That barley is brought in here to compete against the barley which the Irish farmer produces.  The Minister for Finance, apparently, was put in here by the funds of Guinness and his crowd to stand by and not attempt to put a tariff on foreign barley that is brought in here to compete against what the Irish farmer produces.  I suppose that is only what we are to expect.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has thrown out one sop, one sprat, to catch the mackerel in Longford-Westmeath. He tells us that he is holding over the tax on petrol until he gets the result of the De-rating Commission.  That is the sop that he is throwing out to the farmers of Longford and Westmeath to swallow.  I noticed that when the Farmers' Union Party made their case at the De-rating Commission they did not put forward one single plea&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I intend to refer now to sources of revenue that the Minister for Finance might turn to when looking for funds to de-rate the farmers of the country.  In the year 1929 we imported bacon into this country to the value of £1,627,000. This morning I met one of the farmers' representatives in this House&mdash;Deputy White.  He was bewailing the price that he was getting for potatoes.  We all know very well that at the present time you cannot get anything like a price for potatoes in the Twenty-six Counties. The Ulster farmers, however, are alive to the situation.  In the year 1928 they imported £39,000 worth of potatoes across the Border, while the <Col N="1293" /> figure this year is £65,000.  The farmers across the Border who have no rates to pay and whose annuities go to the relief of taxation can send potatoes to the value of £65,000 across the Border to compete with the potatoes that are grown by our farmers who have to pay their land annuities over to John Bull through the generosity of the Minister for Finance, as well as £67,000 for collecting them, and, in addition, £2,100,000 a year in rates.  Why does not our Minister for Finance say that he will put 4/- in the £ on potatoes coming in here across the Border, and let that go to the relief of the taxation the farmers have to pay?  He will not do that.  That, as he would say, would prevent the North from coming in some day.  In 1929 we imported butter into this country to the value of £360,000. We all know that butter is a drug on the market at the present day. Despite that, in February of this year £34,000 worth of butter was imported into the Free State.  The Minister for Finance has made no attempt whatever to put a tariff on foreign butter coming in here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are looking for sources of revenue.  There are plenty of sources of revenue.  £7,249,000 worth of agricultural produce comes into this country every year.  There is a source of revenue in that.  Two shillings in the £ on that imported agricultural produce would yield £780,000, which could go towards de-rating.  That imported produce is, of course, in competition with what we produce here, and the revenue which would be derived from a tax upon it would enable the Minister to make some provision for the relief of the farmers of this country.  Apparently the Minister for Finance is going to hang on until the farmers are down and out, and in fact they are already down and out.  He considers that when he has gagged the six farmers here with a job he can do what he likes with the farming community. It is time the Minister was brought to his senses.  The importation of agricultural produce into this unfortunate country is a scandal, and <Col N="1294" /> worse than a scandal.  If the Irish farmer exported his butter to Australia, the Minister knows the tariff he would have to pay on the butter going into that country.  Still Australia, New Zealand and Canadian butter is brought in here and put into competition with the butter in the home market without a single attempt by the Minister for Finance to prevent it.</P>
    <P>We heard a lot about economy from the Minister for Finance when he was speaking on the Budget. Apparently he thinks it is right that the gentlemen with £1,500 a year should have a war bonus of £206, to help them to live, out of the pockets of the unfortunate farmer, who has to work and slave and drag to keep body and soul together at present. Then we have the Department of External Affairs costing about £58,000, and the expenditure upon which is gradually increasing.  What is it for?  What do these ambassadors abroad represent?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend dealing with any of these Estimates if I am not allowed to deal with one in particular.  All I have to say is that the manner in which this money is being expended is a scandal, and the manner in which the farming community are being treated by this House is a bigger scandal still.  If the Minister for Finance was back where he was in 1914, travelling in Cork county, and if he visited the farmers whose hospitality he enjoyed <Col N="1295" /> in 1914 and 1915, he would realise that at present they cannot afford to put even a plate of butter before him.  He should realise that he has starved those farmers out of existence, and he need not think that because he has gagged the so-called Farmers' Party here he is going to be allowed to get away with it, for he is not.  If the Minister is not prepared to come forward to the relief of the farming community to put them in at least the same financial position or give them the same opportunity of competing even in our home market with those people who have no rates to pay and whose annuities go to the relief of taxation, then let him get out, for the farming community in the country will not allow themselves to be squeezed out by him.  They have been long enough the hewers of wood and the drawers of water for all the pensioners the Minister for Finance has piled upon us for the last five years.  It is about time he realised the position.  I have no doubt we will find that in Longford-Westmeath they are working overtime to produce a new lot of Army pensioners&mdash;buckshee generals who will have to be pensioned, and we will have something on the lines of the Monaghan scandal that was exposed here a short time ago.  It is time that was stopped.  We are not going to allow the farming community to work and slave in order that the Minister may turn out a few gentlemen with a gratuity of £3,000 and £300 a year, and if he is not going to stop it here we will get other means to stop it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. B. Maguire Mr. B. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the disappointments in the Budget speech to me was the statement that no further reduction in the way of expenditure was possible.  Having regard to the fact that we have had statements made in the House from time to time by the Minister for Agriculture that further progress in the development of the farming community was not to be anticipated, and that a somewhat similar statement was made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce so far as <Col N="1296" /> his Department is concerned, I think the Minister's Budget statement must have very serious consequences. In the earlier years when Budgets were introduced here we were buoyed up with the hope that perhaps development in the industrial prosperity of the country would enable us to meet the exorbitant demands of the Budgets.  Our Ministers have had seven or eight years of experience in the administration of their Departments, and it is disappointing to get from them the statements we have had.  It is a disappointment to hear from the Minister for Agriculture that there is no possibility of the development of agriculture along the lines which he has advocated since he took up office. Suggestions have been made outside the House, which I think have received support from this and smaller Parties in the House, that a change of policy in the Department of Agriculture is desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To the advocacy of increased tillage and a departure from the present policy of the production of commodities for export, the Minister for Agriculture and the majority Party here have consistently been in opposition.  They have refused to listen to reasonable argument which advocates a change of their policy.  Without alteration, they have stuck to the theories put forward by the Minister for Agriculture. The only solution, according to the Minister, for the development of the agricultural industry, is along the lines he indicates.  These lines have, from time to time, involved the people of the country in taxation amounting to a very considerable sum.  Above all other things, the Minister strongly recommended and secured the support of the House for the development of creameries, and the result is that the people of the country, during the last five or six years, found themselves in the unfortunate position that they had to expend a considerable sum in capital expenditure.  In view of the depreciated conditions the farmers are left in a very insecure position.  The circumstances which have faced us here within the <Col N="1297" /> last few years show clearly that the policy advocated by the Government has never been a sound policy.  Even the Government's own supporters cannot honestly regard it as a satisfactory policy.</P>
    <P>Similarly, any progress in the way of industrial development is handicapped. In my part of the country there are mineral resources which are capable of producing great wealth.  Since my earliest days I have heard of the possibilities of these mineral resources.  Many men have spoken of the wealth that could be produced from those mineral resources under proper management. I was present at a meeting at which the President of the Executive Council spoke, and he referred to those mineral resources as possessing wonderful prospects for the country as a whole.  For years I have been looking forward to the time when those mineral resources would be utilised for the advancement of the country, and I was never more disappointed than during the last three or four weeks, when I found that the Department of Industry and Commerce had definitely turned down any hopes that existed of utilising the mineral deposits in that part of the country.  They apparently regard the whole thing as a fallacy, for they have discarded the railway line put down by the British Government in 1918 at an expenditure of £50,000.  The railway line was connected with the locality in which the mineral deposits lie. That method of transport was regarded by the Department of Industry and Commerce as unnecessary. The railway line was lifted, and all hope of developing our mineral resources there&mdash;resources which the President of the Executive Council referred to ten or twelve years ago and had great prospects in mind for &mdash;has been shattered.</P>
    <P>We have these two Departments of State going on wrong lines, and I think the time has come when some change of policy should be introduced. The Department of Agriculture is operating along the lines advocated by the Minister as essential lines of progress.  Practical experience <Col N="1298" /> of those lines has proved that the farmers are up against a solid rock and many of them have been brought to the position that they are handicapped by overhead charges which they will not be able to bear in view of the depreciated prices.  We find that the possibility of industrial development is negatived, as instanced in the case I have given of the mineral resources of Leitrim, which were at one time regarded as a practical certainty and which were put forward as one strong reason why we should fight for independence so that our immense natural resources could be developed to the country's advantage. The responsible authorities here have withdrawn all transport facilities and definitely put an end to any hope of utilising the resources there.</P>
    <P>Since there is no possibility of expansion in the matter of agriculture or industrial development, is it not time that the Minister for Finance cut his coat according to his cloth and reduced his enormous Budget? He should realise that this is a poor country.  His Budgets in past years have been responsible for driving into bankruptcy many business men, and surely he should cease to continue along the road that has meant bankruptcy for business people. His policy has also affected other sections of the community to the extent that they find it hard now to exist.  One hope that the Minister for Finance held out yesterday was that by keeping the income tax low the richer elements would be encouraged to come back to this country.  He believed that people who had never been here would come to live here by reason of the lower income tax.  I will add my voice to the numerous voices raised on this side of the House and I will say that if that is the only inspiration the Minister for Finance had when he was preparing his Budget &mdash;that by keeping the income tax at a lower level than in England rich men would be induced to come to live in this country&mdash;then he has very clearly declared his policy.  I <Col N="1299" /> think that the Minister should have taken up a totally different attitude. He should have considered the possibility of developing our resources and he should have considered the interests of the working man, the business man and the farmer as of far more importance than the holding out of any baits to be given at the expense of the people in order to encourage outsiders to come to live here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies have suggested that a Budget which does not contain great changes in taxation indicates a negative economic policy. That suggestion arises apparently from the belief that some Deputies on the other side of the House must hold, that by changing taxation about the troubles which this country, in common with other countries suffer from can be cured. I admit that harm can be done by placing a particular load of taxation in a particular way, and some good may be done by placing the same load of taxation in another way. But the benefits that can be got from changes in taxation are, relatively, small and indirect.  They are benefits in the way of giving opportunities to individuals who are in charge of industries, or who may take charge of industries, to develop and expand those industries.  The policy of the Government in regard to tariffs, as opposed to the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party in regard to tariffs, is well known and I do not think I need go into it again.  But I would just like to deny what members on the other side have asserted by implication, at least, that because some particular employment that might be given if there were a high tariff is not being given in consequence of that tariff not having been imposed, a national loss has necessarily resulted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Reilly quoted me as having said that tariffs are an investment. I do not remember the occasion on which I said that, but I am quite prepared to say that tariffs are an investment.  And some tariffs may be a bad investment, a very bad <Col N="1300" /> investment, and not to be justified. Almost all tariffs, and tariffs in the bulk, are an investment in the sense that expenditure has to be incurred in order to attain an end.  Tariffs will give us increased employment. Tariffs, broadly speaking, impose extra charges on the people.  Any extra charge is liable to decrease production and employment somewhere else.  Any charge of a substantial nature is bound to decrease employment and production.  What we feel has to be weighed in relation to any tariff, where it can be weighed, is whether or not the employment that will be given as a result of that tariff will or will not be outweighed by the loss of employment which will result from the burden that that tariff is likely to throw on the people.  I have admitted that, in certain cases, tariffs impose no burden on the people.  In that respect, the tariffs on cigarettes and tobacco and others can be mentioned; but, broadly speaking, the position is that tariffs throw a burden on the people and that burden decreases production and employment. On the other hand, the tariff causes employment in the industry to which it is applied.  The mere fact that some employment has been lost in a particular industry or that there has been a failure to give employment in a particular industry because a tariff was not imposed does not necessarily prove that there was any national loss at all in that respect.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee asked what was the present value of the items representing advances to the Electricity Supply Board and expenditure on the Shannon scheme.  I believe the present value is par.  I believe that, if we were prepared to dispose of the Shannon scheme to a private corporation to be run as a business concern, the money that has been expended in connection with it could be got at the purchase price.  It is true that the shannon scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt the Minister to ask would not that presuppose that the purchasing corporation would have the same monopoly <Col N="1301" /> powers as the present Supply Board, so that you would be selling not your investment but your monopoly rights, for which you do not take any credit at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Monopoly rights to be included in a certain purchase price. In my opinion, the assets represented by these figures may be taken at the amount at which I give them.  There might be, in respect of some of the minor items, some small depreciation, but in the big figures the actual value is not less than the value represented by the figures, and there is nothing that would materially alter the total.  Deputy MacEntee asked why I did not include the capital value represented by the land annuities in my statement with regard to debt.  I did not include it because the liability in respect of land annuities is a contingent liability. If I had included it, it would not have altered the net total, because against the capital value on the one side would have been set the aggregate of the advances owed by the farmers, and the position would not have been altered.  So far as the local loans are concerned, if they had been included and if any change had been made, the change would have been by way of reducing the figure of the net debt, because the capitalised value of the £600,000, which is payable for twenty years, is less than the value of the loans outstanding on the other side, which have not been taken into account.  The position would not, if I had included these figures, have been altered.  The figures of the net debt certainly would not have been increased.  The Deputy asked why a capital sum to represent certain pensions was not included in the figures of liabilities. That would be completely absurd. As I pointed out to somebody in the Seanad who raised the same question, you might as well put a figure in for the capital value of the old age pensions which are at present being paid.  To put in a capital figure in your total debt to represent pension liabilities would be preposterous. Deputy MacEntee said that he wanted to make life as attractive <Col N="1302" /> here for the young people as it is in other countries.  That is contrary to the policy of his great leader, who wants the hair-shirt policy, another standard of life, and to put a stone or a brass wall around the country</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So the Minister says.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, most people so understood his words, and he certainly indicated that we were not to have the standards of life here that people have in other countries.  If we are not to have the same standards of life as people have in other countries, I do not see how we can make life as attractive here for the young people as it is elsewhere.  The task of doing that, as I hope Deputy MacEntee realises, is a very great task, and it is one which involves, not some further loading of productivity with charges for new social services, but the development of industry and agricultural production here.  Things that are necessary to make life attractive here cannot be got without adding on charges for social services.  In all countries in the world, as a matter of fact, we have the tendency to fly from rural areas to the cities.  One of the attractions of life in other countries that take our young people away is their urban character.  If we are to take this aspiration of Deputy MacEntee in its full sense, one of the ways to make life in this country as attractive for young people as it is for young people in other countries would be to provide urban life and urban employment for them.  The task that Deputy MacEntee says that we must discharge, and which I say is a task which we ought to have before us and discharge as well and rapidly as may be, is a very big task indeed.  It is not a task that is going to be solved by any attempt to get out of paying liabilities which are justly due.  It is not going to be solved by any attempt to hold on to land annuities which are at present being paid by the farmers of the Free State in return for the advances received by them.  I do not say, if we could get away with something <Col N="1303" /> like that, that the money might not be spent here in very many useful ways, but I assert, as I have asserted outside, that there is not the slightest chance of our being able to avoid it, that there are means of enforcing the payment of debts justly due by us.  There are easy means of doing that, and we would suffer what any person suffers who is called upon to pay a just debt and will not pay it.  He is ultimately obliged to pay with costs added.  I am satisfied that that would be the result of the attempt to stop the payment which Deputy MacEntee says should be stopped.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee also referred to expenditure on the Army and another Deputy referred to that expenditure also and to the development of the reserve and other forms of defence than a standing army. He seemed to think that getting the defence force on to a volunteer basis would of itself mean a great decrease in the present figure.  I do not think that it would.  It would not mean anything like the big decrease which the Deputy who talked about it had in mind.  It would not avoid the expenditure on buildings or other overhead charges.  It might, in fact, mean a greater expenditure on buildings and in other directions.  With regard to the use of the Army, apart from the protection of the State against internal attack. I think it is clear that just as an army of a small country cannot beat an army of a big country, an army of a small country can be in a position, as armies of small countries have been before, to offer resistance which would rob of attraction an attack on that small country. That is all that the army of any small country can do, and most small countries do not think it wise at present to depend merely on the good international morals of their neighbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass referred to a statement which I made last year that there would be very few items for segregation as abnormal or nonrecurrent except the amount that <Col N="1304" /> would be advanced to the Local Loans Fund.  I hoped last year that still more rapid progress than has been made would have been made with the discharge of the remaining liabilities in respect of compensation. When that liability in respect of compensation during the troubled times has been disposed of, when the reconstruction of public buildings that were destroyed during those years has been completed, for all practical purposes nothing will remain in this list of deducted items except the advances to the Local Loans Fund or other items that are repayable, in so far as they may be repayable, such as expenditure on the improvement of estates by the Land Commission.  It is perfectly true that you could always find abnormal items which would not recur but which would be replaced in subsequent years by similar items. There are a great number of such items in the Estimates for this year. I have not picked them out.  I have continued, in so far as they remain in the Estimates, those items which were segregated in former years, with one exception, namely, the new broadcasting station.</P>
    <P>I selected it because we are getting, and will get, out of broadcasting reception enough money to pay for the running of that station, for the programme, and for depreciation. If we had not a broadcasting station I do not think that we could continue to charge these particular taxes.  We certainly could hardly charge the licence duty, and when the import duty on wireless apparatus was first imposed the opinion of the whole House was that it should be devoted to a better broadcasting service.  I undertook, as soon as plans could be made, that we would devote it to that purpose.  Because of that undertaking, which was desired by the Dáil and given by me, there is enough revenue arising out of broadcasting to pay for the station and the running of it, and I have set it down as a capital item. Subject to the fact that the time may be a little longer than I anticipated, the position remains that in a very short time there will be little <Col N="1305" /> remaining for segregation as abnormal, except advances like those to the Local Loans Fund which will go to local authorities, which are repayable by them, and which certainly ought to be provided by borrowing and not by raising taxation.</P>
    <P>There is another item which I should mention, namely, the expenditure on forestry.  The best information that we can get is that forestry, with the rates of interest as they are at present, is about half economic. If the rates of interest were about half what they are at present, forestry would be an economic proposition. Acting on that information, I have deducted half the cost of creating State woodlands as capital expenditure which might be borrowed, the other half, representing the uneconomic factor in forestry, being met out of revenue. Deputy Lemass referred again to champagne, earls, millionaires and sycophancy.  We are not afraid of any development of sycophancy in this country.  I do not think that there is any natural disposition among our people towards sycophancy. There are people who can be polite and civil to strangers without being corrupted and without being demoralised or denationalised by them.  As I say, I do not think that there is the slightest danger of a development in that direction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shaw asked when the new Betting Bill would be introduced. It has already been partly drafted. Its completion was really delayed by pressure in connection with the Greater Dublin Bill and the Vocational Education Bill, but I think that the draftsman will shortly be able to give his attention to it and to complete it.  With regard to the tax on bets laid with bookmakers on race courses, I do not know whether the recommendation made a year ago does not require reconsideration in view of the introduction of the totalisator.  In any event, the totalisator will have to pay to the Exchequer two-and-a-half per cent. on bets made with it.  I do not know whether there is any case for exempting a bookmaker who is competing <Col N="1306" /> with the totalisator from paying the two-and-a-half per cent. tax towards the State.</P>
    <P>Returning again to the remarks of Deputy Lemass, I admit that the completion of the report on the application for the coach-building tariff was delayed by the fact that the Tariff Commission took up the Grain Inquiry.  It had been hoped that the delay would not be as great as it proved to be.  It was unfortunate, but I do not think it would have been easy to find a body as suitable for the Grain Inquiry, which was a matter of consequence, as the Tariff Commission.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig and other Deputies spoke as if we had reduced income tax with a view to inducing people of wealth to return to the country or to come to it for the first time. That is an entirely incorrect assumption, and it is an assumption, for which nothing that I have said can be held responsible. There is no question of lowering income tax this year at all.  The question that arose was a question of raising the standard rate for certain reasons.  When we reduced income tax to 3/- in the £, we reduced it with a view to stimulating industry and stimulating the employment of money in business and in industry here, in the hope of ultimately getting greater production and greater employment.  We hoped to get a direct benefit for certain industries and businesses, and for those industries and businesses which would not obtain a direct benefit we hoped to get a certain indirect benefit by an increase of confidence and by some stimulation of enterprise. When the income tax was reduced to 3/-, we had no idea of what the British tax would be in the same year, because our Budget was introduced that year before the British Budget.  We had no idea that it would be reduced that year or subsequently.</P>
    <P>To induce people to come in here was not our object.  It was before us previously, when we made certain adjustments in connection with death duties and in connection with <Col N="1307" /> super tax, but when we found our income tax was lower than the British tax we realised that, to some extent at least, the difference would certainly bring people here.  Now that the difference is greater, we believe that its effect will be greater and that more people may come in and bring capital, spending power and revenue-producing capacity with them.  We do not want to reduce the effect that that difference might have by altering the rate at the present stage.  Amongst other things, in order that the possibility of such people coming in may not be diminished, we do not want to raise the tax at the present time.</P>
    <P>We do not want to raise the tax, either, because we believe that on the business psychology, which is undoubtedly pessimistic in this country, the raising of the standard rate would have a bad effect and would tend to reduce enterprise. Our object in connection with income-tax has been really to get industry and employment here, recognising that employment cannot be produced to any great extent by the State and that if we want the State to give employment we have to get another organisation altogether. We would want to get fundamental alterations for which there is no demand and no support in the country. If employment has to be provided by private individuals or companies then we wish to create an atmosphere in which there will be the greatest activity possible.  Deputy Derrig drew our attention to Australian precedents.  I do not know whether every difficulty which they have in Australia has been solved by what they have done.  Deputy Derrig would lead us to think that if we had introduced high tariffs everything would be lovely.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gorey asked about the scope of the apparel duty.  I think there is no doubt that gloves are apparel and that the duty must be charged on them.  The other articles may seem to be in the nature of borderline cases, but it is for the Revenue Commissioners, after legal <Col N="1308" /> advice, to judge.  Their decision can be tested in the courts if anybody feels strongly enough about it to test it.  Subject to interpretation by the courts, the interpretation of the scope of tariffs, like tariffs on wearing apparel, is a question for the Revenue Commissioners, having obtained legal advice on the matter. When we impose tariffs of a wide scope, like tariffs on wearing apparel or tariffs on wooden furniture&mdash;that is, furniture wholly or partly made of wood&mdash;there are bound to be many borderline cases, but I do not think it would be a good thing to fill our Acts with whole schedules of exemptions.  After all, the hardship is not very great in any of these cases.</P>
    <P>Deputy Little made a suggestion that there should be a repayment of duty on motor parts imported for the purpose of building them into motor-cars, and he commented on the attitude of the Department of Industry and Commerce in regard to the matter.  He suggested that the Department were hostile to small industries. The Deputy had no foundation for making such a suggestion. The point is that his proposal instead of leading automatically, as he suggested, to the use of parts made in the Saorstát; would preclude the use of parts made in the Saorstát.  They certainly are unlikely to be made here as cheaply as outside and the industry would not at all develop along the lines which Deputy Little suggested.  If a car-assembling industry could be built up here, or if there were any indications that there were people who would make a start that might lead to the building of a car-assembling industry here, that would deserve consideration, but it would be a matter of much greater adjustment than Deputy Little suggested. It would mean the adjustment of the duties on cars so that there might not be almost immediately a drop in revenue of a considerable amount.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry thinks there should be a tariff on bacon, butter and other articles of agricultural produce coming in here.  Those particular suggestions have been discussed many <Col N="1309" /> times, and it is quite clear, in regard to some of them, that no advantage would accrue to the people here.  In regard to others, it is clear that on the whole there would be a disadvantage. I do not know how he made up his total figure of agricultural imports, whether he included maize in his total, but if he did mean a tax on maize, then he proposes to tax a raw material, which certainly in the long run would not lead to any benefit.</P>

Did he include the capitalised value of the exemption from income tax of the whole of that undertaking now and in future?

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night, when Progress was reported, we were on the subject of public health.  I am glad to see in the last annual report of the Department of Local Government and Public Health a statement on page 5 that greater activity was shown by local bodies in the promotion of waterworks and sewage schemes.  That is development in the right direction.  There are a very considerable number of towns and villages in the Free State area in which there is no proper water scheme and no proper sewage disposal arrangements to-day, so that the statement made.  I think, by the Minister himself a couple of years ago acknowledging the backward position of sanitation of towns in the Free State area still holds good. Much remains to be done to bring those two important aspects of public health work to the condition they ought to be in.  However, it is, as I have said, satisfactory to know that progress is being made as stated in the last annual report of the Department. In that connection, I read somewhere in the report that the State contribution for the promotion of waterworks and sewage disposal schemes is one-fifth of the cost.  It is also stated in that report that the usual amount allowed from the National Exchequer towards relief works is at the rate of one-third of the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1314" /> Now to my mind&mdash;I may be singular in this&mdash;there is much greater need for development in the direction of sewage disposal schemes and waterworks in the country than in the direction of road construction. If the Department of Public Health could secure from the Minister for Finance a contribution of one-third towards these activities it would be doing better work than giving one-third towards the development of road construction.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of public health work that has been referred to almost every year is the question of overcrowding in the county homes. County homes are, I take it, places chiefly for the convenience of old and infirm people.  In a great many places there are many besides old and infirm people in these county homes &mdash;people who ought not to be there, imbeciles, lunatics, unmarried mothers and their children.  There ought to be&mdash;again, it is a question of finance&mdash;proper segregation of these classes.  Unmarried mothers and their children ought not to be in the county homes, and there ought to be proper provision made in the mental hospitals for imbeciles and lunatics.  Such people afflicted mentally cannot get treatment in the county homes.  Whatever slight chances of cure or improvement there may be in some of the cases, it certainly will not take place as long as they remain in county homes and get the kind of attention which in ordinary circumstances they are bound to get in these institutions, which are already overcrowded with other classes who are entitled to be there.</P>
    <P>Another problem which gives cause for worry in some cases is the question of the care of the blind. There has been an improvement in that direction in recent years, but there is room for more.  I had a deputation from the blind people in my constituency a couple of times in recent months and they complained bitterly that enough was not done for the blind.  Again, we are up against the question of finance, but while there are some good institutions in the country where the blind <Col N="1315" /> are well treated the blind themselves feel if they got better technical education that they could be put in a position to help themselves to a larger extent than they can at present with the meagre technical education facilities that are afforded to them.  I wonder if pressure of any kind could be put upon the local authorities to improve the facilities that are offered to the blind for technical education.  I am sure it is a subject which has received attention. We know there has been improvement in recent years, but there is room for more improvement.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt, in his opening remarks, with the question of the appointment of county medical officers of health.  There has been progress in that direction.  There are more county medical officers of health working now than last year and the year before, but still we are a long way from having a county medical officer of health in every one of the twenty-six counties.  Progress has been slow.  Progress in the last year, I think, has not been very rapid, and in that connection the Minister said something last night about the educational effect of these county medical officers of health.  When he stated that, the question flashed across my mind, was he referring to the educational effect of the political activities of the county medical officer of health for Meath?  If there is one thing that is likely to put obstacles in the way of county councils accepting the policy of the Minister&mdash;a policy with which I agree &mdash;as to the appointment of county medical officers of health, it is activities such as those indulged in by a whole-time official.  Dr. O'Higgins, a member of this House, is a whole-time official as medical officer of health in County Meath. These arctivities are condoned by the Minister.  The Minister may say that he does not control that officer directly, but he certainly pays a considerable portion of that officer's salary as medical officer of health. In County Wexford, a number of members of the board of health opposed the appointment of a medical <Col N="1316" /> officer of health.  There are counties, as the Minister and his Department know, where public men have fought and put every obstacle they could in the way of the appointment of these officials and said they are unnecessary. They are certainly given a very good argument when they see that a medical officer, a whole-time official, can spend so much of his time away from the work for which he is appointed and paid.  The Minister and everyone else in the House know, or ought to know, that there should be work enough and more than enough to keep one medical officer of health in a county fully occupied.  Every one would admit that we are not so far advanced in public health matters and that the health of our children and the health of people generally in every county is far from satisfactory.  For the next ten years, with one medical officer of health in every county in Ireland, there is work enough to keep one man busy six days in the week without his running from Dun Laoghaire to Cork or from Letterkenny to Galway doing political work, even on days when that particular medical officer of health is not occupied in this House doing his work as a member of the Dáil.  That kind of activity and the fact that the Minister condones it is bound to give weight to the argument of members of county councils and boards of health who ask: &ldquo;What do we want a medical officer of health for? There is no work for him.  Cannot the dispensary doctor do that work?&rdquo; That is the cry usually. &ldquo;Cannot the medical officers of health who are dispensary doctors, do the work?&rdquo; That is the cry everywhere where there is opposition to those county medical officers of health.  Certainly good grounds are given to people who oppose such appointments by the activities I refer to and by the Minister's attitude with regard to them.</P>
    <P>There are other matters with regard to public health that might be dealt with.  I am sure there will be other Teachtaí who will be anxious to speak on this subject, and probably <Col N="1317" /> none of these points will be overlooked.  I will not take up time going over them.  Most of them have been mentioned from time to time in discussions of this kind here.  I read somewhere in the last couple of weeks in the daily Press a return of the collection of rates during the twelve months ended 31st March, and, as far as I recollect, there was an improvement.  I have an idea that there was in some counties a considerable improvement with regard to the collection of rates.  That is certainly all to the good, but there are counties that are still backward and, as the Minister said in his opening statement, efforts are being made to bring these counties up-to-date in the way of collection.  I would like to say that I entirely endorse what the Minister said, that the policy of financing Local Government work out of loans is very bad and costly, and instead of helping Local Government it is a big obstacle, because money is spent in paying for these loans that could be spent on more fruitful activities in the various counties.  I would like if the Minister would tell us if there has been an improvement in regard to the number of defaulting rate collectors. The number in recent years has been rather high, and the amount of money lost has been fairly considerable. Perhaps the Minister would be able to tell us if there has been any improvement in that direction.</P>
    <P>Another subject that is causing considerable anxiety, particularly in rural areas, is that of roads and the amount of money that is being spent on them.  Of course, those who are frequent users of motor-cars are very happy to find a good road and to praise those responsible for the good roads, but I suppose the users of motor-cars are in a very small minority.  The people in rural areas who do not use motor-cars and who have to continue the old methods of transport&mdash;horses and cars or other methods&mdash;certainly are complaining of the cost.  I do not know if it is possible for us to continue paying for two great competing methods of transport.  We have the railway system, and we have to pay for that <Col N="1318" /> one way or another.  Competing with that we have the more up-to-date system of road transport&mdash;the transport of goods by heavy motor vehicles&mdash;and the cost of the roads necessary to keep that transport in proper order is a very heavy drain. I think, considering the heavy cost and the small population we have to bear that cost, the cost of rural transport is one that is well worth consideration.  I am sure it has got consideration, but it is worth reconsidering.</P>
    <P>The amount spent on roads is growing enormously.  Of course, it comes to a large extent out of the licence fees paid on motor cars, but a very big percentage of it has to come out of the rates.  That is where the trouble begins.  Frequently, we have had angry complaints made to some of our members about the cost that is put on the rates for the upkeep of roads.  Those who have complained to us are very largely, of course, people from rural areas. They say that the roads that so much money is spent upon are roads that they cannot use.  In great number, they are agriculturalists who are not in a position to use motor cars; for their cattle transport they have to use by-roads.  The main roads are lost to them because they cannot risk putting their cattle upon them.  I am sure that the Minister has had these matters put before him, and if he has given the matter any recent reconsideration we would be glad to hear what the result is.  It seems to me that the cost is very heavy and it could even be proved that the cost of the upkeep of these very good roads, as they are in a great many cases, is too great in proportion to the number of motor users and the number of people who cannot use those roads.</P>
    <P>There are other points with regard to roads that have been mentioned over and over again.  There is the difference that one finds in the quality of the roads in different counties.  Evidently in some counties there are good road makers, good engineers, county surveyors or assistant county surveyors, as the <Col N="1319" /> case may be, but those who travel any distance in different counties know that there are other counties where the roads are not at all up to the standard, although we are told that the same ratio of money is spent on the construction and maintenance of these roads.  It is probable that that matter is receiving the attention of the engineers of the Department and it requires further attention.  There are, I believe, justifiable complaints as to the quality of the roads and the value got for the money spent on them in some of the counties.  Some of our members have spoken to me of their roads and the value they get for them as compared with the value that other counties&mdash;neighbouring counties in some cases&mdash;get out of a similar amount of money.</P>
    <P>As one of those who put down the motion asking that the Estimate be referred back, I should say that we adopted that method to show our dissatisfaction with the Estimate and with the policy which it outlined, first of all, on the question of housing. We are not at all satisfied that housing is receiving the attention that it deserves.  The problem is a very pressing one and we find it very difficult to discover what the policy of the Government on the matter is, if they have any policy.</P>
    <P>The survey has been made so far as urban areas were concerned, and the Minister told us the result of it. He gave us a figure of 30,000 houses as necessary in urban areas, and I say that possibly another 30,000 are necessary in rural areas.  Has the Minister any idea as to when those 60,000 houses are to be built?  Has he any plan?  Can he give us any idea as to when we may hope to see the slums in the City of Dublin abolished? They form a large part of the area immediately requiring houses.  He must have given consideration to this matter, and he must have fixed some limit of time, remote or near, as the date by which we might hope to see the number of houses now urgently necessary built in the Free State area.  The <Col N="1320" /> figures he gave us last night as to the total number of houses built showed that less than 2,500 houses a year have been built in the past seven years.  At that rate twentyfive years &mdash; a generation &mdash; must elapse before the number of houses that are at present required can be built, and by that time many of the houses that are now habitable and fairly decent will have collapsed or will be in slums.  Are we never to see an end of the housing problem? If that be the best that the Minister can do it is a poor look-out.  On the question of housing alone we believe that the policy of the Government does not deserve support, and we are prepared to show our dissatisfaction by voting for the amendment in my name and in the name of Deputy Corish, that this Estimate be referred back.</P>
    <P>The second point&mdash;it is not so important, of course, but it has its own importance as bearing on the question of public health&mdash;is what I mentioned a few moments ago, the attitude of the Minister towards one of the officials of his own Department neglecting the work for which he is paid as a whole-time officer, trotting around the country five or six days of the week when he has a sufficient amount of work to do for the full week in looking after the health of the people of County Meath, if he would only do it, for the money that the ratepayers are taxed to pay him a decent salary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir James Craig</NameTxt>
      <P>In the early days of the Dáil in successive years I was at times a very severe critic of this Estimate.  I find, however, that there are grounds upon which I can support the Estimate, and grounds upon which I could not support the amendment.  I look back to five years ago and I find that the total Estimate then was £561,889; this year it is only £482,158; in other words, there is a reduction in the entire Estimate of practically £80,000.  One of the points upon which I laid very great stress in the early days was the cost of administration, but I now find that I am able to congratulate the Minister in <Col N="1321" /> this direction.  He may not have gone far enough to please everybody, but he has gone a considerable way. I find that the cost five years ago of salaries and wages was £91,000 odd; this year it is £81,000, so that there is a reduction of £10,000 on administration in this year's Estimate as against that of five years ago. Another point upon which I spoke severely was the amount of expenses that were entailed by the travelling of inspectors throughout the country.  This was a huge item, and on one occasion I remember saying that these inspectors were not needed in anything like the numbers that were going through the country, and that it would be better to let them stay at home and pay their salaries than in having the cost that there was then.  I find, however, that as far as this item is concerned the travelling expenses have been reduced from £10,500 to £6,600.  On these two points alone I think we should give credit where credit is due.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, when I turn to what is being done as far as social services are concerned I find that there is a good deal of improvement with regard to the amount of money spent on them.  I find for child welfare that, whereas only £14,000 odd was spent five years ago, we are now spending over £22,000.  That is, child welfare, schools for mothers, etc., grants to the societies that are working in this most needy direction.  Of course, five years ago the medical treatment of children was practically unknown, because then £1,166 was provided in the Estimate, but this year there is £11,000.  I give the spending of that money my most earnest commendation, but it is not anything like enough; we want a great deal more to spend in medical inspection and in the treatment of children, particularly in the treatment. As far as the grants for the provision of meals to school children are concerned I have to find fault with the fact that the increase has only been from £6,000 to £7,600.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that I ever spoke on this Estimate without appealing to the Minister to encourage in every <Col N="1322" /> possible way the spending of money in giving meals to poor children attending school, and I say that this item in the Estimate could be very greatly increased.  With regard to the welfare of the blind, there has been practically no change in five years.  But when we come to the treatment of tuberculosis we have to admit that there has been an improvement&mdash;from £43,000 to £91,000. I take it that that is largely due to the appointment of county medical officers of health, and the expenses that have been entailed thereby. The treatment of venereal disease is practically the same, but the amount spent on housing has very greatly diminished.</P>
    <P>With regard to the county medical officers of health, on whom I spoke until I was almost tired, we have made a certain amount of progress, but I think in about half the counties no county medical officers of health have been appointed.  On the other hand, in the counties where medical officers of health have been appointed, not enough is being done.  I do not think there is any use in appointing a county medical officer of health and giving him tuberculosis work without giving him assistance to do the work.  How is he going to call to inspect the 120 or more schools that there are in a county? Say that there is an average attendance of 60 in each of these schools. How can he possibly inspect them? One of the things that is most urgently needed, in my opinion, is that help should be given to the county medical officers of health by appointing assistants to inspect and treat children.  There is another point in connection with that which also requires attention.  Many of these children are suffering from forms of disease that require special treatment&mdash;treatment of the nose, throat and eye.  In my opinion that is not capable of being done&mdash;particularly treatment of the throat and nose&mdash;even by the surgeon connected with a county hospital, so that it is necessary that some provision be made by which children who are suffering from enlarged tonsils and throat complaints of that nature <Col N="1323" /> should be treated by someone who has a more special knowledge.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Kelly that some more provision should be made for the unmarried mother.  I need not go into that question any further, but I think it is a deplorable thing that these girls are turned out of the county home a short time after giving birth to children.  Their parents in many cases do not want to have them back in their homes, and they, in many cases, do not want to go back to their homes, and there should be some provision to look after these girls when they leave the institutions.</P>
    <P>A matter on which a great deal of discussion took place last year was with regard to the sanitary condition and the water supplies of various urban areas.  Cases were brought forward that; to say the least of it, were disgraceful.  In fairly large towns there were no water supplies and the sanitary arrangements were disgraceful.  I do not know whether the Minister is making much progress in that matter, but I want to ask whether any progress is being made in the schemes that were suggested.  Last year he stated that he would be prepared to adopt schemes if they were put forward.  Unless we have proper sanitation we cannot expect to have a healthy population.</P>
    <P>With regard to the housing problem, that, in my opinion, is a most urgent need.  We are not going to reduce tuberculosis until we provide decent houses for the poor.  Sanatorium treatment is practically useless if the people are afterwards sent back to live in the insanitary conditions in which they were infected. I want to stress again that, in my humble opinion, the only way in which tuberculosis will be diminished, at all events in the country, if it is not excluded altogether, depends largely on the type of houses the people live in.  Over and over again I have seen people who were improved, or who were cured in sanatoria returning to insanitary buildings, where they either fell <Col N="1324" /> back into their previous condition or, if they were cured, they got fresh infection.</P>
    <P>I say that it is not possible for the county medical officer of health to do the tuberculosis work of a county and the medical inspection and treatment of school children, and I would urge upon the Minister the necessity of seeing that some arrangement is made by which he would receive assistance.  There are many other points that I would like to dwell upon, but I do not want to occupy the time of the House any longer, except to lay stress on the three matters that I have alluded to, the provision of sanitation and water supplies in the urban areas, the provision of houses for poor people who, after being treated for tuberculosis in sanatoria, are bound to fall back into their previous condition if they are put into insanitary houses; and finally, with regard to the inefficiency that must arise in connection with the work of a county medical officer of health if he is not provided with assistance to carry out medical inspection and the treatment of school children.  I venture to say that in some counties where these county medical officers have been appointed they have not been able to get over all the schools within their areas.  I do not see any necessity for referring back this Estimate, but I think we should urge upon the Minister the points where improvements can be made. I congratulate him on having reduced the expenditure in connection with administration and on having increased the amount of money to be spent on social services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. Shaw Mr. Shaw">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shaw</NameTxt>
      <P>There are very many important subjects in this Estimate that one could deal with, but I purpose confining myself to two or three of the most urgent.  I would press first the question of houses, because, in my opinion, that is one of first class national importance.  It is a question that I consider should be tackled in an intensified manner, more particularly at present, owing to the very unique opportunity provided by the fact that we have the <Col N="1325" /> lowest bank rate since the war. There is an announcement in this evening's newspaper that the bank rate has been reduced to three per cent.  It has not been three per cent. since 1914.  Six months ago it was 7½ per cent.  The result is that what was uneconomic six months ago is economic now.  I consider that this is an opportune time, and that we ought to endeavour, if at all possible, to go into this matter in a non-political manner and come together in an endeavour to solve what I believe I am correct in saying is one of the most important problems facing this country.  I also consider that now is the time when the rates of interest ought to be revised.  The Board of Works will lend money at 5¾ per cent. for thirtyfive years, the same rate of interest as when the bank rate was 7½ per cent., so that it is quite apparent something ought to be done in that connection.</P>
      <P>The Westmeath Board of Health has approached the bank with regard to a loan.  Boards of Health at present are not eligible to receive local loans.  I do not know why.  I do not think there can be very much progress made until they are brought in, because unless you can get long term loans you will have very little chance of being able to erect houses that can be let at an economic rent.  At the same time, I am very hopeful of the position, in view of the terms which I believe we will be able to get, because we have been offered money at 4 per cent. by the bank, and it is quite possible that we will get it for 20 years.  If we are able to do that we will be able to build houses.  I agree with the Minister that the public bodies have not been doing their duty.  There is no use in waiting for the Government to do everything.  The public boards have an opportunity now. They can borrow money, and it is up to them, owing to the fact that there is an unique opportunity at the present time to tackle the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a sad thing in a country such as this, where the standards of morality and of religion are so high, that such a large number of boys and <Col N="1326" /> girls, brothers and sisters, have to live and sleep in the same rooms. Unfortunately these conditions prevail all over the country.  It is injurious to their health and injurious to their morals.  I stress in the strongest possible manner this need, and I hope the Minister will introduce a Housing Bill on a much more elaborate scale than any Bill he has introduced so far, and that he will tackle the problem and avail of the unique opportunity that now exists. I would like to draw special attention to the reconstruction clause in the Housing Bill which does not apply to rural areas at present. Something should be done to provide either grants or loans for people whose houses are in a dilapidated condition, and who are unable to pay the amount that would be required to repair them, but who would be quite solvent if they obtained a loan, and would repay it in the same manner as the advances made by the Agricultural Credit Corporation are repaid by farmers.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will introduce the Housing Bill as soon as it is possible for him to do it.  All parties, I think, should join together in the attempt to solve this very important and difficult problem.  On the question of the roads, I think the cost of them should be a national one.  It is not fair, for instance, that the people of Westmeath should be asked to pay 2/- in the £, which produces a sum of £28,000, to repair roads that motor lorries and heavy vehicles from all parts of the country are injuring every day.  I think that the cost of the upkeep of the roads should be made a national problem, because ratepayers will not continue to pay 2/- in the £ for a service from which the majority of them get very little benefit.  A great deal of damage is being caused by the slippery condition of tarred roads, and I would like to know from the Minister if anything is being done by his Department to remedy that.  In the locality I come from a good many horses fall on these tarred roads and get injured, while the other day I saw a valuable heifer slip up and <Col N="1327" /> break her hip.  I understand that some developments are taking place in connection with that, and I hope a remedy will be found.  In view of the fact that the revenue from motors has increased to the figure of £880,000, I think that the grants for the maintenance of these roads should be considerably increased.</P>
    <P>I desire to congratulate the Minister with regard to the appointment of county medical officers of health. At first there was a good deal of opposition to the making of these appointments.  Now that a number of them have been made it is realised that these officers are going to be of very great benefit to the country. The inspection of school children by them as well as the treatment, in the early stages, of people suffering from disease will, it is believed, lead to a reduced death rate.  Although, as I have said, there was a good deal of opposition at first, the people now appreciate the very good work that is being done by the county medical officers of health.  I hope there will be a full attendance of members of boards of health at the conference to be held in Dublin in June.  A number of very difficult and important problems will be dealt with at that conference, at which the members of these boards will have an opportunity of conferring with the Minister. It is to be hoped that as a result of that conference a way may be found for removing many of the difficulties that exist at the moment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sir James Craig referred to a matter about which I spoke last year.  It is an unpleasant subject but it is one of first class importance &mdash;that is the position of unmarried mothers.  At present these unfortunate people are herded together. The first offenders are placed with the professional bad characters, with the result that there can be very little hope for their reformation The Minister last year said he hoped that something would be done in connection with that matter.  I repeat that something ought to be done.</P>
    <P>[<i>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle took the Chair.]</i></P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1328" /> The present position is this, that they are rearing families at the expense of the ratepayers in many of the county homes.  In the institution that I speak for, some of them have four, five and six children and they are being reared at the expense of the ratepayers.  There are many subjects that one could deal with on this Estimate, but it would take too much time to deal adequately with all of them.  I trust that the Minister will be able to introduce a new housing Bill and thereby help to remove many of the complaints which are being made at present in connection with housing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T. Murphy Mr. T. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In replying to the statements of Deputy Corish last evening the Minister stated that he thought no case had been made by the Deputy for having this Vote referred back.  I do not agree with that view.  I think that Deputy Corish made a very strong case for having the Vote referred back, and I hope to be able to give the Minister some additional reasons as to why it is necessary that it should be referred back.  Deputy Corish dealt at length with the question of housing. The question was also dealt with by other Deputies who have been very eloquently supported by the speech to which we have just listened.  The additional criticism that I would offer on this would be to support the plea made by other Deputies on behalf of the smaller towns which at the moment have no powers to embark on housing schemes, and generally to urge that further provision should be made for housing in the rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say that I freely admit that a great deal has been done in that direction and done very well. If I see any outstanding defect in the housing legislation that we have passed here during the last three or four years it is that people who have availed of it&mdash;people with plenty of capital in many cases who could have built out of their own capital if they cared to&mdash;have let the houses at rents that are entirely too high.  I am referring now to the small towns where a wage of thirty <Col N="1329" /> shillings or thirty-five shillings would be the average, and where rents of seven and eight shillings a week and, in some cases ten shillings, are being charged for these houses.  These rents are altogether too high.  I think it ought to be possible, before legislation of this kind is passed in the future, that provision be made for a more rigorous control over the rents to be charged for houses erected under future schemes.</P>
    <P>I am not at all as enthusiastic, as other Deputies who have spoken, about the county medical officer of health system.  I have lost quite a good deal of the enthusiasm that I originally entertained for that system.  I regard that particular provision in the Local Government Act of 1925 as being extremely valuable.  I am glad to say that, in some respects, it has been valuable, but from what I see of the working of the system in Cork it is quite apparent that there are defects in it that ought to be remedied.  There is an outlook in the service that, if continued, will not get the best results for the service.  A good deal of useful work is being done in the direction of combating diptheria and other diseases, but recently when the question of following up the work of the county medical officer of health, in the matter of making appointments for the dental treatment of school children, came up for discussion we had the extraordinary proposal made by the county medical officer of health in Cork that this work should be performed by one dentist.</P>
    <P>At the moment there is one county medical officer of health and three assistants functioning in Cork county.  Though it was represented to the medical officer that it was humanly impossible for one dentist to deal with the school children in the County of Cork I understand that the Department has affirmed the view of the county medical officer.  I want to tell the Minister that if that view is persisted in in a county of the size of Cork it means that this service will not be of value, because the dentist will be faced with the task of <Col N="1330" /> attending children from Youghal to Castletownberehaven, and he will of necesity have to spend most of his time travelling in his motor car, and the actual amount of time available for his work will be very little.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer also to the overlapping that takes place.  Ordinary matters were reported by the dispensary doctors to the Boards, and these reports now go to the county medical officer of health in the first instance, and then they come back to the Boards.  It seems to me there is a great deal of unnecessary routine associated with the whole system.  What applies with regard to the dentist would also apply to the person appointed for optical treatment.  Work of this kind could be more efficiently performed by part-time dentists and part-time opticians.  That is the way to get the best service.  I can see growing up already a tremendous addition to the number of officials required to work the service.  While I agree that the service is valuable it seems to me to be opening the way to an unlimited number of appointments, and ultimately that is going to be a serious question for the people of the country.  I am afraid the whole proposition will in the end be a very formidable one indeed.</P>
    <P>I want to direct the Minister's attention to some of the immediate results of the National Health Insurance Act passed here, and which led to the abolition of the county insurance committees.  The Minister was warned when this particular matter was being discussed in the Dáil that one result of the abolition of the sanatorium benefit and the throwing over of insured persons on the county board of health would be their neglect, and even the short time that has elapsed since that measure was passed into law has justified the warnings made with regard to it.  In my county, owing to their straitened financial position the health board are not giving the necessary attention to cases of this kind.  On the question of sanatorium benefit and the working of tuberculosis schemes in Cork there is absolute chaos, and the Minister <Col N="1331" /> must know it.  Representations have been made to his Department with regard to the hardships created every day as a result of this new arrangement.  I ask the Minister in the light of what has happened to review his whole policy in this connection. It has been a disastrous failure, and everything that was said in this House indicating that that would be the result has been justified in the few weeks that have elapsed since the measure became law.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat the protest I made some time ago with regard to the Minister's action in denying members of this House access to officers of his Department in connection with old age pensions.  I do not know whether that was the intention, but the taking of that action by the Minister coincided with a general rejection of old age pension claims.  My experience is that old age pension claims have been rejected in larger numbers than for a considerable time past.  That might be due to the fact that the deciding officers had not the opportunity of going into matters as they used to have.  Certainly the results have been far from satisfactory to the claimants for old age pensions.  I ask the Minister to look into the matter and give a better justification for his action in this connection than he did on the occasion when the subject was last before us.  I want to ask the Minister what his intention is on the question of school meals, and whether it is his intention to put more pressure on local authorities that are entrusted with the working of that measure than he has hitherto done.  In some places very little consideration is given to schemes of this kind, and the flimsiest objections are allowed to prevail against the schemes.  I make the plea also that the Minister should consider an extension of schemes of this kind to the rural areas generally.  He has already adopted an attitude that is not encouraging, but if he takes the trouble to inquire into it he will see that there is undoubtedly a demand for action.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1332" /> How far has the Minister interested himself in the decision of this House on the amendment by Deputy Law dealing with the question of widows' pensions?  I take it that is a matter that is engaging the attention of the Department to a very great extent, and I would like to hear from the Minister how far he has made progress, and how far he has gone to get the information that would be necessary to enable himself and his colleagues to make a decision. I hope in doing that he will take a different line to that indicated by the Minister for Finance when he seemed to bar the door for a long time on any improvement in the social services of the country.  Reference has been made in the course of the debate by, I think, Deputy O'Kelly, to the question of the care of the blind.  I think the Minister's failure to insist that local authorities should make adequate provision in this matter is one that ought not to commend itself to this House. Even the Minister, on his own showing, is without any correct or detailed information as to the actual number of persons afficted.  The provisions, if any, made by many local authorities, are extremely meagre indeed.  On the preparation of the Estimates in my own county I complained about the inadequate sum of £100 voted for this purpose in Cork for the coming year.  It is entirely inadequate, and one might as well say that it is no provision at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and this is the first occasion on which provision has been made, although the matter has been considered for a long time, but not in the detailed manner I would like to see it considered.  The provision is entirely nominal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see the Minister regarding this matter as one to be dealt with in a more thorough manner by his Department and less by a local authority.  It is extremely difficult, even in a very good case, to persuade a local authority to increase <Col N="1333" /> expenditure on any service, no matter how deserving.  Yesterday evening the Minister indicated his intention, when the opportunity arose in the future, of asking county councils to ensure that county surveyors would become the chief engineers for each county and that they would supervise work in connection with labourers' cottages and other work of that kind.  A more unworkable or ridiculous arrangement in a county such as Deputy Carey, Deputy Daly, I, and other Deputies represent, I cannot imagine.  I think the Minister must be aware that no arrangement of that kind could be properly worked. I am sure there are many proofs already available of how unworkable an arrangement of that kind would be.  The newspaper reports have informed us that an arrangement of this kind was put into operation in the County Kerry some time ago and the result has been chaos.  There was an enormous increase in cottage rents.  Labourers' cottages have been falling down and there has been difficulty all the time between the County Board of Health and the County Council in connection with engineering arrangements.  The Minister should profit by the experience of a county much smaller than Cork and should realise that it is very difficult to manage in the way suggested.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most valuable assistance given to the question of providing sanitation and water supplies, such as Deputy Sir James Craig mentioned, was given a couple of years ago when the Government provided some portion of the money.  I regret that no attempt has been made to develop that policy, because when schemes for sanitation and water supplies arise the difficulty always is to convince a large number of members of local boards as to the wisdom of embarking on such schemes on the ground of expense.  I urge that money should be given, even in a small degree, towards schemes of that nature.  If the Minister is not prepared to do that he ought to take power to compel local authorities to go ahead with such schemes when he <Col N="1334" /> is satisfied from the evidence of his own inspectors that the schemes are necessary and urgent.  He ought to be in a position to make an order whereby the area of charge would be extended over the widest possible area.  This point is really at the root of a great many of the difficulties that arise, and it is an answer to the charges that Deputy Sir James Craig has made, that at this time in the world's history important towns are without a water supply and are in a disgraceful sanitary condition.</P>
    <P>I regret no great attempt has been made to give effect to the report of the Poor Law Commission except in regard to some minor details.  I regret we never had an opportunity in this House of discussing important items in that report.  While there are many things in that report that I would not be in agreement with, there are a large number of valuable suggestions that might be given effect to with great advantage to the country and with credit to the Minister's Department.  I hope the Minister will indicate how many outstanding recommendations in that report he proposes to give effect to and what generally is his policy in connection with the Commission's report and its major recommendations. I would like to ascertain the Minister's views with regard to some suggestions in the report.  There was one suggestions about establishing a central County Home in Cork City. A more outlandish suggestion was never made.  I was surprised that any members of the Commission who have a knowledge of Cork County would countenance such a suggestion. I must really complain that the Minister is entirely too much disposed to centralising services.  He will find, if he examines the position thoroughly, that the demand in this country in a great many cases is for decentralisation.  In neighbouring countries that is the position, and very wisely so.  As time goes on I am not at all convinced that the Minister or his successor will not have to recast a great deal of what is done in the way of amalgamation and will have to remedy a whole lot <Col N="1335" /> of matters that have been made for the harsh and oppressive treatment of the poor.</P>
    <P>In connection with hospital accommodation in Cork County I would like the Minister to endeavour to meet the difficulties that arise.  I admit that there were difficulties and that a demand was made upon him for sanction to enable larger contributions to be paid to the Cork City Hospital.  In one of the City hospitals where excellent work has been done and from which no poor persons has been turned away because he was unable to pay the cost of treatment, a very limited grant is being paid by the county council.  I would like to see that grant increased and I feel sure that there would not be the slightest opposition to that proposal on the part of any member of the county council.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister himself would be sympathetic.  Difficulties arise out of mere legal formalities, and I would ask the Minister, if possible, to go into the whole matter again and see if there would not be some opportunity of wiping away the difficulties in connection with the whole matter.  I want to draw the Minister's attention also to the whole administration, atmosphere and surroundings of the county homes, such as we know them at present. They are extremely unsatisfactory, and they must continue to be extremely unsatisfactory until the Minister, through the machinery of his own Department, will take a stronger and more insistent attitude in connection with them.  The whole appearance of the county homes, externally and internally, is extremely depressing, as are the conditions generally, and the whole machinery and system must be overhauled.</P>

      <P>I am talking with particular knowledge of my own area.  I admit myself that in that connection the board of health, of which I am a member, is more responsible <Col N="1336" /> than the Minister, and that prompts me to think that this whole thing arises generally and that the Minister himself ought to go into this question and see how far the surroundings, the atmosphere, the machinery and the management of institutions of that kind would be brightened and broadened.  It is difficult to do much in this connection, having regard to the many difficulties that arise at the moment.  While I do not wish to shirk my own responsibility in this matter, I think the Minister himself will have to take a line in this connection later on if much is to come of the management of places like that or if any reasonable results are to accrue.  The whole surroundings at the moment are cheerless and bare.  Everybody one sees in these institutions looks miserable and wretched, and one has little hope for the system.  Apart altogether from the housing of unmarried mothers, young children, and generally people for whom other provision should be made, the places leave much to be desired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, that arises altogether in connection with the report of the Poor Law Commission.  I would like to see the Minister go into the question of the whole administration of home assistance.  I am not in a position to indicate to the Minister a better system or how the present system could be vastly improved&mdash;at least, I am not prepared to do it just now.  There is room for vast improvement.  I appeal to the Minister to go into this whole matter and to see how far the system so cruelly degrading at the moment might be improved.  I feel that the administration of the Minister's Department might be carried on on much broader and more humane lines.  It is the one Department of State where humane and generous administration is essential and I feel that a great deal could be done to improve the administration of the Department along those lines.  I would again urge that the Minister give some attention to the points I have raised and endeavour to enable us when this particular Vote comes under review <Col N="1337" /> again to be able to congratulate him on a very marked improvement in the general working of the Department, a very much more detailed attention to the various matters that are extremely important, and that must continue to demand attention until the Minister decides to give them the attention that they merit.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for regret that the Minister could not find it possible to give more facilities towards the building of houses, especially as he has embarked on a rather expensive scheme of county medical officers of health.  Having done that, he should give them better opportunities to give good results. According to Deputy Sir James Craig, who is an authority on the subject, it is quite evident that tubercular diseases arise mainly from bad housing conditions.  I was rather surprised to discover that the duties of the county medical officer of health are not so onerous as in the constituency from which I come.  It does not appear that the county medical officer of health has employment for the six days of the week.  It would seem that his duties do not cover more than two or three days of the week, but I take it that he is, perhaps, on preliminary duties at the present time.  If it is the case that it is his duty to inspect the schools and the school children, to inspect the towns and the insanitary houses as well as cases of tubercular disease, it would take, perhaps, more than six days of the week to do so.  I hope that he will be able in the near future to give some attention to the question of houses as well as to the question of schools.  I believe that the schools are a great source of spreading this disease, as well as, in some cases, giving rise to this disease.  I notice in other constituencies as well as in the constituency from which I come that schools are found in close proximity to graveryards.  I know that in my constituency schools are to be found without proper, if any, sanitary accommodation.  I know there are schools with sanitary accommodation at the other side of <Col N="1338" /> the road.  Those schools are often situated on the main road, with the result that the children are compelled to cross those roads, which is highly dangerous on account of motor traffic.  I know other schools in which they have no playgrounds, and numbers of those schools have little, if any, ventilation.</P>
      <P>There seems to be no provision made for the journeys that the children have to cover.  I made complaints some time ago about the distances certain school-going children had to cover.  Deaths occurred amongst those children, owing to those journeys.  The children were three or four miles from the school and that would mean travelling six or seven miles per day.  These would seem to be unnatural distances for young children to cover and no doubt, in the case of delicate children, gave rise to tubercular disease. If the county medical officer of supervising the schools and the number of tubercular cases that may arise, I believe that a number of assistants would be needed.  If that is the case, this scheme is going to turn out a very expensive one. For that reason, I say that the Minister would be well advised now to make an attempt, through good sanitary housing as well as through sanitary schools and sanitary towns and villages, to lessen the duties that will be imposed on the medical officer of health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can give instances of large towns that have no powers at the present moment to introduce water supplies or anything of that kind.  There are towns that have no sanitary accommodation whatever, and neither have they a water supply.  A number of the houses in those towns are not in a sanitary condition, nor are they healthy or fit for human habitation. There is no doubt that there is in the constituency from which I come a very strong demand for houses at a reasonable price.  In my opinion there should be no difficulty in building houses just now at a reasonable price.  Neither do I believe that in the few houses that have been built there is any necessity <Col N="1339" /> for using foreign material.  I know of cases where iron windows manufactured abroad are put into houses when wooden windows could be used.  So far as I can make out, 30/- is the difference in the price between the imported windows and the windows that could be manufactured at home.  In the building of these houses also, I believe that the slates produced in this country should be used as far as possible in preference to imported roofing.  The main objection to them would not, I believe, be so much the cost, because they are very durable.  They have been used at other times in this country.  There may be an objection to them on account of their weight, and perhaps a stronger roof might have to be erected.  If we want to build good sanitary houses there is not much use in building shoddy houses which are constantly falling down and which are a frequent source of expense to ratepayers and local authorities.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corish last evening mentioned the necessity for houses in urban and rural areas.  I quite agree that there is necessity for better houses for poor people in urban areas, but I think that rural areas have come off very well and that, whatever charge may be laid against the late district councils, they availed themselves very fully of the Labourers Acts, with the result that they had quite a creditable number of houses built throughout the country.  There may be districts here and there which would form the subject of inquiry if there was any need for houses, but I think that a great effort should be devoted to the towns. I must say, and I do not say it because I represent Dublin City South in this Dáil, that the need for housing in Dublin is greater than in any other part of Ireland.  There are underground kitchens occupied in Dublin where I doubt very much if any ray of sunshine ever enters.  I would not call them houses, but these habitations are simply breeding-beds of disease.  No child gets a <Col N="1340" /> proper start who is brought up in such habitations and he becomes a great cost to the State.</P>
      <P>I know that to build houses for such people and to expect to receive an economic rent for them is out of the question because these people are not in a position to pay an economic rent.  Still I think that cheap houses, two or three-roomed houses, should be built which could be let at a reasonable rent and, by the State bearing a little of the expense, such houses would serve their purpose very well for people who are now occupying underground kitchens. The building of houses serves a twofold purpose.  In the first instance it will be a great help as regards the health of the immediate inhabitants, thus proving of benefit to the nation, and it will, in a second degree, give considerable employment.  I know that it is all a question of money and that the Minister is quite sympathetic, but I think that a very special effort should be made to find money for this purpose.  I recently read reports in the newspapers in which it was stated that local authorities in both Drogheda and Dundalk had declined to build houses in concrete.  I think that that matter should be made the subject of inquiry by the Minister, who should get his experts in that particular line and the engineers of his Department to inquire why these authorities came to the conclusion that concrete is a defective material to build with.  Was the complaint due to the concrete itself or to defects in the sand?</P>

      <P>I now come to the question of hospital accommodation. The lack of district hospitals has been referred to in this debate. Deputy Corish deplored the fact that there was no fever hospital in Wexford. Taking Wexford as a typical instance, I think there should be some small fever hospital for towns of the size and population of Wexford. The removal of a fever case sometimes occurs in a late stage of the illness, and that may be due to <Col N="1341" /> the fact that the patient will not give his consent to be removed.  The removal in a late stage of the illness is very dangerous to the patient and imperils his chance of recovery, and, if it were only for such cases, there should be small hospitals detached from the main hospitals in which these cases would be treated in towns of a population of five or six thousand.  County hospitals serve very useful purposes for operations and the treatment of cases that can be removed to them, but I think it was a recommendation of the Poor Law Commission that in the case of a county hospital, even allowing for a good road to it, anything farther than twenty-five miles from a patient's house was too far.  I think that that should be the maximum distance that an hospital should be away from the sick, especially the sick poor, of any dispensary district.</P>
      <P>I must say that the appointment of county medical officers of health has been a slow operation.  I do not hold the Minister responsible for that.  In many cases he has met with a very obstinate opposition.  I think that the initial mistake was made in not annexing a certain sum for the appointment of county medical officers of health when grants were given for expenditure to local authorities.  It is rather hard to convince local authorities of the necessity of such officers.  There is a great necessity for them, especially in Ireland.  Ireland is a food-producing country, and it has often been alleged against us that we had no proper public health service to look after the production of food and to see that it was carried out under sanitary conditions.  I think that that is a very valid reason; in fact, it should be a very cogent reason why local authorities, especially in farming districts, should see the importance of appointing county medical officers of health. There is, of course, a greater reason, namely, the health of the people, but still I think that the element of commerce might appeal to them more than the health of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course I need not go into the <Col N="1342" /> duties of such officers of health as they have already been referred to and are well known.  It is a trite saying that prevention is better than cure and to have people healthy you must prevent disease.  I know that that is an argument which threatens the existence of the medical profession, but I would be glad to see the profession go for the sake of the health of the people.  Every pound spent on the prevention of disease is worth £50 spent on its treatment, and you will have far better results.  The county medical officers of health, in addition to looking after the health of children in school, will, I hope, pay special attention to making reports and annoying everyone in regard to the unsanitary condition of schools.  These schools are very backward and sanitation, so far as it exists, is very primitive.  I think it should be part of the education of every child to be given proper sanitary accommodation in the schools and to make the children use it.  I would include in sanitary accommodation a hot and cold bath and, if I had not a trained nurse, I would have a good hefty woman who knew all about bathing children and who would run them through the bath. I believe that that should be part of the education of every child and I also believe that if a child came to school with boots which were not polished he should be made to polish them.</P>

      <P>I heard the Minister state that there was going to be established in Ireland a central laboratory, from which he expected very great things.  He was also able to announce that the Oxford Institute was going to give a subscription. This central laboratory will require the best men that can be got for it if it is going to be of any good to the country.  I am not too confident, if the Department of Finance will have a say in the matter, that they will pay a salary that will secure the best men for that laboratory and that we may not be in better position without <Col N="1343" /> that laboratory&mdash;that is, if they allow the same salary they allow the dairy bacteriologist.  We have at present bacteriologists in connection with the universities doing the work. Except you are going to appoint an experienced man, a man of the highest degrees and experience to do the work, the central laboratory may not prove an unmixed blessing.  I would like to refer to the position of veterinary inspectors under urban authorities to which Deputy Corish referred last night.  We all know, of course, the salaries which these veterinary inspectors receive.  A cynic at one time remarked that the idea of paying them such a very small salary was to ensure their inactivity and that they would give no trouble to anybody.  Well, if the Minister expects those men to overlook the fact that they have such small salaries and do their work efficiently, it is more than I would expect them to do.  I believe they should get better salaries and that the work of inspection should be carried out in a far more rigid manner.</P>
      <P>As I am on the point of meat inspection, I might also take this opportunity to refer to another matter.  We have contracts for supplying meat to hospitals, county homes, and mental homes in which the best heifer and best bullock beef is specified.  Still you will see a contractor sending in a tender at so much per lb., and the amount at which he tenders is about 50 per cent. lower than the market price for the best beef or mutton.  That man cannot intend to supply the best meat.  I know the difficulty of detecting defects in the meat after it is killed.  It is not at all an easy matter.  A very much better course would be to have these cattle and sheep inspected before they are slaughtered.  Then it would be seen if the meat reasonably comes under the heading of best beef or mutton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one Departmental question to which I would like to refer. The Minister has a lady medical inspector under the Local Government Department and on account of her sex I see that she is heavily <Col N="1344" /> penalised.  I thought that we had abolished all differences between the sexes in this country.  I hope we will set an example&mdash;I am not inspired to make this complaint; it is only a little gallantry on my own part&mdash;and that the Minister will abolish any inequality in salaries in the case of men and women doing the same work in his office.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of roads, I am interested in the keeping of footpaths.  I find that footpaths&mdash; and I travel in many counties&mdash;are generally very badly kept.  There are sharp cut stones placed on them. Many children going to school will never walk on them.  In fact, you would think that the footpaths were repaired with the object of driving the children out on to the polished, steam-rolled road, thus endangering their lives.  I would ask the Minister to direct his county surveyors to put a stop to this practice in regard to footpaths and to see that they are kept in a way that children with bare feet can walk on them without either pain or inconvenience. Another matter, as I have referred to county surveyors, to which I would like to direct attention, is the maintenance of streets.  In several towns with wide streets, the idea was to repair a space of a certain width in the centre and then at either side the road ran into ruts. Then the channels were rarely repaired. The result was that horses, donkeys and other animals, which were left standing there on market days, left the town in a very foul condition.  In these small villages and towns, moreover, no provision was made for the scavenging of the streets immediately after a fair.</P>
    <P>Again, no provision was made for the scavenging of the yards in small villages and towns, especially the yards of houses occupied by poor people.  It is true that either the dispensary doctor or the county medical officer of health will report the condition of the yard, but that report will go through the usual gamut and it may be seven or eight weeks afterwards that a notice is served on the occupant of the house <Col N="1345" /> to abate the nuisance.  The whole countryside may be affected before the nuisance is abated.  I would like to make a suggestion&mdash;I do not know whether it requires legislation to have it carried into effect&mdash;that in every village in Ireland the streets and the backyards, especially of poor people, who have no means of removing manure and refuse as they accumulate, should be scavenged bi-weekly.  If you have not deep sanitation at least you can have surface sanitation at a very cheap cost.  If you are to have that surface cleanliness it can only be secured in the way I mentioned.  I believe it would do a great deal for the cleanliness of the streets and for the health of the people.  It would make us look more like a civilised people.  When strangers come to these towns, they should not see accumulations of manure and other refuse strewn at the side of the streets.</P>
    <P>I would like to know from the Minister if he has any communication from Geneva about medical benefits.  In Northern Ireland they have a scheme of medical benefits for insured persons.  At least, the Northern Government have agreed to a suggestion from Geneva that it was due to the insured people to get medical benefit.  They have drawn up a scheme, and they have come to terms with the medical profession in Northern Ireland.  They are being given the terms in force in Great Britain.  The only difficulty was in connection with the dispensary doctor, but they have now solved his case and are giving him 7/6 for every insured person he treats, without any deduction from his present salary, or in any way affecting his rights.  We have a very different state of affairs here.  In the City of Dublin a dispensary doctor does the work of about four or five men, and he gets certification money in connection with national insurance, which works out at about threepence per certificate, as compared with 7/6 in Northern Ireland.  I hope the Minister will do something about this.  I believe there is need for medical benefits in Dublin and in <Col N="1346" /> the larger cities.  I believe that the dispensary doctors have far too much to do.  They are called part time officers, but they are on duty for the twenty-four hours of the day.  If the work was done properly, they would have to work twenty out of the twenty-four hours.</P>
    <P>I should also like to know when the Minister proposes to do anything about post-graduate courses.  A departmental committee which was set up recommended that dispensary doctors should get a post-graduate course, lasting three months, once every five years.  That was a modest proposal in the way of keeping a man in touch with the scientific discoveries of the day.  A dispensary doctor in many backward parts of the country has not very many opportunities of brushing up his knowledge and keeping abreast of the times.  Moreover, he is not well enough off to be a member of a scientific society.  These societies publish weekly journals, but the membership costs something, and the dispensary doctor, who is generally dragging the devil by the tail, has not money enough to become a member.  The Department of Finance in many ways in this country cuts across the activities of every Department. The Department had a representative on this Committee, a very excellent man, I admit, and in his private capacity he would not make the recommendations that he would make in his capacity as a representative of the Department of Finance.  It was he mainly, I think, who knocked on the head this recommendation of the Committee, as he said it would cost the country too much.  It would mean that between the local authorities and the Exchequer they would have to pay for the doctor's substitute while he was taking his post-graduate course.  It might cost the State £8,000 per year while the course would be on, but it would cost the 500 or 700 dispensary doctors more than £17,000 per year in loss of practice while absent from home and the expense of keeping up their houses in the country and keeping themselves in Dublin during the course.  There was no consideration <Col N="1347" /> for the dispensary doctor.  We were solemnly told by the representative of the Department of Finance that it would not be worth £8,000 per year.  I think the sooner we do away with the Department of Finance intruding into the work of other departments the better.  I can see the wisdom of keeping the purse strings tight, but when it comes to interfering with efficiency it is quite another matter.</P>
    <P>The only other matter I should like to refer to has been touched on by Deputy Murphy.  I want to ask the Minister if he has any intention of putting the recommendations of the Poor Law Commission into force and if he proposes to introduce legislation for that purpose.  These recommendations deal with a number of social questions of the very greatest importance, such as that of the unmarried mother, and they certainly would go a good way to do something for these people.  Owing to lack of money our social services are lagging behind those in Northern Ireland and Great Britain, so that we are paying in one way for the luxury of our national independence. There will be some difficulty in finding money for all these things, but something should be done.  I do not believe in criticising the Minister for all our failures.  I believe that the local authorities should do more than they are doing.  They could do a great deal more, but they object to centralisation.  When an unpopular thing is to be done, for instance, Deputy Murphy wants centralisation, but I do not think you can have it both ways.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (Clare) Mr. P. Hogan (Clare)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Clare): I should like to re-echo the sentiment expressed that this question of housing should be lifted out of the plane of party politics and made not alone a national question, but a question of common humanity, because it is that. The Minister, on his own figures, stands in some way condemned for want of policy or method or direction in dealing with the housing shortage.  He told us yesterday that on figures supplied as a result of surveys <Col N="1348" /> made by the local authorities there were something like 43,000 houses needed in urban districts, I think he said in the Saorstát, but on figures compiled by representatives of his own Department he brought that number down to 30,000.  Let us take his own figure.  That thirty thousand houses are needed after we have spent one and a half millions on the erection of houses shows that there is a huge problem with which the Minister has not indicated how he proposes to deal.</P>
      <P>Speaking of rural housing versus urban housing, it is as well that we should clear up some misapprehension which seems to exist in the minds of some Deputies regarding what is really rural and what is really urban.  The Minister said that 69 per cent. of the money was expended on houses built in rural districts.  He meant by that, of course, that they were built in the country districts as distinct from the country towns.  Let us be clear on that point.  It is farmers' houses and houses such as these that have been built and that accounts for the 69 per cent.  But you have towns of 2,000, 3,000 and 4,000 population where there is no local authority to build houses and where houses are badly needed.  There is no authority to build houses in these places because, in the first instance, long-term loans are not available and cheap money is not available.  I have in mind half a dozen towns in Clare where, without exaggerating in order to make a point against the Minister, I can say the housing conditions are scandalous.  The population in these towns varies from 2,000 to 4,000, and there are houses in these places where people are trying to bring up children under insanitary, unhealthy and entirely unhygienic surroundings. When the Minister says that there are 30,000 houses still required, we can realise the magnitude of the problem and the necessity for taking immediate steps to tackle it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said, when the Executive Council was being nominated, referring to the policy of the then prospective Minister for Local Government and Public Health, that the Government <Col N="1349" /> had no policy in the matter of housing. I said that a good part of the money that went to the speculative builder, went astray.  I now say, with some knowledge, that in respect of the houses that have been built in urban districts three-fourths of the money has gone astray; that that money has gone to the speculative builder, and that if you go into towns, in urban districts, you will find people still in the same wretched hovels that they were in before the Housing Acts were passed.  I speak of what I come into immediate contact with, and any Deputy can do the same.  My experience is limited to two urban districts in my own county&mdash;Ennis and Kilrush.  I know the housing conditions in both these towns.  Take, for instance, the town of Ennis.  There were fifty houses perhaps built there with these grants, but I know there are people still living in back lanes and in side streets where the children are being reared under conditions that are very difficult and demoralising.</P>
    <P>We find, in the report prepared in accordance with the directions of the Department of Local Government, the local officer of health in Ennis saying that the number of houses in the district not fit for human habitation is 200.  Let us take 30 per cent., according to the Minister's calculation last night, from that number, and we get something like 140 houses.  The number of people inhabiting these houses is 1,600, out of a population of about 5,000.  Take 30 per cent. from that 1,600 and it will bring the number down a good deal&mdash;I shall not make a calculation at the moment.  It shows that the problem is of sufficient magnitude for the Minister to take cognisance of it, to induce him to indicate what his policy is, and to prevent the money for the building of houses for these people going to speculative builders, to build houses for the people who in ordinary circumstances would not be entitled to houses provided by State grants.</P>
    <P>Houses were built in that area but if I went down the by-streets I would find people who still needed habitable houses.  I would find people <Col N="1350" /> who were endeavouring to rear children under these conditions unable to do it.  In Kilrush urban district, according to the medical officer's report, the number of houses unfit for human habitation is 70, and the estimate of houses required is 152.  In both these towns, houses were built under the grant, but they have been built without any policy, method or direction.  It simply means that people who need houses have not got them.  These houses have been sold for big prices &mdash;for £400 and £500.  The money given in a good many cases had been lent by foreign insurance societies and it might be said that foreign insurance societies own three-fourths of the houses built by grants given by the Government.</P>
    <P>We were told a few days ago that in order to preserve the country from internal and external aggression we had to spend £1,500,000. Here is aggression taking place and active inroads being made upon the health of the people through their children being brought up in insanitary surroundings and what is the policy of the Minister in that matter? That is the reason I reiterate my appeal that this matter should be made a human question and that there should be no consideration of party policy or propaganda in connection with it but that all parties should sink every difference in order to solve it.</P>
    <P>There is a matter in connection with central purchasing that I want to draw attention to.  It has been stated here, on every occasion that this estimate comes up, that central purchasing is not giving general satisfaction. I think that will be agreed by everybody who has taken care to examine it and has had any experience on public boards.  The material supplied, in a great many cases, is not the same as the sample supplied. There is a grievance on the part of the local people which consists mainly in the fact that because they cannot contract for the whole of the Free State they cannot contract for the local institution.</P>
    <P>I should like, also, to support what <Col N="1351" /> Deputy Shaw said on the maintenance of roads.  I stated here on several occasions that national services ought not to be made local charges.  National service is being made a local charge, in many cases, in connection with the roads where the road is not used 50 per cent. or 30 per cent. by the local people.  The roads are being used by people from Cork and Dublin and all the cities in the Saorstát and are not, as I say, used 30 or 50 per cent. by the people who foot the greater part of the bill.</P>
    <P>I would also like to know if the Minister intends to make any change in the matter of this barbed wire fence which he has erected around the officials of the old age pensions department in the Custom House. When that matter was being discussed on the motion for the Adjournment, I said that these officials were not in a position to understand appeals from the evidence submitted to them by the applicants for the pensions.  I repeat that there are many old age pensioners who, when given 14 or 21 days' notice to make appeal, are not in a position to put their case clearly before the officers who decide the appeal.  I have come across cases where they were not able to make their cases clearly without cross-examination. If you are to keep Deputies who know all the facts away from these officers, then in nine cases out of ten you are going to inflict hardship on the applicants. I do not say that in every case that comes before the officers for decision on appeal Deputies should be present. I do not say that every case in which a Deputy seeks to interview the official is one in which he should interview him.  But I say there are cases, and very many of them, where a full statement by a Deputy would secure that justice would be done to the applicant and would put an entirely different complexion on the application to the officer who has to decide it.  I think the Minister ought to take down this barbed wire fence and let us have free access to these officials, as is the <Col N="1352" /> case in regard to every other official in the service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister one or two questions. The Minister stated last year, with regard to the allocation of the road grants, that they were allocated on a definite basis.  I would like to know what provision his Department intends to make with regard to the allocation of grants for national roads that have not been completed, and whether they will get any extra consideration in the matter of allocation.  I have in mind a road which was declared to be a national road.  The amount allocated for that road out of the £2,000,000 grant did not cover one-third of the road.  It is a road which opens up the West and which is taken advantage of by tourists and others.  It is on all the maps as a national road, and at present part of it is a disgrace.  I would like to know what the Minister is going to do with regard to that.  Last year I asked the Minister a question with regard to the adjustment of the annuity accounts by the Land Commission, and he promised to give it attention.  I understand that this adjustment commences about the middle of February, and the county councils are not made aware of what grants are being withheld till the middle of April.  They have to have their estimates ready by the end of March, and are consequently much handicapped.  The Minister promised to look into the matter and see whether the county councils could have this information before striking their rates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this Budget, and I regret the Minister has not much more money for the use of the working-class houses in general.  The recent Act passed here enabling urban district councils to put the Act into operation has been availed of to a great extent, as far as I can understand, and it would be very satisfactory in the main.  There is a point in connection with the recent Act introduced here where it gives the urban authorities power to strike a rate of a shilling to assist in building the <Col N="1353" /> houses in such a manner that they could be let at an economic rent. That has been availed of to a very great extent by a number of urban districts.  The striking of the shilling rate certainly enhances the prospects of that council being able to let the houses at an economic rent. That is the most difficult situation in respect to houses.  It is quite possible for any council to build them, and it is quite possible to get a loan, but the cost of building is so high that it is not possible to let them at a rent which those workers are able to pay.  The workers' average rate of wage is something like 30/- in districts throughout the country. If they have to pay anything more than 5/- I do not see how it would be possible for them to maintain themselves and their families in food and other necessaries.  We are not able to raise the standard of wages to the level we would like, for the simple reason that we have not trades in those districts.  We have not industries sufficient to warrant the increase in wages, except in very isolated cases, such as Cork and Dublin.  I think it would be well that before the expiration of this Act the councils throughout Ireland should avail themselves of this opportunity and put the Act into operation.  I know that certain counties whose valuation is considerable and where, by the striking of a shilling rate, you would realise a sum of about £25,000.  By striking that rate of one shilling it would be a magnificent contribution for any county to do, for one year alone; and then, provided you could get buildings erected at, say, £250 each, it would mean something like 100 buildings would be erected in that county.  Of course, the valuation I have in mind is very large.  In respect of the material to be used in those buildings, I heard an insinuation made in reference to the Department and the Minister, that the Minister was more or less accountable for not having Irish material to use in them.  That is not quite correct.  It is not fair to the Department and the Minister for that statement <Col N="1354" /> to be made.  I think the anxiety of the Department on all occasions has been that Irish-manufactured material should be used as much as possible.  It is a matter for the local body who are crecting those houses to carry the wishes of the Department into operation, and if they co-operate with the Minister I certainly believe he will assist them to have Irish-manufactured material used on all occasions.  That goes without saying.  There is no necessity for me to dwell on that any longer, but we might as well make it plain that we are aware of the policy of the Minister and his Department in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the grants-in-aid for reconstruction of small farm houses in the country I think it would be very important that, following the adoption of schemes of county councils in respect to small farms, there would be a grant levied by this means by which a grant could be given for the reconstruction of small farm houses.  There are many farm houses in the country which are more in need of repair than labourers' cottages and look very dilapidated.  The labourer's cottage is a fine house, and if it is kept in the way it should be kept by the occupants and as some of them are kept it is a pleasure to go into them and a pleasure to the passerby to look at them.  I think it would be well that there should be a grant made for the reconstruction of small farmers' houses.  Here a few years ago there was a considerable amount of building done by farmers in our county, and we found that the housing department dealing with it here in the Department dealt with it in the most expeditious manner, gave universal satisfaction to the people, and spent considerable sums on the houses.  It is a pleasure to see these houses studding the country to-day. They look respectable and decent and are habitable, and that, I think, should be fostered to a great extent. There is another matter in respect to building in urban areas.  We assumed that the rateable value of a town has enhanced itself by £1,000 <Col N="1355" /> or £2,000 due to the extent of building created in that town.  That is to say, recent building in urban areas such as banks or other institutions. The housing of the Working Classes Acts provided building.  These houses increased the valuation in towns considerably and to the extent in some cases of approximately perhaps £2,000 and £3,000.  We will assume that the county council struck a rate in respect to the poor rate in these towns and that the poor rate of that town is 10/-.  Now they collected on a house of £100 valuation, and the rate that is to be collected by the urban area is 10/- to pay the county council.  The urban council is required to pay the county council the sum of £50, while the urban council themselves have not the right to collect any more than 1/90th of the entire poor rate on that house.  This is a serious matter for an urban council to have to collect the entire rate of 10/- off the urban council.  But that 10/- must be distributed over the other inhabitants of the town and not the occupants of the new buildings.</P>
    <P>That is a matter, I think, which should be adjusted between the urban councils and county councils, and I would like that the Minister would try and get some agreement between these two parties.  It is not easy to get it done, but I think an effort might be made to deal with it.</P>
    <P>I am now dealing with another matter in respect to roads which is a very serious matter in the County of Longford.  It appears that the traffic has reverted back to its original stage coach lines in respect to that county.  Originally Longford was the main artery between the north, south, east and west.  That was in the old mail coach days.  We have the old mail coach stages there a present.  Since the operation of the bus traffic that has come back. You have the routes to the southwest, to north-west Galway, to south Mayo, to north Mayo, to Roscommon, Sligo, Leitrim and Cavan; then on the south you have the route running towards Athlone and on towards <Col N="1356" /> Limerick; then take the routes running in the north, we have them running to Granard, Cavan, and Killeshandra at present.  I think our bus traffic is a 54 bus per day passing through the town of Longford.  It is scarcely possible to conceive that we should have such a bus traffic through the small town of Longford as 54 a day.  The roads through that county are reasonable but we would require under the circumstances a special grant to sustain that traffic that is passing over them.  It is not like other counties where the traffic just touches the fringe at one end.  They are in and out over our roads all the time and the traffic that is carried on over those is enormous.</P>
    <P>In respect to motor traffic I would like to call the Minister's attention to a certain position that obtains in the City of Dublin in respect to bus, road, motor traffic, and pedestrians in general.  I do not know whether it is his function to deal with it or not but I think it amounts to what is practically a scandal at the moment.  Unless you spring to it and get off the road you will be run over.  At a toot of a horn you have got to go.  I think there must be drastic steps taken to deal with this type of motor drivers and other users of the road.  A person has not got the merest chance of escaping some of those road hogs from time to time.  Here in thoroughfares they go as they please and as they like. They toot their horn and if you are not paying attention that is the last of it.</P>
    <P>The county hospital scheme is general throughout the country, but I think it requires some special supervision in many of the counties. The conditions that obtain here are not ideal in some respects.  The cooking utensils, the heating arrangement and other matters are not what they should be in county hospitals.  The water supply in some of these hospitals is very meagre. The cost of bringing a supply of water to a small county home in my district was estimated at between £7,000 and £8,000.  That is a considerable sum in a small county, and it is a system that might require <Col N="1357" /> special consideration from the Department.</P>
    <P>As regards the old age pensions department, we have not very much to complain.  If they do not give much, they give a little now and again, and there might be a little more loosening up of the purse in time to come.</P>

      <P>As regards county medical officers and dispensary doctors, the salaries in some of the counties, to my mind, are not adequate. In some cases I understand the salary is as low as £180 or £200. That is not a salary that a doctor should be asked to work for.  I know very well it is not the fault of the Department of Local Government. It is the fault of the local bodies.  I think the attention of these local bodies, where small salaries are paid, should be called to it.  They should at least give a doctor a salary that would enable him to keep a decent home.  In many cases these doctors are working day and night.  They have to keep motor cars, and they have to buy at least one suit of clothes in the year. Public bodies might be a little bit more generous in that matter.  There is at the present moment a desire on the part of public bodies to co-operate with the Department.  They have at last discovered that the Department is directing the operations of the county homes and the county councils in the manner in which they should be directed.  I am very pleased to see signs of co-operation between them.  I doubt if Deputies will have anything to say by way of criticism, except on some small technical matter.  I think we are perfectly satisfied with the Department's policy in general during the past twelve months.</P>

      <P>In rising to support the motion to refer this Vote back, I desire to say that I agree with Deputy Murphy that there is too much of a tendency on the part of the Department <Col N="1358" /> of Local Government towards centralisation.  As one of those who in my own county supported the scheme of amalgamation of workhouses, I think that in some respects this policy of centralisation is being carried out to a far greater extent than we consider it should be, and in a direction in which it should not be carried out at all.  Possibly there are directions in which centralisation would be a good thing.  I believe that the amalgamation of the workhouses has justified itself; I do not think that the country has lost anything by the closing down of these numerous institutions.  But while believing that, I believe out of that have arisen difficulties that we who started the scheme did not foresee. One of the difficulties that has arisen is in connection with the necessity for better and more widespread hospital accommodation in some rural areas, especially in large counties like Mayo.  I also believe that the work of what is known as the Central Purchasing Board is being carried to extremes.  I believe in the principle of the Central Purchasing Board, but I think that some modification should be introduced into the system by which local traders would get a chance of competing, and also that local bodies should have the privilege, other things being equal, of giving a preference to the local trader.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not work out in that way in practice as far as my knowledge goes, and I have been a member of public bodies for some years.  I do not agree with Deputy Connolly in his statement regarding the hardship that mental officers and other high officials are suffering from.  I think that if the Department paid less attention to the ills and the sufferings of the higher officials, such as medical officers, and more attention to the ills and hardships of the lower paid workers, and not attempt, as they did some years ago, to impose a sweated wage on road workers throughout the country, which they did despite the protests, in a great many cases, of <Col N="1359" /> local bodies, the country would gain more.  In my experience the higher paid officials are well able to look after themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good deal has been said about sanitation and water supplies in small towns.  This is really a crying evil, and I do not believe there is any county in which it is such a pressing matter as in my own.  But while realising that, I do not believe in and I will not support any scheme that would tend to throw the provision of such accommodation on the local rates.  We have to take into consideration the conditions that exist in counties like Mayo; we have to realise that in such counties small valuations are the rule and not the exception, and that the small farmers are in the position that after years of a strenuous land fight, they won concessions in the shape of lower rents from a bad system of landlordism and in which fight many of them went down in winning these concessions.  Now they are asked in the shape of local rates to give up these concessions.  What does it matter to a small farmer if he has to pay out money, whether as rent, annuity or rates?  He will be paying it out anyhow.  I quite realise the pressing necessity for providing adequate sanitary accommodation and water supplies in small towns, but it is no use to get up here, as some Deputies have done this evening, to try to pillory rural ratepayers and to hold them up as being selfish. It is no use to try to pillory local bodies when they do not rush into big schemes of this nature.  In my own county we are faced with this difficulty, that if we were to provide one scheme we would be faced not with that one scheme alone but with about thirty-five schemes, for any one of which just as good a case could be put up, and each one of which is just as pressing as the other. It would mean in the end that the rates would actually be £2 in the £. There is no use in closing our eyes to these facts, and there is no use in getting up here to try to pillory the local bodies and the rural ratepayers. I would like the Minister to explain <Col N="1360" /> what is the cause of the delay in carrying out the Drainage Act which was passed through the House a little over twelve months ago.</P>

      <P>I do understand the Act.  I am only asking for information from the Minister, and I would be glad to get the information.  I would also ask the Minister if he has considered the representations that have been made in the past two years by local bodies in regard to increasing the capitation grant to mental hospitals.  The Minister is well aware that when the present grant was arranged years ago, the cost of living and the administration expenses were a great deal lower than they are to-day, that the present capitation grant is not at all fair to the local bodies, and that the deficiency has to be made up out of the rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good deal has been said about housing.  I quite agree that a considerable amount of work has been done during the past few years under the various Housing Acts <Col N="1361" /> that have been passed, but there was one bad principle contained in practically all these Acts except in the case of the Gaeltacht Housing Act, and I believe that this should be remedied in any Bill that the Minister may have in contemplation.  That is, the giving of grants to people who could well afford to do without them, people with large incomes, people who are quite wealthy, people who by getting these grants probably deprive more deserving cases of them.  I am quite convinced that if the Minister analysed the applications received by his Department under the various Acts and went into the financial status of the applicants he would find that that was so, that as a result of wealthy people, who could afford to do without these grants, getting them, deserving applicants were deprived of the money.  Another matter to which I would like to refer is with regard to the Appointments Commission. It has been stated that this is an attempt to put into operation what was known as the National Civil Service policy of Sinn Féin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another matter on which I do not know whether I would be in order or not under this Vote, but it is a matter that I believe veers on Local Government, and that is the position of small towns throughout the country regarding what is known as tolls and customs. In some cases local bodies are trying to buy out these tolls and customs, but I know that in my constituency purchase schemes are being held up because rumours have been spreading through the country that the Local Government Department has legislation in contemplation that would practically do away with these tolls and customs, that would, for instance, make it illegal to hold fairs on the streets of small towns&mdash; though I do not believe such a step should be taken in the present <Col N="1362" /> financial condition of the country&mdash; and that that would be done for public health reasons, so that there would be no tolls and customs charges at all.  Local committees and local bodies who have had such property offered to them have hesitated to purchase on account of these rumours.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Hennessy and others as to the great use the county medical officers of health are going to be.  I fail to see, in a county like Mayo, that one man can do all the things we are told he will have to do.  The county, from the point of Shrule down to Belmullet, is 80 miles in extent, and from the town of Ballaghadereen to Achill is about 65 miles.  I fail to see how one medical officer of health is going to cover that huge territory and attend to the numerous schools, or do half the things that are expected of him.  I would like the Minister to give some explanation of the position of road workers in counties like Mayo under the Insurance Acts. Public bodies have to insure their road workers, who have also to pay contributions, and they find, after all this money has been paid, that the workers get no benefit.  They are disqualified for various technical reasons.  It would be a good thing if the Minister would make some statement as to the position of road workers under these Acts.</P>
      <P>I also believe that something should be done in the direction that Deputy Brennan indicated with regard to the stopping of money on account of defaulting land annuitants. That is a source of instability to the local bodies when drawing up their estimates, because sometimes they do not know what their position is as a result of the stoppage.  With regard to what Deputy Hennessy said in connection with the medical profession, I would suggest to him that he should help to introduce the Chinese system, under which the doctor is paid for keeping the patient well, but the payment is stopped if he gets ill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>My experience of the Local Government Department is the <Col N="1363" /> very best.  Any time I put a straight case to it on behalf of my constituents or on behalf of my county it always did the needful&mdash;and I say &ldquo;always&rdquo; advisedly.  The roads in some parts are too good.  The road leading to the town of Fermoy is so good that horses cannot travel on it. It is a wide road but I had to write to the Minister asking if he could give a small grant to make it wider so that horses would have a passage along the side of the slippery portion of the road.  It is a great loss to the town of Fermoy.  Farmers from the different districts cannot come in there, because their horses are in danger, owing to the condition of the road, and if a shaft is broken my head would be broken if I were seen about the town.  They put all the blame on me.</P>
      <P>As regards the county medical officer of health we have got a very active man in the county.  He has a very big county and he and his assistants are attending well to the schools.  It is a matter of great comfort to parents, especially in areas where there were outbreaks of diphtheria, to know that their children are now immune from that disease. They have been inoculated, and the parents feel that the children are now safe from attack by that disease. That is one of the good things he did.  Of course there are some little things that this officer cannot attend to.  He has 630 schools in the district, and I consider that it would take him ten years to inspect them all, especially if he is to have the assistance of only one dentist, as I believe is suggested by the Department. That is one of the things I must take up with the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that a bargain should be made with a dentist in every town and tickets given to the children from the schools to go to him.  The County Cork comprises about one-sixth of the area of the Saorstát.  If one dentist were expected to attend all the children over the whole of that area, some of them would be fathers by the time he reached them. I would like to see more cottages provided for labourers.  I believe it <Col N="1364" /> is the fault of public boards, more or less, if cottages are not being built and kept in repair.  I know that some labourers' cottages are allowed to get into a very bad state of repair. I am in the happy position to be able to report that, with the assistance of the Local Government Department and of the County Board of Health in Cork looking after its business, all the labourers' cottages in our area are now nearly as good as new.  We expect to be able to build more labourers' cottages.  I heard it suggested by the Minister last night that the county surveyor could do some of the engineering work in connection with schemes carried out by the committees operating in the County Cork.  As we have three committees under the board of health in that county, I suggest it would be impossible for the county surveyor to do all that work.  I am sure the Minister would not dream of expecting us to get all that work done by the county surveyor.</P>
    <P>Some of the rateable areas in the County Cork are very small, and if the cost of providing a water supply in one of them had to be borne by the locality it would not be possible to undertake the scheme.  In such cases I would urge that either a grant or a long-term loan should be given.  The people in the town of Charleville, with a population of 4,000, have to depend on a well for their water supply.  There are two sources from which a water supply could be got.  The scheme in one case would cost about £3,000 and in the other £13,000.  The carrying out of either scheme would impose an impossible burden on the ratepayers of that area.  At one time the area was joined to Kilmallock, but since the passing of the Local Government Act it is now a separate area, and could not carry out a scheme involving a large expenditure of money. The working of the tuberculosis scheme in our district has become rather difficult, so difficult that the doctor and the county medical officer of health cannot understand one another in the carrying out of the work.  Whether they can or not they pretend not to.  I hope the <Col N="1365" /> Local Government Department will give attention to that matter, and see that it is settled up, so that the poor people will not suffer while the two big pots concerned are wrangling.  I desire to say here, in the presence of the Minister and his staff, that my experience of the Local Government Department is the very best.</P>

      <P>I think, after the two very fine election addresses that we had this evening from Deputy Shaw and Deputy Connolly, that when I take a ramble down to Longford in a few weeks' time I will find everything in great order there.  I am sure I will see Deputy Connolly's reconstruction scheme at work in every house.  I feel, too, that the Minister for Local Government will take to heart the appeal that Deputy Connolly made to-night on behalf of the dispensary doctors and increase their salaries immediately.  I am sure the poor dispensary doctors are overworked and underpaid, like all the other officials of the Local Government Department.  If there is any one department in which we have clearly exemplified the maxim of government by the officials for the officials it is in the Local Government Department.</P>
      <P>Every new branch established means a drain on the unfortunate ratepayers, and the appointment of every new official brings about, as Deputy Murphy said this evening, the appointment of five or six more. If you appoint a medical officer of health you will find that he will want three assistants; these will want seven or eight nurses, and then there will be wanted nine or ten dentists. We do not know where we will wind up.  That is the policy of the Local Government Department, as far as I can judge.  I was glad to hear Deputy Daly's appeal with regard to dentists, and his suggestion that we should have one in every town.  I suggest that Deputy Daly is a good bargainer.  Let him make a selection of the dentists and he will make a bargain and it will be a good one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1366" /> There is one matter to which I wish particularly to allude.  During the past five or six months I have on a few occasions called the Minister's attention to the Combined Purchasing Department, and I regret to say that up to the present, instead of improving, that Department has got worse.  On one occasion recently a sample was sent up from the South Cork Board of Health, and we had a letter from the trade department asking for the name of the contractor who had supplied the sample. That is the latest move we had on the part of the Department.  I wonder what interest the trade department would have in looking for the name of a special contractor?  I would like to hear some explanation from the Minister about that.  On another occasion when a contractor in Cork tendered for mattresses and bed-presses for the trade department his tender was not accepted, though it was the lowest.  I would like to know from the Minister how that came about.  I had an idea that the lowest tender was always accepted, provided it was up to specification. This contractor has given satisfaction to the Minister and his Department in previous contracts.  I would like to know by what manæuvring this Cork contractor was put out of the contract.  I have seen the tender which was rejected and I have seen the price accepted by the trade department and on each item the Cork tender was the lowest.  I would like an explanation as to that.

      <P>Last year the House very kindly agreed to sit at 5 o'clock instead of 3 o'clock for the convenience of country Deputies who wished to attend the Spring Show.  That was very much appreciated, and I hope the Dáil will agree to accommodate us in the same way on Wednesday next and we could sit later that night.</P>

      <P>I have just received a report on this proposal.  It appears to be very desirable, but it will cost £400 to carry out and will bring in no return to the navigation whatever. I am not clear whether we can carry it out or not, but I will give the matter my best attention.</P>
