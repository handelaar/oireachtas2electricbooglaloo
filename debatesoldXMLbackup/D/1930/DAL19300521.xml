      <NameTxt>Mr. Fogarty (for Mr. Sheehy)</NameTxt>
      <P>(Tipperary) asked the Minister for Finance if he will state why the Revenue Commissioners failed to collect arrears of income tax alleged to be due by Mrs. Lucy Bartholomew out of the lands of Huntsgrove, Templederry, Co. Tipperary, from the year 1919-20 to 1928-29, amounting in all to £157 6s. 9d.; and further, why the inspector of taxes has instructed the collector to seize the stock and chattels of the three tenant farmers therein, viz., Cornelius Ryan, Martin Crowe and Mrs. Kate Ryan, widow, considering the fact that until recently these tenants were not aware of any assessment <Col N="2126" /> of income tax in respect of the lands, and until recently got no opportunity of deducting tax from their rents; and further, if the Minister will arrange that these tenants be permitted to pay their rents to the Revenue Commission until the arrears of income tax is liquidated.</P>

      <P>As regards the first part of the question any informative statement as to the delay in collection would involve a disclosure of the affairs of private persons and I am, therefore, precluded from making such a statement.</P>
      <P>The recovery of tax from the occupiers is authorised by Section 199 of the Income Tax Act, 1918, which provides inter alia that tax under Schedule A may be collected, recovered and levied by the collector by distress from the occupier of the property charged, or upon the premises in respect of which the assessment is made, and all goods and chattels, to whomsoever the same may belong, found on any such premises, may be distrained and sold for the recovery of any such tax.  Rule 1 of No. VIII. of Schedule A of the Income Tax Act, 1918, provides that a tenant occupier of any lands who pays the tax shall be entitled to deduct and retain the tax appropriate to the rent payable to the landlord.  The occupying tenant is thus furnished with a legal means of recoupment in respect of any tax paid by him in respect of the landlord's interest in the property and it lies with the occupying tenant to utilise the means provided by law.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners are communicating with the parties concerned with a view to their paying the rents to the Revenue as tax until the liability is met.</P>

A list of subscribers to the Dáil Loan in the parish of Rockhill was received in my Department and repayment to the subscribers who made application within the prescribed period and furnished satisfactory evidence in support of their claims has already been authorised.  No list was received from the parish of Bruree.  A number of subscribers in this parish have, however, furnished satisfactory evidence in support of their claims, and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs has recently been authorised to issue Savings Certificates to the majority of these.  I hope to be in a position to authorise repayment in favour of the remainder at an early date.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state the quantity of German or other foreign oats which has been imported into Saorstát Eireann since last harvest; whether he is aware that the importation of such oats is likely to bring infection and cause foot and mouth disease in this country, and whether he will prohibit or limit the importation of foreign oats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There were no direct imports of oats into Saorstát Eireann from Germany during the six months ended 31st March, 1930. The total imports of oats, other than seed oats, during that period were 37,972 cwt., of which 13,996 cwt. were from Great Britain and 23,976 cwt. from Northern Ireland.  As consignors are not required to state the country of origin, it is not possible, as intimated in my previous reply of 9th ultimo on this subject, to say whether any and, if so, what quantity of these imports originated in countries other than Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  Save as regards a consignment of 3 tons reputed to be of German origin, imported via Great Britain during the past few months, the Department have no evidence that any oats grown on the continent of Europe have reached this country.  As far as the Department are aware, there is no record of oats from a country infected with foot and mouth disease being held responsible for conveying that disease.  In all the circumstances, therefore, it is not considered necessary to prohibit such importations at present, but the matter will be closely watched.</P>

A similar situation may arise in the very near future.

      <P>Technically, of course, only one Vote is introduced, but on that question discussion can take place over the whole five or six Votes.  It is not limited to the Vote that has been formally moved, but will be expected to range over all the Votes for which I am responsible.</P>

      <P>My reason for asking it was that some confusion arose last year owing to the discussion covering the whole Votes.  That confusion very nearly precluded Deputy Alton from speaking on some matter in which he was interested.</P>
      <P>I shall try and follow the Minister's example and be brief.  The slight increases in the Votes for primary and secondary education are apparently automatic and need no comment.  I agree with the Minister in questioning whether 98 or even 95 per cent. attendance in any country, whether in rural or urban schools, can be taken as an absolute figure, that certain allowances must be made because, of course, statistics can be made to prove many things. A five per cent. increase in attendance resulting from the compulsory Act is very good, but the Minister stated that he took 82.5 or thereabouts to be the stabilised figure. I think we should rather aim at an 85 per cent. attendance.</P>
      <P>As regards the work in the top standards, and whether the programme and staff cater for the needs of pupils between the ages of 12 and 14, I understand from the Minister that the inspector's report was satisfactory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

    <Col N="2146" />
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>My reason for mentioning that was that it is rather a contentious question.  I have met myself technical teachers and manual instructors who informed me in different counties that parents had come to them beseeching them to take children of 12 or 13 years of age from the national schools as they were practically wasting their time there.  That, of course, may not be and probably is not, attributable to neglect on the part of the teachers, but to the under-staffing, which is necessitated by financial stringencies not only here, but in other States as well.  It is very hard for some of these schools to cater for the needs of the top standards.  The Technical Commission's Report, on page 22, paragraph 50, states: &ldquo;Great difficulty has been experienced in technical schools as a result of the low standard of elementary education of many of the applicants for admission to classes.&rdquo;  The blame could hardly, of course, be fixed on the teacher, because even if the pupils had finished the sixth standard they would scarcely be able to take advantage of technical education. A part might be attributed to the irregular attendance some years ago, because compulsory attendance in the last few years could not remedy the defects which had arisen prior to the application of that Act.  No doubt the operation of the Continuation Education Bill will remedy that defect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection even at the risk of being considered retrograde I think that a good deal could be said for reversion to the individual inspection of schools.  I think that it would be profitable to revert even in part to that individual inspection. Some years ago, after the primary programme and the secondary programme had been drafted, a co-ordination committee was set up.  It ended rather abruptly for causes into which we need not go now.  I think it would be well to re-establish such a committee to adjust matters between the primary programme, the continuation programme, the secondary programme, and the technical programme.  It might be <Col N="2147" /> called a co-ordination committee, an educational council or an advisory council.  We would not quarrel about the name.  I certainly think there is room for such a committee. In the report on technical education it was recommended to establish a finance committee to consider the application and allocation of Government grants in connection with technical education.  That would be one of the functions. Another might be, of course, to see would it not be possible to lighten perhaps the national school programme in the areas in which the continuation programme would be in operation some time after the appointed day had been fixed and to attain greater proficiency in a more limited number of subjects in the primary schools.  The Minister informed us that some 10,000 of the 500,000 pupils attending National Schools had entered for the leaving certificate examination, and that some 55 per cent. had passed.  That would be 2 per cent. of the pupils.  I do not know that it would be advisable to make that leaving certificate compulsory, but would it not be well to consider what standard pupils should reach in the national schools before being admitted to the continuation schools, or would the Minister insist when they fail to reach sixth standard on their staying a year or two longer before being admitted to a higher type of school?  I know that there are difficulties in the way of making that examination compulsory.  We should like to hear the Minister's view on it when replying on these Votes.</P>
    <P>In County Galway, when the examinations were held for scholarships for pupils proceeding from primary to secondary schools, there was an extraordinary percentage of failure.  I do not attribute that failure altogether to the teachers, perhaps not at all to the teachers, but I think there is room for an inquiry into the working of the whole national system of education. Matters we have referred to year after year I suppose need scarcely <Col N="2148" /> be mentioned here now, such as school meals.  We all recognise that wet, cold and hungry children cannot avail of educational facilities in primary or any other schools, and it seems to me that there are indications that the objection or opposition to such school meals is dying down.</P>
    <P>In the matter of sanitation of schools I was told last year that it was for the Department of Local Government to interfere in such matters, but some co-operation was promised between the Department of Education and the Department of Local Government.  The Minister might be good enough to tell us what steps have been taken in that regard during the past year.  There is no need to go into a whole list of these schools which I mentioned last year and the year before, many of them with no sanitary arrangements, but we would like to know what leeway has been made up in the matter of the 350 new schools needed and the 500 requiring enlargement, also to what extent has amalgamation led to overcrowding of schools.</P>
    <P>At the risk of being misunderstood, I stated here two years ago that I did not think that teachers who had themselves only a slight knowledge of Irish should be encouraged to teach other subjects through Irish.  I suppose I will not be taken as being opposed to intensified teaching of Irish in the schools, but it does harm to the pupils and to Irish to permit teachers with a slight knowledge of Irish to attempt to teach other subjects through the medium of that language.  Our hopes are largely centred on the preparatory colleges.  This year some fifty pupils will leave these colleges, and I wonder whether adequate provision has been made in the training colleges so that those fifty pupils may continue their education on lines as Irish, as Gaelic, as it now is when they enter the training colleges. I would refer particularly to the training college in Drumcondra, without animadverting to it, so as to elicit information as to whether adequate preparations have been <Col N="2149" /> made therein.  It was pleasant to learn from the Press that the new rules and regulations are at last available and about to be put into the hands of the teachers.  Thus one cause of complaint has been removed and the Minister will have one question less to answer this year.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Gaelicising of the schools, I have never heard of the Education Department issuing even a pamphlet to the teachers to tell them what the Government requires in that respect.  There are no definite instructions that I know of.  If I am misinformed the Minister will correct me.</P>
    <P>In the head office in some respects there are unreasonable delays.  For example, there was a dispute in Achill which the Minister knows about.  I think it was finally settled by the manager being promoted to another parish after, I think, about eighteen months.  Nothing was done to settle a dispute which had actually come into court.  Letters were written week after week and month after month, but no conclusion was arrived at.  To give another instance&mdash;in June, 1929, a school was inspected.  I refer to the school of Killossery.  The principal was marked efficient.  He appealed.  That was in June.  In December there was a re-inspection and the principal was rated highly efficient.  Of course it is quite possible for a principal teacher to be only efficient in June and highly efficient in December.  I suggest that was too long a delay.</P>
    <P>In the matter of appeals some information regarding the Appeal Board would be welcomed.  There are, I understand, three men on that Board, one of them supposed to be appointed by the inspectors.  Perhaps the Minister would inform us whether the inspectors are consulted about selecting their representative, also whether the Gilbertian situation might arise in that a junior inspector on the Appeals Board might revise the work of his senior inspector who had inspected a school.  That is a ridiculous position, and he might <Col N="2150" /> inform us whether it is not a possible one.</P>
    <P>In advocating the setting up of a Texts Committee to deal with school texts, particularly in the primary system of education, I was supported here by Deputy Tierney last year or the year before.  I am still of opinion that such a committee is necessary.  An Gúm is doing something in that respect for the secondary schools.  The old National Board, whatever we might think of the outlook of some of their books, did great work in that series of Readers they published.  It is particularly necessary in Irish and Irish history.  There is an improvement, but still there is no merit in many of the Irish text-books.  Even the grammar is very often faulty. History texts are more faulty still. I myself know of some pupils in the sixth standard in a pretty large Dublin school being asked questions on recent Irish history, and displaying abysmal ignorance.  A question was answered by the best informed of ten pupils as to what leaders were executed in Easter Week.  His answer was Pearse, Connolly and Robert Emmet.  He was the only one who knew anything about it in a senior class in a Dublin school.</P>
    <P>I understand also that in the training college there is one year in which no examination is held in Irish history.  I think that is rather extraordinary.  A knowledge of history is very necessary, because if Irish is to make headway in the schools, it is not sufficient to teach it as a subject.  You must have a national foundation for it, and not teach it merely as you would teach other subjects.  Irish will never be revived except you have a national basis for the teaching of it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Pension Fund. I have been criticised and misrepresented for having suggested when the matter was last before us that Deputy O'Connell and the Minister, or the teachers and the Minister, should try and put some concrete suggestions before this House.  The question of these pensions is very involved.  It is difficult for the average <Col N="2151" /> Deputy to understand it, and my suggestion, without prejudice at all to the rights of the teachers, was that some concrete proposition should be put before this House for agreement or disagreement.  We have heard nothing since.  I do not want to press the Minister for a reply if this is not an opportune moment, but he might possibly give us some information as to how the matter stands.  When regulating those matters perhaps he would not forget the junior assistant mistresses and the lay teachers in the convent schools.  With regard to secondary education, it is significant that there was an increase in the number of schools and in the number of pupils. That is a healthy sign, but as was said by me and other Deputies in connection with the continuation education debate, we would like to see a great many of these schools with a different orientation, a curriculum more closely in touch with agriculture and the local needs of the people.  The new programme of secondary education produced a radical change in this State, even more radical than was effected in the primary schools in what was called the National programme.  In the primary schools we had a commission which revised and considered the working of that new programme since it was put in operation.  I would strongly support the plea made by the secondary teachers at their Congress that an inquiry should be held into the whole working of a scheme of secondary education, that the Minister should have a Departmental or other inquiry into its operation.</P>
    <P>Criticisms have been made of the standard of examinations.  I have heard teachers maintain, for instance, that the examinations in Irish are based, say, to the extent of 30 per cent. on tricky questions of idiom, rare idiom that might not be heard in speech from a native speaker once in a month.  Again, there have been complaints about examination papers in mathematics. While admitting that it is an ideal <Col N="2152" /> to be aimed at, I would like to know how far it is now feasible to bring the leaving certificate into some conformity with the entrance examinations to the universities.  There is waste of time and energy and a great overlapping there.  What about making the junior certificate and entrance examination for certain offices in public employment, say, under the county councils, and so on?  If it could be done, it would save a lot of time.  There is a great leakage there.  That council on education that I suggested perhaps might consider these matters.</P>
    <P>Regarding the status of Irish in secondary schools, I have asked the Minister on a few occasions what percentage of its pupils a secondary school must present for examination in Irish in order to obtain full grants.  Personally, I would rather foster Irish by encouraging it by voluntary methods if possible, but I know of many schools that are not in the least inclined, except under compulsion, to teach any Irish. Perhaps the Minister would tell us what percentage of the pupils on its rolls and for whom they are receiving grants a secondary school must present for examination in Irish in order to obtain full, or nearly full, grants.  There are schools, and they are not Protestant schools, lest it be concluded that I am referring to them, in which the position of Irish is not improving.  There has been a retrogression.  I know of two secondary schools in which there was a gasra of the Fáinne, schools in which a certain percentage of the pupils spoke in Irish, say, at mealtime or at recreation, and in both schools there has been a change for the worse.  In some of these schools Irish is taught for three-quarters of an hour five days a week as a subject, with no more national foundation to it than German or French.  I submit that the Minister might tell us whether it is possible for a secondary school that did not present, say, fifty per cent. of its pupils for Irish in A1 class or a B1 class.</P>
    <P>Regarding the pensions of secondary <Col N="2153" /> teachers the scheme inflicts hardship on elderly teachers who were over fifty years of age on the 1st August, 1929, who have had broken service during the last ten years, or part service in England or elsewhere.  In the matter of increments, too, some of the teachers are hard hit by the taking of each school as a unit in this matter.  A school might have perhaps fewer pupils one year than another, and might have a teacher or two more than the number allowed by the law or the regulations.  A teacher satisfying all the requirements, having all the qualifications, still cannot get the increments, whereas a teacher with lesser qualifications and several years shorter service in another school, can get his incremental salary.  That is an unsatisfactory position.  I can quite see that there are great difficulties in it, that the schools are now owned by the State; but perhaps if all the schools were taken into account and the number of pupils reckoned instead of taking each school as a unit, something could be done to remedy the defect.</P>
    <P>On the matter of technical education we had, of course, a pretty full debate on the Vocational Bill, and we will still have a fuller debate, I hope, in the Committee Stage.  We are, I gather, to have two schools of domestic science very soon, but I trust that the recommendations of the Technical Committee in this respect will be given due weight, that proper attention will be paid to their recommendation that the subjects should be brought more into accord with the life of the people, with the actual social and economic conditions of the people of this State.  The low proportional increase in the attendance at the commercial classes is also satisfactory or rather it is encouraging to see that in the higher technical subjects the percentage in increased attendance is much greater than in the mere commercial subjects. Perhaps the Minister would give us some information as to the bonus which was taken from the part-time teachers in technical schools.  We <Col N="2154" /> will probably be told that it is a question for the committees now, but still a dissatisfied, underpaid staff will not make for efficiency in the schools.  With regard to reformatories, I think that comes into this Vote here, and industrial schools.  They are primarily not controlled by the Government nor financed by the Government, but still there are approximately 6,000 children in these institutions.</P>
    <P>I should like to know whether the Rules and Regulations, made in 1868, have been revised.  We were informed on a previous occasion by the Minister that the authorities in control of these reformatories and industrial schools take an interest in the children for two years after they leave such schools.  I hope that that is so, and that it could not happen that children from those schools who go to work, say, on farms, could be treated, as cases in the courts have revealed that children in Scotland and England have been treated by farmers&mdash;half starved and no pay.  I hope that that could not happen in regard to boys from reformatories or industrial schools here.  It would be useless for me, I am sure, to refer to the teachers in these schools because, no doubt, the Minister will again say that that is not his business.  These teachers have hard work to do, and are occupied for long hours at a stretch, as well as having other work to do besides teaching, namely, disciplinary work.  If at all possible, their conditions should be improved.</P>
    <P>I might refer briefly to the National Library and National Museum which also come under this Vote. Owing to the comparative generosity in dealing with the National Library excellent work has been done in the way of new cataloguing and the purchase of books dealing with Ireland. More accommodation will, however, be required, especially in view of the provision of the Copyright Act.  I understand that that matter is being considered.  At the same time additional reading rooms are required if they can possibly be found.  Several <Col N="2155" /> students go there with their own text-books and do not use the library books at all.  On a few occasions when I went there about eight o'clock in the evening the atmosphere was terrible, and certainly showed that more reading rooms are wanted.  Some time ago there was an advertisement published for an assistant librarian.  I think he had to be an honours graduate, and, if I remember rightly, the salary was about £120 with bonus, or £190 altogether. I do not know how you are going to get an honours graduate to remain in a post like that.  He will probably remain there just for a time before proceeding to a better job.  I do not think that you would get the proper type of person for a post like that at such salary.  Thirty years ago an assistant librarian in the National Library started at £150. A salary of £190 for a post of that kind seems to me to be very like sweated wage.</P>
    <P>As regards the Museum, I suggest that the Minister for Finance should be as generous comparatively with that institution as he was with the National Library.  It is, I understand, being reorganised, and the confusion in the basement and entrance halls would certainly lead one to that conclusion at present. Undoubtedly the Library is of great advantage educationally, and so is the Museum, especially for students of research, from the primary schools to the universities, and for the teaching of history and other subjects.  Pride of place should, and will, I understand, be given to the Irish Section when it is completed. The Museum seems to be understaffed, and, as Deputy Alton stated, some of the scientific or technical assistants are on a temporary basis and should be made permanent.  The needs of the Antiquarian Section have often been referred to, but I do not think that they have yet been satisfied.  Those are all the matters to which I have to refer, as the University Vote does not come in at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement <Col N="2156" /> in introducing the Estimate was a frank and fair statement concerning the merits and demerits of education in this country.  In speaking to this Vote it is my intention, despite the smile of the Leader of the Labour Party, to deal with primary education in a way, perhaps, which may be distasteful to him.  The cost of primary education in this country is £3,617,000, as compared with £318,000 for secondary education.  The return received for the money spent on secondary education compares very favourably with that expended on primary education.  We are spending about £10 on primary education for every £1 spent on secondary education.  I quite agree that such expenditure is necessary, because primary education is of outstanding importance to the country, and two-thirds of the children of the country will receive no education apart from that which they receive in the primary schools.  The importance of primary education is recognised not only in this country but in most countries throughout the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Head Master of Harrow recently stated that were it not for the system of primary education in England very probably Communism and Bolshevism would have sway in that country.  Perfecting a system of education and bringing it up to the necessary pitch of excellence is, as the Minister remarked on a previous Estimate, really the work of a lifetime and cannot be achieved in a year or two.  I do not want to say anything unduly harsh about our system of primary education, but, if there are serious defects in it, it is the duty of Deputies to try and have them remedied at the earliest possible moment.  I have noticed that there have been many complaints about the results of our primary educational system.  It was recently stated, for instance, that the results of the scholarship examination in Co. Galway in connection with primary schools were anything but satisfactory.  I have also observed that in a report submitted to the County Council of Wexford, in connection <Col N="2157" /> with the scholarship scheme there, it was stated that two out of twenty-five pupils had passed the examination for such scholarships. Can anyone say that two out of twenty-five is a satisfactory proportion in a system which is costing us over three millions a year?  Miss Ryan made a statement there to which I attach considerable weight. It negatived the opinion that anything that was lacking in our primary system was not due to the teachers.  Miss Ryan stated that it showed a deplorable state of education and also that the national teachers were not doing their duty. There are, of course, differences of opinion as to the causes, and I do not set up as an authority on the matter, but there can be no difference of opinion as to the effects.</P>
    <P>Recently I made an appeal for the setting up of something in the nature of a test examination in connection with primary education.  The primary examination certificate has since been established and the Minister has given us the results.  He said that out of 10,000 pupils who presented themselves for examination only 55 per cent. passed, so that out of 10,000 pupils we had 45 per cent. of failures.  On a former occasion the Minister expressed the view that the backwardness in connection with primary education was due to unsatisfactory attendance at school.  The Compulsory School Attendance Act has now been in operation for some years and the attendance has been raised from 73 to 82 per cent.  I suggest that it is clear that the breakdown in the system is not due to irregular attendance but to other and more important causes.  The Minister informed us that there were 428,000 children on the rolls.  Of those who presented themselves for that simple examination only 5,000 odd could qualify.  Does such a system enable the children of this nation to go forward and fight the battle of life?  I say that such a percentage of passes as that mentioned shows that there are serious defects in our system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2158" /> I notice that the teachers have recently been clamouring in the Press, where they are given all the space necessary to air their grievances. They have been demanding that in future the granting of primary certificates should be placed in their hands, and that they should give them to pupils whom they regard as being fit to receive them. Was there ever such an astounding claim made by any body of men who have such results to show as those shown in connection with this Vote? The teachers want to be handed over the granting of those certificates without any examination.  I can only describe such a proposal as colossal effrontery.  I ask the Minister to realise that our primary system is undoubtedly in a backward condition. I ask him to go further and to make it obligatory that pupils reaching a certain standard should present themselves for examination. Then we would have a reliable test as to how primary education is working in the country, and we would be able to realise whether it is proving effective or ineffective. At present, when pupils come to a certain age and a certain standard, they must automatically leave that standard and go to a higher one whether they are fit for it or not.</P>
    <P>In view of the defects in the system and the huge sum of money which a comparatively poor State like this is spending on primary education, I ask is it fair that children should be changed from one standard to another without any test?  Is that in the interests of the children?  Is it fair to the parents who make sacrifices to keep their children at school?  Something must be done to deal with these defects.  There are causes for them.  It may be due to the teachers.  I do not say it is.  I do not want to be unjust.  Though there may be differences as to the causes there can be no differences as to the effects.  May I ask the Minister seriously if he cannot devise some means by which pupils will not be advanced from one standard to another without something in the nature of a test to see whether or <Col N="2159" /> not they are fit to go into the higher standard?  I believe it would be much better for a pupil to have a sound, thorough knowledge of the fourth standard and not to have a knowledge of all the fundamentals of the fourth and fifth standards.  Deputy Fahy has pointed out that complaints are coming from the technical schools about the low standard of education of those presenting themselves.  He takes the view that it is not due to the teachers, but I take the view that a great deal of it is due to the teachers.  I think there should be some spur put upon the teachers in order to endeavour to get better results than we are receiving under the present system.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is true or not, but I should like to ask the Minister if it is his intention to change the age for entrance into the preparatory colleges.  I have been told that there was some intention to lower the age for entrance from 16 to 13.  I hope it is not true.  I understand that for these examinations something like 2,000 candidates offer themselves for somewhat over 100 vacancies and if such a change is going to be made it ought to be made gradually.  Of the 2,000 pupils who present themselves for these examinations, only 140 or 150 can enter the colleges.  The parents of these children have kept them at school. They must have reached a fairly decent standard of education if the parents and the teachers consider them fit for entrance to the colleges, and it would be a very harsh thing if the parents of the bulk of these 2,000 children are left next year without any hope of their being able to enter the colleges.  I have been asked by many people about this matter, and I take the first opportunity of asking the Minister if that is his intention, and if so, to ask that such a change should be made gradually and not all at once.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to appear hypercritical as far as primary education is concerned, but certainly the country is spending a huge sum of money on it and it is undoubtedly <Col N="2160" /> getting poor results.  If anybody contrasts the results of the examinations for certificates in the national schools here with what is going on, say, in the London County Council schools, one can at once see that there is no comparison for the backwardness of education in this country. I understand that in the London County Council schools there is not a single pupil who does not pass the sixth standard.  I think I can make that statement as being true, and I shall be glad to hear what Deputy O'Connell has to say on the subject.  I have the idea that the national teachers in this country are becoming a little bit too autocratic in their demands and in their methods, and that some voice should be raised on behalf of the parents of the children and of the children themselves.  Nobody will be better pleased to hear that any statement I have made, as far as the teachers are concerned, is untrue than I shall be.  What I do say is that undoubtedly primary education is backward in this country and that some steps should be taken to see that it is made much more efficient than it is and that the country receives value for the three millions odd which it is spending on the present system of education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to Deputy Byrne that complaints with reference to primary education are not confined to this country.  Similar complaints are made in England and in America, and one frequently comes across statistics in these countries showing that the average of illiteracy is very high and pointing out that evidently there is something seriously wrong with the system of primary education there.  Personally, I think that in this country the programme is overcrowded and that in endeavouring to teach a multitude of subjects the point is missed and the children in these schools have a confused knowledge of many subjects and no real knowledge of any.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two matters in <Col N="2161" /> connection with the primary education Vote to which I should like to refer.  One is the heating and cleaning of schools, for which a sum of £14,400 is set aside.  I do not know if many Deputies receive complaints such as we get down the country, that the money provided for this purpose is entirely inadequate, with the result that in many country schools the teacher has very often to bear the greater portion of the expense of heating and cleaning the school, and in many cases the children have to do the cleaning after school hours.  The old practice of carrying sods of turf to the school is still in force in many parts.  It is a great hardship on children who have travelled long distances to have to spend the day in a cold, draughty school with a very inadequate fire.</P>
    <P>Another question is the cost of books.  This matter has been frequently raised here.  It is due, I take it, to the constant changing of books in the schools.  The Readers are changed too frequently, with the result that poor people with a number of children going to school find it very hard to meet the expense. They will tell you that it is almost impossible for them to keep their children in books.  When one child passes from one standard to another, instead of being able to hand on the books to the next member of the family, new books have to be provided.</P>
    <P>As to the National Gallery, I made a plea before that if it were possible some of the pictures should be sent occasionally to some of the other cities and urban centres where accommodation could be provided for them.  All the people in the country cannot come to Dublin, and there are people of culture and refinement in many parts who never get a chance of seeing these works of art.  If it were possible to insure the pictures and the authorities in other centres would make arrangements for their reception, it would be a good idea if selections from them could be sent down occasionally. The people of Cork, Waterford, <Col N="2162" /> and other places have to pay for the upkeep of the National Gallery, and it is only fair that they should get a chance of seeing something for their money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T.J. O'Connell Mr. T.J. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>So many questions could be raised on this Vote that it is difficult to do more than merely mention them. Indeed many of the matters that I wish to refer to have already been referred to year after year.  I do not propose, therefore, to do more than to mention them again, because we have already said all that it is possible to say about them.  Generally the Minister, in his opening statement, has the usual annual excuse for not having the rules published. He spared us that this time, and trusted to the inspiration of a newspaper report.  But, as far as I and most of those who are engaged on the work of education are concerned, we have given up all hope of ever seeing these rules.  I shall do no more now than remind the House that we have not yet got them after eight years of Departmental life.  I suppose the Minister takes it&mdash;at least it is evidence of the fact that he agrees&mdash;that owing to the good sense of the teachers, managers and others engaged in education they are able to carry on without any rules. There might be something to be said for that if the Department did not now and again root up some old rule and use it to prevent the application of the common sense of managers and teachers to carrying out the work of the schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A considerable amount is provided in this Estimate, and a considerable amount has appeared in other years' Estimates for the provision of preparatory colleges.  I do not wish to say anything on the whole policy of preparing teachers in this way, but I should like to get some explanation &mdash; so far as I know none has yet been offered&mdash;as to the necessity for erecting large and substantial and expensive buildings in out-of-the-way places in the country.  These buildings are erected in the Gaeltacht. When the intention is that people should be reared in the atmosphere <Col N="2163" /> of the Irish language and brought up to be able to use it, it would seem at first sight that the natural place to have them trained is in a district where Irish is the spoken language. But when one remembers that in practice the students have no real touch with the life of the Gaeltacht, one is tempted to ask what is the reason for having these colleges there.  We have two or three of these colleges in Dublin, and if it is necessary to have the colleges in the Gaeltacht then we should not have the present colleges in Dublin, where they are not in touch with Irish speakers.  The real fact, I understand, is that the students are not in touch with Irish speakers, even where the colleges are erected in the Gaeltacht.  There is no real touch with the life of the people.  The students may take a walk amongst them now and again, but these students, as we can well understand, are kept under discipline, and rightly so; they live in the schools and have little touch with their surroundings. They could do that equally well in Meath or Westmeath or Dublin.</P>
    <P>I should like to have some idea as to the difference in cost which that has entailed upon the State.  I believe the difference is a substantial one and I should like to have from the Minister the corresponding value that we have obtained as a result of putting these colleges in out-of-the-way places instead of in more central positions.  I have had complaints from parents as to the cost of travelling to these colleges.  That is one of the factors which have to be taken into account.  The main factor, however, is the cost of erection of new buildings in these out-of-the-way places.  If it could be shown that the students were part and parcel of the life of the Gaeltacht and that they were deriving special advantages from the fact that the colleges were situated in the Gaeltacht, it would be all to the good.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in connection with these colleges on which I would like to have the views of <Col N="2164" /> the Minister.  We have heard that the students in these colleges have done very well at the Intermediate examinations.  I should like to know at what cost to themselves students have achieved this success. The secondary programme is usually covered in three or four years. Secondary teachers think that they are doing very well if they cover the programme for the Intermediate certificate in that time.  It can, as a matter of fact, only be done with a certain amount of pressure.  The students who enter the Preparatory Colleges, say, in October, 1928, are expected to sit for the Intermediate certificate in 1930.  From what I have heard, I am satisfied that the measure of success which they have achieved could only be obtained at the cost of a great deal of pressure on the part of both pupils and teachers.  They would require to be working at very high pressure all that time.  These children&mdash;the boys and girls attending these colleges are little more than children &mdash; are at such an age that work for eight or ten hours per day is not good for their health.</P>
    <P>We ought to remember, in training the teachers who are to take charge of the children of the future, that we do not want mere bookworms. We want teachers who will have wide experience and knowledge. To keep a young lad's nose to the grindstone from early morning till late at night in order that he may pass an examination and make a good show at the end of eighteen or twenty months is not the best way to turn out a successful teacher. I should like that there would be some examination of the amount of work done by the student in those colleges as compared with the amount of work done in the ordinary residential secondary school.  This matter is, perhaps, rendered more important when we remember that the success of a pupil at the intermediate certificate examination will determine whether or not he is to be continued in the college.  It is unfair to the children that they should be expected to cover the course in <Col N="2165" /> approximately half the time allowed for the same course in the ordinary secondary school.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer again to a question which has been repeatedly raised here&mdash;the provision of school accommodation. I will only refer to it on this occasion for the purpose of obtaining information from the Minister of the progress that has been made in solving the problem.  I should like to know how many new schools have been erected during the year and what the Minister's plans are for the future.  The amount of money available this year is less than the amount which was available last year.  The problem of school accommodation here in Dublin is specially acute.  I should like to know whether the Minister is taking any special steps to deal with the problem in Dublin.  I know that some very fine, new schools have been built here.  That has relieved the pressure to some extent, but there is no system by which the accommodation available in Dublin can be utilised to the best advantage.  Some schools are overcrowded.  Other schools may have accommodation.  I am afraid that children are refused admittance to schools in Dublin on other grounds than want of accommodation, although want of accommodation is always the plea used. That plea can always be used under our present system.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that evidence is not wanting that certain schools select their pupils and select the class from which the pupils are to be drawn. When pupils of other classes apply for accommodation in these schools, which are supposed to be free schools, they are not admitted, on the plea of want of accommodation. I think there ought to be some method by which that would be prevented. When a child applies to any school which is receiving grants from this State as a national school, that child ought to be admitted if there is accommodation for him. There ought to be no possibility of selection on the ground of the class to which the child belongs or the position held by his parents or his <Col N="2166" /> own capabilities&mdash;whether he is a brilliant student who is likely to bring credit to the school or not. These factors should be ruled out, and any child who applies should be admitted to the school if there is accommodation for him.  The question is how can that be effected?  I made one suggestion to the Minister &mdash; I do not know whether I put it formally or not.  I repeat the suggestion now: that every school should be bound to exhibit in the porch or entrance a notice showing the number of pupils for whom there is accommodation in the school. That should be displayed the same as any other school notice.  Along with it should be shown the number of pupils on the roll on the Friday of the last school week.  If that were done and a parent applied for admission for his child, he could see whether or not there was room for him.  If there was accommodation, he could insist on the admission of his child and he would not be turned away with the plea, which is made now in a great many schools, that there is no accommodation.  If the parent does not look the kind of person whose children should be admitted, he is told that the school authorities would be glad to receive him, but that there is no accommodation. There may be other methods of dealing with the question.  I suggest that method.  Certainly, something should be done to prevent what is happening in many schools in Dublin whereby some schools are enabled to make selections of the type of pupil they desire, while other schools take all the pupils for whom they have accommodation. All these schools are drawing money from the public purse, and all pupils, whether rich or poor, whether brilliant or dull, have the same right of entrance to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Goulding referred to the question of heating and cleaning. That also seems to be a perennial problem.  I should like to know from the Minister what steps he is taking, if any, as regards the provision of proper heating facilities for the <Col N="2167" /> schools, and also as regards the provision of sanitation.</P>
    <P>There is another matter about which I think it is necessary to say a few words, especially in view of discussions that have taken place lately.  I refer to the Department's policy as regards instruction through the medium of the Irish language. There has been quite a considerable amount of discussion and complaint by teachers of late that the Department's policy is practically to force teachers by indirect means to teach subjects through the medium of Irish, although the teachers themselves feel that the conditions under which such teaching can be carried on successfully are not present.  In the School Programme Report for 1926, it was laid down that where a teacher is competent to teach through Irish, and where the children can assimilate the instruction so given, the teacher should endeavour to extend the use of Irish as a medium of instruction as far as possible.  That is reasonable, and nobody objects to it.  But there are two conditions definitely laid down there&mdash;(1) that the teacher must be competent to teach through Irish, and (2) that the children should be able to assimilate the instruction.  It is stated that. generally speaking, the teacher who holds the bi-lingual or higher certificate will be deemed competent to teach through the medium of Irish.  The complaint that is heard from teachers is, not that they are themselves being forced to teach through the medium of Irish while they are not competent to do so, but that the children under their care whom they are expected to teach through Irish are not in a position to assimilate that instruction. There is no doubt in my mind that teachers in many cases are being indirectly coerced to teach subjects through the medium of Irish merely in order to be able to say, as far as I can judge, that they are teaching through the medium of Irish.  Who ought to be the judge in these matters?  That is the difficulty.</P>
    <P>I think that where you have good, <Col N="2168" /> efficient teachers, teachers who are doing their work earnestly and fairly, the decision, to a very large extent, should rest with them as to whether or not the children can assimilate their instruction through the medium of Irish.  After all, the inspector visits a school once a month and in many cases not nearly so often.  He certainly will not know as well as the teacher can know&mdash;he has no means of knowing&mdash;whether or not children are able to benefit by instruction through the medium of Irish.  I think that the demand that was made by the teachers at the Congress, that the time had come for some kind of assessment of the whole value of teaching through the medium of Irish, in the circumstances is a fair demand.  They passed a resolution saying that in their opinion the time was ripe for an educational assessment of the use of Irish as a teaching medium in schools in English-speaking districts. I think it would be well if we had an examination now, after a period of eight years, of the effect of teaching subjects through the medium of Irish, its educational value, and whether in fact an attempt has been made to do more than it is possible to do.  I have a strong feeling arising out of statements made by many teachers&mdash;I will not call them complaints; they were only complaints in so far as these teachers felt that their status was being affected in some way&mdash;that things are being done in some schools &mdash; sometimes perhaps through the enthusiasm of the teachers themselves, but much more often as a result of a feeling that they are expected to do it&mdash;that are not for the educational benefit of the children.  If that is so I think that they should not be done.  I do not want to go into this to any great extent now, but I could quote instances that would lead one to believe that there is a settled policy to insists that, whether it is the teachers' opinion or not that it will be of benefit to the pupils, instruction must be given in certain subjects through the medium of Irish.  You cannot lay down hard and fast rules <Col N="2169" /> in a question of this kind.  You might find certain schools in Dublin in which such instruction could very well be given.  There are schools in Dublin with special advantages in which there is no doubt that instruction can be given effectively through the medium of Irish where the children are largely Irish-speaking. There may be other schools where that can be done effectively, while in a school across the road it would be foolish to attempt it. There is no use in laying down a hard and fast rule to the effect that in future, unless such instruction is given, a teacher cannot get rated as highly efficient, which brings with it certain rewards to the teacher.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into this at great length, nor do I want to quote particular cases.  It is a matter that the teachers themselves have discussed with the Minister on many occasions.  But I would like to have from the Minister a statement as to what the policy of the Department is, as to what they expect to be done, and whether or not they stand by that statement which I read as to the conditions which should exist before subjects are expected to be taught through the medium of Irish, namely, that the teacher is competent to impart it, and that the children are in a position to assimilate teaching through the medium of Irish, because if one sets out to teach through the medium of Irish, the statement you often hear is that if that condition is not present you are teaching Irish and not the subject.</P>
    <P>Another matter that one comes across now and again is that a teacher will be told that his teaching of the subject through the medium of Irish&mdash;arithmetic, history and geography, and such subjects &mdash; is very good, and yet the subject, oral Irish, is only marked &ldquo;good.&rdquo; That is important when it is remembered that one of the regulations at present applying to a certain class of teachers&mdash;not to all teachers but to some of the younger&mdash;is that no matter how well all the other subjects are taught, unless the mark <Col N="2170" /> for oral Irish is also &ldquo;very good&rdquo; the teacher cannot be rated &ldquo;highly efficient&rdquo; and cannot get the special or higher increments that are attached to that rating.  As I say, cases have occurred where all the other subjects have been marked &ldquo;very good,&rdquo; including subjects taught through the medium of Irish, and yet the oral Irish is supposed to be only &ldquo;good.&rdquo;  I cannot conceive how a subject like arithmetic could be taught through the medium of Irish in a way that could be described as very good if the children had not a good oral knowledge of the language.  If that is the case, arithmetic should not be taught through the medium of Irish at all.  I should like to have from the Minister a definite statement as to what the position is, and I should like to know whether it is his intention to have an assessment made of the whole value of teaching subjects through the medium of Irish in English-speaking districts.  I think the time has come when we might very well take stock of what we have been doing in the matter of reviving Irish for the past eight years and find out whether we are going in the right direction or whether a better system than that in operation at the moment might not be adopted.</P>
    <P>I will refer, again briefly, to the various recommendations that were in the 1926 Report and that have not been carried out.  There is one of them especially that I have been raising year after year, and that is the notes for teachers.  I suggested some time ago that if the Minister were to take three or four of the senior inspectors and put them at this job and if they were to spend a whole year at it the value to education as a whole would be better in the end, even with the expense that it would involve.  I am sure that it would have a frightful effect on Deputy Byrne if the inspectors were withdrawn for a short time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I believe that some of the inspectors should be set <Col N="2171" /> aside for this work.  That work would come home to the whole teaching body, and that would be of more benefit than their incidental visits to schools during the year.  As Deputy Byrne has butted in at this stage, I might say a word or two about his statements.  We hear a good deal about value for money.  Will Deputy Byrne tell us how he would estimate the value we are getting for the money?  What is the standard of value?  That is a question, I think, that anyone who comes with this annual jeremiad ought to be prepared to answer.</P>

      <P>That shows at once that the Deputy was completely ignorant of what he was talking about all the time.  He asked what was being done by the London County Council, and he said that he was informed that practically every child passed through the sixth standard.  When our School Attendance Act will have been in operation for five years, which will be next year or the following year, we hope that practically every child will pass through the sixth standard.

      <P>I venture to say that the Deputy is very far wrong; in fact, I am quite sure that he is. He spoke about the primary certificate that was instituted for the first <Col N="2172" /> time this year on a voluntary basis &mdash; that was why all the children were not put in for the examination&mdash;and he talked about the astounding claim that was made by the teachers that they should have control in some way of the issue of this certificate. Of course, Deputy Byrne does not know that it was the teachers themselves that marked the papers this year.  He is quite unaware of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>And at least one of the reasons why there was not a higher percentage of passes was because the teachers adopted too high a standard and rather undermarked the papers or did not give the full value.  That may surprise Deputy Byrne.  I am sure that he cannot conceive that a national teacher would have any sense of honour or that the would be inspired by anything but to show good results in order to satisfy Deputy Byrne.  I could quite well conceive what Deputy Byrne would say if some of us began to dip too deeply into the buying and selling of spades and shovels, for instance.  We would be promptly told by him that we knew nothing about it.</P>

Perhaps he was unfortunate in his teacher, or perhaps his teacher was unfortunate in him, which is more likely.  We had evidence on the matter the other day when the Minister for Industry and Commerce made repeated attempts to point out to him some very simple thing that was in an Act of Parliament.  After that exhibition I am not surprised at anything that Deputy Byrne says, but I do not intend to deal with his statement at any length.  In this country there is more inspection of the work of teachers than in any other country which I know, and the complaint has been made that it <Col N="2173" /> is over-inspected.  Certainly there is more inspection here than there is in England or in Scotland.  I do not know whether Deputy Byrne knows anything about the systems of education in England and Scotland.</P>

      <P>We have had statements from those who are best qualified to make them as to the efficiency of the teachers and the work that the teachers do.  There was never a time, as I think the Minister himself said, when there were not statements from people of the type of Deputy Byrne that the work was not satisfactory and that in their fathers' time or in their grandfathers' time very much better work was done.  We will always have that type of complaint, and I am sure that anything I or the Minister or anybody else in this House would say would have no effect whatever on Deputy Byrne.  But we pay as much attention to what Deputy Byrne says on this subject as we do to what he says on any other subject, and that is very little.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support what Deputy Fahy says about industrial school teachers.  I think that the conditions under which those men have to work are not at all as they should be.  I cannot see why the Minister is so powerless as he pretends to be in this matter.  A grant is being given by the State towards these schools.  I suggest it should not be handed over without some different conditions being attached.  It would not be unfair if grants necessary for the maintenance of the schools were found by the local authority while grants necessary for educating the children were found by the Education Department. An arrangement on that basis could be made; either that or the State should undertake the education of the children, be responsible <Col N="2174" /> for them and see that the teachers teaching the children possess the same qualifications and are put on the same scales of salaries as the teachers engaged in the National Schools.  These are a few of the points I was anxious to mention. There are many other things deserving of discussion on this important Vote but I will, perhaps, raise them on other occasions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Collins-O'Driscoll</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer to the matter that has been spoken of by Deputy Goulding &mdash; the cost of school Readers to children in the primary schools. Every year in almost every school the Readers are changed in each standard. Some parents have mentioned to me on different occasions that they look with dread upon the promotion of their children in the schools owing to the very high expense that is entailed. There are so many Readers on the market at the present moment that I could scarcely name them. There are, for instance, the Standard, the Oriel, the Acme and the Sterling, and there is a regular competition amongst Readers with titles of the Saints.  Each of the series of Readers is excellent in itself, and I know that it is the policy of the Department to encourage a change of Readers in the different standards; but I often think that the Department's intentions, when it is mentioned that it is advisable to introduce new matters to the pupils in the different standards every year, are misinterpreted.  A pupil is promoted from the second to the third standard and the series he gets in the third standard will certainly be new matter to him; the same applies to the fourth and other standards.  These Readers, excellent as they are, really mean a duplication of matter.  You find the same poems, and the same lessons in prose appear in the different series.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expense involved in purchasing books is a very important consideration. Books that sold for a penny, twopence or threepence in my day are now sold for as many shillings.  This cannot be said to be the fault of the publishers.  They are not sure of their market, and I <Col N="2175" /> do not know how they estimate the number of series of Readers they will publish every year.  This applies mostly to the English Readers.  If the Minister could get some of the inspectors and teachers&mdash;perhaps in that matter Deputy O'Connell could suggest something&mdash;into consultation they might be able to advise in regard to series of Readers and I believe that that would have a very beneficial effect on primary education. I know for a fact that when children reach 14 years the parents consider the price of books is too prohibitive and they keep the children away from school.  In many cases there is a serious tax on the teachers, because frequently they have to buy Readers for the poor children.  I know that Deputy O'Connell's solution of the matter would not be the Minister's solution, but something should be done to lessen the cost on the pupils.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I would like to refer.  In the school programme I believe needlework is not obligatory in girls' schools now until the girls have reached the third standard.  A child leaving the infant school is usually about seven years, and then that child is placed in the first standard.  The child does not reach the second standard until she is nine years, and she is at least then years before she reaches the third standard.  It is a great hardship on a child not to be shown how to use a needle until she is ten or, perhaps eleven years of age.  Of course the programme is certainly overcrowded, but I think that in girls' schools some means should be devised to drop one subject and let needlework be taught in the junior standards.  It is very hard on the teacher in the third and fourth standards to have to teach the elements of needlework.</P>
    <P>I am in entire disagreement with my colleague for North Dublin in what he said about primary education. I think that the people of the Saorstát never got better value for their money than they are getting at present.  There is no more hardworked body of teachers in any <Col N="2176" /> country than there is in Ireland. The teachers here have nobly responded to whatever calls were made upon them.  Some of them had to learn Irish, had to commence in the very elementary stages, and to-day they are teaching the language with excellent results.  There are some teachers who, eight years ago, did not know a word of Irish and they now have the bi-lingual certificate; they are teaching Irish and are able to rank in the standards of the highly efficient.  Their teaching of the English language and of the other subjects is equally good.  There may be a few exceptions, but these are the exceptions which prove the rule.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne's idea of the primary leaving certificate is one with which not many of us will agree.  This is a subject in which we are all interested.  As Deputy O'Connell has stated, this was a perfectly voluntary matter last year. The fact that the teachers presented 10,000 pupils when it was not obligatory on them to do so, and prepared them for what I consider a very difficult test, is surely commendable. I wonder did Deputy Byrne see the papers that were set for the primary leaving certificate? I have often wondered how many Deputies would be able to answer these papers set for the primary leaving certificate.  The Irish in the higher course was a real steppingstone to the intermediate certificate, and so was the higher English course, and the arithmetic, instead of being of a low standard was, in my opinion, of a very high standard. I say to Deputy Byrne, with great respect, that if he reads those papers he will change his mind.  He states that there are 428,000 pupils on the rolls.  Not a sixth of that number, perhaps not one-tenth or one-twelfth of that number, could under any circumstances be allowed to sit for the primary leaving certificate.  The fact that there were, voluntarily, 10,000 sitting out of a possible 30,000 was most creditable.  The fact that 55 per cent. passed at the first attempt does not indicate by any means a low standard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2177" /> I think the Education Department is to be congratulated especially on what it has achieved on the technical side.  At the end of April I received an invitation to view some of the exhibits of the Dublin technical schools.  The exhibition was on Friday evening and, unfortunately, most country Deputies had then gone home.  I only wish that they had an opportunity of seeing some of the work turned out in the technical schools in Dublin.  I could scarcely believe that such excellent work was possible.  I visited the technical schools at an earlier period when the pupils were only commencing. The progress they made from October to April was something wonderful and it reflected great credit on the principals of the schools and on the Department.</P>

      <P>I should like to make a few sporadic remarks on two or three subjects.  It was very pleasing to find the Minister in a position to say that we are making important progress and that the attendances in the schools are greatly increased. I think we might say that probably as a result of more regular attendance there has been a considerable improvement in the number of pupils who have been able to reach the sixth standard.  Though I accept these statements with pleasure, and am glad that the Minister is able to make them, I put myself alongside the unpopular Deputy, Deputy Byrne, in one respect.  We are spending a very large sum of money on primary education.  I do not want a penny less spent on it, but I still think with the Deputy that we ought to get more rapid improvement than we are getting. There is really a case for seeing whether we are making the improvement that we ought to be making, considering the money we are spending on the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Mrs. Collins-O'Driscoll, and not with Deputy Byrne, in believing that the cause, if what I believe to be true is true, is not at all with the teachers.  I do not follow Deputy Byrne in that.  He thought the teachers were largely to <Col N="2178" /> blame.  I take very much the view of Deputy Mrs. Collins-O'Driscoll in that respect, that the teachers are doing their very best to get the very best results in and through their work, and I believe they are very largely successful.  I think there are other causes which are holding us back.  The attitude taken up by Deputies Fahy and O'Connell makes me really hopeful that something important may come from these discussions. I do not want to turn the debate into a debate about Irish, but I was pleased to hear Deputy Fahy say that he was a firm believer in a policy of fostering the Irish language rather than compelling the use of Irish.  It has been my conviction always that if you want to make a success of the teaching of Irish you have to do it through a fostering policy rather than through a compulsory policy.  I thought that even more important was the statement made by Deputy Fahy, followed by the statement of Deputy O'Connell, that the important question at present is to what extent attempts are being made to teach other subjects through the medium of Irish.  I have no doubt the Minister will say that the policy is that laid down in the paper which Deputy O'Connell read. I have no fault to find with that as a policy for the Minister, but I think there is a good deal more than that to be considered.  One important point is whether that lenient policy is the policy that is being followed in the course of the Department's administration.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Fahy that pressure is the wrong way, that there is pressure in the administration to make the teaching of other subjects through the medium of Irish be carried on very frequently in a way which is fatal to the real education of the child, and that so long as there is that wrong pressure the results are bound to be poor, and that what is required is an easing of that policy in administration rather than an increase in the pressure.  I agree with what Deputy Fahy and Deputy O'Connell said in that matter, and I strongly support them in their suggestion that there really is a case for <Col N="2179" /> inquiry, a summing-up, a taking stock, of seeing what the policy of the last eight years has led us to, of seeing whether we are getting&mdash;I will put it bluntly and crudely as Deputy Byrne did&mdash;value for our money and whether we can hope to get more improvement if we change our plans somewhat.  I do not think that even Deputy Mrs. Collins-O'Driscoll or any other Deputy is prepared to say in the House that we have got a perfect system.  If we can get improvements I hope we are always anxious to try and find them and bring them into practice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fahy and Deputy O'Connell have also referred to two or three other matters in which I should like to support them very strongly.  I agree that the most important event of the last twelve months in connection with the votes we are now talking about has been the introduction of the secondary pensions scheme.  I agree with the Minister that it is yet too early to say whether that scheme is on a perfectly satisfactory footing or not.  I refer to the subject for this reason, that I know there are cases of hardship, and I think it is important for any Deputy who knows of such cases to bring those cases of hardship under the notice of the Minister, because it is only when such cases are brought to his notice that he can see whether the scheme is completely satisfactory and perfect or whether it will not require some amendment at a later stage.  With Deputy Fahy, I think the most important cases of hardship that have arisen have been those of broken service for the older teachers in connection with the rules that are laid down in the scheme, applying to cases of quite long service where well qualified teachers were approaching the age for retirement and were cut out by those rules for broken service.  I do not want to go into special cases, but I want to urge Deputies to make it their business to find out how the rules of the scheme are working among secondary teachers so that the Minister may be made aware of cases of hardship.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2180" /> In connection with the secondary teachers, there is another matter to which small reference was made, and that is that there still remain a number &mdash; I am glad a comparatively small number&mdash;of highly efficient teachers teaching approved classes for the requisite number of hours and still not receiving the incremental salary given by the Department. I think so long as any of that class remain it will be a blot upon our system.  The Minister, in the last reply he gave to a question on the subject, certainly surprised me and pleased me by saying that the number of such teachers had fallen obviously and had become unimportant in number, but that is all the more reason for removing the defect completely. It means all the less cost to the State.  It ought to be possible to find some way even without increased cost to the State in which the grants given by these increments would be distributed in such a way that there would be no teacher suffering from a grievance of that kind, and I consider it to be a real grievance.  As I have said, there are highly efficient teachers teaching a number of classes the requisite number of hours and yet they are debarred from receiving the incremental grant or prevented from changing from one school to another, because if they do so it may cause a loss in increment.</P>
    <P>In connection with pensions there is another matter to which I would like to make a brief reference.  We have had to talk about it in the House before and the Minister for Education himself in 1928 stated, I believe, his intentions or his convictions in the matter.  I want to remind him of that statement and to ask him whether there is a hope that action will be taken in the early future on the matter.  I refer to national school inspectors who are retired after a lengthy service, part of which may have been service as a national school teacher.  Now we in the Free State are in this matter in an isolated position compared with Northern Ireland or Great Britain. There the service which he has had teaching as a national school teacher <Col N="2181" /> is taken into account.  When his pension comes to be estimated in the Free State we are still in the position that a retiring inspector's pension is calculated only on the years of service as an inspector.  At least I believe that to be the case.  When the Superannuation Act was going through in 1928 the Minister for Education said that it was not his intention that that should continue and that he felt that there was justice in their claim that their whole service as teachers and inspectors should be taken account of.  In that I am in entire agreement with him and I bring the matter forward in the hope that I may be able to get from him an assurance that some change will be made in what I believe to be our present policy in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not the intention originally to take part in this debate at all but in view of one point in particular that was raised by Deputy O'Connell I think that it is the duty of anybody who is interested in education or in the progress of the Irish language to express himself.  I am very glad that a certain amount of misgiving has been expressed from the side of those who are actively engaged in education as to the question of teaching subjects through the medium of Irish.  I have been of the opinion personally for a long time that the movement towards teaching subjects through the medium of Irish was a movement which was fraught with danger not only to education generally in the country but to the progress of the Irish language itself. There is a good deal to be said for teaching children in their most youthful stage the elements of calculation and such things through the medium of the Irish language but I do not believe personally that the practice of teachers who themselves are not native speakers trying to teach other subjects through the medium of that language to children who are not native speakers of it is a practice which anybody who has any kind of logical mind could defend as an educational practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2182" /> Deputy O'Connell talked about there being schools in Dublin in which it was possible that subjects might be successfully taught through the medium of Irish.  I am inclined to doubt whether there is any place in Ireland outside the Gaeltacht where it is possible successfully without doing damage either to Irish or to education to teach subjects to any high standard through the medium of Irish.  I believe that this effort which has been made to impose the teaching of mathematics, for example, and other subjects through Irish in the schools is one of the things which have done most to create misgiving and uncertainty in the public mind and to create a certain amount of artificial opposition to the whole question of teaching the Irish language.  It might not be there at all if this effort had not been made.  I have come across cases even in my own experience where experiments of what you can only call a ludicrous kind were made in certain secondary schools.  I do not say that these experiments were sanctioned or ordered by the officials of the Ministry.  Some of the things were brought about by the enthusiasm of certain people.  Certain teachers take the bit in their teeth when they get a certain amount of encouragement.  I believe the function of the Ministry of Education should be to discourage teaching the students through the medium of Irish in a non-Irish-speaking district unless they are satisfied that both the children and the teachers have a very good knowledge of the language. The number of teachers in Ireland qualified, certainly as far as secondary education is concerned, to teach any subject through the medium of Irish in any real, thorough or successful way must be a very small number.  You will get a great many people who will make an effort to teach, for instance, Latin through the medium of Irish, but I make bold to have grave doubts about the quality of the Latin that is so taught.  The danger looks greater as you go up in the scale of education. I believe less harm is done in the lower classes of primary schools <Col N="2183" /> by teaching the elements of calculation, and so on, through Irish, to children who are just beginning the language or who have a certain amount of fluency in it, but it is in the senior classes, and especially in secondary schools, that the grave danger exists both to education generally and the language itself if there is too much indulgence or too much encouragement of the practice.</P>
    <P>I am personally inclined to think that all this movement towards teaching subjects through the medium of Irish is a premature movement and I am not sure that it is not all founded on a semi-political make-believe. It is an inheritance from the days when we were trying to get a Republic by pretending that we had one.  We are trying to restore the Irish language by pretending that it is restored and to my mind that process is confusing what is really an end with a means.  If Irish comes to be the spoken language of the country then it will be quite easy and necessary that subjects should be taught through the medium of Irish, but until that date comes attempts to teach things like mathematics, geography, and so on through the medium of Irish are really confusing an end with what can only be a means to an end.  I am very glad that the teachers themselves have adverted, both outside the Dáil and here, in the person of Deputy O'Connell, to the danger of that whole movement.  I hope that what Deputy O'Connell has said will be taken very much to heart by the Minister, and if there is any attempt being made by over-zealous officials or teachers to push the teaching of other subjects through the medium of Irish in districts where such a system is unsuitable it will be curbed. There are two other subjects of lesser importance which I desire to mention. I believe that a certain amount of difficulty has arisen in secondary schools owing to the character of the leaving certificate programme.  It has come to my knowledge, from the point of view of the university, that a great deal of difficulty is being encountered <Col N="2184" /> on account of the lack of co-ordination between the leaving certificate programme and the programme for the university matriculation. The National University is, at any rate, doing something itself to try and bring about a better co-ordination. I wonder whether from the side of the Ministry something more active could not be done to secure that the standard of the two examinations shall not be so far apart as it is at the moment?  What happens now is that students instead of as was originally intended, going in for the leaving certificate examination, go in for the matriculation examination a year earlier and thus gain a year.  The result is that the leaving certificate examination, which was intended originally to be a sort of entrance to the university, has to a certain extent been left high and dry and, instead of the secondary course being lengthened, as it was hoped it would be, it has been shortened since the days of the senior grade intermediate.  The whole question is one of co-ordination.  The standards of the two examinations are too far apart.  It may be possible either by raising that of the matriculation or lowering that of the leaving certificate examination to bring them nearer.</P>
    <P>Another point on which I would like to dwell is that raised by, I think, Deputy Mrs. Collins-O'Driscoll, namely, the question of supplying proper text-books in the primary schools.  I do not know whether it was last year or the year before that I raised this matter.  I believe that one of the greatest drawbacks in the primary system is the lack of a standard supply of good text-books. There is at present too much variation and the matter is left too much in the hands of publishers, who are amenable largely to the laws of supply and demand and are not necessarily actuated by any very high educational motives.  I believe that since the old series of text-books was abolished there has been a constant decline in the standard of readers, for instance, supplied in primary schools, though the old <Col N="2185" /> Readers were perhaps prepared from a special point of view and had their own drawbacks.  I think that there should be some means by which standard text-books could be made available through the Ministry of Education and also, perhaps, the price of such text-books might be fixed so as to put them within the reach of the poorer class of pupil.</P>
    <P>That applies to English text-books, but still more so to Irish ones. So far as I am aware, and I have given a good deal of attention to the subject, the position in regard to Irish text-books is completely confused. There is no such thing as a really useful Irish Reader for primary schools.  In some parts of the country you will find the same book, perhaps an unsuitable one, in use for six or seven years.  You will find in schools in County Galway, for instance, in districts where Irish is hardly dead even yet, that there are hardly any books available for the pupils of ordinary primary schools.  Generally a book in the Munster dialect will be used by the teacher.  Perhaps one book, perhaps two books, may be available for all the pupils of the school. There is no such thing as a set of Readers in the local dialect which could be graduated so as to enable pupils to advance from simple to more difficult Irish and to introduce them to the beginning of a knowledge of Irish literature.  I think that if the zeal that is devoted to the movement for teaching through the medium of Irish were devoted to securing a properly graduated standard of text-books a great deal more would be done for the language and, perhaps, for education as well.</P>
    <P>In that respect I am inclined to think that the books which are being produced by the Committee set up under the Ministry some years ago can scarcely be described as suitable for school reading.  They purpose to be of use for secondary schools, but the vast majority of them contain practically nothing that is of any educational value, and in many cases the language in which they are written is not always of an altogether <Col N="2186" /> irreproachable kind.  I am inclined to think that the whole question of the supplying of Irish books in particular, both in primary and secondary schools, would need to be considered more carefully and, instead of novels and detective stories being published at the expense of the State, it would be better that the money spent on these books should be spent on good translations which are being produced to a very small extent.  There should be good graduated text-books containing selections from Irish prose and poetry and which would give students a good introduction to the old literature of Ireland.</P>
    <P>A great deal of whatever objection has been raised to compulsory Irish has, to my mind, been really against the methods pursued in enforcing compulsory Irish.  If the teaching of Irish were carried out in a more reasonable way, if excessive demands were not made on the capacity both of teachers and pupils, if an attempt were made to face the actual fact that for the majority of the people of Ireland Irish is no longer their native language, because they have to learn it as they would learn a foreign language, and if our programme towards the restoration of Irish were based on that fact we could get on without discomfort and with less disagreement amongst ourselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to preface anything I am going to say by remarking that I have listened to more commonsense manifested in this debate in the speech of Deputy Tierney than I have heard since I first became a member of the Dáil. The speech of Deputy Tierney was one, I think, which should commend itself to every member of the House, particularly to any Deputies who take even the slightest interest in this important subject of education. I think it is agreed that the establishment of school attendance committees throughout the State has had very useful results and reactions on the youth of the country.  I would like to get some information from the Minister as to when he proposes to establish, or rather re-establish, <Col N="2187" /> the Cork School Attendance Committee. It has certainly outlived its usefulness. It may be said to be in existence, but it can rarely find a quorum, for reasons with which the Minister should be conversant.  I think that the Minister has power under the Act of 1926 to see that when death occurs, or when, for other reasons, a vacancy is created on such committees, vacancies shall be filled by people who are willing to serve.</P>
      <P>There is a very large sum of money set apart in the Estimates for the provision of training colleges.  It is certainly a huge expenditure. Many people in Cork as well as in Dublin feel that while you have to send people, say, from Cork to Galway or Mayo, or from Dublin to Mayo or any other part of the Gaeltacht, the object intended is never realised, because the pupils are practically locked in while they are there and they have no intercourse with the peasantry.  I, and a good many others, fail to see the object of transporting people from one end of the country to the other into such colleges where they have no contact with Gaelic-speaking people.  Does the Minister feel that there is something in the air which would give pupils the blás and make them speak better Irish?  I cannot see how they will profit by residence in the Gaeltacht unless they have contact with Irish-speaking people there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that girls from Cork go to Falcarragh, but they do not get the intercourse which they should get as pupils if they are to secure a proper knowledge of Irish.  It is rumoured that a college will be established in Ballyvourney in Cork County.  I see no necessity for it.  I think that it is useless expenditure, and that in a few years it will become a white elephant on the State.  We have excellent cultural facilities in Cork, as in Dublin, where students have an opportunity of attending the School of Art, the Technical Schools, the School of Music and other cultural institutions of that character.  In Dublin you have a Protestant and a <Col N="2188" /> Catholic Irish college, and we suggest that it would be foolish expenditure on the part of the State to erect a college at Ballyvourney when there are plenty of facilities in the City of Cork.  I would enter a strong protest against expenditure of that kind when you realise that the highest prizes at the disposal of the Minister were obtained by boys from the Presentation College in Cork and the North Monastery.  Those boys got the highest marks in Irish during the year just closed.  On the University side you have another lad from one of the cities with absolutely no contact with the Gaeltacht securing first prize.  Therefore, there seems to be something wrong in this whole scheme of education&mdash;on the Irish side of it at any rate.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect which I should like to touch upon.  Deputy Tierney spoke of the Readers in use in the schools.  He rightly pointed out that there should be a standardisation of these Readers.  He stressed the cultural aspect and the educational value of it, but there is another point which I am sure will appeal to many Deputies, and that is that the fact that we have not standardised Readers is the cause of extra expense and that bears hardly upon the poorer classes.  Those of us who are old enough to remember the old system of education will recollect that there were first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth standards and, as the name implies, the books were standardised.  A pupil going from one school to another could use the same books, and in poor families the books used by the eldest could be passed down to the other members of the family.  Under the present system a boy transferred from one school to another, even in the same area, may have to get a different Reader, and that is the cause of a great deal of expense. Another point is that, from the literary standpoint alone, they are not works that would commend themselves to judges of good literatue. I am convinced that the educational value of the school books of to-day that I have examined is not <Col N="2189" /> at all to be compared with that of the old school books, with, of course, certain qualifications.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I should like the Minister to direct his attention to is the fact that teachers who become ill are deprived of their salary if their illness lasts longer than one month.  Some arrangement should be come to to put teachers in the same category as other civil servants who are paid their full salary for six months while ill, and whose salary does not terminate until after twelve months' illness.  If something were done in that direction it would tend to give the teachers still further interest in their business.  I know that already they have a very favourable record for the interest they take in it, as shown by the enthusiasm with which most of them have entered into the programme laid down by the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which has struck me as a careful student of education, and that is the aspect referred to by Deputies Tierney, Thrift and O'Connell.  We are spending huge sums of money on the teaching of Irish and I am perfectly convinced that we have not got any results approximate to the amount of money spent.  I had occasion during the last couple of weeks to examine a showcard.  The letterpress on it was in Irish and asked the public to buy certain articles of Irish manufacture.  One authority on Irish wrote the matter for the letterpress.  It was submitted to a second authority on Irish who made some corrections.  It then went to a third authority on Irish who made a third set of alterations.  Eventually, it was sent to Cork University and two professors there struck up a form of words which really conveyed what the proprietor of these articles wanted to convey to the public. Surely there is something wrong there.  If we have not standardisation already, we should at least make an endeavour to get it.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which I intended to raise on the Civil Service Estimate and that is with regard to the method of examination or the marks allotted for Irish in relation <Col N="2190" /> to other subjects.  If it would be in order, I should like to mention the matter now.  Recently a case was brought to my notice where a young boy fresh from school entered the post office service.</P>

      <P>Then I shall raise it on the Civil Service Estimate.  I think something should be done to regularise not only the Readers in English, but also those in Irish.  With regard to the established practice now of teaching other subjects through the medium of Irish, we have been in too great a hurry.  In many places it requires a little extra moral courage to say even that much. The worst feature of Irish life today is that if a public man or a man in his private capacity has the audacity to say even one word against the programme of Irish he is immediately labelled anti-Irish, anti-Gaelic, and anti-everything else. That has been the practice for a very long time.  A very noisy minority were able to stifle even the best educationist in the country.  They were in too great a hurry altogether with the Irish programme.  I have the very greatest sympathy for the unfortunate children who to-day are being taught in two languages where, for instance, the town of Kinsale is, and who possibly, if asked where is Ceann-tSáile, could not tell you.  Deputy Fahy thinks that I do not understand any Irish.  Sometimes I can understand a little of his Irish, although it is not Munster Irish.</P>

      <P>I submit to the Minister that in the method of teaching the Irish language there must be some association of ideas, and one cannot get that association of ideas under the present system.  The children in the schools put in a relatively long time in learning Irish.  When I say that I mean learning anything taught through the medium of Irish, because when you are teaching any subject through Irish you are imparting a fuller and better knowledge of that language, although in my view you are not imparting a better knowledge of the subject which is being taught.  Whilst I have the greatest sympathy with the language movement and should not like to do anything to retard it, at the same time I think that the teaching of such subjects as arithmetic, algebra and geometry through the medium of Irish is a great mistake and will retard rather than accelerate the movement towards a Gaelic-speaking Ireland.  Having said that, I hope nobody will misconstrue anything I have said.  I am not ashamed or afraid to say anything that I want to say on this or any other subject, and I hope there will be some casing off on the situation.  This galloping ahead is ruining half the children by trying to teach them in elementary schools certain subjects through the medium of a language which they do not understand and which they never hear when they go home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.T. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to hear from Deputy Anthony that this debate is being conducted in a very reasonable spirit.  If that atmosphere continues, the Minister will have no difficulty in dealing with two or three small points which I wish to put before him.  I wish, first of all, on behalf of quite a considerable number of my constituents, to make the complaint that the Constitution is being broken with full knowledge by the responsible Government of Saorstát Eireann who are depriving the children of two islands off Schull of the right of free education to <Col N="2192" /> which they are entitled under the Constitution.  I refer to the islands known as Calf Island and Castle Island where children are left at present to grow up in a state of absolute ignorance.  I do not say that it would be possible or practicable to have a school on each of these islands because the expense might be out of all proportion, but the point I respectfully put before the Minister is that in a matter of tampering with the Constitution and taking away the constitutional rights of any citizens, the question of expense cannot be looked upon as a stumbling block or as an excuse or defence.  How to deal with these children is, I agree, a matter of some difficulty.  It would be impossible to send them each day to the mainland.  You would have to provide motor boats for them and days might come when it would be impossible for them to attend school. The only practicable solution I can see, and I have consulted those best qualified to speak on the matter, would be that the children should be allowed to be moved to the mainland. They are the children of very humble people, but, if a contribution, even as small as six shillings per week during the school year, is allowed in respect of each child, I am satisfied that with the assistance of food sent from home and their own boats these children would be enabled to be suitably educated at a very small cost to the State.  My appeal is that these children should get the rights which the Constitution says that they ought to get and that they ought not to be forced to bring a Chancery action in Dublin to have their rights declared under the Constitution.  We all know that if they did, at the end of a week or a fortnight of argument before Mr. Justice Meredith, they would get a declaration that they are entitled to these rights at a cost which would be more than sufficient to carry out my suggestion for the next twenty years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am talking about Schull, I want to draw the Minister's attention to another matter. During the war period, the necessity for a female school in the town of Schull was very <Col N="2193" /> badly felt.  There were no grants for that purpose then available.  There was a small community of nuns there.  These good nuns had not themselves the money, but they obtained money from other sources and from other sections of their Order and&mdash;what is a credit to those good nuns, a credit to Schull and a credit to their Order&mdash;they expended £2,500 in the building of a school. There is a large amount of the money which they borrowed still due.  I suggest to the Minister that he should not take advantage of any technicality, but that he should take over that school, have it vested in trustees, put under the direct control of the Department of Education and pay back to those noble-hearted ladies some at least of the money they have expended.  I do not think that is an unreasonable suggestion. I do hope the Minister will look into it and see if something cannot be done to relieve a situation which should never have arisen and which would never have arisen were it not for the period in which that building had to be erected, if the people were to get the education they were by law entitled to.</P>
    <P>There is one other small point that I will refer to briefly, lest I be ruled out of order.  I suggest that the Minister for Education should get at the soft side of the Minister for Finance in connection with the question to which I propose to allude.  We all know that buses and motor conveyances are now provided in some country districts for the conveyance of children to school.  There is no sight more encouraging than that of those children driving comfortably to school on a very wet morning.  On the other hand, I know no more distressing sight than that of little children travelling on foot two or three miles to school on a wet morning.  They face the day's work wet and shivering and they are unable to learn.  In some instances, these motor conveyances have been provided, or largely provided, by the generosity of local people.  I ask the Minister for Education to persuade the Minister for Finance to provide <Col N="2194" /> that no motor conveyances used solely for the purpose of conveying children to or from school shall be subject to any motor duty.  That is a very small matter, but it is one that would affect some of these conveyances. If granted, I am sure it would open the way for similar conveyances and thus provide a much-needed want.  I know the Minister has done a good deal in this respect. I know that the methods of conveyance he has provided for children to and from school have met with universal approval.  They are in accord with the laws of God and the laws of humanity.  I merely put this small point before the Minister now.</P>

      <P>On the Vote for the office of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health I referred to the lack of sanitary arrangements in the national schools. These arrangements are both inadequate and primitive.  I think that one of the first charges on any sums allocated for the reconstruction of schools should be the provision of proper sanitation.  It is a very bad start if children are brought up in an atmosphere of neglect of proper sanitation.  If they are not educated in the ways of modern sanitary appliances I fear they will go through life with a handicap.  Medical inspection of schools is making somewhat slow headway.  It is not through any fault of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health that only in a small number of counties have appointments been made of county medical officers of health. These county medical officers of health are responsible for the medical inspection of school children.  Unfortunately, too many children attend school with infectious and contagious diseases.  There is no provision made in the majority of schools for their inspection and, following inspection, for their segregation and treatment.  I think it is very hard on parents who take care of their children, especially with regard to cleanliness of their heads and scalps, that their children should be infected by those of negligent parents. <Col N="2195" /> I know that there has been some provision made for lectures on hygiene, but these lectures should be on a more elaborate scale.  I will be told, no doubt, that that will come with medical inspection of school children.  I hope it will, but it is coming very slowly.  Lately, I noticed that some children leaving school invested in chewing gum. The great drawback of chewing gum is that the gum is indestructible.  This piece of chewing gum passed around from mouth to mouth amongst a dozen school children.  Each of them had their such out of it.  It struck me that if there was one child with infectious disease in the group how easily the disease would be spread amongst all the others.  Infectious disease has been spread amongst school children in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard a lot to-night about Gaelic as a medium through which to teach other subjects.  While I have been in this House I have been voting for compulsory Gaelic in the national schools.  I believe in the educational value of a second language. There are some languages of greater educational value than others, but I thought the second language which had the greatest chance in the national schools in Ireland was Gaelic.  I think it was advisable to avail of Gaelic as a second language for the purpose of expanding the intellects of the children, because children who learn a second language have certainly an advantage in after life over unilingual children. I know arguments can be used that you could get a better second language than Gaelic.  It is another question when you make Gaelic a medium for teaching other subjects. There could reasonably be no objection to Irish or Gaelic as a compulsory subject if it were taught as any other language is taught in schools. I think the primary idea of the enthusiasts&mdash;I shall not call them fanatics&mdash;in making Gaelic the medium for teaching other subjects is that the child shall be taught Irish from the time he goes into school until he leaves it.  Undoubtedly, the parents of those children resent the <Col N="2196" /> teaching of other subjects&mdash;very important subjects such as mathematics &mdash; through the medium of Irish, but they are cocreed with the bribe that their children cannot get a Civil Service appointment without a knowledge of Gaelic.  In that way, they are reconciled to it.  They could also be reminded of the fact that a lot of these children find their way into the big business houses of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and elsewhere, and that Irish is not the language of those business houses. Accountancy is not conducted in Irish, and children who are taught accountancy or mathematics through the medium of Gaelic are very much handicapped in these houses.  Deputy O'Connell has said&mdash;nobody disputes the wisdom of his statement&mdash;that it is time for an assessment.  If an assessment comes, I hope it will be an impartial assessment.  If there are to be enthusiasts for Gaelic on the assessment board, I would ask the Minister to see that there are also people on it with more sense of proportion and more sense of reality. Some aspersions have been cast on the Irish national teachers&mdash;I think very undeservedly.  I think the national teachers are a very fine body of Irishmen.  This country owes them a very great debt.  If the Irish people are to be a success in their own country&mdash;or out of it for that matter&mdash;it will be due to the efficiency of the Irish national teachers.</P>
    <P>It is not given to many people to have the opportunity of obtaining a university education.  I should like to see every teacher in Ireland, in due course, having a university degree&mdash;not only a degree or diploma in education, but also one of the other university degrees.  I think it would be a very good investment for the country.  The only way you can bring university education to the homes of the poor people is by utilising teachers who are graduates of the universities.  If that were done, you might have to improve the salaries of teachers, but I believe it would be money well expended.  I think that the national teachers, owing to their knowledge of school <Col N="2197" /> children, should be associated more closely with the formulation of programmes. They understand a child and the capacity of a child better than the people who draw up those programmes.  One great fault, I think, at present is that the programme is overcrowded.  When I was a boy&mdash;I was not a very distinguished boy&mdash;I had the advantage of being taught a subject thoroughly before proceeding to another.  For instance, I knew addition before I went to subtraction, and subtraction before I went to multiplication, and so on through the whole gamut. Nowadays there is quite a different system in operation.  A child who does not know addition or subtraction will ask you a question about decimals.  I think that is the wrong way.  But there is overcrowding, and I really think that if the national teachers had more to say to the formulation of programmes there would be a more commonsense system of education, and in the long run the children would have a more solid basis for the different pursuits in life to which they will be called.</P>
    <P>With regard to the county council scholarships that are available for children in national schools, I do not say that they are inadequate in number, but the amount of the scholarship is inadequate for any boy or girl.  No boy or girl can avail of the university education to which these scholarships are supposed to lead except their parents have means to supplement the amount provided by the scholarship.  I would certainly prefer to see the amount doubled, even if the number were to be reduced to half.  I think it would lead to better results, because if this expenditure of public money is at all justifiable, it is for the purpose of tapping a higher order of intellect. I do not know if they have succeeded in all cases in tapping that higher order of intellect.  I do not know whether or not the Minister is in a position to tell me, but I would like to know how these boys get on afterwards when they go to the university. Do they get honours through all their examinations, do they get honours at all, or are there instances <Col N="2198" /> where they failed to pass?  I think that is the real test of the success of the county scholarships scheme.  I am rather pleased with the whole trend of the debate, because it shows that we have come to realise the reality of the situation of education in Ireland, and I think the sooner we face it the better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mathews</NameTxt>
      <P>I receive a good many complaints as to the deficiency of primary education.  I never heard that deficiency, if it exists, attributed to the teachers, either from lack of hard work or of enthusiasm. Most of the criticisms I heard as regards primary education were on the grounds of trying to convey instructions through Irish to pupils who were not conversant with the language, and I myself quite realise it. When I was at school I could read a French book so as to get its meaning, and if I was allowed plenty of time and the use of a dictionary I might have been able to express my meaning in French that might not be very correct, but I know that if an attempt had been made to convey instruction in any other subject through the medium of the French language I would have had a very poor knowledge of that subject.  If you try to convey knowledge of any subject through a language with which the pupil is not really conversant, what occurs is this: he is asked a question, and the first thing he has to do is to translate it into the language that he knows best, then think of the answer, translate it back and reply in the language in which the question was asked.  If education is carried on under that system there is every reason why there should be a good deal of cause for the complaints that we hear every day about primary education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell has dealt so extensively with questions affecting pupils and questions affecting teachers, and has also dealt so extensively with the education policy generally, that I do not propose to traverse much of the ground which he has covered.  But there is one matter which I think has not been touched upon in this debate <Col N="2199" /> and to which I desire to direct the attention of the Minister, and that is the matter of the provision of playing fields in connection with national schools.  I am one of those people who believe that up to the present the Department, while I give it a good deal of credit for paying a considerable amount of attention to mental education, have not given sufficient attention to the question of physical education amongst school children.  I believe that no matter how good our educational programme may be, no matter how perfect our educational system may be, if the children attending the national schools are not physically fit they cannot benefit from the education that is given them in the manner in which the Department desire, because I believe that a fit body is conducive to a clear brain, just as an unfit body is conducive to a muddled brain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hennessy has referred to the county medical officers of health in regard to the medical inspection of school children.  I believe that it is very desirable to have this medical inspection of school children, but I also believe that if more attention were paid to the question of physical culture and organised games in the schools there would not be the same necessity for the medical inspection of the children.  I understand that some time ago a deputation from the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, together with a deputation from the Gaelic Athletic Association, waited upon the Department.  I understand that while the Department thought it desirable that playing fields should be provided as far as possible in connection with national schools, they pointed out that there were very many difficulties. I admit that as far as the cities and some urban areas are concerned there might be considerable difficulty in acquiring playing fields, but with regard to the children attending national schools generally I think that sufficient attention has not been paid to this matter.  Take the universities. I think that Deputy Thrift or <Col N="2200" /> Deputy Alton or Deputy Tierney will agree with me that as far as the universities and the colleges are concerned a considerable amount of importance is placed on this question of playing fields, because those in charge of the universities and the colleges realise that it is necessary that attention should be paid to organised games.  I believe that if the Department would pay more attention to this question of acquiring playing fields for the children much better results would accrue, and while it may be said that considerable expenditure would have to be incurred, I do not think that that expenditure would be altogether wasted, because I believe that money would be saved in connection with the medical inspection of the school children and in regard to their health generally.  I bring this matter forward in the hope that the Minister will give us some assurance that an endeavour will be made to acquire playing fields as far as possible.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which I wish to touch upon, in view of what has been said to-day by a number of those who took part in the debate, and that is in connection with the teaching of subjects through the medium of Irish.  I believe that the casual observer or reader of this debate would come to the conclusion from it that very few teachers are capable of teaching other subjects through the medium of Irish.  Such a conclusion would be, in my opinion, altogether erroneous.  There are a large number of teachers quite capable of teaching other subjects than Irish through the medium of the Irish language.  In that respect I would direct the Minister's attention to a recommendation which, I think, was made by the Gaeltacht Commission with regard to teachers in the Gaeltacht area.  There is a large number of teachers there capable of teaching all subjects through the medium of Irish.  One of the recommendations was that those teachers should get some additional remuneration, either by the restoration of the ten per cent. that was deducted from the teachers generally <Col N="2201" /> or by means of some bonus.  But I think that the Department should hold out some inducement to teachers who are teaching in the Gaeltacht subjects through the medium of Irish to encourage them to remain in the Gaeltacht area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>One gratifying feature in connection with this debate is the increased interest that is taken in educational matters by this House. I am long enough a member of it to remember when the subject of education was introduced, either through the Estimates or in connection with some of the many Bills we have had, that the number of Deputies taking part in the discussions was very small indeed.  I am glad to notice the increase that has taken place in the interest in educational matters.  It makes me hopeful in regard to the future, because I am one of those who hold that education lies at the bottom of all our industrial and other activities, and I am quite satisfied that this debate will be helpful to the Minister and to his Department in shaping the future educational policy of the country.  I think that the criticisms that have been offered will also be helpful to the Minister in dealing with the important question that has been referred to by almost every speaker&mdash;that is, the policy of teaching English through the medium of Irish.  I have criticised that policy on a great many occasions, and the more I see of it the more I am convinced that the shortcomings which many of us find in our primary education to-day are largely due to the mistaken policy of trying to teach English subjects through the medium of Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very glad to hear the Minister's statement with reference to the great improvement that has taken place in the work of our technical schools.  I was particularly glad to hear from him that there has not merely been an increase in the number of students, but that that increase has been most marked in the subjects connected with purely technical education, an advance which the Minister very truly said <Col N="2202" /> is of great importance.  He said it was specially noticeable in the case of what he might call technology. There was, he said, if you take science pure and applied, and handicraft, an increase of 65 per cent. since 1924.  That was one of the most satisfactory statements which I heard from the Minister since he took charge of the Department, and I only hope that that good work and that good progress will be continued.</P>
    <P>We still hear from technical education committees and from those engaged in the work of technical education complaints of the low standard of the primary education of the pupils entering the technical schools. I am satisfied that that in our city is, to some extent, if not to a considerable extent, due to the overcrowding that exists in most of the city schools.  The attention of the Minister has been drawn to this matter here over and over again and I would like to hear from him what steps, if any, have been taken by the Department to deal with this question of overcrowding during the past twelve months.  One would like to know what extensions have taken place, and what extensions are in contemplation, because if we allow this matter of overcrowding to continue it is obvious that the standard of primary education will continue to fall.  All of us will agree that good work cannot be done in primary schools where overcrowding exists.  I would like to hear from the Minister if definite steps have been taken to deal with this important matter.  There is another question arising out of overcrowding and it is one to which the Minister's attention has been drawn.  In order to get the young people educated, families have in some cases to attend three or four different schools. Only one child can be taken in here, another in there and so on in the different schools.  I know one family where the children have to attend four different schools in the city in order to get educated.  One of the unfortunate effects is that when it comes to the holiday period all the schools have different closing <Col N="2203" /> times.  In some cases you have two members of a family on holidays and the other two attending schools. That is very unfortunate for the poor people and for the schools, because if some members of a family are on holidays, I am quite sure the holiday influence is extended to the others who are at school.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told me already that the question of uniformity of holidays is not one for his Department but for school managers.  I cannot agree with that.  Under normal circumstances it might be one for the school managers, but owing to the special circumstances brought about by overcrowding and the fact that families are distributed over a number of schools it is a matter that calls for special attention from the Minister and I hope some attempt will be made to bring about uniformity.</P>
    <P>The only other matter to which I would like to draw attention is that of scholarships.  I am not satisfied, particularly from figures obtained in reply to a question some little time ago, with the results of these scholarships. I would like more attention devoted to them.  In many cases the competition for them is exceedingly small.  Scholarships have not been awarded in many cases because there were not sufficient competitors and in other cases because the answering was of such a low standard only a moiety of the scholarships was awarded.  The whole matter is one that calls for immediate inquiry.  I would like to have from the Minister some information as to what he proposes doing.  I am not at all satisfied that the question of increasing the value of the scholarship is really the trouble.  I think there are other causes.  Something should be done to keep the scholarships constantly before the minds of the students and some effort should be made to induce more to enter for them.  I would like the scholarships inquired into from another point of view.  I think most of them go to those engaged in what I might term the commercial side of education rather than to encourage <Col N="2204" /> pupils to enter the industrial side. That is a matter upon which the Minister might be able to give us more information than we have had at our disposal.  I would like to see an increasing number of scholarships devoted to encouraging larger numbers to enter the industrial sphere.</P>

      <P>I have listened to this debate most attentively from the beginning and I do not think I have ever been more interested in a discussion on educational matters since I had the honour of being elected a member of the Dáil some seven years ago.  It has certainly been the most peaceful discussion on the subject that I have ever known to take place here.  We have had the benefit of listening to experts from every side on the subject of education.  From every Party we have heard men speak who are well qualified from their knowledge and experience to give us their opinions of the advance that education is making in the country.  The Minister is to be congratulated on the increasing success of the Compulsory School Attendance Act.  We hope that it will continue to increase in usefulness as time goes on.  I think there are some classes in the community that are escaping this Act, and I will bring one class under the Minister's notice.  I refer to the children of people who go about in vans.  In my county and, I conclude, in other counties, during the summer and autumn, large numbers of people travel in vans.  I took the trouble to count the number of people one day.  There were three vans in camp quite close to me and the total number of persons was thirty-two.  Do children in those circumstances get any education?</P>
      <P>[<i>An Ceann Comhairle resumed the Chair.</i>]</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Their parents move about from place to place.  They have no fixed residence, and whether the children ever learn anything or come within the reach of education at all is very problematical.  There is another class of people somewhat similarly affected, though I do not know that <Col N="2205" /> their case is so urgent now.  I refer to people in canal boats.  There are not as many of them now as there were; there may be a few left still. Large numbers of children who live in vans escape the influence of education altogether.  A great deal of good work was done, and it is still being done, I think, by committees of ladies appointed years ago to look after boarded-out children.  It has often occurred to me that it might have a good and a humanising effect, particularly in lonely districts, if ladies of the proper creed, the creed belonging to the majority of the children attending the schools, were invited to visit the schools occasionally and take an interest in the educational work.  I do not wish to interfere in any way, but I think that would have a humanising effect. It is a matter worthy of consideration, because I think the more interest shown by our citizens in the schools the better it would be.  There are very few people who will take trouble on these subjects.  If suitable people could be invited to give their assistance in this matter it would be extremely helpful.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Fahy&mdash;and I have heard it also mentioned by other people&mdash;that in some cases there seem to be too many subjects taught, with the result that there is not the efficiency one would look for from the teaching that is given.  I have not the opportunity of observing matters that Deputy Fahy has, and I take it what he says is correct. Deputy Mrs. Collins-O'Driscoll made a remark that I heard a good many other ladies utter.  She referred to neglect in the matter of the teaching of sewing in girls' schools.  That is a most important matter.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation, I am inclined to think that the Deputy misunderstood me. I mentioned that needlework was not, under the present programme, taught to the very junior children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. G. Wolfe Mr. G. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise.  Then it would appear that in the junior classes needlework is not taught.  I agree with Deputy Mrs. Collins-O'Driscoll <Col N="2206" /> that needlework ought to be taught in the girls' schools from the commencement.  I do not think I could agree with Deputy O'Connell when he says there was differentiation made in some schools and children were kept out for one reason or another.  I think it is a good thing to have children of more or less equal ability in the same school.  It is not everybody who possesses the art of teaching, and we all know that the very cleverest people are not always the best teachers.  If you put very clever boys and very stupid boys together, the result is not so good for the boys who are not so clever; they fall behind.  If they were under other teachers they might possibly become extremely able and accomplished.  It is necessary to have a class confined to pupils of equal ability and not have very clever pupils and pupils of less ability put together.  There ought to be more grading of schools where that is possible.</P>

    <P>In point of fact in a technical school that I knew the principal was one of the most brilliant men that this particular school ever had, yet he turned out his pupils less satisfactorily than many men with less ability could have done.  It was afterwards proved to be the case when he was followed by others who were apparently not quite so clever and yet who achieved better results. I am entirely in favour of the teaching of Irish and always have been.  I am in favour of bi-lingualism because I think it is of great commercial value to be able to speak two languages from your early youth.  If you are able to speak two languages to start with you have no difficulty in acquiring a number of others.  I have always held that the teaching, particularly of subjects like arithmetic through Irish is not wise; I do not think the result has been good.  For one thing I think there are not enough teachers to be got who can go around the country and give efficient teaching.  Even if there were I wonder how many of the pupils in the country districts can take in the instruction that is given? I know of one school in my neighbourhood <Col N="2207" /> where there is a most efficient Irish teacher, but I hear pupils complain very much about having to listen to instruction in Irish which they cannot take fully in.  I think that is a matter which ought to be considered.  There has been general agreement that the matter has been too much pushed. We are all desirous that Irish shall become the language of the country and shall be spoken but what we want to get is the best way to make it a national language to be spoken by everybody.  I think the continuation classes that are promised by the Minister will have a very good effect because the want of sufficient education has prevented a very large number of people from joining the technical classes.  They are unwilling to display their want of education.  I remember years ago when I was connected with a technical school helping to form some of those classes by going out and asking people to join them.  That is not a satisfactory state of affairs at all.</P>
    <P>I think with these continuation classes that the necessity will not arise of having to go out in the highways and the hedges and compel people to go, but that of their own free will they will see that it is to their advantage to go in and learn the ins and outs of the particular trade they mean to make their livelihood by.  The Minister is bringing forward his Vocational Bill and I will deal a little further with the matter in Committee.  He has been congratulated upon the improvement that seems to be taking place in the general education of the country, and I think we may look in the not far distant future for further advances and higher results than we have yet attained.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to spoil by iteration the wise criticisms and helpful suggestions that have been made to the Minister with regard to education, general and particular.  I find myself in sympathy with most of what has been uttered to-day in this debate, <Col N="2208" /> and particularly I welcome the suggestion that emaunated from Deputy Fahy that fostering rather than enforcing ought to be the watchword with regard to the teaching of Irish. I think that will have quicker and sounder results and be less detrimental to education in general than the present method, which, I fear and deplore, does not bring the results that the originators hoped for. I rose primarily to reinforce the remarks which Deputy Fahy made regarding the National Museum.  I think last year I drew a rather mournful picture of the state of the Museum, as it presented itself to me, with regard to its staff and with regard to its accommodation.  I would like to ask the Minister what steps have been taken to improve matters.  Are they any better than they were last year?  The Minister gave us some assurances last year that he had not forgotten, and that he was doing a lot, but I do not see any signs of the Museum getting better accommodation.  Is there any prospect in the near future that they will have a place to display whole collections that are at present in cold storage, particularly the collection of the Geological Survey?</P>
      <P>I would be glad to know what the Minister is doing with regard to the staff, whether he has decided how the Museum is to be run, what assistance will be got and whether those figures on the paper represent merely paper officials and are not real, are not standing for real active, live officers of the Museum.  If we let this matter alone too long I am afraid the Museum will suffer. Other museums in these islands are pushing ahead.  I know that in the Six Counties they have taken wonderful strides.  I would be sorry to see this museum, which is such a pride to us, resting on its oars or going back.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>One word of explanation. In speaking on this Vote I said that the teaching of other subjects through Irish by teachers with a slight knowledge of Irish should not be encouraged and I said the teaching was bad for Irish and bad <Col N="2209" /> for education.  I said the same thing in Irish two years ago here and no notice was taken of it.  I must say that a whole thesis has been built upon my remark and that the foundation is not strong enough and will not stand the thesis that has been built upon it.  I want to make it clear that I am in favour of the teaching of subjects through Irish by teachers who are competent to do so in all schools throughout Ireland. I wish Deputies would go into the schools and see how very little Irish is being taught there.  Students can be taught Irish and have been taught Irish and I have been in schools and have seen them get taught.  While being in favour of the fostering of the language I recognise that there are many schools, primary and secondary, in which no Irish would be taught unless it was compulsory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel Deputy Fahy must have felt that he started something more than he expected from one remark of his. With regard to the last remark made by Deputy Fahy I do not think there is much change&mdash;I have not recent figures here&mdash;in the actual amount of teaching through Irish in the last three years.  May I quote the figures in this Report in the middle of the year 1926&mdash;I am speaking now of the matter of which complaints are being made and that is teaching through Irish and Irish only&mdash;there is a certain amount done in which there is a little Irish used.  I am leaving that out, because the only thing coming into play is the teaching through Irish only.  It might have prevented a certain amount of over-statement of the position if these statistics had been looked into in the Report.  I am leaving out infants, because there is a general consensus of opinion that if the teacher can teach Irish it can be done there.  That was the recommendation of the National Programme Committee.  Only 4,000 were taught through the medium of Irish in the first standard, in the second standard 2,700, in the third standard 1,500, in the fourth standard 1,000, in the fifth standard 600, <Col N="2210" /> in the sixth standard, roughly, 350&mdash; I am giving round figures&mdash;in the seventh standard 162, and in the eighth standard 69.  May I suggest that valuable as the discussion was, and I am not at all inclined to question its value, it is an exaggeration to suggest that any lack of improvement or any failure to advance as quickly as we ought to advance is due in the Saorstát, as a whole, in the bulk of the schools, to an attempt to teach through Irish?  It is one of the most important questions raised here.  I admit it is a very important question, and I will straightaway agree with a principle&mdash; not merely is it the theoretical thing to which one might give assent, but it is a thing which it is my duty to see is acted on in practice&mdash;that it is bad educationally and for the language that teachers who do not know Irish should be asked to teach subjects through Irish to pupils who do not know Irish sufficiently to follow.  That, in fact, where there is teaching through Irish, and where we would encourage teaching through the medium of Irish, the two conditions ought to be present, the capacity of the teacher on the one hand, and the capacity of the pupils on the other hand.  If there has been, as many here seem to think there has been, in the actual carrying out of the programme by the Department, any tendency to go away from that principle, I will certainly inquire carefully into it.  I will undertake to have an inquiry made to see how that can be done, and so far as in me lies apply effective checks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that it is wise that that should be done.  I think that there is general agreement on that so far as the House is concerned.  On the other hand, I am not willing to accept the principle that outside the Gaeltacht there should be no teaching through the medium of Irish.  I think that that proposition was advanced here.  If the language is to become a language in the sense of being a real second language, a language in which people not merely read but think&mdash;many pupils in <Col N="2211" /> all countries read foreign languages but cannot think in them&mdash;then the language must be something that is being studied for purposes other than school purposes.  Therefore there should be a reasonable advance in this matter but, I quite admit, only a reasonable advance.  As to whether some extended inquiry in that respect is necessary, I will have careful investigation made.</P>
    <P>There may have been a certain amount of confusion caused in the past twelve months owing to certain circulars that were sent out.  They were open to different interpretations. It was, for instance, laid down that the teacher was, amongst other things, expected to carry out where possible the requirements of the National Programme.  That contained a clause about teaching through the medium of Irish.  It seemed a reasonable interpretation of that programme that where there was a young teacher, who had certain abilities and who had made no effort to qualify himself by getting a bilingual certificate, it would be fair that he should be penalised for not doing so and that if he made that excuse for not teaching Irish it could be brought against him in the report. I realised that even then there was a danger of pressing unduly, I have decided that all ambiguities shall be cleared up and we will deal with that teacher not by compelling him to teach Irish, but in another manner. I do not think that there should be any force used to secure teaching through Irish where the conditions insisted on here are not fulfilled.</P>
    <P>There is rather a consensus of opinion, and if Deputies are under the impression owing to certain complaints that have reached them that we are going too far I will have that matter carefully and fully inquired into.  It is my firm conviction, as I have said, that undue haste, where neither the teachers nor the pupils are capable, will do harm to the language itself apart from the educational damage done.  Another matter that was raised was the question of scholarships.  Deputy Good, Deputy Byrne and others raised it, and I <Col N="2212" /> think that Dr. Hennessy gave, at least, what was a partial explanation and that was the value of the scholarship. I have seen articles recently dealing with the subject and they proceeded on the assumption that the cream of national schools went in for those scholarships and on that assumption there was a very telling criticism made.  Inaccuracies were, indeed, made in dealing with the actual papers set.  It was alleged that the answering of a certain number of questions would secure a pass. That conclusion was arrived at by cutting each question in half, an inaccuracy which I was surprised to see in an article dealing with an educational matter.</P>
    <P>I am rather doubtful about the premises on which the whole argument is founded.  I am not denying that there is a case for investigation. &mdash;I think there is&mdash;but the sweeping conclusion reached by various people from these statistics do not seem to me to be justified.  I ask Deputies to consider, in the case of the parents of a good many pupils at primary schools reaching the age of fourteen, what inducement is there even supposing the value of the scholarship was brought before the parents?  Is the value of a scholarship itself sufficient to induce them to allow pupils to go on?  I suggest that it is not in a good many cases.  It would not tempt a good many brilliant young pupils.  We have other tests besides these scholarships.  We have, for instance, the entrance to the preparatory colleges.  There we have keen competition and there we get a type of pupil that certainly cannot have been neglected in the national school if the pupils are to accomplish anything like that which they have accomplished when they come to the Intermediate certificate examination. I mention that as a set-off to the sweeping conclusions drawn from the scholarship statistics.</P>
    <P>I am dealing now with pupils, the great bulk of whom were drawn from national schools, who then went on to secondary schools, known as preparatory colleges, and presented themselves.  These colleges <Col N="2213" /> differ from most secondary schools inasmuch as they present practically all their pupils for examination.  So far as the preparatory colleges are concerned, the total percentage of passes was, in the case of boys, 100 per cent., and in the case of other schools, not preparatory colleges, 75 per cent.  In the case of girls 93 per cent., and for schools not preparatory colleges 69 per cent.  The percentage of those who obtained honours was: preparatory colleges, boys, 83.9 per cent., and for schools other than preparatory colleges 30 per cent.  In the case of girls the corresponding figures were 22 per cent. and 19 per cent.  It is not merely in Irish that this has been done.  In case Deputies might go away with the idea that the reason they scored so well was because they scored in Irish they should turn up&mdash;and I ask them to do so&mdash;the actual returns for the leaving certificate examination and they will see that the scoring was in all subjects. Take, for instance, history.  The figure there was for boys 62 per cent. and in the case of preparatory colleges 99.4 per cent.  The corresponding figures for girls were 61.5 per cent., and preparatory colleges 88.7 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the case of mathematics, a subject which we discussed here on more than one occasion, the figures for all schools were 76.8 per cent., and for preparatory colleges 95.2 per cent.  In the case of girls the corresponding figures 49.8 per cent. and preparatory colleges 94.8 per cent. That seems to a certain extent to knock on the head the theory which I have often heard advanced, namely, that girls are not capable of doing mathematics.  Deputies will remember that these things are done through the medium of Irish, and the bulk of the pupils do not come from the Gaeltacht.  I am really using that as a kind of corrective to the lugubrious views put forward as to the results produced by the national schools, based on the assumption that the cream of the national school students went in for the county council scholarships.  I do not think that that is so.  I think that <Col N="2214" /> economic reasons prevent them from doing so.  On the other hand, there is a case, I admit, for inquiry as to why most pupils do not present themselves for examination for county council scholarships.</P>
    <P>Deputy Good made a suggestion, to which I may have effect given, that the matter should be brought before all the pupils, who should be told that these scholarships are available. Deputy O'Connell raised the point as to whether the preparatory colleges are not being forced too much.  Yes, if their education began at the time that pupils entered such colleges, but my whole argument is that their education did not begin there.  As the Deputy knows, between the ages of twelve and fourteen in preparatory colleges and national schools, more or less, the same programme is covered.  We are trying for coordination there.  I want to say that the education cannot be altogether so hopeless in the national schools at the age of fourteen when such results are achieved.  When it comes to Civil Service examinations that are open to national schools, and also to secondary schools, a fair percentage of national school pupils are successful.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell raised the question of the health of the pupils.  In fact, one of the most successful preparatory colleges is also successful in hurling.  It is not suggested that mentally or physically the pupils are decrepit despite their hard studies.  I have not heard that students there are worked more than those in secondary schools.  I have heard complaints, the value of which is very difficult to test, namely, that in all secondary schools too much is required from pupils. That is a complaint which I have heard in other countries as well as in this.  It is a difficult matter to investigate.  I tried to do so, but, especially in the case of day schools, it is extremely difficult to determine what amount of home work a boy does when home from school. Whether he is doing two hours' work or four hours' work it is not easy to say.  The same applies even in the case of students in the study <Col N="2215" /> hall at residential schools.  Another point raised was the question of school accommodation.  During the financial year 1928-9 grants were made to the extent of £61,000 for the erection of 33 new schools, which afforded accommodation for 3,400 pupils.  Grants amounting to £26,000 were sanctioned for the enlargement of 27 schools to provide additional accommodation for 1,250 pupils. Grants amounting to £13,000 were allotted for works of structural importance, and so on, in the case of 164 schools.  During the financial year 1929-30 grants were made to the extent of £41,000 for the erection of eighteen new schools to afford accommodation for 23,000 children, and grants amounting to £24,000 for the enlargement of 28 schools to provide additional accommodation for 1,400 pupils, and general improvement grants were sanctioned to the extent of £27,000.</P>
    <P>Deputy Good was anxious to have some information&mdash;I am sorry I had not more notice of it&mdash;about the accommodation provided in Dublin. I cannot give him particulars for the present year, though some of the actual work I shall now mention is going on at present.  There was completed about 18 months ago accommodation for 2,200 pupils at the Marino; there has also recently been provided near James's Street accommodation for 600 pupils in the Keogh Barracks district; a school at Iona Road for 500 pupils; a school at Killester for 600 pupils; a grant has recently been made for a school at Fairbrother's Field, which is being built for 400 pupils, and a school for girls at Upper Drumcondra for 600 pupils.  For the last two or three years we have, therefore, accommodation provided or to be provided for about 5,000 extra pupils.  As to the primary certificate examination, some extraordinary deductions were made.  Deputy Fahy conveyed the impression, and Deputy Byrne backed him up&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Two per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, two per cent.  After all, if there are 500,000 pupils in National Schools <Col N="2216" /> and only 10,000 present themselves, therefore only two per cent. go in for the primary certificate. That seems simple arithmetic. The only difficulty is that it is too simple, like all statistics.  Of course, if there are only 10,000, that can only be taken in conjunction with the number of pupils in the sixth standard, or of the age of 14, which is an entirely different proposition. But remember this is only the first year, and I suggest that before there are violent diatribes on the system from one side or the other&mdash;because I think there were attacks from another quarter during the usual Easter spate of oratory on educational matters&mdash;we should just give it a chance and see what is in it.</P>
      <P>Complaints were made about the Irish and mathematic papers in the secondary schools.  I went in for a secondary school examination in the beginning of the 'nineties, and I never remember a year in which complaints were not made about papers of one kind or another, nearly always mathematics, and also, naturally, in the case of Irish.  It is a weapon open to anyone to use.  I find it very difficult to get Irish experts or teachers to agree, and, possibly, the same would apply even to art experts, or tenors, or sopranos, or anybody of that kind.  It is an extremely difficult matter.  An &ldquo;A&rdquo; school is not bound to present any particular percentage of its pupils, but in fact &ldquo;A&rdquo; schools, as a rule, present a higher percentage for the examination than other schools.  Of course, it is not the numbers presented for the examination that decide whether they become an &ldquo;A&rdquo; school or not.  It is a question of whether they will teach through Irish.  I cannot take the boys, as you cannot get an average, there being only one school, but if you take the girls' schools, where there are a number of &ldquo;A&rdquo; schools, you will find that there the results, on the whole, are slightly higher for the average schools over the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fahy and Deputy Thrift referred to the question of the grievances that certain secondary teachers have as to pensions regulations. <Col N="2217" /> I indicated when introducing this scheme, or certainly afterwards to Deputies who came to me that great trouble had been taken to secure that no reasonable case of a demand for a pension would be left out.  Certainly as cases presented themselves in the actual framing of the scheme provision was made to meet every case we could think of.  But it is inevitable that there should be cases we could not think of.  Since then a number of cases have come to my notice that did, on the merits, seem to be hard cases, but Deputies will realise that when two or three cases of this kind come to my notice I cannot immediately propose a new scheme. Therefore, if there are hard cases I think Deputies might take Deputy Thrift's suggestion and bring them before me.  I shall only promise to deal with them in so far as they are really hard cases of people whose main business is secondary teaching, not people who are really not secondary teachers.  In any reform which may be contemplated, it must be made clear that we cannot allow in people whose main business is not secondary teaching.</P>
    <P>As regards the other subjects raised, Deputy Thrift and Deputy Fahy mentioned the question of increments of salary and the connection of that with the quotas in the schools.  We have given on the whole a liberal quota to the schools.  The question is: is that a correct quota? To us it seems a generous quota, and if that be so, it is, as things stand, inevitable that a certain number of teachers who are in certain schools beyond the quota should unfortunately be deprived of their increments. The suggestion was put forward that we might have a national rather than a school scheme.  I considered these various questions at one time or another, and up to the present I have not come to any satisfactory solution of the difficulty. I do not say that my efforts will stop; they will not; but I confess that I have not yet reached any satisfactory solution.  Deputy Thrift drew attention to the fact that the number in the course of the last <Col N="2218" /> four or five years had diminished from about 120 to something in the nature of 60 or 70&mdash;at any rate diminished 50 per cent.  He regards that as an argument that the question is easy to deal with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure, because in order to bring in these you may have to open a very wide door indeed, so far as the quota in the schools is concerned and the employment in the schools of teachers for whom we cannot pay.  That is my difficulty.  We could not, for instance, give a school carte blanche, however desirable it might be, to employ as many teachers as it liked and to pay them all.  What I fear is that in the effort to deal even with this small number that remains we may have to open the door much too wide in that respect.  However, I shall have the matter examined again and see whether something cannot be done.  It is a surprisingly intricate question and, having given a great deal of consideration to it, I am not altogether too hopeful.</P>
      <P>The usual questions have been raised with regard to the heating and cleaning of the schools which, as I have on more than one occasion pointed out, is essentially a local matter.  It is so in every country, but in the case of a country where 97 per cent. of the cost of primary education is borne by the central Government a greater effort might be made locally.  I am rather in the habit of emphasising that we are absolutely exceptional in that respect.</P>
      <P>As to Deputy Goulding's suggestion of sending pictures from the National Gallery to other cities, I presume he meant for occasional exhibitions as temporary loans.  I shall bring that matter before the Trustees. It is not a matter I can deal with, as I am not the custodian of the pictures, but I shall recommend it for their serious consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Byrne asked a question as to whether it is my intention to change the age for entrance to the preparatory colleges.  It has been reduced from 16 to 15½ already, and <Col N="2219" /> it may in future be brought down somewhat lower&mdash;that is the upper age&mdash;but not without due notice being given to the parents.  Notice of any change of that kind should be given well ahead.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Fahy asked a question about the Appeal Board. I appoint the inspector, so the danger that the Deputy fears is not likely to occur.  Professor Whelehan has kindly consented to act as chairman of the Board.  I think at the moment the national teachers are represented by Mr. Quinn.  A delay of the kind mentioned by Deputy Fahy is sometimes inevitable, especially when we change over to a new system.  As a rule, we try to have an appeal hurried up as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy G. Wolfe, having stated that the programme was overloaded, did what every other well-meaning person in the State does, immediately asked for a new subject, that is, needlework.  I admit there is a great deal to be said for needlework.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. G. Wolfe Mr. G. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Wolfe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is there already, well it is there.  I understood from him that it was not there, and therefore that it was being asked for.  I can assure the Deputy that it is not at all an unusual thing. Deputy Dr. Hennessy also complained of the number of subjects, and I think he wanted one of his own added; everybody wants one of his own added.  Some people have put forward a plea, and there may be a good deal in it, that if girls could do less at mathematics and more at domestic economy and needlework it might be better for the country as a whole.  On the other hand, we have the cry that there are not sufficient girls doing mathematics. The question of needlework and domestic economy for girls is a very important one.  I regret to say both subjects are being crowded out. That has not been mentioned in the debate.  Both of them are being crowded out to an extent I do not like.  I think a great deal could be <Col N="2220" /> achieved if we had more domestic economy being taught in the schools, and more needlework likewise.</P>
      <P>The question of co-ordinating the University standard with the leaving certificate was raised, firstly, by Deputy Fahy, and then by Deputy Tierney.  If it is the will of the University representatives, we might pass an Act to provide that nobody should be permitted to enter a University who had not passed the leaving certificate examination.  I wonder whether or not that would meet with the approval of the University representatives.  There are two ways of co-ordinating.  You can go up or down, and I am not sure which way I was asked to coordinate here this evening.  It is not often we have complaints made about our tests being too strict. Suggestions have been made that certain examinations that we conduct are not sufficiently testing, but here we have the complaint made that one of our examinations is altogether too difficult, from the university point of view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>

      <P>I prefer to put it this way&mdash;that they are losing a year at the secondary school&mdash; that they do not stay on at the secondary school and go in a year later to the university.  Universities are bodies that are very chary about their independence.  I am glad that there has been an expression of opinion here that they should tone up their matriculation standard and see that they get in a more efficient type of student.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the Cork School Attendance Committee, that Committee <Col N="2221" /> may not be functioning in the strict sense of the word, but the matter had not been brought to my notice before.  As was seen from the figures I quoted last day, there is nothing to complain about as regards school attendance in the city of Cork.  As regards the point raised by Deputy Jasper Wolfe regarding the children of the Calf and Castle Island, if he brings the case before me I will see to what extent a grant can be made for bringing those children to the mainland.  I say that, while not at all accepting the interpretation of the Constitution which the Deputy gave.  That we are, by the Constitution, bound to provide schools for the convenience of everybody I doubt very much.  If the Deputy's interpretation were correct we would be bound to provide a schools for every isolated family living six miles from a national school.</P>
    <P>The question of conveyance for school children has been brought, on several occasions, to my notice.  It has been suggested that conveyances used for this purpose should be relieved of the tax of £70 which lorries have to bear.  That would not be a satisfactory way of attacking the problem.  These lorries do other work than conveying children to school.  It would be much better to face the problem&mdash;as we are trying to face it&mdash;in conjunction with local people interested and see how the £60 or £70 can be made up. To remit a tax of that kind would lead to all sorts of abuses and difficulties.</P>
    <P>The question of the charge of text-books was raised.  The difficulty is this: there is a pupil in a class in the year 1929, let us say.  That pupil has a certain text-book.  As very often happens, he is not promoted.  Is that pupil to have the same text-book next year in the same class? Is it not much better, in that case at all events, that there should be a change of text-book?  That is the reason for any steps we take.  That is the extent of our interference. There is great liberty allowed to schools in the choice of text-books. We cannot interfere unduly with <Col N="2222" /> that liberty.  We could not, even in the schools of one city, prescribe a uniform series of text-books.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell raised a question which was referred to in a very different way by Deputy Good. That is the question of the reception of pupils into national schools in the City of Dublin.  Deputy O'Connell's complaint was that pupils go to certain national schools and are told &ldquo;no accommodation here.&rdquo;  He complains that there is a selection actually made, and that, for instance, only brilliant pupils are taken into certain schools.  It is extremely difficult to test whether that charge is true or not.  In so far as it is true, how far can you interfere with the right of the parent of a brilliant pupil to send his or her child to the school which they think best?  The question raises a difficult point of principle.  But even to test the allegation itself is extremely difficult.  I have heard the allegation on more than one occasion.  It is not easy to test it, and it is still more difficult to find a remedy if the abuse &mdash;if it is an abuse&mdash;exists.  The type of children going to different schools may be due to the exercise of a weeding-out power&mdash;if I might put it that way&mdash;exercised by the authority of some schools.</P>
    <P>How far we could compel a uniform closing time for primary schools of a certain area is extremely difficult to say, because the schools are run by such different management. It is not merely a question of different managers.  There are schools being run by different religious Orders and they have to consider the necessities of their community. They may find that the best time is the month of June.  The ordinary schools may find the best time the month of August.  I will look into the matter again and see whether more uniformity can be introduced in that regard.  Deputy Good raised the question before and I looked into it then but not with much success.  I will again consult the managers of the different schools in Dublin to see if greater uniformity, if not full uniformity, cannot be introduced.</P>

    <P>Deputy Alton asked me a question in regard to this Vote.  There is provision in this year's Board of Works Estimate in connection with the extension of the Museum.  That is only a first instalment.  The plans are not yet ready.  I have other ideas about the matter, but I am not in a position at the moment to make any public announcement.  Steps are being gradually taken this year to fill our establishment in the Museum.  Advertisements have been issued, if the <Col N="2225" /> appointment has not been actually made, in connection with the vacancy in the art and industrial section of the Muscum.  Advertisements have been issued for the position of Keeper in the biological section of the Muscum&mdash;that is, the natural history section.  Some time ago, advertisements were issued for the filling of three posts in the Kildare Street Branch of the Muscum.  How far the Civil Service Commissioners have dealt with the matter, I am not in a position to say exactly.  I hope that, in a short time, we will be able to take steps to complete the staff set down in the Estimates.</P>

    <P>The intention of this and other amendments standing in my name is to ensure that under this Bill the wage-earning staffs become pensionable servants of the Borough Corporation, as they are after a certain period under the Corporation of the City of Dublin, and also to ensure that the transfer of the Pembroke and Rathmines servants shall be done in such a way as to give them credit, when they come under the City Corporation, for pension purposes for the years they have served under those bodies.  The Minister, in an amendment which he has circulated, goes a good part of the way to meet the purpose of this and other amendments.  I notice, however, that in the case of officers he makes it possible for officers to receive pensions after ten years, whereas in the case of servants, as now defined in his amendment, it will not be possible for them to receive pensions if they have under twenty years' service.  Perhaps the Minister would explain his reason for making such a distinction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps some general comment on the different amendments put down by Deputy Davin and the amendment intended to meet them that I have circulated would make the situation clearer. Some of Deputy Davin's amendments would make explicit the transfer of servants from an abolished body to either the new borough or the City Corporation, whether directly as in the case of the borough and the servants of the Rathmines and Pembroke Urban Districts, or indirectly in the case of the County Council, the Board of Health and the present Rural District Council to the Civic Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment that I propose&mdash; to put a new section before Section 15&mdash;arranged for the carry-over of every contract of service, whether expressed or implied, as between the servants of any of the abolished <Col N="2228" /> bodies, either to the Borough Corporation or to the City Corporation, and to that extent it meets one aspect of Deputy Davin's amendments. The amendments, putting in a new section 82, does that in respect of servants of the rural district council and the county council or the board of health to whom they are transferred, and the amendment to Section 19 makes arrangements for the carry-over of servants of the rural district council so transferred to the county council, and servants of the county council, otherwise transferred by agreement with the Minister for Local Government, to the Corporation.  So that we secure in this way the carrying on of what may be called contracts as between the servants and the existing bodies. On the matter of pensions, Section 24 (1) of the Bill secures</P>
    <P>For the purposes of any enactment empowering the City Corporation to grant to any of its employees other than officers an allowance in respect of the loss of his employment, an employee of the City Corporation who was previously employed by the county council, the board of health, a rural district council or an abolished body of which the City Corporation is the successor shall be entitled to reckon his employment by the county council, the board of health, such rural district council or such abolished body (as the case may be) as employment by the City Corporation.</P>
    <P>By the Act of 1925 and a private Act of the Dublin Corporation, employees in Dublin City who have 20 years' service can be given pensions either on loss of office or on leaving the service.  Section 48 (2) secures that the borough Corporation shall be in the same position.  Twenty years are quoted there to bring the borough as regards pensions to servants into the position that obtains in the Dublin Corporation.  Beyond that, I am not prepared to accept an amendment.  Deputy Davin's amendment No. 17 would give servants of the present urban districts facilities in the matter of pensions or gratuities <Col N="2229" /> that are not enjoyed by the servants of the Dublin Corporation at present.  I think that no case has been made for changing the position there.  I say that the amendments which I have down meet the situation. Employees of the urban district councils with 20 years' service, who become transferred to their successors, as all employees automatically will, will be immediately secured by the terms of the Bill in their pension rights in the same way as if they were employees of the Dublin Corporation with that length of service.  Therefore, I would oppose all Deputy Davin's amendments and would substitute my own.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to admit that the Minister has gone a long way to meet what was intended by my amendments, but could we have from him his reasons, or any good reasons, as to why a member of the wage-earning staff should not be entitled to a pension until he has twenty years' service, while the officer or salaried member of the staff of the Corporation can get a pension after ten years' service?</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>An officer enters the service of a local body as a person entering a position which is a pensionable one.  That is the normal frame of mind and the normal understanding on which an officer enters the service of a local body.  A servant of a local body is a casual workman and only gradually grows into the position of an employee with any permanence.  No doubt that was taken into consideration by the Dublin Corporation when it introduced its legislation dealing with the matter, and that guided the terms of the Act of 1925, in which the twenty years was repeated.</P>

    <P>and to add at the end of Part II., page 51, the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That portion of the Townland of Kimmage in the District Electoral Division of Terenure and the Rural District of South Dublin bounded as follows, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Starting at a point on the boundary between the Townlands of Terenure and Kimmage in the District Electoral Division of Terenure, at the centre of the road 215 yards south-west of Kimmage Cross Roads, proceeding in a northerly direction along the centre of the laneway which opens to the said road at the said point for a distance of 65 yards, thence in a north-easterly direction along the centre of the said laneway for a distance of 60 yards to the centre line of the bridge over the Corporation Mill Stream, thence in an casterly and south-casterly direction along the centre line of the <Col N="2233" /> said Corporation Mill Stream for a distance of 520 yards to the boundary between the Townlands of Perrystown and Kimmage, in the District Electoral Division of Terenure, thence northerly, north-easterly, southerly and westerly along the said Townland boundary to the starting point.</P>
    <P>This proposes to add the townland of Larkfield, fourteen acres, the townland of Stannaway, 162 acres. and part of Kimmage, 106 acres.  I have felt, after an examination of the position in Kimmage, that the part of Kimmage that it is now proposed to take in should come in.  The valuation of this part of Kimmage has increased from £330 in 1911 to £549 in 1926, and to £611 in 1930, and between 1911 and 1926 the population increased from 37 to 100.  It has been very rapidly urbanised. Stannaway, too, has increased in population between 1911 and 1926, from 64 to 121, and for a long time past I have been pressed by persons controlling 150 acres out of 162 who have been pointing out the desirability of taking it in.  Larkfield is only a small area between the two of them, and the population has risen from 7 in 1911 to 29 in 1926. It is just a small rectification of the boundary in the Kimmage area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to move the Second Reading of this Bill.  It is a short, two-clause measure, and its object is to extend the Shop Hours Act which was passed in 1926 and which will expire on the 15th July next if this Bill or some similar measure is not passed into law.  The Dáil might like a very short account of how the Act which this Bill proposes to extend came into being.  There has been no general legislation governing shop hours and matters of that kind since 1912, and, of course, things have moved very much since then in regard to the hours of work and the hours for opening shops.  I will quote, as an instance, one of the provisions of the Shops Act of 1912. It provides that no young person under the age of 18 years shall be employed in a shop for a longer period than 74 hours in the week. I need hardly say we have advanced very far from that.  There is nobody who would now think of putting such a section as that into an Act of Parliament.  In 1922 or 1923, certain difficulties arose between employers and employees in Dublin and elsewhere with regard to the hours of work.  There was considerable confusion, there were strikes and threats of strikes, picketing, and general disturbances.  As a result, a Bill was introduced into the Oireachtas in 1925, which fixed the closing on week nights at 6 o'clock, and on Saturdays at 7.30 in so far as drapery shops were concerned. There was some dissatisfaction with regard to that measure and a feeling among certain traders that the hour of 7.30 was too early.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2235" /> A Bill amending the 1925 Act was introduced in the later months of the session of 1925.  With regard to this measure a difference of opinion arose between the Dáil and Seanad on one particular point and that was the hour for closing on Saturday night. The Dáil wanted to fix the hour at 9 o'clock and the Seanad at 7.30. The matter was referred to a Select Committee of both Houses.  Evidence was taken from parties interested and eventually a measure of agreement was reached whereby the hour was fixed at 8.30 on Saturday night. As they appear in the Act, the hours are 9 to 6 on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, 9 to 6.30 on Fridays and 9 to 8.30 on Saturday nights.  This measure has been in operation since 1926 and, generally speaking, there has been satisfaction.  I do not say there is complete and entire satisfaction amongst all the sections affected, but in any case the Act has prevented the state of affairs that we had in 1923, 1924 and 1925 before the first Act was passed.</P>
    <P>The object of this Bill is to continue the existing Act for a further period.  The Bill does not regulate the hours of working, though undoubtedly it has the effect of limiting the hours which an employee will work.  It does not follow that when the shop is closed the assistant is automatically released from duty. There are instances in some shops, smaller business places, where an assistant may have to remain for a half or three-quarters of an hour or more doing work of various kinds&mdash; putting up stock and generally tidying up after the day.  Apart from this Act that is now in operation there is nothing to prevent young people working from 12 to 15 hours a day.  I have already quoted a section from the Shops Act which indicates that no young person is to work more than 74 hours in the week.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a much more comprehensive measure dealing with the hours of working in shops than either this Bill or the Act it proposes to continue.  We have had no <Col N="2236" /> such legislation since 1912.  In England they have an Act that was introduced in 1928.  Before that they had the Defence of the Realm Regulations which to some extent did operate to restrict the hours of opening. In Britain, too, they are at present engaged in a big inquiry into the whole position with a view to regulating hours, etc.  I am anxious to have such an inquiry into matters here, but in the meantime, until that inquiry is established, I am strongly in favour&mdash;and I hope the House will also be strongly in favour&mdash;of continuing the existing position until we are ready to put something more comprehensive in the place of the existing Act.  I suggest the proper thing to do is to continue the existing situation which, though it may not be entirely satisfactory and may have many faults, still has resulted in doing what it purported to do, that is, to bring peace to the particular business concerned&mdash;peace between employers and employees.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to Deputy Lemass's amendment.  With regard to the general principle comprised in the amendment I am quite in favour of it, but it is doubtful if the suggestion which the Deputy makes is a practical one in view of the time available.  The present Act expires on the 15th July.  What I fear about Deputy Lemass's proposal, if it were accepted, is that we would not be able to have a satisfactory inquiry of the type that, I am sure, Deputy Lemass as well as I would wish to have within the time available and at the same time have legislation enacted as a result of that inquiry in time before the present session closes.  That is the difficulty that I see in regard to the amendment. I am in favour of the general principle in the amendment, and I would like the inquiry to be held, but I think it would be a much bigger matter than the Deputy anticipates. I do not think it could be satisfactorily done inside a month, because not only does the amendment suggest that the Act should be examined with a view to amendments that might be made in it as a result of experience, but it also <Col N="2237" /> brings in a very much wider question, the advisability of extending the terms of the new Bill to include other trades and to operate in areas outside Dublin and district.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of having general shop legislation governing closing hours and the work of employees applied to districts outside Dublin, and to trades other than the special one mentioned here; but while the Act applies to Dublin only it does not mean that there are not other provisions of various kinds governing the hours of opening shops in districts outside Dublin.  Sometimes regulations are made by order of an urban council or some other local authority, and sometimes by agreement between employers and employees. While the hours are not general, still there are outside Dublin certain regulations which are observed.  I suggest to the House, and especially to Deputy Lemass, that we should pass this Bill now.  I will not say with certainty that there was a general understanding when the Act was passed in 1926 that something would be done by the Government during the life of the Act, which was approximately three years, to inquire into the whole question and to introduce legislation. I do not know what steps have been taken in that direction, or whether anything has been done. What we do know is that the life of the existing measure is running out, and there is no doubt that if the Act is allowed to expire, and as we have no fresh legislation from the Government, we will be thrown back to a position of chaos, confusion, general disturbance and uncertainty such as existed in 1924 and 1925.  I do not think there is anybody who will say that was a good state of affairs, or that it was anything we should look forward to without anxiety.  The proper course for the House to take in the circumstances is to secure that the existing measure is continued. I am prepared to support Deputy Lemass or anybody else in any steps he takes to hurry up an inquiry such as he advocates here, or to force the Government to expedite any action they may have in <Col N="2238" /> their minds in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>I think it is necessary that it should be done.  I think it is necessary that we should have a scheme of comprehensive legislation governing the whole question.  In the meantime, I believe that we cannot get a satisfactory enquiry in a month and that it is essential that we should have the Act continued; there should be no hiatus between the time when the present Act shall expire and new legislation takes its place.  Accordingly, I ask the House that they should pass this Second Reading.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;that&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Second Reading of the Shop Hours (Drapery Trades, Dublin and Districts) Bill, 1930, be postponed for one month, and that a Select Committee consisting of eleven members of the Dáil be set up to examine the operation of the Shop Hours (Drapery Trades, Dublin and Districts) Act, 1926, to consider and report on the amendments therein, if any, which experience has shown to be necessary, and the advisability of extending the terms of the Bill to include other trades and to operate in areas outside Dublin and district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving that amendment I realise that while not impossible it is most unlikely that a Select Committee, consisting of eleven members of the Dáil, could properly examine into the question outlined in the proposed terms of reference and submit a report within a month.  Deputy O'Connell has urged that the establishment of such a committee might result in a situation in which the existing Acts would be allowed to lapse before alternative legislation was allowed to be substituted for it. That is a situation which I would not like to see arise.  I do not think that there can be many members of this House who want to have conditions <Col N="2239" /> in the drapery trade in Dublin City go back to those contemplated by the Shops Act of 1912 which was drafted to meet pre-war conditions that are not parallel to-day.  My purpose in proposing this amendment was mainly to concentrate the attention of the House on the fact that the existing Bill, which relates only to the drapery trade, is unsatisfactory in many particulars and that there is necessity to have the question relating to all trades considered with a view to the introduction of an Act to amend the Shops Act and to bring it up to date.</P>
    <P>The existing Act was passed in 1926 for a limited period and it was presumed that during that period the Government would take steps to examine the amendments necessary in the Shops Act and introduce permanent legislation regulating the hours of opening and closing of shops of various kinds, not merely in Dublin but in every town and city. The Government has not done so and we are now faced with the position that this imperfect Act is due to expire and unless renewed we will be back to the position of 1912.  Sooner than allow that to happen, I would be prepared to facilitate the passage of this continuing Bill but I do hope that we will be able to get agreement that this continuation will be for a short period and only until the whole question can be properly examined by a Select Committee, and permanent legislation prepared.  It would be foolish for the Dáil to contemplate a position in which this Bill would be continued from time to time without having any proper examination into its operations. Anyone familiar with the working of the present Act knows that considerable amendments are required in it.  As Deputy O'Connell has pointed out, it does not attempt in any way to regulate the hours of employment in the drapery trade.  It merely provides that drapery establishments may not open before and may not close after certain hours.  The hours of employment are, in fact, unregulated except in so far as persons under eighteen years of age <Col N="2240" /> are concerned and they can be kept employed for 74 hours in the week, the time fixed in the 1912 Act, which in that matter is the only legislation existing.</P>
    <P>The main reason why this Bill was introduced and the main reason why it is supported is because it has the effect, indirectly, of limiting working hours, but I would like to see legislation introduced which would definitely fix the maximum number of hours for shop employees of all kinds.  The Bill is defective also in so far as it does not provide adequate machinery for its enforcement.  The enforcement of the Act rests with the Dublin Corporation, and although officials appointed by the Corporation have no doubt done their best they have not I think been able to enforce it as rigidly as some of us would like to see it, because it is obvious that legislation of this kind becomes unfair if it is not applied with equal vigour to all persons concerned.  If one trader is able to dodge the terms of the Act and keep open longer than another then that is putting the trader who is anxious to obey the law at a commercial disadvantage. When restrictive legislation of this kind is introduced and passed by the Dáil we should be very careful to see that proper machinery for its enforcement exists.  In my opinion, the enforcement of the closing hours provided in the Act or in any amending Act should be in the hands of the Civic Guards, as the enforcement of the weekly half-holiday is under the Shops Act of 1912.</P>
    <P>There are perhaps a number of minor amendments also possible in the Act.  One of the provisions of the Act sought to provide that on the working day prior to bank holidays shops would be allowed to open and remain open after the hours fixed for normal occassions. But one of the most important bank holidays of the year, that of the first Monday of August, was omitted from the terms of the Act, and although a shopkeeper can remain open after half past eight on the Saturday prior to Whit-Monday, he cannot do so on the Saturday prior <Col N="2241" /> to August Monday, which, in the drapery trade, is a much more important occasion.  That is a minor amendment which, however, might be repaired by this continuing Bill if it is not outside its principle.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that many Deputies here have been approached by deputations and individuals in recent weeks concerning this Bill.  I have.  The suggestions put forward by these deputations varied considerably. There were, of course, those representing the assistants and those representing a certain section of the employers who wished the existing Act continued.  There were others representing the smaller drapers who desired to have alterations made in the hours provided in the Act.  Some of those whom I met were, of course, anxious to get back to the position of 1912.  I can tell them that they are wasting their time agitating for that, because it is not likely that in 1930 anybody will be anxious to restore the social conditions that existed pre-war.</P>
    <P>The present Act permits drapery shops in Dublin to open for a total of 52 hours in the week.  Some reasonable objection might be made to the allocation of that number of hours between the various days, but it is a matter which certainly could be examined by a Committee of the Dáil to which representations could be made by the parties with views to put forward.  It is even possible, I think, that an agreement might be reached to provide alternative allocations of the hours which would permit shopkeepers in a certain district, by a majority vote or something of that kind, to select one set of hours as against another, even though the maximum number of hours would not be altered.</P>
    <P>One of my purposes in moving this amendment to the Second Reading motion was to have the Dáil consider the possibility of extending the existing Act to cover trades other than the drapery trade.  I think that those representing the drapery trade who have met Deputies had a very reasonable case in support of their objection to the Bill on the ground that it placed them at a considerable <Col N="2242" /> commercial disadvantage with other traders who are indirectly competitors of their own for custom. There are shops in Dublin and other towns which keep open for amazingly long hours.  I know of assistants engaged by tobacconists, fruiterers, newsagents and traders of that kind who work for 75 hours a week.  I know of one assistant who works 14 hours a day in a shop of that nature and it is high time, I think, that the Dáil should take steps to restrict these hours and to compel the institution of civilised conditions.  The Minister for External Affairs will be asking the Dáil in the near future to agree to a convention for the abolition of slavery and of the slave trade. I think that this Dáil could show its desire to assist in that useful object by limiting the hours worked in establishments of the kind I have indicated in Dublin.  I do not say that these hours are worked in all establishments or that all establishments which keep open till late hours work their assistants fourteen hours a day but there are some which do.  There are quite a number of them, of course, which are properly run and in which the assistants do not work more than 48 hours a week.  Even though the shops are open arrangements are made for different shifts to come on.  If, however, we are going to have an Act in operation regulating the working hours of any one trade it is for those who advocate the continuance of that Act to show why it should be confined to one trade when much more objectionable conditions prevail in others.  If all shops were compelled to close at the same hour I think that opposition to the continuation of the present Act from those engaged in the drapery business would become very much modified if it did not disappear altogether.  I do not know either why the Act should be confined to Dublin and district.  I am sure that the conditions which necessitated its passage in 1926 prevailed in Cork, Limerick and other towns as well as in Dublin and if there was need for it here there was need for it in those places.</P>
    <P>These are the main points that are <Col N="2243" /> covered by the amendment which appears in my name.  I realise, as I have said, that a Committee of the Dáil might not be able to consider the matter and put in a report within a month.  The suggestion I have to make, if the House would be agreeable to it, is that the Act should be continued for a limited period on the understanding that such a committee would be set up.  The Act, however defective, is better than the conditions which would exist following its expiration, and if we were placed in the position of having to vote for its continuation or permitting a position to be created in which only the 1912 Act would prevail we would vote for its continuation.  We would like, however, to see all these questions I have mentioned thoroughly examined and permanent legislation introduced to deal with them.  I think that the Government is open to censure in not having provided for such an examination during the five years the Act operated. I do not want to press that point now, however, but I do ask that we get general agreement to the establishment of this committee, because I do not think anybody, no matter what his views are, could object to the question at least getting the detailed examination which a committee could give it and which this Dáil could not.  I do not wish to deal with the various points which are being made by the different Associations and individuals interested in the Act.  That we must have a limitation of working hours is, I think, obvious, and that the limitation should be of such a nature as to impose the least hardship on any class will, I think, be accepted.  The Dáil is not a suitable body for the examination of a matter of this kind, particularly if it is determined to confine the operation of the Act to Dublin City and district.  After all, the number of Deputies from Dublin City and district here in the Dáil is only 23, whereas the question would in the end be determined by the votes of all Deputies from all over Ireland whose interest in the matter would be very slight.  One of my <Col N="2244" /> main reasons for having this question referred to a committee was that it would enable Dublin Deputies, as such, to examine conditions prevailing in Dublin and provide a code regulating these hours in the best interests of all classes.</P>

      <P>I rise to oppose the Second Reading of this Bill, and in stating my opposition to this Bill I want to be perfectly clear and definite that I do not stand for the working of long hours by assistants in shops in Dublin or in any other part of the Free State.  Other countries, France, Germany, England and America, are on the verge of a universal eight-hour day, and I, for one, am in complete agreement with that universal movement.  If they work an eight-hour day in these countries I see no reason whatever why we in the Free State should not they work an eight-hour day.  The legislation that this House is asked to pass affects only one or two sections of traders in the City of Dublin. Deputy O'Connell, in moving the Second Reading of the Bill, referred to the 1912 Act.  He stated, quoting a certain section of that Act, that no young person should be employed for more than 74 hours a week, and he added that, generally speaking, there is satisfaction with the working of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy says that there was satisfaction with the 1926 Act.  My experience is that business men in the City of Dublin are far from being satisfied with the working of the 1926 Act.  There has been almost universal dissatisfaction.  If the House passes this Bill, it will be <Col N="2245" /> a benefit certainly to certain workers in this city.  It will be a benefit to two classes, I think, in the City&mdash;to the merchant drapers on the one hand and to the assistants who work in their shops, but these benefits would be conferred at the expense of the rest of the working class community, leaving out entirely the general public, which should be considered in passing a Bill of this kind.  I suggest that the Bill should not have been placed on the Statute Book and that the regulation of hours between employers and employees is really a matter of arrangement between the various traders themselves, who know the different conditions necessary and suitable for their own particular trade.</P>
      <P>How has the operation of the Act affected the business men of the City of Dublin?  Many of the smaller shops have been reduced almost to the verge of bankruptcy.  Shops that had a return of £50 have fallen to £25 and £30 per week.  Shops with a return of £100 weekly have fallen to £80 and £75 because the shops are closed when money is available and when business is to be done.  Under this Act the smaller traders are compelled to close at half past six on Friday evening.  From half past six to half past seven is the busiest hour in the day for the shopping public in this city.  When the shops close at half past eight on Saturdays the real work of the day is only about to begin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The falling off in the turnover I suggest is mainly due to the closing of the shops at half past eight on Saturday evening.  Shops are closed at an hour when trade is to be done and money is available.  I need hardly remind the House that overhead charges of most people in business have been considerably increased in recent years.  A month or two ago a fresh burden of £125,000 was added to the traders of the City of Dublin in connection with the Dublin Poor Relief Bill.  Their trade under this Bill has steadily diminished.  How do you expect them to pay their way?  They do not want anything <Col N="2246" /> unreasonable.  They do not want the assistants to work more than a forty-eight hour week, but they do want decided alterations in the hours and they want to be permitted to work on Saturday evenings after 8.30 and on Friday evenings after half past six.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell appears to think that the Act was satisfactory as far as the general community was concerned.  I would like to point out that when the smaller traders agreed to the passage of this Bill certain gurantees were given to them by the better class shops.  It was arranged, in order to secure the original passing of the Bill, that these shops would close at 1 p.m. on Saturday.  When the Bill began to operate and when the fall in turnover was realised they adopted a very clever device.  Instead of closing at 1 p.m. on Saturdays they continued the half-holiday on Wednesday and remained in competition with these smaller people up to half past eight on Saturday.  I ask all reasonable Deputies how is it possible for the smaller traders to get a living.  I am authorised to say on behalf of these smaller people that they have no intention of keeping their shops open for a longer period than is at present permitted under the 1926 Act.  They have been rather harshly treated by this Bill.  The promise that the better class shops gave to them was broken, and we find that the English colony that has come in has taken the national trade of the City of Dublin.  Those foreign shops about which there is so much complaint in this city capture the trade from our local traders.  I feel sure this House will not stand that condition of affairs.  Deputy O'Connell appears to think that if we keep on this Act things are going to be rather in a satisfactory way.</P>

      <P>Anybody who maintains that the trade of Dublin is improved by this Act has no knowledge of the circumstances.  The most extraordinary anomalies exist under This Act.  Under the 1912 Act, to which reference has been made, <Col N="2247" /> every shop was to close for a half day during the week.  What do we find?  Woolworth's Stores are kept open for six days in the week, taking profits out of the country and putting traders out of business in the city.  This is the Act Deputy O'Connell asks the House to pass, and he says that unless it is passed the business of the City of Dublin will revert to chaos.  Those are statements which cannot be substantiated.  I cannot see for a moment how Deputy O'Connell can stand over this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, open six days in the week, and I have known them when anything special is on to have the restaurant open on Sunday. These are trade anomalies which should be dealt with by proper legislation. I do not want it to be imagined that I am against men working in the City of Dublin.  I am as anxious that they should have a 48-hour week as any man in this House, but I say that this Act has operated with great harshness on the bulk of the smaller traders in the city.  To give an idea of how the traders themselves, leaving out of the question the employees, are anxious to have this question dealt with, I will read a letter I have:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear Sir&mdash;In the hope of obtaining your valued help and support I desire to place before you the present need for legislation&mdash; as regards the earlier closing of all shops in Dublin City and suburbs&mdash;the suggested hours to be 9 o'clock each evening and 10 o'clock on Saturdays and seven o'clock on sundays. Thousands of small shopkeepers are obliged to keep their shops open and work an average of 14 to 16 hours per day, seven days per week, for want of compulsory closing hours, which exist in all the principal large cities across the water.  The health of the shopkeepers and their assistants are serious factors <Col N="2248" /> calling for immediate attention on the part of our members in An Dáil and An Seanad.  An extension of the present Shop Hours Act to embrace all shops would meet the position.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Appealing in the name of humanity for your assistance to stop this slavery before the summer begins.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And Deputy O'Connell wants this slavery perpetuated! When introducing the Second Reading of the Bill he referred to a section of the 1912 Act, in which he stated that no young person shall be employed for more than 74 hours per week.  Deputy Lemass knows what is happening in Dublin as well as I do.  The unfortunate assistants, in confectioners, tobacconists and sweetshops, work, I would venture to say, 74 hours a week, and we are giving to this privileged few 54 hours a week.  There should be equality for all.  Give the men who work in the confectionery, fruit and tobacco trades the same hours as other people, or some reasonable extension if necessary.  I ask the House not to pass a Bill which gives 52 hours to one section and asks another section to work for 74 hours a week.  If Deputy Lemass's suggestion could be accepted by the Government I would be very glad to support it. There should be some inquiry into the whole question of the working of shops and the working conditions for assistants.  I would not like it to go forth that in opposing this Bill I am opposed to offering the shop assistants a 44-hour week.  Deputy O'Connell referred to the fact that a Commission was being set up by the Labour Party in England to deal with this question.  That should also be done here, but you are not going, as Deputy O'Connell says, to revert to chaos if you reject this Bill.  Under the Act of 1912 you still can deal with the matter.  The people who are opposing the Bill tooth and nail are doing so because their livelihood is dependent on it.  They have not the slightest intention of reverting to a 74-hour week.  They will still observe the 52-hour week and are <Col N="2249" /> willing to close their premises at reasonable hours.  As I say, an inquiry into the working of shops should be set up before further legislation is passed.  I fail to see why the Dáil should interfere with the closing hours of shops.  That is a matter that should be arranged between the business people on one hand and their assistants on the other.  I say that the bulk of the unfortunate assistants are forced to work for 74 hours a week and that we should not pass a Bill which will give privileges to only a few assistants.</P>

      <P>Though I support the rejection of this Bill, I do not do so on the grounds put forward by Deputy Byrne.  Not withstanding the Act of 1912 and other legislation, people work 74 hours a week.  I myself have to work 74 hours, sometimes 84 hours and sometimes 94 hours a week, and it is on those grounds that I suggest that the principle underlying the Bill is wrong. If the Dáil decides that it should lay down regulations as to who may open a shop and who may not open a shop&mdash;it does not matter what is being bought or sold&mdash;this question of hours and regulations will arise. This Dáil has no right to intervene in matters of that kind.  It has, of course, the right to intervene where licensed premises are concerned, because that is a matter of restricting the hours during which intoxicating liquor can be purchased.  Generally, however, in the general question of the sale of goods, whether drapery, cutlery or anything else, I submit that the Dáil has no right to intervene. You might just as well say to any Deputy who happens to be a farmer, that the Dáil must enact that he shall not touch his hay after 6 p.m. in July or that he shall not be allowed to dig potatoes in October. It is exactly the same principle.  I submit that it strikes at the very basis of freedom for which my friends across the House have fought.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GearoidOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  I am <Col N="2250" /> glad to hear that.  Does the Dáil take upon itself the right to say who may start a particular business or shop&mdash;I do not say industry&mdash;and that it is going to regulate the hours in regard to such business?  It is proper that no person should be forced to work hours longer than are reasonable, but what is this Bill going to do?  If we refuse to pass the Bill, does it mean that the assistants in this particular trade will have longer and later hours?  I do not see why they should.  I think that if there is a question as to how long they should or should not work it is a matter that should be arranged in the trade itself.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell mentioned the 1912 Act, and no doubt a regulation regarding the working of 74 hours is unreasonable in 1930.  We must remember, however, that that Act was passed in 1912.  The idea of a 74-hour week in 1930 is ridiculous, but traders and persons who are employed by them should agree amongst themselves on these matters and the Dáil should not interfere. It is not because one person is sufficiently affluent to employ seven or eight assistants that another person who has, unfortunately, to run his own business with the aid of a son or daughter should be penalised. That is why I oppose the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should remember that there are elements, such as public health and other matters, in the case of factories to be considered which do not prevail to the same extent in the case of shops.  There is no comparison at all.  If the Deputy desires to continue in that strain I would ask him why sweet shops, say, in O'Connell Street, are not controlled and are allowed to remain open until twelve o'clock at night.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely agree with the suggestion of those who say that we ought not interfere in the matter of the hours during which a particular type of shop in a particular place shall remain open or closed. I think that if we deal with the question of drapery shops in Dublin we ought to deal with the question of sweet shops and tobacco shops.  If we deal with them in respect of Dublin then we ought to do the same in respect of Cork, Ballaghaderreen, and elsewhere.  I think that the machinery is entirely inadequate, and that we ought not to have it. We have fixed hours in the case of the drapery trade in Dublin.  They were fixed in 1925, and when they were thought to be too short on Saturday nights they were changed in 1926.  I would be sorry to see the present Act die because, in the first place, it would be absurd that we <Col N="2252" /> should have a social system in which our shops would be open at all hours of the morning and stay open until all hours at night.</P>
      <P>There are limits within which the purchasing public want facilities for shopping.  These limits ought to be found in such a way as would give as reasonable an amount of leisure as could be given both to owners and employees.  I see not reason to say that owners, employees, or the public so far as shopping facilities are concerned, are not adequately served in the drapery trade by a normal weekly closing at 6 p.m., 6.30 p.m. on Friday and 8.30 p.m. on Saturday. We have fixed particular hours for the drapery trade in Dublin, and if we are to understand from Deputies that there is dissatisfaction in regard to hours in other trades, I would not like to see that headline go before the question concerning trades in other towns had been considered.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that Deputies for Dublin should come together and discuss the matter but I would prefer to see the new city council discuss it because I think that they would be in a better position to do so.  Deputies from Dublin are sent here to do general national work and I do not think that we should sectionalise ourselves in any way to deal with specific local problems.  I do not see why Mayo Deputies should come together to discuss closing hours to be observed by drapery houses in Ballaghaderreen or Castlebar.  The question of the closing of shops is a matter which if it is to be discussed in detail by any set of governors should be discussed by local governors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister suggest that the Dublin Corporation would have power under the existing statute to enforce closing hours?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>No. but they have certain powers under the Act of 1912.  I have had representations from businesses other than the drapery trade to the effect that they also want regulation of shopping hours.  I appreciate the necessity for <Col N="2253" /> it, but if under the 1912 Act local bodies have not a particular type of power that they think they should have, or if employers or employees think that such powers are not sufficient for their purpose, what we want is not an examination by a particular part of the Oireachtas into the question of hours but representations made from organised employers, organised employees, or local bodies as to the additional powers which they want under an Act such as that of 1912 and which would enable them to make regulations in such matters.  I think that progress in that particular direction is wanted and not progress by examination here as to during what particular hours shops here shall be shut or open.</P>
      <P>But for the moment I certainly would be very sorry to see the present Act discontinued, because it has set what appears to me, personally at any rate, not unreasonable hours for the shutting of drapery houses in the City of Dublin.  Outside businesses such as publichouses, it is the only particular class of business that the Oireachtas has fixed any hours for, and I hope that the headline set in this particular measure will be borne in mind by local bodies when considering hours for different businesses.  However, I think we cannot continue indefinitely to keep the present hours in operation in the City of Dublin in respect of the drapery trade by a measure of the Oireachtas.  I do not know whether three and a half years is too long to extend this measure, but personally I should like to see the Act carried along for a further period and not dropped.</P>

      <P>No reason in the world except that there were reasons sufficiently apparent in 1925 and in 1926 to warrant the passing of this measure for a particular period.  There is a measure in existence, <Col N="2254" /> and a unanimous recommendation comes up from the Seanad in the shape of a Bill for its further continuance for three and a half years.  These are the reasons that give me definite ground, and I think that the dropping of this Act by the Dáil now would be interpreted as a going back on what we had in mind as regards hours for business when we fixed the hours in 1926.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order.  The Deputy said I made a certain statement.  I have stated what I did say.  Is the Deputy in order in repeating his misquotation of what I said?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether Deputy O'Sullivan is concerned about the legal or the moral right of this House to deal with the question, but, as I say, it is illuminating to hear him make such a statement. If he is viewing it from the legal aspect, I should like to remind him that it is an accepted truism that all law is based upon common sense and I will ask him to apply commonsense to the practical application of allowing business premises to open and close when they like. What would it mean in practice? He talks of certain shops in O'Connell Street remaining open at present until 11 and 12 o'clock at night. Yet his attitude means, in effect, that all other shops should be allowed to do likewise&mdash;that no limitation should be applied.  I think anyone who exercises common sense in this matter will admit that if no restrictions are applied, the owner of business premises is going to remain open as long as his competitor remains open.  Even if there were no assistants employed, the health and interest of the family of that owner certainly should be the concern of this Parliament, as well as those of <Col N="2256" /> other citizens.  Deputy Byrne treated us to a most extraordinary lecture in opposing the Bill.  Will he show us how the passing of this Bill means reducing the hours of labour of one section of assistants to 52 hours and forcing another section to work 74 hours?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Act itself does not control the particular section to which I referred, practical conditions show that that is what would happen if the Bill passed. The people working for 74 hours per week will continue to work for that length of time, and only those engaged in the drapery trade&mdash;the privileged few&mdash;will get the benefit of the proposed legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore Deputy Byrne's remedy is to add to the number of people who are already working 74 hours per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have clearly stated that those for whom I am speaking undertake that no hours beyond the hours worked under the Act, namely, 52 hours, will be worked if this measure is rejected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what it means in substance.  The passing of this Bill, according to Deputy Byrne, means the forcing of one section to work 52 hours and another section to work 74 hours.  His remedy is to have them all work 74 hours. I submit that there is only one alternative to the passing of this Bill and that is the suggestion contained in Deputy Lemass's amendment. There can be no reasonable argument advanced against the principle of that amendment.  I admit the amendment is not before the House, but if the Minister is viewing this from an impartial standpoint and is concerned about the welfare of all classes affected by the working hours in these trades, if he is alive to the fact that the owners and employees of every shop in practically every line of business in this city and throughout the country would welcome uniform hours, I suggest that the best way out of this difficulty is to allow the Bill to pass and stipulate the period within which a committee <Col N="2257" /> would be set up representing all interests in the House to deal with this from a national standpoint.  The Minister misrepresented Deputy Lemass's view when he said that he wanted to make it a local affair.  If I interpreted Deputy Lemass aright, I understood him to say that Dublin Deputies would have the opportunity when this committee was set up to have the views of Dublin traders and assistants represented there, as well as the views of all other traders and assistants throughout the country. There is a crying necessity for legislation on this question and I appeal to the Minister to agree to the setting up of this committee within as short a period as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation. I have withdrawn my amendment, not because I did not think it contained the best suggestion for dealing with the question, but because it has been pointed out that it would be impossible to put that suggestion into operation in the time available.  I have asked, however, that if the Act is continued for a limited period a committee should be set up on the lines I have suggested and to consider the terms of reference which I propose.  I had hoped that we could get agreement to set up such a committee, in which case a motion to that effect might be passed in Government time.  If not, I shall put down such a motion myself, but if it appears in my name it will not be considered by the Dáil, in view of the state of the Order Paper, for a considerable time.  I should like to have the committee meet soon, in which case it would require the agreement of the Government, and I hope still that we shall be able to get that agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that we are likely to establish a dangerous principle if we are not very careful. This is only one branch of industry, and there are some hundreds, if not more, branches of industry in this State.  I am in touch with the conditions in several of these branches of industry.  In any of them that I am in touch with the hours of labour <Col N="2258" /> are regulated by employers, on the one hand, and labour on the other. That, as far as I know, is the general principle with regard to the regulation of working hours in industry. Much the same principle&mdash;I happen to know something about it&mdash;prevails on the other side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different matter.  I am opposed to Governments interfering in industry.  On that account, it is only something very special that would make me vote for this Bill.  I do not think it is desirable, from the point of view of the State, on the one hand, or from the point of view of industry, on the other hand, that there should be any Governmental interference. It is primarily a matter for the employers, on the one hand, and for labour on the other hand, to regulate the hours, and if those two are not able to regulate the matter, it shows that there is something wrong in either camp or in both camps.  From that point of view, and from the experience I have had of the working of that particular system, I am loth to depart from the principle I have referred to.  It would require some very strong inducement to make me vote for any Government interference of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I, and I am sure other Deputies, have received letters from the organisations representing the two parties interested in the passage of this measure.  I received&mdash; and probably Deputy Good received also&mdash;a resolution from the Secretary of the Merchant Drapers' Association asking that this Bill be passed, as well as a similar resolution from the Labour organisation concerned&mdash;the Distributive Workers and Clerks' Union.  So far as Deputy Good's point is concerned, he ought to vote for this Bill, seeing that it has the support of the employers and the employees chiefly concerned.  Probably, the Merchant Drapers' Association employ the greater number of the assistants engaged in the drapery trade in Dublin.  As Deputy Lemass has pointed out, there is at least one other employers' association that is not affiliated with the Merchant Drapers' Association and for whom they cannot speak.  That is one of our difficulties with regard to this Bill.  Personally, I am not satisfied with this Bill.  I think it is unsatisfactory in so far as it deals with one trade and one trade only.  I should like many other trades to be brought within the scope of this measure. There is an Act in operation at present dealing with the drapery trade, and those of us who are in favour of a restriction in the hours of work for other trades will have to allow this Bill to pass and make an effort later to get the other trades dealt with. As other Deputies have pointed out, if the Act at present in operation were allowed to lapse in July, we would be forcing both the employers and the employees concerned under this measure to work seventy-four hours or longer.  That is a thing which I am sure the House does not wish to do.  I think the Bill is unsatisfactory from other standpoints. <Col N="2260" /> Possibly, many traders who agreed with the passage of the Bill originally are now dissatisfied with it, having had experience of its working.  Alterations could be made in the hours of closing which, while not allowing employers to keep assistants working longer hours, would enable them to re-arrange the hours.  Like many other Dublin Deputies, I have received several deputations on this question.  One and all agreed that they were not desirous of working their assistants longer than forty-eight hours per week.  Some of them wanted this Bill dropped.  Others wanted it amended in various ways.  It was suggested that amendments might be brought in, even at this late hour, and that while the hours would not be extended they might be rearranged. I do not know that time would allow that to be done.  I would certainly favour Deputy Lemass's proposal, that this House should hold an investigation into the whole problem.  I do not see why this House should not do that, or why it is not competent to do it.  We legislate every day in the week on matters closely affecting, not alone the business, but the life of every individual in the State.  I do not see, therefore, why we should not be fully competent to deal with a matter affecting the hours of business of employers and their employees. There is nothing wrong in principle in that proposal.  I do not mind Deputy O'Sullivan.  We hear many ridiculous things from him from time to time.  It is worthy of him to suggest that we have no right to interfere.</P>

      <P>He may have meant to say that.  It required half a dozen different efforts from him to explain what he said, and, with every effort, he bogged himself worse and worse. However, that is characteristic of him.  I do not suppose anybody here minds him very much or takes very serious notice of what he says.  The House, in my humble opinion, has the right, and I go further and say the duty, to investigate a matter of this kind, which affects the lives and the health of citizens of the State. There are a great many of our people &mdash;probably far too many&mdash;engaged in shops.  We have laws and regulations governing work in factories and prohibiting workers in certain industries from working beyond certain hours.  I do not see why anybody should suggest that we have no right to interfere, from the point of view of public health, and restrict the hours of working in shops.  It was put to me recently by a trader with whom I discussed this question, that if no legislation of this kind remained in operation the hours of closing in certain areas in Dublin would be regulated by the traders who remained open latest.  Competition would immediately set in, and if one trader in a district kept his door open until a certain hour on a Friday night his competitor would remain open for half an hour later the next night.  That would continue until we would get back to the state of affairs which some of us remember, when many drapers' shops were not alone open until twelve o'clock on Saturday night but open on Sunday morning as well.  The traders themselves do not want that state of affairs revived.  Much against my will and for the reasons I stated, I am constrained to vote for the passage of this Bill.  I do so on the understanding that we, on this side, will make an effort to have carried into effect the suggestion which is down in the name of Deputy Lemass. We want the scope of this legislation widened.  We want other trades brought within its ambit.  We believe that it will be possible to arrive at agreement between the interested parties by which while the hours of <Col N="2262" /> trading may be altered, there certainly will be no extension of the hours of working as laid down by the present Act.</P>

      <P>I desire to say a few words about this Bill and about the amendment, which has now been withdrawn and put forward as a suggestion.  To my mind, it is a rotten Bill, and a rottener amendment, and the mover of the amendment so thought, as is shown by his withdrawing it almost the moment he put it forward.  He asked this House to do what he frankly recognised was impossible in the time in which he asked it should be done.  I do not know what the suggestion is that is now emerging from the amendment.  The month has gone, I suppose.  Are we still to examine the operation of the Shop Hours Act in its relation to certain trades and in its relation to Dublin? Are we to extend the inquiry to other localities, and, extending it to other localities, extend it to the possibility of bringing in other trades?  Are we still to stick to the idea of a Dáil Committee?  A Dáil Committee is the worst body that could deal with this matter.  I shall not go into the question of competence. The Dáil can appoint a committee to do anything.  The Dáil could deal with this matter itself.  But a more unsuitable body to deal with matters of that kind than a Dáil Committee can hardly be conceived.  The Committee will presumably take evidence.  It will take evidence, say, with regard to the hours at which butchers in Claremorris will have to close their shops.  How are the butchers of Claremorris to give evidence before the Committee?  How are the people who want to buy meat in Claremorris to give evidence?  Are they all to tramp up to Dublin? Would not the wisest course be to have some body which could go round the country and take evidence in different localities, and if it is thought suitable, set up a Dáil Committee which would do that work?</P>

      <P>It is possible that the extension of this to other businesses might come in.  Certainly the scope would have to be widened, both in regard to the area and in regard to the trades to be covered. Take any other example.  A shop might have branches located down the country to which the same conditions might apply.  Does anybody think that a Dáil Committee would be a suitable body to deal with that? I have been investigating the Shop Hours Act of 1912, and the whole code of which it was the final Act, for two or three years.  There was neither a promise, nor was there a presumption, when this particular Act was passed, that there would be any immediate amendment of the general shop hours code.  One of the things that has kept us departmentally in difficulties on that particular branch of the work is this, that there does not appear to be any general feeling through the country that shop hours ought to be changed.</P>

      <P>I mean the city and townships&mdash;the Dublin area. Outside that area nobody has made any representations.  I do not see <Col N="2264" /> that there is any public desire for a change in the Shop Hours Act of 1912.  Certainly I have no information that would lead me to the conclusion that there is.  Within Dublin I have had representations both ways&mdash;for and against this Bill&mdash;but I have received very few representations asking that the terms of the Bill should be applied outside the drapery trade, and I have received representations from people in the drapery trade that it should no longer be applied to them.  Any representations that have come have been confined to the Dublin area&mdash; I say that with a little reservation: there may have been some casual enquiry from outside, but nothing of any volume.  What am I to do under these circumstances?  Set up a committee?  I can set up a Departmental Committee at any time, and I think if the matter is to be tackled that we should do that, and set up a Committee of the Dáil to consider the legislation that would be produced following on the Departmental Committee's report.  That is the only way to do it.  But am I to establish a Departmental Committee because one trade in Dublin got this Bill passed for itself in 1925 on what nearly amounted to false pretences, and because certain other people in Dublin want it extended to another group of trades?  Why should we set up a committee under these conditions? There are much more urgent things requiring committee work and committee examination than this.  If there seems to be a desire, if in the next three or four months, as a result of the publicity from this debate, I get representations from any substantial group of employees or employers throughout the country, if there is any real demand for an investigation of the Shop Hours Act to lead to an improvement of conditions in shops, we can get it examined. But I suggest that the only way to have it examined would be by a Departmental Committee which I would establish and which would report to the House.</P>

There is the question of the consideration of the drapery and other businesses in Dublin, and everything, drapery included, in the areas outside Dublin.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not admit that any of these businesses require regulation by this House.  I think that the duty of this House in that connection is confined to the passing of such legislation as the Factory Acts and other Acts which safeguard the workers' lives and which tend to safeguard their health or to improve the conditions which operate against it.  Any other improvements <Col N="2266" /> to my mind should be operated under the machinery that is laid down in the 1912 Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let their elected representatives make representations to me.  So far, by letters or interviews or in any other way, representations have not been made to me.  There is a volume of complaint throughout the country with regard to the Shop Hours Act.  Representations could be made through any of these channels, and on that case when it is made I will act.  On the Bill itself, I said that the 1926 Act was passed almost on false pretences. It was passed on a statement that it amounted to an agreed measure.  It was not an agreed measure, and it was clearly shown not to be so once it was passed. Secondly, the Bill does this very deplorable thing to which the Minister for Local Government and Deputy O'Sullivan referred: it establishes a precedent for this House to interfere to regulate the hours in a particular area with regard to a particular trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to act at all in regard to hours we should act generally, or else&mdash;and this would be the better method&mdash;we should establish machinery to enable areas down the country to put in force hours for themselves. The Minister for Local Government said that as far as he saw there was a provision of services in the way of sale sufficient to meet the needs of the public.  Why does anybody <Col N="2267" /> want to open in these areas outside the hours that are laid down?  Surely it is because they know there is a demand for their goods outside these hours.  The very fact that certain traders came to a certain Senator in 1926, and said to him: &ldquo;We, the owners of the bigger shops, had an agreement with the members of the Trade Union. That agreement is on the point of being broken.  Why?  Because certain of the smaller and intermediate shops are realising that very good business can be done outside the hours we agreed to.  If they open we will have to follow suit.&rdquo;  Why are they going to open?  Very few of these people want to keep open. As a matter of fact, the longer a shop keeps open the more overhead expenses it incurs.</P>
    <P>It will not do that for the sake of having the assistants hanging around idle, or having them in the shop for a couple of hours longer, but because there is a demand.  As to the other point which the Minister for Local Government made and in which there is more force&mdash;with reference to bringing this Bill to a sudden conclusion&mdash;he suggested that it might be allowed to run on for some period, possibly not for the three-and-a-half years that it was proposed.  I hold that if there is to be an examination into the 1912 Act we should not prejudice that examination by having this Bill on the Statute Book.  We would have a committee meeting, representations would be made, and people would be giving evidence for or against a condition that was established under the 1925 Act in a rather arbitrary fashion by the Dáil without having had much argument put up in support of it.  If there is to be an examination&mdash;and if there is any feeling in regard to it I can promise an examination speedily&mdash;it would have to go back to the condition of things before the 1926 Act came into force, and anybody can see that this would lead to chaos and confusion.  Talk about going back to seventy-four hours a week is the greatest folly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2268" /> The 1912 Act imposes these obligations, that with the exception of certain businesses all shops must close on one day in the week not later than 1 o'clock, that there must be a weekly half-holiday given&mdash;which two things need not occur on the same day&mdash;and that on the voting of two-thirds of the traders in a particular business the hour for closing may be not later than 7 o'clock.  That may require amendments of a small nature.  For instance, it may be considered that it should be not earlier than 7 o'clock, but that is a small point. The main contest that there was about both the 1925 and the 1926 Acts was with regard to the hour of Saturday closing, and the hour of Saturday closing could be established under the machinery set up by the 1912 Act.  But the point about the 1912 Act that Deputy O'Connell I am sure does not like is that it requires a vote of two-thirds of those concerned; in other words, it gets down to the people concerned in the business.  I say that the 1912 Act machinery is the best possible machinery.</P>
    <P>It may not be correct in all its details; it is an old Act now and it may have to be brought up to date to meet present requirements, but it has the machinery.  But we should not get into the habit of dealing with special trades and special areas.  If we do, our task will never be ended. I suggest that this Bill be allowed to drop, that if necessary an inquiry can be started at once, both from the point of Dublin and of the drapery trade.  It could be constituted at once even on the question of Dublin and other trades, and it could be constituted a little later on the question of Dublin and other districts and the drapery and other trades. But if we are to have an enquiry let us approach it with the main Act, the Act which is on the Statute Book and which established rather good machinery, and let this Act, which arose in peculiar circumstances which do not, I think, arise at the moment, lapse, so that we can get back to the old conditions.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce comes along now after five years just when this measure is about to lapse and says that an inquiry can be started at once.  He is now most profuse in his promises of an inquiry.  What has he done for the past five years with regard to the matter?  He made no promise of an inquiry and we have had no inquiry.  I do not say that there was a promise, but I distinctly say that there was an understanding among Deputies at the time when this Act was passed that there would be an inquiry and an investigation, and possibly permanent legislation. Otherwise why was there a period of five years originally fixed in the Act?  That was what the five years period was fixed for&mdash;to give the Gevernment and the House an opportunity of looking into the whole question.  It is only at the end of that period that we have this promise from the Minister.  He throws that promise out as a reason why the Bill should be dropped as an inducement, as it were, to the House to drop the Bill.  He tells us that the Act was passed under something like false pretences because there was, in fact, no agreement.  The records are against him.  It was only afterwards he said that people disagreed with it, but I say that there was an agreement at the time the Act was passed.</P>

I cannot see that the continuance of the Act would prejudice any such inquiry.  Deputy Byrne has a rather unfortunate knack of making people say what they never said and insisting that they did say it.  He said that in my opening statement I indicated I was satisfied with existing conditions. That is not so.  I made it quite plain I was not satisfied, but I pointed out that if the Bill were allowed to drop the new state of affairs would be less satisfactory than the conditions now existing. The Deputy also referred at length to the position in other shops outside the drapery trade, and, as Deputy Cooney pointed out, he declared that we wanted slavery perpetuated. As Deputy Cooney also pointed out, Deputy Byrne apparently wants to put those engaged in the drapery business into the state of slavery that he talks about in relation to other trades.</P>

      <P>There should be no objection to the Bill then.  Deputies Byrne, O'Sullivan and Good emphasised that the matter was one which should be settled between the employers and the employees; it was a matter for arrangement in the trade.  Let me point out that the 1925 measure had its origin in an agreement between the principal people engaged in the drapery trade and the employees.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>It was to prevent it being broken that the Bill was introduced originally.  The Bill sought to give effect to the agreement. What the Minister indicated was actually taking place.  There was an agreement and conditions were satisfactory, but some of the smaller drapers who were not in the Merchant Drapers' Association proceeded to open their shops and not to observe the agreement which existed between the general body and those employed in the trade. The merchant drapers held that if that was going to continue, and if the smaller shops were allowed to open and take the trade away, they could not afford to close at the hours arranged.  All this led to the trouble that we had in 1924 and 1925, and that is why the Act was passed.  That was why the House in its wisdom and good sense passed what the Minister for Industry and Commerce now calls a rotten Bill. I am glad all the Ministers have not the same opinion of that Act as the Minister for Industry and Commerce. If the Bill has succeeded in creating a cleavage in the Cabinet, it will at least have done something of importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was one thing that the Minister for Industry and Commerce seemed to emphasise, and that is that the mere fact the shops were not open would tend to indicate that there was not a demand for their goods.  That might provide a sound argument why shops should be allowed to open on Sunday morning. I am quite sure that a number of shops would do a good trade if they were allowed to open on Sunday morning.  Perhaps the Minister might give some indication that all shops should be allowed to open at any time they wished.  I agree with the Minister for Local Government that there ought to be some regulation in this matter.  Deputy Lemass will understand that, so far as I am concerned, the matter is not under my control, and therefore I can make no promise.  I can only repeat <Col N="2272" /> that so far as the principle of his amendment is concerned, I am in agreement with it.  I am in thorough agreement with the proposal of an inquiry with a view to having permanent legislation suited to 1930. As to the means by which that inquiry would be instituted, that could be settled afterwards.</P>
    <P>On the point as to what amendments could be introduced in connection with this measure, that is a matter I would have to consult the Chair upon&mdash;whether any amendments could be permitted of the nature suggested; that is, a change in the hours set out in the original Act.  Generally speaking, I would be disinclined to have any patching of the existing measure.  I think the fact that there is certain dissatisfaction with it is an advantage rather than otherwise, inasmuch as it would be a spur to go ahead with permanent legislation.  Deputy Byrne told us about people on the verge of bankruptcy because of the operation of this Act.  I would like further proof than anything Deputy Byrne advances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not establish that if they had longer hours they would not be closed down. They might have closed down anyhow. I have no sympathy with people who will keep out of the Bankruptcy Court only by sweating their employees and over-working them.  Reference has been made to the inconvenience caused to the public.  I have heard no outcry with regard to the inconvenience caused by early closing.  I am not satisfied with the position in regard to shop hours.  I agree with the Minister for Local Government that the existing position is better than the position that would be created if this Act were allowed to drop on the 15th July.  While undoubtedly there are abuses in other trades it is not good argument to say that the advantage, small or large, that we <Col N="2273" /> have under this Act should be thrown away because we have not a similar state of conditions in other trades.  Let us deal with the other trades by all means but not by simply throwing the drapery trades people back into a position of confusion. I do not think there is anything in the argument put up by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that his proposed investigation would be prejudiced by the continuance of this measure.  Any inquiry he proposes to institute, and I hope it will be instituted immediately, can be carried on more satisfactorily if the present conditions are maintained than if we were thrown into the confusion and chaos that would undoubtedly exist if the Act is not continued.</P>

      <P>The Land Commission Estimates for the financial year 1930-31 show a nett increase of £88,605 on the preceding year.  I may say at once that £66,000 of this increase is in respect of operations under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Act, 1929, which is included in the Vote for the Land Commission, so far as expenses for grants and staff are concerned, provisions for loans under that Act by the Commissioners of Public Works being made in the Estimates for Local Loans. It will thus be seen that the nett increase for the Land Commission proper is £22,605.  But of this £14,470 is accounted for by a reduction in the Appropriations-in-Aid, so that the actual nett increase in the items of positive expenditure on the service of the Land Commission is only £8,135.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall deal with the various sub-heads of the Estimate seriatim, but as in introducing last year's Estimates I went fully into the scope of <Col N="2277" /> each, and Deputies are doubtless familiar with their implications, it is hardly necessary again to go into lengthy explanations of the standard items.  Under sub-head A&mdash; salaries, wages and allowances&mdash; there is a decrease of £1,130, due to slight variations in the staff.  Each year there are necessarily some changes due to retirements, deaths and promotions of officials, but the number of the staff and the amount of estimate under this sub-head are practically the same as for the previous year, and do not call for special comment.  Under sub-head B&mdash;travelling expenses&mdash;there is no change, as the amount of £32,000 has been found adequate for the outdoor staff employed.  Under sub-head C&mdash;incidental expenses&mdash;there is an increase of £80, due to increased payments to chainmen, etc., for lockspitting lands and turbary. Under sub-head D&mdash;office of the Public Trustee&mdash;the slight increase is due to normal salary increments for the clerical staff.</P>
    <P>Under sub-heads E and F combined&mdash;solicitor's branch and incidental expenses connected therewith &mdash;there is a decrease of £85, due to minor staff changes.  Grants under the new Gaeltacht Housing Act are introduced under sub-head G1&mdash;and out of a total estimate of £60,000, £57,000 is allocated for dwelling houses, the balance being for poultry houses and piggeries.  Salaries and travelling and subsistence allowances for the Gaeltacht Housing Act staff are introduced under sub-heads G2 and G3&mdash;and together add £6,000 to the Estimate.  In view of the extent and importance of the operations arising out of this Act, I am sure Deputies will agree that this is a very reasonable amount for staffing.</P>
    <P>The Housing (Gaeltacht) Act provides for the making of grants up to a maximum of £80 for the erection of new dwelling houses, and up to a maximum of £40 for the repair of dwelling houses.  With a view to improving the economic conditions of the Gaeltacht the Act also provides for the making of grants up to a maximum of £5 for new poultry <Col N="2278" /> houses and piggeries, and up to £2 10s. for improvement.  In cases where the maximum grant is considered insufficient a loan which must not exceed the amount of the grant may also be given.  The Act stipulates that preference must be given to families who habitually speak the Irish language, and amongst these a preference must also be given where the greatest overcrowding and worst sanitary conditions prevail.  The total amount to be made available under the Act is £250,000 and of this three-fifths are to be spent in districts where the average Poor Law Valuation (excluding valuations over £20) is £1 1s. or less.  Up to date almost 9,000 applications have been received. Four inspectors have been appointed and have been engaged examining the applications, so that, as far as possible, the most urgent and deserving cases should be the first to receive attention.</P>
    <P>The inspectors will be sent to the country within the next few days to begin their local investigations, and although many of the applicants will, I am afraid, be disappointed, I hope that as a result of the operation of the Act a very considerable number of those who are now badly housed will find their conditions much improved, and these, after all, are the people for whose benefit the Act was passed.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head H&mdash;contributions for excess stock, &amp;c.&mdash;the charge is fixed at £134,500 annually.  Under sub-head I&mdash;payment under Section 11 (7) of the Land Act, 1923&mdash;there is the considerable increase of £9,100 following on the larger amount of Land Bonds advanced for State contribution to the standard price and for cost funds.  The increase under this sub-head reflects the expenditure in vesting tenanted land.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head J we come to the important question of the improvements of estates, &amp;c.  In view of the widespread national benefit of this expenditure, Deputies of all parties will doubtless be glad to see an increase of £4,640 appearing under this section.  As I explained in the <Col N="2279" /> recent debate on the Supplementary Estimate for improvement expenditure in respect of the year 1929-30, the original improvement estimate for that year was £161,650, and the supplementary addition of £45,010 made a total under this sub-head of £206,660.  But from this has to be deducted a sum of £13,000, representing an administrative saving on other sub-heads of the Land Commission Vote applied to improvements, making a nett total of £193,660 for the year 1929-30.  Thus the estimate for an expenditure during the coming year of £211,300 for improvement of estates, etc., represents really an increase of £17,640 under this sub-head.  I think Deputies quite understand that it is necessary for the Land Commission to expend money on the improvement and rearrangement of holdings sold or being sold under the various Land Acts and on the equipment of untenanted land acquired, and divided with houses, fences, roads, drains, etc., and that a considerable portion of this expenditure is ultimately recovered by way of land purchase annuities charged on the lands, so I need not repeat what I have elaborated on previous occasions in this regard.  I may point out, however, that the Estimate of £211,300 includes £11,300 in respect of such items as purchase of tenancies on the Congested Districts Board estates (£10,000), workmen's compensation (£1,200), and nurses' cottages in congested districts counties (£100), leaving a sum of £200,000 for improvement works.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head K&mdash;advances to meet deficiency of income from untenanted land purchased under the Land Acts, 1923-29&mdash;there appears an increase of £3,000, but this was one of the sub-heads on which a saving was made during the present year and applied to estate improvements.  The original Estimate for the year 1929-30 was £13,000, which was subsequently reduced to £9,000.  Though the area of untenanted land acquired has increased, there has in recent years <Col N="2280" /> been an improvement in the income received from lands held pending division, and the Estimate of £12,000 should be sufficient to cover temporary deficiencies in income arising from the difference between gale days and dividend days, etc.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head L&mdash;moneys required for the purposes of Sections 42 and 46 of the Land Act, 1927, to pay interest at 4¾ per cent. on the capital deficiencies arising on the resale of lands in Land Bank Estates and Committee cases there appears a decrease of £8,000, but this was also a sub-head on which a saving was made during the present year and applied to estate improvements. The original Estimate for the year 1929-30 was £38,000, which was subsequently reduced to £29,000.  The reduced Estimate of £21,000 for the coming year is mainly due to the dissolution of most of the co-operative farming societies and the resulting decrease in the charge for arrears of instalments of annuities. The sum of £21,000 comprises £7,000 for Section 42 (Committee) cases, and £14,000 for Section 46 (Land Bank Estates).</P>
    <P>The sums estimated for in the remaining sub-heads are comparatively trifling.  The charge for telegraphs and telephones (sub-head M) remains the same.  Under sub-head N&mdash;which covers the difference between the face value and the market price of Land Bonds sold for redemption of Government charges on lands acquired by the Land Commission under the 1923 Act&mdash;there is an increase of £500, intended to provide for claims against the purchase moneys of resumed holdings, for arrears of payment in lieu of rent, and other contingencies.  The sum of £100 again provided under sub-head O to cover loss on unoccupied holdings is practically a token figure.</P>
    <P>With regard to appropriations-in-aid, the decrease of £14,470 is mainly due to the expectation of a smaller receipt in respect of the &ldquo;excess annuities&rdquo; payable on holdings situate on estates purchased by the Estates Commissioners and the Congested Districts Board resold since <Col N="2281" /> the passing of the Land Act, 1923, at enhanced prices due to expenditure on improvements.  The Estimate under this sub-head for the year 1929-30 included accumulations of previous years.</P>
    <P>I think that covers all I need say on the financial side of the Estimate. As regards the general work of the Land Commission, satisfactory progress has been made during the past year, and I have every reason to expect a continued advance during the coming year.  The following round figures indicate the present position of land purchase.</P>
    <P>As regards untenanted land (including holdings acquired by resumption or exchange and Land Bank and Committee lands), over 340,000 acres have been acquired by the Land Commission under the Land Acts, 1923-9, and offers have been made or the lands gazetted in respect of a further area of nearly 150,000 acres, making a total of nearly half a million acres of untenanted land acquired or in definite process of acquisition.  That represents roughly about half of the estimated total available area of untenanted land in the Saorstát suitable for division under the Land Acts, 1923-9.  Considering that the Land Commission were not in a position to begin the practical acquisition of untenanted land under the 1923 Act until the year 1925 owing to the preliminary difficulties to be overcome, I think that represents a very remarkable achievement for six years' work with the staff available. The alleged dilatoriness of the Land Commission has recently become quite a popular catch-cry, but those who are so ready to criticise have really no conception of the enormous amount of survey, inspection, administrative, clerical and legal work involved in the purchase, improvement and resettlement of half a million acres of untenanted land.  The relief of congestion is a tremendously difficult problem, and in no other country has it been treated with so much courage, skill, energy and success as in Saorstát Eireann. In this connection, the provision of additional land by means of reclamation <Col N="2282" /> schemes is now engaging the earnest attention of the Land Commission, in view of the success attending the early experimental efforts in this direction, and it is hoped during the coming year to undertake fresh schemes of reclamation in addition to the development of those already instituted.</P>
    <P>In addition to the extension of the area of arable land so badly needed in the congested districts, these reclamation schemes provide employment for a considerable number of persons during the winter months and are becoming a factor of great economic importance to the tenantry concerned.  The reclamation work includes the rearrangement of commonages (often necessitating a great deal of tact and patience on the part of the Land Commission inspectors), drainage, fencing, planting, tracing with lime and making approach roads, as well as the erection of necessary buildings.  The principal reclamation schemes in progress are, in County Galway, the Cloosh, Oorid and Maam Valley schemes; in County Mayo, the Ballycroy and Erris schemes, and in County Donegal, the Rosses scheme, and reclamation work in other districts is in contemplation.</P>
    <P>Of the 340,000 acres of untenanted land actually acquired by the Land Commission under the Land Acts 1923-9, over 250,000 acres have been already divided among some 12,200 allottees.  As I stated in the Debate on the Supplementary Estimate last February almost the entire allotments during the past year have been made on purchase agreements and not as in previous years on temporary convenience lettings which would subsequently have to be converted into allotments on purchase agreements before they could be vested in the allottees in fee simple.  As the time and difficulty in putting an allottee into permanent and legal possession of his parcel of land is much greater than putting in an allottee on a temporary basis, it is excellent work on the part of the Land Commission staff to have divided some 50,000 acres of untenanted land on <Col N="2283" /> purchase agreements during the past year.  This is quite apart from the division of untenanted land on Congested Districts Board Estates, the returns for which are not yet available, as they are kept on a different system.  The addition of the untenanted land divided by the Land Commission since 1923 on estates which had been purchased by the congested Districts Board and the Estates Commissioners would bring the total area of untenanted land divided since 1923 to well over 400,000 acres&mdash;a very creditable record.</P>
    <P>From the financial point of view the Land Bank Estates have now been practically disposed of, 41 of the Co-operative Farming Societies having been dissolved while the remaining 7 will be dissolved very shortly.  The total capital liability under Section 46 (b) of the Land Act, 1927, in respect of the 48 societies amounts to approximately £346,335, of which the State liability will be approximately £167,252 (or 48 per cent,. of the total).  The future continuing charges on the Land Commission Vote will therefore be 4¾ per cent. on £167,252 equivalent to £7,945 per annum.  For the year 1930-31, in addition to this annual charge on the capital liability assumed by the State, there is a charge under Section 46 (a) of the Land Act, 1927, for arrears of annuities in the 7 cases not yet dissolved, amounting approximately to £6,065.  This explains why the amount for Land Bank cases under sub-head L of the Land Commission Estimate for the year 1930-31 is put down at £14,000.  In future years it will be reduced to £8,000.</P>
    <P>The winding up of the Land Bank estates has proved to be a very difficult undertaking, involving a detailed examination not only of the lands and their ownership but of the security for deposits and their allocation, as well as an investigation of the previous financial arrangements of the societies and the recovery of moneys due to them.  As regards the resale of these lands, 26 estates, <Col N="2284" /> comprising a total area of 6,239 acres, have been already resold to purchasers for a total price of £94,737, and arrangements are well advanced for the resale of the remainder. Good progress has also been made in dealing with the &ldquo;Committee Cases.&rdquo;  In 70 cases, comprising a total area of 20,843 acres, the lands have been vested in the Land Commission for a total price of £377,492, of which the liability undertaken by the State represents £127,560 (or 34 per cent. of the total).  For the year 1930-31 the charge on the Land Commission Vote in respect of interest at 4¾ per cent. on the latter amount will be £6,059 (to which has to be added £396 in respect of the transfer of liability from the annuity payers. to the State in a Section 38 case); so that the amount of £7,000 estimated for allows for interest in respect of the State liability for further advances to be made during the first half of the year.</P>
    <P>As regards tenanted land under the Land Acts, 1923-9, 11,346 holdings, comprising a total area of 432,000 acres and representing a total price of £3,882,000, have been vested in the Land Commission (of which 4,567 holdings, comprising an area of 165,500 acres, were vested during the past year, showing a continued increase in the rate of vesting). In addition, nearly 16,000 holdings, comprising a total area of 540,000 acres, have been provisionally gazetted preparatory to vesting, and will be vested as soon as objections to Provisional Lists have been disposed of and outstanding matters, such as the provision of turbary, drains and embankments, retention and rearrangement of holdings, &amp;c., have been settled.  Every effort is being made to simplify procedure so far as is consistent with legal requirements, and to organise the available staff so as to secure the maximum output and avoid any unnecessary delay, and I hope that each year in future will show a cumulative increase in the rate of vesting. It is too soon yet to recap much benefit from the provisions of the amending Act of 1929, but their <Col N="2285" /> effect should be felt during the coming year.</P>
    <P>Steps are also being taken to allocate and deal with estates on a county basis in future, and this system will allow more co-ordination between the outdoor and indoor staff in regard to local conditions, and will enable cognisance to be taken of counties which are backward as regards unvested holdings. In dealing with estates of tenanted land under the Land Acts, 1923-9, the work of the Land Commission had necessarily, up to the present, to follow the order of the lodgment of maps and schedules of particulars by owners over the whole twenty-six counties of the Saorstát, as there was no means of regulating this, and the earlier lodgments were first taken up.</P>
    <P>As regards the completion by the Land Commission of proceedings which had been initiated under the Land Acts of 1903 and 1909 but not completed at the date of transfer, the Land Commission has, since 1923, in respect of direct sales between landlord and tenant, vested a total area of over 438,000 acres in 14,400 purchasing tenants, involving advances amounting to over £3,600,000, and in respect of the resale of estates which had been purchased by the Estates Commissioners and the Congested Districts Board vested a total area of 836,000 acres in 26,700 purchasers on resale for a total resale price of £4,875,000.  The direct sales between landlord and tenant under these Acts have been practically completed and, as I stated during the recent debate on the Supplementary Estimate, special attention is being paid to the question of completing as soon as possible the resale of estates purchased by the Estates Commissioners and the Congested Districts Board.  Steps are also being taken towards the vesting in fee simple in the allottees of the parcels of untenanted land divided under the Land Acts, 1923-9, but this will necessarily occupy some time. To sum up, vesting operations as apart from the division of untenanted land, the Land Commission has vested since 1923 under the <Col N="2286" /> various Land Acts a total area of some 1,706,000 acres representing over 52,000 purchasers for a total purchase price of £12,357,000.  The area invested during the past year was 310,000 acres for a total purchase price of £2,193,000, representing 10,000 purchasers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to raise this question under Standing Order 27, as the matter is one of urgent public importance.  This question has been raised on two occasions since July, 1929.  At that time several fishermen of Donegal who obtained licences from the Moville Board of Conservators, a Board appointed under the Executive Council of the Free State, were maltreated by agents of a body known as the Foyle and Bann Fishery Company.  On the 20th July their nets were seized.  The question was then raised, and, so far as I remember, the Minister for External <Col N="2287" /> Affairs replied that the attention of the Government had been drawn to the matter, that action was being taken, but that he was not in a position to make a statement to the House.  That was in July, 1929.  The matter was raised at a meeting two days ago of the Moville Board of Conservators.  They state that they are of the opinion that the passing of resolutions is useless any more, and that unless the Executive Council take steps to protect their rights, in so far as the fishing on the waters of the Foyle is concerned, they will take the matter into their own hands. They further state that force was used against them by the agents of the company, who are not citizens of this State, and who got no authority from the Saorstát courts. They further state that if the Government do not come to their assistance and protect them, they will meet force by force.  I do not intend do dwell at much length on this matter, beyond saying that, as a representative of the people of Donegal, I agree with the resolution, and I desire to state definitely in this House that if the Minister in his reply to-night does not state definitely that he is going to give protection to those people, and if he is of the opinion that force will not be used, I will take damn good care to see that force will be used, and I will take care to be there, even if nobody else is there.</P>

      <P>This matter has been raised so often in this House that the details which led up to the dispute have been regarded as somewhat ancient history.  I do not, therefore, intend to go into them, but, as Deputy Blaney pointed out, when I spoke in July last in this House in regard to the matter Mr. McGilligan stated that action was being taken but that he was not in a position to make a statement to the House.  A period of ten months has elapsed since the Minister for External Affairs made that reply, and we want to know what steps he has taken in order to safeguard the interests of the Foyle fishermen and of <Col N="2288" /> the Moville Board of Conservators. At a meeting of the Board of Conservators yesterday the following resolution was passed:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That in view of the unsatisfactory state of affairs existing regarding the territorial aspect of the waters of Lough Foyle appurtenant to Saorstát Eireann, this Board discuss and consider the question of the Board's position in regard to the supervision of these waters as the position at present is very unsatisfactory, owing to the action of certain persons (non-resident of An Saorstát) adopting the role of bailiffs without the permission of this Board, and in every way flouting our authority as the Board of Conservators charged with the responsibility of exercising supervision over these waters.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Speaking to the resolution, the mover of it said that though he put down the notice of motion he felt inclined to say at the outset that the time for debate had passed and that they must resort to some other course than the adoption of resolutions or the making of representations and protests to bring the Government to a sense of its responsibilities in a matter which was of vital importance to citizens of the Free State in that area.  He said further:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We are not going any longer to sit tamely looking on at the invasion of Free State territory and the denial of our rights.  If necessary, force will be met by force.  We should here and now issue a warning that if energetic steps are not taken forthwith by the Government of the Free State to protect our fishermen that obligation will devolve upon themselves. They will not shirk the obligation, and in discharge of it will be justified in taking all the means within their power, let the consequences of the conflict be what they may.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lest some Deputies may think that the Board of Conservators are an irresponsible body, I would like <Col N="2289" /> to assure them that that is not the case.  In seconding the resolution, Very Rev. Canon McCafferty, as reported in the Press, said that, the Government having set up the Board with certain powers, it was their duty to see that their rights were respected, not only by the natives of the place but by outsiders. He further said that they had not done so, and that inquiries and questions in the Dáil were always met with the remark that the whole subject was under consideration.  With regard to the question of a several fishery existing on the Lough, he said that if the Foyle and Bann Company obtained a decree in the only court in which they had a right to obtain such, namely, the Free State court, well and good, but until such time as the question was settled in the Free State courts he held that it was the Government's duty to protect the fishermen in their occupation.</P>
    <P>This matter, as I have said, has been raised here repeatedly, and the Minister stated that the whole question was having attention.  So far as we here and the people of Donegal know, nothing has been done by the Government.  A sinister silence prevails in regard to the whole matter. The Government have thrown a cloak of secrecy over the negotiations, and have adopted a hush-hush policy in regard to the matter.  The same sinister silence prevailed before the Boundary Commission made the report which sacrificed six counties.  We would like to know whether the same silence now is the forerunner of a betrayal similar to that which the people in that area experienced over the boundary question.  As pointed out by Deputy Blaney, something has to be done at once, as the fishing will start shortly.  If these men come in and interfere, as they did before, and come with arms, there is going to be a conflict.  That is why we warn the House now that if any conflict arises it will be brought about by the inactivity or inaction of the Government, or by the silence which has prevailed up to the present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarney" hpid="Mr. Carney Mr. Carney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter of the Foyle fisheries was raised in this House previously owing to certain action taken by the Foyle and Bann Company as lessees from the Irish Society.  Three motor launches came into Lough Foyle on the 25th June last on board of which were fishermen from Doagh, Moville and elsewhere who held licences under the Moville Board of Conservators, who had their mandate from the Minister for Fisheries of the Free State.  They were prevented from fishing inside what is called the several fishery that was supposed to belong to the Foyle and Bann Company.  Two questions were involved.  One, the question of the territorial waters of the Free State.  According to the Free State law, even if the Free State were positive that they owned the territorial waters, these people to whom I refer were supposed to own the several fishery on Lough Foyle.  The question of the several fishery is absolutely separate from the question of territorial waters. Everybody realises that, but everybody realises also that these several fisheries exist merely on so-called charters.  In this case the charter was granted by King Charles II., and no one knows whether such charters are good, bad or indifferent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As happened in the case of the Erne, the fishermen appealed to the courts, where they fought the question out and were told that unless the Free State took action to disprove the title of these people the fishermen were not entitled, even as private citizens, to sue in the courts to upset that charter or so-called charters held by people for several fisheries around there.  There is a several fishery, as I have said, existing on the Foyle.  At the same time, the people of this State are supposed to own the territorial waters and, even if it were held, which I am not admitting, that the Foyle and Bann Company owned the several fisheries on the Foyle, the Foyle and Bann Company committed an illegal act when they seized the nets in a boat which was merely sailing over the waters of the Foyle and in which were fishermen with licences issued <Col N="2291" /> by the Moville Board of Conservators, for which they paid £3.  It was an illegal act to seize the nets according to the Free State law, or even according to the law of the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>We appealed to the Minister in regard to the matter and my colleague, Deputy Blaney, has quoted his reply.  The matter was brought up under the same Standing Order (27) by Deputy de Valera on the 31st July, 1929.  Deputy Blaney, under the same Standing Order, has brought the question up here to-night and has thrown down the gauntlet.  He has stated that if the Executive Council of the Free State do not take action to safeguard their own citizens we are going to take action definitely against anybody, whether from inside or outside the Free State, who interferes with their rights.  As I say, my colleague has thrown down the gauntlet, and the fishermen of Donegal, from Doagh to Innishowen, will meet force with force.  My colleague and I will be there personally and if we are put in jail we will ensure that there will be somebody else ready to cast down the gauntlet to anybody from the Six Counties or the Free State.  The Minister for External Affairs seems to have nothing to do but to get his photograph taken signing treaties with Germany and other countries. There is, however, plenty of work for him to do at home, and if he does not do it, we are going to do it.</P>

      <P>I should like to say right at the beginning that nothing is going to lead to a conflict in that area, with all the deplorable consequences which might follow, more than the ignorance prevailing about this matter and which has been steadily spread by people like Deputy Blaney and Deputy Cassidy. Deputy Carney says, what I am sure Deputy Blaney knows, and what certainly Deputy Cassidy knows, that there is no question of territorial waters involved in this whatsover. What is involved is not a right to waters, but a right to fishing&mdash;that <Col N="2292" /> and that only.  Two sets of people are in conflict with regard to that. There is only one way to get that decided, and that is not by any mock heroics about being on the spot.</P>

We are used to scurrility from him.  It seems impossible under the Standing Orders to make him behave like anything else but a cad, but I think that when he indulges in these remarks <Col N="2293" /> the attention of the Chair should be drawn to it.</P>

      <P>One cannot get any indication beyond the mock heroics being performed by these people.  This debate will have to be conducted as a debate, or else not proceeded with.  If Deputies want an answer, they will get it.  If they want to obstruct and do not want to listen, then they will continue as they are going on.  This is a dispute with regard to a right to fishing. As to the foolish comments made by the mover of the resolution quoted at length by Deputy Cassidy, I do not think one of them has anything to do with the case under consideration.  &ldquo;The unsatisfactory state of affairs existing regarding the territorial aspect of the waters of Lough Foyle appurtenant to Saorstát Eireann,&rdquo; does not arise.  If the waters were absolutely and clearly established as our waters, it has nothing to do with the question as to whether the Foyle and Bann Fishery people, being the lessees of the Irish Society, have a right to take fish from Lough Foyle, any more than if it were a matter of taking fish from a river clearly inside the Free State, and an Englishman had leased the fishery in a proper way and brought in Scotch and English <Col N="2294" /> servants in order to help him to preserve the fishery there.  This talk, therefore, about the action of certain persons non-resident in the Saorstát is again so much verbiage and has nothing to do with the case.</P>
      <P>Let there be a right to a fishery established and these non-residents of the Sairstát will be protected by our courts, functioning under our law, in upholding their legal rights. &ldquo;Flouting our authority as the Board of Conservators charged with the responsibility of exercising supervision over these waters.&rdquo; Although there was raised here today a question of a licence, what has the licence to do with it?  A man pays £3 and gets a licence to take fish out of waters that are in the ownership of other people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The fact that a man is a citizen of the Saorstát, or that he is not a citizen has not anything to do with his right to fish in Lough Foyle at present.  The only thing that determines the right is: who owns the right to take fish from Lough Foyle?  If a man pays £3 to the Board of Conservators, what does that entitle him to?  To fish in waters if the waters are not privately owned.  If the right to take fish is not a private right, the right of private property, then he can take fish in the area under the control of the Board of Conservators. I think the Deputy himself will admit that there is no insinuation that because a man pays a £3 licence he is entitled to fish over the whole area that is under the control of a Board of Conservators, whether the water be preserved or not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilBlanel" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <P>There are two things.  The action should be tried out in court.  As to the other point, it is not really for me to interfere in this case.  It is a matter which comes under various Acts of ours, the Larceny and the Fishery Acts, as to the protection which a man may give himself if he finds his property being encroached upon.  Whether they have a right to use force is a question also to be tried out in court. It is not so clear as the Deputy seems to imagine.  With regard to the special point of the necessity for taking action, we hold that action should be taken in our courts.  We hold that there is a prima facie case established by long usage over many years in favour of the Irish Society and their lessees, the Foyle and Bann Fishery Company, but that that presumption is fast disappearing. There was a presumption, but that is fast disappearing owing to the unaccountable reluctance of the Irish Society, or their lessees, to come into our courts, and if that continues much longer the presumption will have disappeared.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The League of Nations will certainly never adjudicate in a conflict of fishermen with regard to the right to fish in a certain area.  The question of territorial waters does not arise in this case.  I have been asked questions, always on the matter of the territorial waters.  We have taken up the matter of the territorial waters time and again, and we shall continue to take it up.  Even the matter of the right to get fish in that area we have also brought before the notice of the people concerned with a view to getting that issue decided in our courts, but it has not been done.  We <Col N="2297" /> are not a litigant in this.  There are two conflicting parties, and it is for them to take legal action with regard to the rights being decided.  Either party can do it.  But the case is not going to be improved, in fact whatever presumption there is on the side of the Irish Society, or their lessees, which, as I say, has been weakened by the fact that they did not come into the courts, will again arise if the people, on the other hand, who are asserting now a right which they never asserted prior to 1922, proceed to try and assert that by methods of violence.  Whatever presumption there may be coming to the surface in their favour, will certainly be destroyed by any resort to force, and that is where Deputy Blaney, Deputy Carney and Deputy Cassidy make the situation worse than it was.</P>
