      <P>Since the Dáil last met we have lost the services of one of the oldest members of the House by the death of Deputy Bryan Cooper.  No Deputy was more assiduous in his attention to the work of the Dáil, and his contributions to our debates were marked by careful thought and unfailing courtesy.  Until Deputy Cooper's health failed he was an active and zealous member of the various Committees of the House, and his labours on the Public Accounts Committee in particular were of the greatest value.  Might I ask you, sir, to convey to Mrs. Cooper and her family an expression of the sympathy of the Dáil on their bereavement?</P>

      <P>I wish to refer to a matter of urgent importance, of which the Chair has already had notice.  I desire to ask if the Government has any statement to make with regard to their interference in the situation that has now arisen in Dublin because of the strike at the North Wall, where 150 men have gone out?  The work in which they were engaged is now stopped at the port.  I would like to mention also that the railway men will shortly be out.  I would like to know if the President thinks it is now time to interfere in order to bring about a settlement of the dispute.</P>

      <P>If the Bills are not circulated sooner where is the sense of introducing them now?  Surely it would be more advisable to have them circulated immediately so that Deputies can take advantage of the very long vacation to study the details of each measure.  This is particularly important in the case of the Betting Bill, which arises out of the Report of a Special Committee. The gentlemen engaged in the betting business are anxious to have a discussion on the different clauses of the Bill.  I think it is only fair that Deputies should have all these Bills in their possession in order that they may study them carefully.  Can the Minister give us any definite idea when they will be circulated?  I think it is ridiculous introducing the Bills now if they are not to be circulated in a very short time.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 19.  Before sub-section (5) a new sub-section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(5)  An agreed adjustment may provide for the payment by the City Corporation to the County Council in one or more instalments <Col N="1319" /> or by way of annuity of a sum in respect of the loss of benefit which will be occasioned to the inhabitants of the County as a consequence of the extension of the boundaries of the City by this Act in the case of any benefit which is limited by a restriction on the amount in the pound of the rate which can be raised for the provision of such benefit and the following provisions shall have effect in regard to every sum the payment of which is provided for under this sub-section, that is to say&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  every payment received by the County Council in respect of any such sum shall be applied towards the provision of the benefit in respect of which it is paid, and</P>

    <P>Normally the increase in burden because of a change in area arises from an increase in rates.  The present amendment is intended to secure that in such a case as a technical instruction committee or a library scheme where there is a limit to the rates that can be raised there shall not be a reduction in services arising in any particular area that would be equivalent to an increase of burden.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 34, sub-section (2).  Lines 26-36 inclusive deleted and the following words substituted there-for:&mdash;&ldquo;premises situate in the City or (until the appointed day) in an added urban district or (until the 1st day of April, 1931) in the added rural area and either</P>
      <P>(a) such premises are valued under the Valuation Acts at not less than twenty pounds and are occupied by such individual, partnership, unincorporated association, or corporate body wholly for the purpose of carrying on therein any business, profession, trade, manufacture, or other commercial or industrial pursuit, or</P>
      <P>(b)  such premises are occupied by such individual, partnership, unincorporated association, or corporate body partly for the purpose aforesaid and the proportion of the valuation under the Valuation Acts of such premises which is fairly attributable to the part thereof so occupied is not less than twenty pounds.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be remembered that in connection with the commercial franchise the basis of the commercial <Col N="1321" /> franchise in the Bill, as it left this House, was occupation of premises of not less value than £20, occupied wholly or partly for the purpose of carrying on commerce or trade or industry.  In the discussion of the matter in the Seanad a question arose as to whether a person residing in a house of £25 valuation, and using one of the rooms in the house for, say, dressmaking purposes, would be entitled to be put on the commercial register.  Arising out of a general consideration of the matter, it was clear that we had to make the basis of the franchise, for the commercial register, firm.  The present amendment proposes that the basis of the commercial franchise shall be occupation of premises of not less value than £20 and the carrying on of a business, profession or trade therein, whether the premises are wholly occupied or whether these premises of the value of £20 are simply part of another premises.  The basis of the franchise would, under this amendment, be the occupation of premises whether they were wholly or separately rated premises or whether they were simply part of another premises, and the carrying on, in that premises, the valuation of which is not less than £20, of the particular trade or industry referred to here. It makes the valuation basis of the franchise firmer and it enables the widest possible discretion to be given to the deciding officer as to what trade or profession is to come in under this franchise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We, on this side of the House, are quite definite and clear in our own minds that no amendment that the Minister would propose could in any way improve or make more acceptable the ambitious and vicious principle in this section of the Bill as originally drafted.  But I should like to be clear what is the exact purpose of the amendment for which the Minister was responsible in the Seanad and which he is now putting before the House.  It seems to me that one of the effects of it will be to prevent, or make it rather more difficult for <Col N="1322" /> those occupying the more lowly valued premises getting on this commercial register.  The Minister has quoted the example of a dressmaker inhabiting a house of the valuation of £25.  I think he had admitted that, if the section went through as it originally stood, she by the fact of that occupation would be entitled to go on that commercial register, but that the effect of this amendment will be that if she only occupies, say, one room out of six, that that room will be assessed on the total valuation of the premises at, say, £4 or £5 and that consequently she will not be entitled to get on the commercial register.  We would like to be clear on that before we discuss the matter further.  I am not sure, if that is the intention of the Minister, that this amendment will fulfil it.</P>
      <P>I do not see any provision in this amendment limiting or defining, in any way, the portion of the premises in respect of which the qualification may be secured.  If you take the case of a person, or society, or body, or partnership, or corporation, occupying anything like, say, five or six rooms and that each of these rooms is occupied partly for the carrying on of business or a profession, trade, manufacture or other commercial or industrial pursuit, and at the same time for some propaganda or organisation work carried on by the organisation, I do not know what the position would be.  Suppose, for instance, you considered the case of an organisation of ex-servicemen occupying a building.  In some of the rooms of that building a certain process of manufacture might be carried on, say, the making of poppies.  At the same time in the same room there might be carried on relief work which possibly the organisation would have on hands.  In a case like that I would ask the Minister to tell the House whether, by virtue of this amendment, that organisation would be entitled to go on the commercial register and, if so, in respect of what particular room?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister seemed to indicate <Col N="1323" /> that he visualised the amendment operating in respect of one or two rooms or a number of rooms in a building, which rooms are definitely set apart for the carrying on of some sort of manufacture or profession or industrial pursuit, whereas so far as I can see from the amendment it contemplates nothing of the sort.  It makes no segregation or delimitation of the area in which these pursuits are to be carried on.  Industrial and commercial pursuits may be carried on in the same room.  That room may have a total valuation of £50, and in that room there may be carried on propaganda work which could not be described as an industrial or commercial pursuit.  I would like the Minister to tell the House whether the occupier of that room would go on the commercial register.  The amendment seems to be drafted in such a way that it opens up endless loopholes for discussion and equivocation on the part of claimants to the commercial register and on the part of the registration officer.  He is not bound in any way.  It gives him a discretion which I think will be open to grave abuse in the circumstances in which this particular privileged franchise has been introduced to the local government legislation in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Anything that I said about a room being used for a particular purpose was repeating the sort of suggestion that was made as to things that might occur in the Bill, as drafted, when it reached the Seanad.  A person under this amendment can get on the commercial register if he can substantiate a claim that he is occupying premises for the purpose of carrying on therein any business, profession, trade, manufacture, or other commercial or industrial pursuit.  If these premises, whether they are premises separately rated under the Valuation Acts or whether they are simply part of premises so rated, are rateable to the extent of not less than £20, and if the whole premises are occupied and <Col N="1324" /> the valuation lists show them to be of a valuation of less than £20, the position is clear from the valuation point of view.  If a person claims that he is carrying on in part of a premises a particular class of business and he claims that part of the premises in which he is carrying on business is of not loss than £20 valuation, then the registration officer is called upon to verify, if necessary, if it is not prima facie clear, whether the premises in respect of the claim are of less than £20 valuation or not. In amendment 6 to the Electoral Bill, provision is made for the registration officer having these powers, but in so far as claims may arise on spurious grounds, whether these grounds may be those of valuation or the nature of the occupation carried on therein, the registration officer's machinery will be responsible, in so far as it can be made responsible, for seeing that spurious claims are not upheld.  Before they pass the registration officer, it is open to anyone examining the lists and feeling that a claim is being illegally made, to lodge objections and have them gone into in the usual way.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not dealt with the question as to whether, in effect, this is a narrowing of the register, and whether the effect of the amendment will be to reduce the number&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy understands that if originally the arrangement was that the occupation of part of a premises rated at £20 or over gave a person a right to be on the register, you are narrowing the electorate when you make the basis of registration such that a person must occupy premises for those purposes, the valuation of which is not less than £20.  There is a narrowing but a greater fixation of the basis of the franchise, so that while there may be left loopholes. about which the Deputy complains, for those who may wish to evade the law, many loopholes have been closed up by fixing, in a more satisfactory way, the valuation side of the qualification.</P>

      <P>While, as I said in the beginning, we feel satisfied that nothing could actually make this proposal acceptable to the Party on this side of the House we might have been inclined to tolerate the amendment if it actually widened the commercial register and allowed some of the less privileged sections of the community to enjoy this franchise. The Minister has clarified the position for us.  This amendment is designed <Col N="1326" /> to enhance the privilege which the original Bill conferred on the commercial electorate.  It is an intensification of the evil which the Bill contained when it came first before the House.  For that reason we must vote against the amendment which the Minister was responsible for introducing in the Seanad and for which he is responsible now in this House.</P>

In so far as premises are partly occupied, what is valued under the Valuation Acts is the whole premises, and in some other way there has to be decided what is the suitable proportion of the valuation that is applicable to the premises that are actually occupied for trade purposes.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 63, sub-section (4).  A new sub-section inserted before the sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 3 of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1926 (No. 18 of 1926), execution orders within the meaning of that Act in proceedings in the District Court for the recovery of moneys due in respect of the municipal rate shall, if the Court on the application of the person by whom such proceedings are brought so directs, be executed by such person.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the old Dublin Collection of Rates Act, there was power by which on the application of the rate collectors, when a case for non-payment of rates went before a justice, the justice could at his discretion give an enforcement order for the collection of rates to the collector to carry it out.  There was that power in respect of the municipal rate but not in respect of other rates.  We have amalgamated all the rates of the city and called it the new municipal rate.  In sub-section (3) of Section 63, the law for the time being in relation to the making, assessment, levying etc., of the poor rate is applicable to the new municipal rate.  Under these circumstances it would be no longer within the discretion of the justice to give an enforcement order to the collector.  The city authorities <Col N="1329" /> have represented that it cheapens very much the collection of rates and simplifies generally the procedure.  This amendment proposes to continue in the Dublin area the power by which, when a collector seeks an enforcement order from the courts for the collection of rates, an enforcement order at the discretion of the justice can be given to the collector.  Otherwise, it would be given to the Civic Guards for £5 or under, and it would be given to the under-sheriff if over that.</P>

      <P>I move: That the Committee agree with the Seanad in the following two amendments:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 65.  The following words added at the end of the section:&mdash;&ldquo;but such charges shall be collected and recovered as part of the municipal rate.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 66, sub-section (1).  After the word &ldquo;Corporation&rdquo; in line 16 the words &ldquo;and collected and recovered as part of the municipal rate&rdquo; inserted and after the word &ldquo;Corporation&rdquo; in line 18 the words &ldquo;and collected and recovered as part of the municipal rate&rdquo; added.</P>
      <P>The first of these amendments secures the position of the collection of the contract water rate, which is, technically, not a rate at all, but except we put in this amendment we will not secure the machinery for its collection.  The second amendment refers to the police rate, which is the only rate kept separate, for the reason that it is a vanishing rate. This amendment is necessary in order to secure that the police rate can be collected in the same way as the municipal rate.</P>

      <P>I move: That the Committee agree with the Seanad in the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 72, sub-section (2).  After <Col N="1330" /> the word &ldquo;City&rdquo; in line 19 the following words inserted: &ldquo;which is not a small dwelling within the meaning of the Local Government (Rates on Small Dwellings) Act, 1928 (No. 4 of 1928), and,&rdquo; and in lines 23 and 24 the words &ldquo;the Local Government (Rates on Small Dwellings) Act, 1928 (No. 4 of 1928)&rdquo; deleted and the words &ldquo;that Act&rdquo; substituted therefor.</P>
    <P>Under a local Act the Dublin Council had powers by which, in respect of houses suitable for occupation by artisans and actually occupied by them, provided that the rates were paid by a certain time, and provided they submitted to certain control in respect of the repairs and sanitary arrangements of the dwellings, they could give a remission of one-fifth of the rates.  The Rates on Small Dwellings Act gives power in respect of houses under a particular valuation which will now be £8 in the City of Dublin, by which, if the rates are paid before a particular day, the owner of these houses, not being an occupier, can get a reduction of one-tenth in his rates.  The amendment is intended to secure that the old power that the Corporation had will be retained by them, and that in dwellings generally, whether they would normally come under the Small Dwellings Act or not, under which, automatically in certain circumstances, they would get a reduction of one-tenth, the Council is given power to bring in under its previous powers any house that they consider is suitable for an artisan, is occupied by an artisan, and that comes under the control that they desire in respect of repairs and sanitary arrangements.  The Council has to consider the matter and to pass the necessary resolution by which the houses that come in under that control will get one-fifth remission of rates as against one-tenth remission of rates which all small dwellings get, whether they come in under the sanitary and repair control or not.</P>

      <P>New section.  Before Section 76 a new section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;76.&mdash; (1)  The Council, by resolution passed under this section and for the passing of which not less than two-thirds of the members of the Council shall have voted, may authorise the expenditure by the Corporation of moneys on the decoration of the City for occasions of public rejoicing or for other appropriate occasions.</P>
      <P>(2)  Every resolution passed under this section shall specify the occasion for which the decoration of the City wholly or partly at the expense of the Corporation is to be authorised by such resolution and the amount which is to be expended by the Corporation on such decoration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1332" /> (3)  Subject to the provisions of the next following sub-section the Corporation may expend moneys out of the Municipal Fund in accordance with and in so far as authorised by a resolution passed under this section but not otherwise.</P>
    <P>(4)  The aggregate amount of the expenditure of the Corporation for the purposes of this section in any local financial year shall not exceed a sum equivalent to a rate of one penny in the pound of the rateable valuation of the City.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The effect of this amendment is that where not less than two-thirds of the members of the Council decide that, because of a particular occasion of public rejoicing, or other such appropriate occasion, they desire the City to be decorated, they can specify a certain sum, not greater than the sum that would be raised by a penny rate, and expend it for that purpose.</P>

      <P>Section 101; sub-section (3).  To delete the sub-section.</P>
      <P>Section 101, sub-section (4). To delete the sub-section.</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 102 a new section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;102.&mdash;(1)  Where it appears to the Minister that any local, personal or private Act or any order <Col N="1335" /> relating to the existing City or to either of the added urban districts and in force at the passing of this Act contains provisions which are inconsistent with or rendered unnecessary by or adequately replaced by provisions made by or under this Act, the Minister may by order declare that such provisions of such Act or order shall not apply in or in relation to the City, and upon such order being made the provisions specified therein of such Act or order shall not apply in or in relation to the City.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where it appears to the Minister that any local, personal or private Act or any order relating to any of the coastal urban districts and in force at the passing of this Act contains provisions which are inconsistent with or rendered unnecessary by or adequately replaced by provisions made by or under this Act, the Minister may by order declare that such provisions of such Act or order shall not apply in or in relation to the Borough, and upon such order being made the provisions specified therein of such Act or order shall not apply in or in relation to the Borough.</P>
    <P>(3)  No order made under this section shall come into force unless and until it has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas and has been approved by resolution of each such House.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These amendments were inserted by the Seanad with a view to getting, in their opinion, more effective control over orders issued by Ministers for the purpose of implementing legislation.  These two sub-sections give the Minister power to adapt such Acts as exist to the new circumstances, and whether they are local Acts dealing with particular matters&mdash;for instance, a local Act dealing with a particular matter of the city, and another local Act dealing with some matter in one of the added urban districts&mdash;under these two sub-sections the Minister has power to issue an order extending <Col N="1336" /> to the whole city any one of these Acts that he considers most suitable for the city as a whole.  An order so issued will come into force immediately, but may be annulled within twenty-one sitting days by a vote either of the Dáil or the Seanad, and it would under those circumstances cease to exist, without prejudice to anything that had been done in the meantime.  The Seanad was of the opinion that where the issuing of such an order involved the repealing of any existing Act. whether it is a local or a general Act, or of any statutory order issued under such an Act, such repeal should not take place simply by a Ministerial order which had run the gauntlet of either House, sitting for twenty-one days, and it proposed that a Minister, having issued an order adapting to the city as a whole a private Act, or having issued a similar order with regard to the borough, that the order actually putting the new situation into force may come into effect right away. subject to running the gauntlet of both Houses for twenty-one days, but that a separate order must be issued in respect of any Act or order that as a consequence is to be repealed, and that there must be an explicit resolution passed by the Dáil and the Seanad before that order comes into force.</P>
    <P>To a certain extent this arises on the general question as to the way in which Ministers, in issuing such orders, can best be controlled.  From my own point of view I think there is no necessity for this amendment.  I told the Seanad that I would accept it as a contribution from them to our general experience of how this matter can best be dealt with.  I am asking the House to accept the amendment, which will mean that in certain circumstances the Minister must get a positive resolution from both Houses where an Act or an order is to be annulled.  I do not put it to the Dáil as a necessary or even a desirable type of thing, except that it will give us a certain amount of experience of working in this particular way.  From my point of view this is <Col N="1337" /> not a suitable occasion for discussing the whole matter of these orders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Professor O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the House should agree with all the amendments.  The bulk of the amendments are due to the fact that it was necessary to bring the Bill into harmony with the Greater Dublin Bill.  It was not possible to introduce the amendments at an earlier stage, because the views of the Seanad on that Bill had not been made clear.  There is, in addition, a proposal to include Bray amongst the scheduled urban districts, and that necessitates a rather long consequential amendment (No. 17).  I will deal with one or two of the other amendments when they arise.  I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 21, sub-section (2).  Two new sub-sections inserted before the sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) The Minister may from time to time by order require a vocational education committee to appoint a sub-committee to exercise and perform in relation to any part of the vocational educational area of such committee such specified powers, duties and functions of such committee as in the opinion of the Minister can be better or more conveniently exercised or performed by a sub-committee and whenever any such order is made and in force it shall be the duty of such committee to comply with the requirements thereof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3) The Minister may, as and <Col N="1343" /> when he thinks fit, revoke an order made by him under the foregoing sub-section, and thereupon such order shall cease to be in force.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The House may remember that a case was put up on behalf of two existing technical education committees, one of them rural and one urban&mdash;Tipperary, and the other Bray.  The case of Bray was met by separating the rural part of North Wicklow from Bray, and scheduling Bray as an urban district.  That could not be done in the case of Tipperary on account of the smaller size of the town, comparatively speaking, and this is an attempt to meet the claim of the Tipperary Committee. The Minister may insist on certain things&mdash;for instance, that in Tipperary, rural and urban, a sub-committee be appointed with definite powers.</P>
    <P>Question put, and agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in the following amendment:</P>
      <P>Section 27, sub-section (2). After the word &ldquo;officer&rdquo; wherever the same occurs the words &ldquo;or servant&rdquo; inserted.</P>
      <P>This amendment is in connection with the dismissal of employees of technical education committees by the Minister, so that servants, as well as officers, shall have applied to them the clause dealing with inquiries&mdash;clause 105, I think.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1344" /> Section 48, sub-section (4).  The sub-section deleted and a new sub-sections substituted therefor as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(4) No payments shall be made out of the vocational education fund of a vocational education committee except by the treasurer of such committee on the direction in writing of such committee, and every payment so directed shall be made out of such fund by such treasurer and every such direction by such committee to such treasurer shall be a sufficient authority to such treasurer to make the payments thereby directed to be made to the person or persons mentioned therein.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the Bill as it stood the clause, as worded, would practically necessitate that a bank should almost act as auditors for every account of a vocational education committee before it could pay out anything.  This amendment carries out the ordinary practice by which, on being presented with the Treasurer's note, the bank can pay out in the ordinary way.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in the following amendment:</P>
      <P>Section 53.  A new sub-section added at the end of the section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) In making such regulations <Col N="1345" /> regard may be had to (amongst other things) the following matters:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the annual local contribution payable to each vocational education committee,</P>
    <P>(b)  the amount of the rate required to raise such annual local contribution, and</P>
    <P>(c)  the population of the vocational education area of such committee.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The House will remember in dealing with the finances of the vocational education committees I indicated that so far as future development in that line was concerned: that is, having stabilised, so to speak, the present grants to existing committees, it was the intention on the whole, roughly speaking, to give a fifty-fifty contribution from the Government; that is, according to the amount put up by the rates a similar sum would be subscribed by the Government.  It was urged in the Seanad that that would be unfair to certain districts and that I had bound myself down rather too rigidly.  This is an amendment pointing out that certain things may be taken into consideration; that is, in some cases, a grant of more than 50 per cent. might be given and in other cases less.  I indicated, however, in the Seanad that it was not the intention in accepting the amendment to modify in any way the promise of fifty-fifty grants, so far as the country as a whole is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 96.  A new sub-section <Col N="1347" /> added at the end of the section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(4) All moneys raised by a rate struck by a local authority for the service of the year beginning on the 1st day of April, 1930, and which but for this Act would have been paid to a committee appointed or partly appointed by such local authority to exercise and perform functions, powers and duties transferred by this Part of this Act to a vocational education committee and would have been applicable by such first-mentioned committee to the purposes of such functions, powers and duties, shall (so far as such moneys are not paid to such committee before the appointed day) be paid by such local authority to the said vocational education committee.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The occasion of this amendment is the scheduling of Bray as an urban district under the Act, but it is of a general character.  It simply means that in some cases the moneys actually paid in and that are due to the committee are not paid over until the month of June.  As the Bill becomes operative on the 1st April, this is only a section to see that the moneys due are paid over.</P>

      <P>(a) the functions, powers and duties which, immediately before the appointed day, are exercised and performed through or by the North Wicklow committee shall, in so far as they relate to the urban district of Bray, be transferred by Section 95 of this Act to the Bray vocational education committee, and shall, in so far as they relate to any other part of the functional area of the North Wicklow committee, be transferred by the said Section 95 to the Wicklow county vocational education committee,</P>

      <P>The principal change is in the case of Bray.  A case was put up on behalf of Bray, and I also received a deputation from the Bray Technical Committee.  I pointed out to them that it was impossible to do quite what they wanted, namely, to make, a separate county practically for the purposes of this Bill of the district of North Wicklow&mdash;that that would practically mean a second Bill.  However, I was able to meet the committee in what was really the essential that they wanted, and they indicated to me that they were quite satisfied with the solution, namely, the scheduling of Bray as a separate urban district.</P>

      <P>I promised Deputy Briscoe that I would give him an opportunity to put a question, which he raised at the beginning, to the Minister for Industry and Commerce before the House rose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sent a copy of the question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The question is: To ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce what steps, if any, he is now prepared to take in connection with the dispute between the employees of the I.O.C. and the Company. Further, if he is aware that eleven men, members of the N.U.R. at Limerick, were dismissed for refusing to handle goods of the I.O.C. arising out of instructions from their organisation, and that last night two men at the North Wall were similarly dismissed, and that to-day the whole staff consisting of 150 men have gone on strike.  If he is further aware that the Irish headquarters of the N.U.R. have approved of this action and that the Irish Secretary to the N.U.R., who is at present in London has signified his intention, if necessary, of calling out all railway-men throughout the Free State, and that this Union controls eighty per cent. of the men engaged on railway-work in the Irish Free State.  To ask the Minister further if he is aware that such a strike will have serious consequences on all branches of industry and trade and will completely tie up all exports, and if he can make any statement as to his intentions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I took particular care in this question to try and get a statement from the Minister that would not tie him up in any way or commit him as to his opinion on the merits or the demerits of the parties concerned on either side.  I do not propose to delay the House by going into any details except to say that if the Minister will make a statement that he or his Department is prepared to arbitrate, or bring the parties together <Col N="1358" /> so as to prevent any further dislocation, he will be saving the country from what may be very serious results.  I need not point out, at the present time, that if this strike at the North Wall develops the whole of the shipping, inward and outward, would be shut down.  All the transport of the country will be dislocated if the men are not saved from going out on strike, which they will do, in view of the united attitude of the labour people on this particular matter, unless a satisfactory arrangement is arrived at.  In view of the fact that the Dáil will not meet again until November and that we are faced with this very serious situation I would like to hear any remarks that the Minister may wish to make.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to associate myself with Deputy Briscoe in his request that, at this juncture, the Minister should intervene.  The Minister has on other occasions, intervened with very good results.  On this occasion he should use all the resources of his Department to prevent this industrial trouble from spreading.  It may develop and have very serious consequences to the trade and commerce of this city.  For that reason, I join with Deputy Briscoe in asking the Minister to intervene before this trouble develops to any greater extent.</P>
