      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state if any rent for storage is chargeable on the 93,000 lbs. of Irish-grown tobacco in bond; and, if so, what is the amount of rent to date; and further, if he is in a position to state in what condition that tobacco is.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state (a) how many blind persons between the ages of 15 and 50 are registered under schemes for the welfare of the blind, and how many of such blind persons have received the benefit which these schemes claim to provide; (b) how many blind persons of 50 years of age and upwards were in receipt of a pension under the Blind Persons Act on 17th December, 1929, and the total amount paid in respect of such pensions for the year 1929; (c) how many blind persons <Col N="1642" /> of 50 years and upwards are in receipt of allowances from county council and county borough council schemes for the blind; and (d) whether the Minister can tell the House the total number of blind persons in Saorstát Eireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The following is the best information available in reply to the four sub-divisions of the Deputy's question: (a) From returns received by the Department of Local Government and Public Health from 25 local authorities who had adopted schemes for the welfare of the blind, it appears that the number of blind persons between the ages of 15 and 50 registered under these schemes on the 31st March, 1929, was 379 and that 356 of these persons were in receipt of assistance under the schemes; (b) No figures are available showing the number of persons who were in receipt of pensions under Section 1 of the Blind Persons Act, 1920, as at 17th December, 1929.  The number of such persons as at the last Friday in December, 1929, was 2,884 and the approximate cost of pensions for blind persons during the year ended 31st December, 1929, was £70,033; (c) The number of blind persons of 50 years and upwards in receipt of allowances under blind welfare schemes from the 25 local authorities mentioned in (a) above was 698.  The majority of these schemes did not come into operation until 1928 and the returns, therefore, do not represent the normal operation of the schemes; (d) There are no statistics available which would enable me to state the total number of blind persons in Saorstát Eireann.</P>

      <P>Patrick Fennell, Michael Fennell and Patrick Gorman were detained and questioned on 1/3/1930, as it was believed that they could give material evidence regarding an armed attack on the house of Thomas Daly, which took place on 28th February, 1930.</P>
      <P>P. Burke was arrested during 1929 for obstructing the Garda in the discharge of their duties.  P. Cahill, his workman, was not arrested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that, according to the last returns issued by his Department under the Cruelty to Animals Act, 1876, more than 2,000 experiments upon living animals were performed in the Irish Free State during the year 1928, the vast majority of these being performed in Dublin; if the Minister will say how many of these experiments were actually witnessed by the Inspector working under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  The Inspector under the Cruelty to Animals Act, 1876, is not expected to be present at all experiments conducted under that Act.  The Inspector was actually present at a large number of experiments, but no record is kept of the exact number.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has been misinformed.  The residence 78 Morehampton Road has never been registered as a fit place for vivisection experiments.  The question of Government supervision does not, therefore, arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will state the amount <Col N="1646" /> of fines imposed on non-attending jurors for each year since 1922, and the amount collected; also, if he will state to what fund the money so collected is devoted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The amounts actually recovered in respect of fines imposed on non-attending jurors for each year since 1922, taking all the Saorstát Courts together, are:&mdash;1923, £10; 1924, £114; 1925, £138; 1926, £99; 1927, £77; 1928, £60; 1929 (first nine months), £68.</P>
      <P>Since 1927 these sums are payable into the Exchequer under the terms of the Juries Act, 1927, Sections 46, 50 and 51 of which govern the imposition, remission and collection of these fines.  I have not any figures showing the amounts originally imposed as compared with the amounts ultimately recovered.  The Deputy will understand that the amount originally imposed is frequently reduced or altogether remitted by the Judge, acting under the Sections referred to.  It may be assumed, however, that the fines as ultimately settled by the Judge are almost invariably recovered.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he is aware that in the case of a Gárda prosecution in Dublin on or about August 27th, 1929, against a Mr. Wm. Murray for riding a motor bicycle without tax or licence, the evidence of a detective officer was recommended by the presiding Judge to be sent to the Gárda authorities for investigation; whether a Court of Inquiry was instituted to consider the case; what were the exact charges preferred against the detective officer concerned; what were the findings of the Court, and what action was taken by the Gárda authorities as the result of such findings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that in the case of a Gárda prosecution in the Dublin District Court on the 27th August, 1929, against one William Murray for offences against the Motor Car Acts, the District Justice suggested that <Col N="1647" /> the evidence given by a detective officer who was called as a witness for the defence should be brought to the notice of his authorities.  As a consequence disciplinary charges were preferred against this officer to the effect that he gave false evidence in the said prosecution to contradict the evidence of the prosecuting Guard; that he was guilty of neglect of duty in failing to report promptly any evidence which he could give for the defendant, and that he made false and misleading statements in a written report to his superior officer as to his movements on the occasion in question.  A sworn inquiry was held to investigate these charges and the officer was found guilty.  The imposition of punishment was postponed for six months pending consideration of reports in the meantime on his conduct in the Uniform Branch to which he was transferred. Further disciplinary offences by this man have since come to light, and his dismissal from the force has been decided upon.</P>

      <P>There are at present two institutions which provide elementary education for blind children&mdash;one for boys in Drumcondra and one for girls at Merrion.  The teachers of these institutions are recognised national teachers, and the schools receive grants from the Department of Education.  These grants are subject to increase according to the numbers of children in the schools. It is understood that, in addition to the grants made by the Department of Education, the Department of Local Government and Public Health also gives capitation grants for each pupil in school residence. The duty of ensuring that blind children shall be enabled to benefit by the education supplied in the above institutions devolves not on the Department of Education, but on the boards of health of the counties and county boroughs in which the parents of such children reside. I have no proposals for further legislation to lay before the Oireachtas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The information asked for in the first part of the question is not available.  There is authority for believing that the number of persons blind from birth is exceedingly small and probably not more than 4 per cent. of the blind population.  The diseases commonly responsible for blindness in this country are: (1) trachoma, (2) corneal ulceration, (3) cataract, and (4) myopia.</P>
      <P>Neonatorum is generally regarded as a serious factor in the causation of blindness.  This affection has been almost eliminated by the strict observance of the prescribed precautions and treatment contained in instructional memoranda dealing with the prevention and treatment of ophthalmia neonatorum which have been issued from time to time by the Department.  Early indications of preventable forms of blindness (e.g., trachoma, corneal ulceration and myopia) can best be discovered by the medical inspection of school children, and the requisite treatment and corrections can be afforded under school medical service schemes.  Such schemes are now in operation in the four county boroughs, in Clonmel, and in the following counties: Cork, Offaly, Kildare and Louth.</P>
      <P>In addition, county medical officers of health have been appointed in Carlow, Donegal, Galway, Meath, Roscommon, Westmeath, and Wicklow, and will soon be available in Cavan, Limerick and Monaghan.  The medical inspection of school children will be undertaken in these counties at the earliest moment that local arrangements permit.  Ophthalmic surgeons are attached to the county hospitals and other institutions in the following counties: Cork, Galway, Kildare, Kilkenny, Limerick, Laoighis, Longford, Louth, Meath, Offaly, Sligo, Waterford, Westmeath and Wexford (14 in all).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the considerable progress which is being made, and the practical interest which is being shown by the medical profession, it does not appear that the setting up <Col N="1651" /> of a committee would serve any useful purpose.</P>

I have been in rather constant touch with the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland in connection with the matter, and I can assure Deputies that the matter is very intricate and the legislation in connection with it will be of a difficult nature.  So far as it has been possible to progress with the matter, that progress has been made.  There will be no avoidable delay in further dealing with the question.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if his attention has been drawn to the statement made by the Medical Officer of Health for Dublin at the meeting of the Incorporated Orthopædic Hospital of Ireland, when he stated that, notwithstanding all the houses that had been built in and around Dublin, there were more insanitary rooms and dwellings to-day than ever in the history of Dublin, and that there were kitchens occupied to-day that had been closed in past years; and if the Minister can state what steps he proposes to take to attempt to combat the growing of this evil.</P>

      <P>I understand the Medical Officer of Health recently made an unofficial public statement to the effect indicated in the first part of the question with the object of bringing before the public the need for a sustained continuous effort in the provision of further houses.  The solution of the housing problem has received considerable State support since 1922 by the operation of the various housing subsidies, and in the case of Dublin County Borough a sum of £874,300 has been allocated as grants for the provision by the Commissioners of 3,853 houses, and a sum of £135,400 has been earmarked as grants for the provision of 1,703 houses by private persons and Public Utility Societies.  The current proposals of the Commissioners in Dublin include the provision of a further 1,400 houses, for which sanction has been given to the raising of a loan of £600,000.</P>

Take, for instance, Mount Street, where a new road is being put down.

So far as the city is concerned, I have no recollection of any complaints being made. I can get no specific recollection of these matters in the city being drawn to the attention of the Commissioners. I am assured that the matter is constantly under review.  The Commissioners have statutory powers to require the Tramway Company to keep the roads in proper order, and from time to time, in fact, quite recently, they have drawn the attention of the company to places in the city which require attention.  As Minister for Local Government and Public Health, I cannot go to Dun Laoghaire and Dalkey and inspect the tram line, but if the Deputy will <Col N="1655" /> communicate the statement he made here in regard to the unsatisfactory condition of the tram lines either to the Department or the local bodies, I am sure that the matter will be taken up by the local bodies who are responsible.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil hereby approves of the Circuit Court Rules which were laid on the Table of the Dáil on the 27th day of February, 1930, and resolves that it is expedient that the said Rules shall come into operation on the 21st day of April, 1930.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The latter date has been selected because it is a short period of vacation and it is preferable that this change of practice should occur at a time when the Courts are not in <Col N="1662" /> full swing.  I do not intend to delay the House by going through these Rules in detail, because I fancy that members of the House who are interested in the matter have made themselves fairly well acquainted with the Rules as they now stand and that they feel satisfied that these Rules are very largely based upon the old County Court Rules.  In fact, they follow the old County Court Rules as far as is possible in the slightly altered circumstances.  The most important part of these new Rules, which we are most anxious to bring into operation, is the schedule of costs.  The absence of a schedule of costs has been a most serious inconvenience to the Court itself and to the practitioners in the Court. Really, the fact that an impasse has not occurred during the five and a half years the Courts have been in force without any schedule of costs is a great tribute to the common sense and good will of the various practitioners concerned.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that while I am proposing that these Rules be adopted, they are not my Rules, nor have they been in any way drafted in my Department.  These Rules have been drawn up by the Rule-Making Committee who were set up by statute.  It must not be taken from that that I disapprove of the Rules or that I do anything in submitting them except completely to approve of them.  I wish to point out, however, that in putting them forward I am not putting forward my own handiwork.  I am putting forward the considered views of experts who were appointed under the Courts of Justice Act of 1924 for the purpose of drawing up Rules of Court.  The Committee consisted of five Circuit Court Judges, two barristers and two solicitors.  Not only was this body set up by statute but, in addition, the Dáil and the Seanad, as will be in the recollection of most Deputies, gave a very definite lead to this Committee, and pointed out very clearly to the Rule-Making Committee the course it should pursue when drawing up these Rules. <Col N="1663" /> The House will recollect that this Committee presented Rules to the House, and that those were considered in the summer of 1928.  A Committee of the Dáil and Seanad was set up, and that Committee recommended the rejection of these Rules and suggested lines upon which new Rules should be drafted.  The objection to the Rules as then presented was that they were rather too elaborate and that they followed the High Court rather than the County Court procedure.</P>
    <P>I then found it my duty to approach the Rule-making Committee and to suggest to them that they should draw up another set of Rules, otherwise there would have been a deadlock.  Though the Committee themselves were satisfied that the original Rules, upon which they had spent a great deal of time and expended a great deal of care, were the best Rules they could produce, they consented to draft a new set of Rules which would fall in with the views put forward by the Joint Committee of the Dáil and Seanad.  The Rules now before the House are the result of these fresh labours.  The House is aware that a Joint Committee has been set up to consider the whole administration of the Courts of Justice in this country.  I would suggest to the House that they pass these Rules now as they stand, let them work, and let the Joint Committee, if they see in the working of these Rules any objection, bring that forward in their report and amendments can be made.  It seems to me that this is a matter which the House ought to deal with forthwith, as the Courts have been hampered in carrying on their work.  I am sure that Deputies who have experience in the matter will understand how difficult it is, how impossible it is almost for a Court to carry on its work without Rules.  I ask the House to pass the Rules as they stand.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand why the Minister selected this time for the approval of the Circuit Court Rules which were laid on the Table on the 27th February.  We <Col N="1664" /> have been waiting for five or six years for these Rules.  We expected them every other year and now, when a Joint Committee of the House has been set up and is nearing the time when it will submit its report, a report which I believe, if it is acted on, will drastically amend the Courts of Justice Act of 1924, or the effects that flow from that Act, is scarcely the time to approve of Rules such as we have now before us. I would have thought that the Minister would have waited until he had received the Joint Committee's report. It will probably be not much longer than a month until the House will have an opportunity of considering the report.  If we had the Committee's report before putting the Circuit Court Rules finally into shape, it would be more desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has suggested that up to the present there has been embarrassment for practitioners, barristers and litigants because of the absence of Rules.  I do not think the Minister could point his finger to any particular embarrassment brought about by the absence of Rules.  Local Bar Associations have made their own Rules so far as was practicable and they followed those Rules and honoured them.  That has resulted in no difficulty with regard to the taxation of costs or any of the other things that might be embarrassing because of no Rules being in existence.  I do not propose at this stage to discuss the Rules or go into any of them in detail.  There are a number of matters in those Rules that certainly are very far away from the practice and procedure followed in the days of the old County Court.  I will just take one example.  You have here the introduction of pleadings, a highly technical thing and a thing that operates in practically all sorts of actions.  I think that is one of the matters that would be investigated by the Joint Committee and I believe it has been so investigated in the sense that evidence has been placed before the Committee.  It is a matter about which the Joint <Col N="1665" /> Committee would be likely to have something to say in its report.  In so far as I understood the Minister when he discussed this question before, the position is that we cannot amend one of these Rules, that we must take or leave the whole lot.</P>

      <P>Well, that is the position.  I do not propose to go into those Rules or discuss any one of them.  I believe there are defects in them&mdash;not very many, perhaps, but there would appear to be some at any rate.  If I say there are many the Minister may say there are not; we may hit a happy medium by saying there are a number of defects.  It is not necessary to put these Rules into operation for the purpose of ascertaining what the defects are.  If the Minister has waited five or six years to bring the Rules before the House and nothing serious has happened&mdash;the people in the country have been waiting for the Rules since the 1924 Act was passed&mdash;then why can he not wait a little longer?  If we have been able to carry on for six years without anything serious happening, and with no embarrassment that the Minister can point to, surely we can afford to wait for another month or two until the Joint Committee has reported.</P>

      <P>I would like to support the remarks of Deputy Ruttledge. I cannot understand the reason for bringing forward these Rules for confirmation now in view of the fact that the Joint Committee is at present investigating the working of the whole Courts of Justice Act.  As both the Minister and the Deputy have stated, the Courts of Justice Act has been working for the last few years, in spite of the fact that there were no Rules, and yet it has worked fairly satisfactorily.  I cannot see the sense of bringing in for confirmation a set of Rules now and, within a short space of time, having to revise them all again in view of probable amendments to the Courts of Justice Act.  There may <Col N="1666" /> be this reason: the Minister has suggested that the Joint Committee should wait and see how the Rules work.  I do not like that suggestion, because it strikes me as if the Joint Committee has to carry on for a considerable time before it makes its report. Otherwise, what is the use in having these Rules in operation at all?</P>
      <P>If these Rules in their working are to be considered by the Joint Committee, surely they will have to be given a trial of at least six or twelve months, and does that mean that we are not going to get the report of the Joint Committee before that period has elapsed?  I am afraid it looks like that, and I very much regret that that suggestion has come from the Minister.  I am not on the Committee, but as far as I understand a considerable amount of evidence has been tendered to the Committee, and the Committee would, in the ordinary course, be in a position within a much shorter time than six or twelve months to bring in a report.  If that is the case, what is the sense of bringing in these new Rules when not only may some of the Rules have to be altered by decisions arrived at by the Joint Committee and the House subsequently by way of amendment to the Act of 1924, but, as Deputy Ruttledge has reminded us, the whole set of Rules will have to go back again into the melting pot?  With Deputy Ruttledge, I appeal to the Minister to postpone the action he is now taking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain Redmond Captain Redmond">
      <NameTxt>Captain Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see what good it will do to put them in force.  Surely it is not the object of our passing motions and Acts of Parliament here to see what harm will they do if we pass them.  The question I ask is what good will it do to pass them.  The only good that I can see from the Minister's point of view seems to be that, as he suggested, the Joint Committee will have time to see the working of these Rules.  I do not want the <Col N="1667" /> Joint Committee to have time to see the working of the Rules.  I want the Joint Committee to make a report as soon as possible without having to await the experience of the working of these Rules.  I think the very fact of confirming these Rules now would almost give an excuse to the Joint Committee to delay their report and to postpone decisions which up to this on the evidence before them they would have every reason to have come to and determined.</P>
      <P>I cannot see the sense&mdash;I am putting it on the ground of sense&mdash;of bringing in and confirming these Rules.  The only argument we have from the Minister in favour of confirming them is &ldquo;What harm would it do to put them in force?&rdquo;  Having gone on for six or seven years without Rules surely it is not too much to expect that the Courts will continue to function for the next month or two months until the Joint Committee has brought in a final report and the House has determined when and how the Courts of Justice Act shall be amended.  I think it is a futile waste of time to bring in these Rules now and confirm them when the whole subject matter of the Rules will be the subject of revision by the Joint Committee.  I am not going to enter into a discussion as to the merits of the Rules. I do not think this is the occasion to do so, especially when the Joint Committee is sitting.  I believe the whole matter is really <i>sub judice.</i>  I appeal to the Minister to postpone the confirmation of these Rules.  Why not let things stand as they are until the Joint Committee have decided what course they intend to pursue and what amendments they intend to suggest?</P>

      <P>I wish to endorse what has been said by Deputy Ruttledge, and I also wish to say that I agree with what has been said by Deputy Redmond.  As a member of the Joint Committee.  I cannot proceed to discuss these Rules at present. It would be manifestly wrong if I did so.  But there are questions arising <Col N="1668" /> on the Rules that necessarily must be discussed in this House.  The Minister asked what harm can be done by the passing of these Rules now.  Assuming for a moment that the Committee which is at present sitting will bring in a report and that this House will act on that report, it must follow that the Rules that you are now asked to endorse will be scrapped.  There is no getting away from that.  These Rules claim for themselves the right to repeal statutes.  At the Committee, other questions of the same sort will arise which Deputy Ruttledge and I are both estopped from discussing now. What I do respectfully suggest to the Minister is, that as these Rules have been allowed to remain in abeyance for the last six years, another two months' rest will do them no harm.  I am sorry the Chairman of our Committee is not here, because he is, I think, the greatest living expert on the Courts of Justice Act. We, on the Committee, are all in agreement that nobody knows more about the Courts of Justice Act than Deputy Morrissey.  I am sorry he is not here.  When Deputy Morrissey speaks to you on this question he will speak to you as an absolute expert. I have had time and again to refer to him in connection with the Courts of Justice Act, and he has its provisions at his fingers' end.  If he were here now he would tell you all about it.  Without entering into a discussion on the Rules, which I cannot enter into because the matter is <i>sub judice</i>, I do not think any harm would be done if the Minister would agree to postpone these Rules for two months.  If the Courts of Justice Committee continue in the same vigilant way as at present, I hope you will have their report before then.  I know that you will not have an agreed report on many matters, but the report will be of some help to us and to the country in trying to remedy what must follow the passing of every great statute, and in trying to secure that we will have no more Bills coming into this House year after year and session after session to amend the Courts of Justice Act; that we have put together <Col N="1669" /> something which expresses the wishes of the country and which will help the Minister in framing a statute that will put an end to this matter once and for all.  I appeal to the Minister, in all sincerity, to allow the matter to remain over for a few months.</P>

      <P>I think that we are all in agreement with the Minister in our anxiety to get these Rules of Court passed as quickly as possible.  I suggest, however, that the natural and reasonable time for the Rules of Court coming into force would be at the beginning of the year&mdash;that is after the long vacation.  Bringing them in now would be putting them into force in the middle of the year. I think it would be better if the Minister would agree to withdraw the Rules, give us some little time to bring in our report, and then arrange his programme so that he would introduce the Rules in to the House in time to put them in force at the beginning of the legal year&mdash; that is after the long vacation. There are matters I can mention without in any way going contrary to what is <i>sub judice.</i>  It will show you what harm might be done if the Rules are put into force now.  Take the question of pleadings.  Suppose pleadings are now instituted in the Circuit Court.  There have been no pleadings up to this.  Say pleadings are instituted, and suppose after three or four months the Committee report that the appeal be by rehearing. There would, therefore, be no necessity for pleadings, and you would then be changing again.  I am only supposing that the report was on these lines.  I am putting it that way because it is necessary in order to leave men's minds absolutely open on the matter.  As a matter of fact, I think we all have open minds on this matter.  In that event you would have to change <Col N="1670" /> back from the practice, and you would have three changes in one year.  First, you would have the adoption of the pleadings, then you would have no pleadings, and, afterwards, it might arise that pleadings would be instituted about a case over a certain amount in value and not below that value.  Other recommendations might be made.</P>
      <P>Then there are other questions where the rule and legislation fit into one another.  The whole thing is a very delicate matter.  I suggest to the Minister that it would be better for him to make up his mind to introduce these Rules at the beginning of the year and to warn the Committee that they must have their report in in time, so that when the report is in there will be ample time to fit the Rules into the report.  Of course, it is very objectionable that the rule-making authority is such an unwieldly body, because it is so hard to get them together and they take so much time.  The Minister has explained that to the House.  It makes it difficult to change rules as rapidly as it might be necessary to change them.  Another objection that can be brought against the present system is that the rule-making authority has powers which are wider than the powers given to rule-making authorities in any other country in the world.  But that is altogether a matter apart from the Rules themselves. I hope the Minister will accept the suggestion thrown out from all quarters of the House and thereby postpone his motion for a few months.</P>

      <P>I do not know if an ordinary layman should intervene in this debate, but I should like to say, speaking as one who is not versed in the technicalities of the matter, that it would appear to me that a good case had been made out by Deputy Ruttledge and the other Deputies for a postponement of these Rules.  I am not in a position to discuss the Rules from the layman's point of view.  But it seems to me that if it is likely&mdash;it appears to be likely from what has been said here by the members of the Committee&mdash;<Col N="1671" /> that there will be material and substantial changes in the Courts of Justice Act as a result of the report of the Joint Committee, no good purpose would be served by now introducing Rules, putting them into practice as suitable under the present Act, and then to follow this by a new Courts of Justice Bill which will render it necessary to introduce a new set of Rules.</P>
      <P>The Minister asks what harm will it do.  One thing it will do is, it will put a great many legal gentlemen to the cost of making up those Rules and finding out all about them. There was just one thing from Deputy Little's point of view that I would be particularly anxious to get some light and information on if the Minister himself did not happen to belong to the profession.  He said: &ldquo;One of the principal things they had to do was to put into force a schedule of costs,&rdquo; and the unanimity with which the legal profession objected to that would make me suspicious, under other circumstances that the Minister had a reduced scale to be put into operation and that the lawyers were objecting.  Perhaps the Minister would be able to tell us whether that was the case or not.  It might considerably alter my view with regard to the Rules.  On the whole, it does seem sound if we are to have a change in legislation involving a radical alteration in the Rules and if we have gone on five years without the Rules that we might be able to struggle on for a few more months without them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>My reasons for bringing in this motion are very clear.  I am perfectly aware that there is a Committee dealing with amendments to the Courts of Justice Act.  I hope, as other Deputies do, that the Committee will bring in, within a few months, a well-balanced and well-considered report.  Deputy Redmond suggested that my attitude was prompted by some desire that there would be a delay on the part of the Committee.  That is not so at <Col N="1672" /> all.  I hope there will not be any undue haste.  I hope there will be a well-considered and well thought-out scheme, that there will be due thought given to a solution of all the problems that come before them.  I anticipate that that will take some two or three months more at the very shortest.  It may take longer. After they have brought in their report it will be necessary for the report to be considered.  When that report has been considered, I presume it will be necessary to have an amending Bill brought in.  That will take some time to draft and, in addition, will take some time to be brought through the House, with the result that I do not expect to see for a year at the very shortest the Courts of Justice Amending Act in full operation.  I think that is the very shortest period.</P>
      <P>It is quite true that this Court has worked for five and a half years, but I gather it has not worked very satisfactorily, and that there is a view on the part of the Judges and generally all round, that certainly there should be some regular scale of costs.  Supposing those Rules are put into force they will be the basis, at any rate, of whatever Rules come into force for the Circuit Court. They will be the basis upon which any Rules will work.  Deputy Little talked about pleadings, that there are too elaborate pleadings.  Where does he find elaborate pleadings in these Rules at all?  I do not know where to find them, and I have gone through the Rules fairly carefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, what I considered would be the proper course to adopt was to bring in these Rules, to let them work, also to let the Committee consider them, and afterwards the Committee, in considering what amendments should take place to the Courts of Justice Act, should also consider what amendments should be made in the procedure.  That seems to me to be the proper logical thing.  In the meantime the Court would have Rules under which they could properly function.  There are a considerable number of improvements brought into these Rules, and they are, as I say, considered Rules <Col N="1673" /> which must certainly be the basis upon which any Circuit Court Rules must be built up.  There is no doubt about that.  If there be alteration in a year's time, then alterations can also and must then be made in the Rules.  I have been taken by one argument which was put forward by Deputy Wolfe, and it is an argument which I frankly admit I cannot get ever.  Deputy Wolfe says there are Rules which he would like to discuss, but which he did not find himself free to discuss.  He says he is a member of a committee and did not feel himself in honour free to discuss here in the Dáil these Rules.  Well, if there are members of the Dáil who consider that they cannot discuss the Rules adequately and fully, that there are considerations which stop them, I feel that is an argument to which I must bow.</P>
    <P>I cannot ask the House to pass these Rules if there are Deputies who would like to discuss the Rules and find that there are external considerations which prevent them giving the Rules adequate discussion, but though I am willing to adjourn the discussion of these Rules and adjourn the motion, say, for six months, I would like to point out to the Dáil that this is the third time the Rule-Making Committee has brought these Rules to the Dáil.  It brought Rules in in 1926 and they were withdrawn. It brought Rules in in 1928 and they were turned down.  It brought Rules in in 1930 and they are turned down. Do you think that the Rule-Making Committee will go on?  Men give hours to the work, not paid time at all.  They do it on Saturdays when they would not be sitting or doing ordinary work, all gratuitously. They have given hours of hard labour and they come in, and for the third time they are turned down.  I practically foresee myself that unless there is a changed attitude that the Circuit Court, which has carried on for the last five and a half years without any Rules, will carry on for the next twenty-five years without any Rules, but I see also that serious difficulties may arise at any moment in a Court functioning without Rules.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1674" /> Deputy O'Connell mentioned the question of costs.  As to the question of costs, solicitors have arranged between themselves a scale of costs in relation to the draft Rules.  It would be hard to lay down any hard rule, because the scale of costs of the solicitors vary from county to county, but if a party were to say &ldquo;These costs are not legal at all, what are they based on?  I will not pay them,&rdquo; I think there would be a very nice question raised.  I have heard the suggestion.</P>

      <P>The motion of the Minister raises a very important question, because I take it that assent to the motion would be taken by the country to be an assent to the policy which has been expressed in the volume of estimates which we have just received.  A study of these estimates, I am sure, would bring nothing but astonishment to the taxpayer. It is true that in his Budget speech last year the Minister indicated that so long as the present Government remained in office there was no great hope of any remission of taxation.  Nevertheless, I am sure there were few people so pessimistic as to anticipate that so far from there being a reduction in the coming year there would be probably an actual increase.  The total of the estimates indicate that an increase in taxation is almost certain.  The amount covered by the estimates is £21,782,000.  This time last year the amount covered by the estimates then presented was £21,141,430.  So that the present estimate is £641,000 more than last year's, notwithstanding the fact that the Minister himself last year was of the opinion that <Col N="1676" /> there could &ldquo;still be no question of the need to limit outlay as much as possible.&rdquo;  Possibly the Minister may argue that in comparing the figure of £21,782,000 with £21,141,000 I am not being fair to him, because by supplementary estimates the amount for last year was increased to £21,453,000.  But I think he would be a very sanguine, not to say a very simple, man who would believe that the coming year, even with this inflated expenditure, will pass without producing at its tail the usual crop of supplementaries.</P>
      <P>Last year the total amount required from the Central Fund in respect of non-voted services was £4,199,220.  A further £100,000 was added in respect of old age pensions, making the total expenditure for the year £25,440,650.  It is probable that the Central Fund this year will require at least £100,000 more than last year, and this means that the total bill to be faced by us in the year which will commence on 1st April&mdash;from the point of view of the taxpayer possibly a very appropriate day&mdash;will be £26,082,000, or £640,000 more than last year.  It is true that some of these increases are represented by minor increases under certain heads of reproductive expenditure, and these we do not propose to criticise.  But we do criticise the fact that there has been no corresponding retrenchment in those services which are either non-reproductive or entirely parasitical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this connection, I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Deputy Heffernan), whom I see in the House, what has become of the Economy Committee which we understand was set up last year under his Chairmanship. And if there were any members of the Farmers' Party in the House upon this occasion when the taxpayers money, a large part of which is provided by the farmers, is being voted away, I would ask such members what efforts have they made to secure economies.  I understand that that Party has had rather an unpleasant time recently at the hands of its supporters in the country.  I believe that the excuse <Col N="1677" /> that its members offered for their present alignment in the Dáil was that through their efforts and the efforts of their Chairman, Deputy Heffernan, on the Economy Committee certain economies, with a consequent reduction in taxation, had been secured.  Now we find Deputy Heffernan himself in the ranks of the spendthrifts, imposing a further expenditure of £48,000 upon every section of the community, but most of all, because they get the least return for it, upon the farmers for whom he claims to speak in the Dáil.  We now see Deputy Heffernan in office.  But we can remember Deputy Heffernan out of office, and we can recollect how, at great length, he pleaded in this House the ever-argued and always-lost cause of the taxpayer. If ever a man burned with a passionate zeal for economy it was Deputy Heffernan.  Alas, Deputy Heffernan has become one of the tax spenders.  It is sad and chastening to reflect how office may corrupt even the best of men. And what are we going to say about Deputy Heffernan's one-time Party? Has it also ceased its labours on behalf of the taxpayer?  Has it forgotten about the farmers whose interests it was sent to this Dáil to safeguard and secure?  After keeping company for well-nigh three years with prodigals has it become as spendthrift as they, or is it that, notwithstanding their proud boasts and professions throughout the country, the Farmers' Party is unable to exercise any control whatsoever over expenditure?  Are we to assume that even with Deputy Heffernan at their head and representing them in their counsels of the Government, the Farmers' Party has been about as effective, as far as this question of economy and expenditure is concerned, as a group of hayseeds upon a telegraph pole?  We shall leave the Farmers' Party to be further dealt with by the farmers of the country, hoping only that in this country justice will be ever tempered by mercy, and return to the Estimates.</P>
    <P>As we have seen, the total Estimate for voted and non-voted expenditure <Col N="1678" /> last year was £25,440,000.  The Minister, in order to secure a balance of a sort between income and expenditure, adjusted this by deducting, first of all, £1,080,000 in respect of what he called abnormal expenditure, and a further £435,000 as an allowance for over-estimation.  These adjustments left the sum of £23,925,000 to be provided out of the proceeds of taxation or other normal revenue.  It seems probable that the total tax and non-tax revenue for the current year will amount to about £24,350,000, so that the Budget as adjusted by the Minister will about balance.</P>
    <P>What of next year, however?  The probable burden which the country will have to face next year will be about £26,082,000.  The Minister, I suppose, will propose to reduce that by deducting certain items of expenditure which he describes as abnormal, and, instead of providing for them out of taxation, will propose to defray them by borrowing. But in this connection the Minister himself is immediately faced with his own statement of last year, for when introducing his Budget he said:</P>
    <P>We may reasonably hope that in the year 1930-31 the expenditure of this kind which has hitherto been classed as abnormal will include very little in addition to whatever sum may be required for the Local Loans Fund.</P>
    <P>It is questionable whether it is justifiable even to classify the contributions to the Local Loans Fund as abnormal.  At any rate, such contributions were formerly regarded as items which should be provided for out of normal revenue, and the Minister, in classifying them now as abnormal, is departing from precedent. But we will allow that to pass. We will assume, for the purpose of argument, that the Minister proposes to classify as abnormal not only the contributions to the Local Loans Fund, but the Vote in respect of Property Losses, and, perhaps, £100,000 on Vote 11 as well.  These items will amount to about £902,000. Deducting them from the £26,082,000 <Col N="1679" /> we would have left £25,180,000, which, in accordance with the practice of the Minister, has to be reduced by deducting a further two and a half per cent. as an allowance for over-estimation, which leaves us with a sum of £24,550,000 to be provided for out of normal taxation or other revenue.  We have seen that the probable total of tax and non-tax revenue for the current year will be about £24,350,000, but this includes an item of £200,000 repayment from the National City Bank which the Minister himself was at pains to point out last year will be a nonrecurring item, and, therefore, must be left altogether out of account when we are attempting to form any idea as to what the revenue will be during the coming year.</P>
    <P>Upon this basis we are left with these two contrasting figures; a probable revenue of £24,150,000 upon the basis of the present taxation and a probable expenditure of £24,550,000, on the basis of the present estimates. There is, therefore, a difference of £400,000 to be reconciled and the question at once arises, how does the Minister propose to do that?  If our present economic circumstances were normal, if this country, or this community, were a prosperous one, the answer would be immediately forthcoming, that the £400,000 would be provided by the natural and spontaneous expansion of the revenue from existing taxes.  But, unfortunately, such expansion is not to be anticipated in our case as the following figures for the revenue for the past four years will show:&mdash; in 1925-6, the total revenue was £25,439,000; in 1926-7, it was £25,060,000; in 1927-8, it was £24,123,000; in 1928-9, it was £24,221,000, and I anticipate&mdash;and I do not think that the result will prove me far wrong&mdash;that for the present year the normal revenue will not exceed £24,150,000.  It may have been noted that the revenue in 1928-9 was £100,000 more than in 1927-8.  But in order to secure that result, the Minister in his Budget for 1928-9 had to impose a further farthing per lb. on sugar, which <Col N="1680" /> brought him in about £180,000.  Even this return, it is worth noting, disappointed the Minister, for he had hoped to secure by that expedient over £200,000.</P>
    <P>The arresting fact which emerges, however, from the revenue figures which I have just quoted is that, notwithstanding all the questionable expedients which the Minister adopted during the past three years, the revenue has been static; it has given absolutely no indication of spontaneous growth or expansion.  In a well-balanced tax system, such natural, spontaneous growth would be the inevitable concomitant to increasing prosperity.  It is absent, and since it has not manifested itself in this country during the past three or four years the assertion of the Minister and his colleagues of the Executive Council that this country has become increasingly prosperous under their regime is at once refuted. So far from our revenue indicating that, so far from there being any growth or expansion of revenue, the whole tendency of it has been to contract and decline, so that even to maintain it at its present level the Minister has been driven to the most desperate courses.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that if Deputies are to pass this Central Fund Bill and thereby to give their approval to the Estimates which the Minister has circulated and to the spending policy that he and the Executive Council have decided upon, they must be prepared to face and acquiesce in the imposition of further taxation.  Can we face that increase of taxation?  Notwithstanding the imposition of fresh taxation during the past three years, there has been the sugar tax, a tariff on woollens and other tariffs introduced by the Minister from time to time, every one of which ought to have brought fresh money into the Exchequer, so that the revenue should have shown in each of these three years a continuous increase&mdash;notwithstanding this fresh taxation, the revenue has remained static&mdash;a sure indication that we are overtaxed.  If we pass the Bill that the Minister has submitted to us, we <Col N="1681" /> must be prepared for further fresh taxation during the coming year of about £400,000.  Can we afford to impose that further burden upon productive industry in this country?</P>
    <P>Last year, our total export trade amounted to £46,061,000.  That represented the gross out-turn of this community, and all that out-turn had to be sold in a very competitive market.  It is possible that during the coming year competition in that market will be further intensified, but there is an added factor to be taken into consideration, viz., that during the coming year that market will be a rapidly falling one and, therefore, one in which the producer's margin of profit will tend continuously to diminish.  In these unfavourable conditions and in face of diminishing profits, what will happen if the Minister imposes further taxation upon the producers of this country?  It will represent an increase in the cost of production for which the producer cannot seek to compensate himself by asking higher prices.  He will be between two fires&mdash;I had almost said between two thieves&mdash;his competitors abroad and the Minister's tax-gatherers at home.  What will happen? He will either give up the ghost and cease to produce, or he will endeavour to reduce the immediate, but not the ultimate, cost of production by decreasing wages, by declining to make proper provision for the maintenance and development of his plant and industry and by reducing his personal expenditure. By ceasing to produce he directly creates unemployment and becomes unemployed himself.  By reducing wages, he reduces the purchasing power of his employees, and by failing to maintain and develop his own concern he creates unemployment in all the ancillary industries which depend upon his.</P>
    <P>It is no counter to this argument to contend that some of the expenditure now contemplated is going to be productive.  It cannot be immediately productive.  It may not be productive until after a lapse of years.  The benefit of it, though possibly certain, is shadowy or remote. <Col N="1682" /> But the burden of it is not only certain but substantial and immediate, and the first effect of the proposals now submitted will be to disorganise and dislocate all industry and to create unemployment.  The prime fact that must be borne in mind in connection with this Bill is that if it goes through, one of its effects will be, during the coming year, to intensify unemployment in this country.  I do not mean to say, as I said before, that some of the heads under which increased expenditure is going to take place will not be productive.  They will be productive, but the cost of them ought to be met, not by imposing fresh taxation, but by retrenchments in regard to services which are non-productive and some of which are merely parasitical. If the Minister proposes to make further provision in regard to local loans, he ought to compensate the taxpayer for that provision by securing a corresponding economy, say, in the Gárda Síochána or in the Pensions or Superannuation Vote, or possibly under Vote No. 1 for the Governor-General and his establishment, or in Vote No. 3 for the Department of the President of the Executive Council.  We do not desire that reproductive expenditure should be cut down, but we realise that the fruits of that expenditure may not become immediately manifest, whereas the disadvantages and burdens which it will impose upon the taxpayer will be immediately felt, and, therefore, we say that rather than impose fresh taxation the Minister ought to prune the expenditure, so far as he possibly can, of every Department, in order to secure that the increased reproductive expenditure will be met by corresponding economies.  It is a strange fact that last year the Minister admitted that through the efforts of the Committee, presided over by Deputy Heffernan, he was able to secure economies amounting to £500,000.  But the increased expenditure this year almost equals that sum, and the only conclusion I can come to is that after one spurt of zeal on the part of Deputy Heffernan and his Economy Committee, <Col N="1683" /> the Deputy and the Committee went to sleep and have remained moribund since.  An analysis of the Minister's figures shows that if accepted by this House one of the inevitable effects will be to impose further burdens upon the producers of this country and to create further unemployment. We, on this side of the House, will not vote for any financial policy or endorse any expenditure that will have these inevitable effects, and, therefore, we are prepared to oppose the Bill on Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>In speaking of this question of taxation one is always compelled to think of what governs, or rather, what should govern, taxation in general, namely, capacity to pay.  Taking a glance roughly over the bill with which this country is faced, I believe that any ordinary individual would come to the conclusion that we are not able, under any circumstances whatever, to meet such a demand.  As the question of de-rating is, I suppose, at present <i>sub judice,</i> it is not permissible to discuss it, and I do not intend to do so, but I intend to say this much, that if the terms of reference do not include, or allow the Committee to go into, the question of general taxation, I think it is a great chance missed, because we in this country, as well as in England, are labouring under a system of taxation that is largely the result of convenience.  Owing to wars or special political situations, taxation was needed, and clever men put up schemes without much thought, which continue even to the present day without any further thought, and so far as I can see, this system of taxation is purely and simply a ready means for Governments to collect money, a convenient but not at all a cheap means.  There is no consideration at all given to the question of production, and as it is out of production that all those taxes must arise it seems strange that no consideration whatever seems to be given to it.  Certain heavy taxes that are imposed have <Col N="1684" /> no consideration whatever for the poor.  They do not make so much difference to the rich.</P>
      <P>Take, for example, the tobacco tax, in which the tobacco manufacturer is bound to spend a huge sum of money before he proceeds to manufacture anything.  The tax in that instance is four times higher than the actual value of the article. That manufacturer invests a big sum of money in the raw material, perhaps years before he gets any return for his money, and naturally has to compel the consumer to pay interest on his investment.  That consumer, unfortunately in the case of tobacco, is an individual who may be poor; it does not interfere so much with the wealthy individual, but it hits the poor man very hard. The manufacturer pays that back before he starts to produce anything. I believe that in that, as well as in other forms of taxation, an effort should be made to collect the taxes as near the point of consumption as possible.  As these taxes, however, were the result of convenience, were imposed at abnormal periods, and levied without further consideration, I believe that the time has come when Governments should make an effort to consider the system, see where it is doing a serious injury and, as far as possible, alleviate the burdens with which producers are faced.  I quite admit from the point of view of farmers that all farmers are not compelled to pay income tax except their income reaches a certain amount.</P>

      <P>I was giving the Deputy every latitude I could, but he kept on repeating about systems of taxation and I could not allow him to go further.  We are concerned with questions of expenditure rather than with taxation on this Bill.  The general question of expenditure in regard to taxation <Col N="1685" /> is of course relevant, but questions about particular taxes and methods of their collection are questions for the Budget Resolutions leading up to the Finance Bill rather than to the Central Fund Bill.  The Deputy, I am sure, will appreciate that.  I will let him make his point, but we cannot have it generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it therefore that farmers who pay their taxes and who do not pay under the direct head, are taxed on what is known as poor law valuation.  These men contribute taxes before production practically begins and therefore they are greatly interested both in the taxation and in the question of expenditure. If the expenditure did not exist, naturally they would not be faced with the imposition of taxation levied without any consideration of whether they are paying out of capital or income.  As the expenditure however is actually there the money must be collected and it all comes back on them. The money that may be returned in certain classes of subsidies to them has been put up by them perhaps a year previously.  That is a matter which I believe should come under the question of de-rating.  It is a point that should be discussed at much greater length, but if this money is to be spent it certainly must be collected and the only means we have of having it collected here is out of production, and, as long as we insist that the system takes no consideration as to whether it comes out of production or out of capital, it is going to continue to be rather a deterrent to production than any form of encouragement.</P>

      <P>I do not think that a debate of a general nature such as this should be allowed to conclude without taking the opportunity of clearing up a number of points which were mentioned in recent debates but not adequately debated. I am very glad to see that Deputy Batt O'Connor is in the House at the moment, because he visited my constituency yesterday looking for rainbows.  The rainbow he found <Col N="1686" /> was, according to himself, a magnificent specimen, a perfect arch with glowing colours and the keystone of the arch was the President of the Executive Council.  The exact financial cost of this rainbow which we are wearing round our shoulders for a portion of the coming year has been estimated by the Minister for Finance at £7,744,365.  I will be glad if Deputy Batt O'Connor who personally saw the rainbow will assure us that in his opinion it is worth all that sum.  Personally I was not aware that there were any rainbows in my constituency.  I have contested a number of elections there.  I visited most parts of the constituency.  I have spoken at a number of public meetings but I never saw anything even remotely resembling a rainbow.  There is something suggestive of a promise of brighter times in the very mention of a rainbow.</P>
      <P>When one sees a rainbow in the skies, one associates it with a promise that the disastrous deluge of Biblical history is not going to be repeated.  There is, in any case, a general impression that circumstances are going to be better in the future than they were in the past but, as I have stated, no suggestion of that kind has made itself evident in the constituency which Deputy O'Connor honoured by visiting last night.  In fact, there is a decided impression that things are getting worse.  Deputy O'Connor confined his visit merely to addressing a meeting in a small hall in Dawson Street&mdash;presumably, a meeting composed of selected individuals admitted by ticket.  No doubt, they were all prosperous.</P>

      <P>Surely Deputy O'Connor is not now asking us to ignore <Col N="1687" /> the magnificent rainbow he discovered last night?  I have no doubt he was talking to prosperous individuals. Anyone who was not prosperous would not be admitted.  In fact, the very idea of a mere unemployed person getting into a meeting of that kind is inconceivable.  Does Deputy O'Connor realise that there are, in fact, a number of persons unemployed in the city who would be very glad to get a glimpse of even a segment of the rainbow?  I wonder is Deputy O'Connor one of those who are under the impression that there is no unemployment?  There are quite a number of people in the country, quite a number in the Dáil, who appear to be under the impression that unemployment does not exist.  We have statistical tables produced here from time to time by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Finance, and the President of the Executive Council, the keystone of the rainbow arch, indicating that unemployment is diminishing at such a rapid rate that it is to be expected that in a very short time it will have ceased to exist if, in fact, it has not already disappeared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume it is in order, on the Central Fund Bill, to refer to the economic conditions existing in the country.  When the Vote on account, which preceded this Bill, was under discussion here, we debated the question of the economic penetration of our industrial system by foreign capital.  As rainbow chasers are, perhaps, inclined to ignore, quite a number of businesses in this part of Ireland have been purchased recently by foreigners, and foreign interests are getting increasing control of our industrial system.  I do not want to reopen the discussion on that issue. When we were discussing it, however, it seemed to me that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in his zeal for rationalisation and efficiency, was inclined to ignore the fact that these developments, which he seemed to consider so desirable, have tended to increase the already very high number of unemployed. When one comes to discuss the question <Col N="1688" /> of unemployment, presumably one has got first to prove that unemployment exists.  Seán MacEoin travelled 3,000 miles to tell the people of another country that unemployment in this country was not, as he put it, &ldquo;particularly bothersome.&rdquo; Of course, Deputy MacEoin, like Deputy O'Connor, gets his experience from attending these small meetings of select individuals, all prosperous, all, no doubt, in receipt of substantial incomes, substantial pensions, or reasonable remuneration of one kind or another.  When Deputy MacEoin said that unemployment was not particularly bothersome, he meant that it did not bother him.  Neither does it bother Deputy O'Connor, I am sure, nor any of Deputy O'Connor's colleagues in the Party opposite.  Those of us who are excluded from the select circle of rainbow chasers come occasionally into touch with the unemployed, and we are inclined to consider the problem as a particularly bothering one. In fact, we are constantly bothered by it, if &ldquo;bothered&rdquo; is the proper word to use in that connection.  In fact, we have been brought so closely into touch with it that we have been filled with a zeal to end the problem altogether if it can be ended.</P>
    <P>I have said that unemployment exists.  There are some 24,000 or 25,000 registered as unemployed at the employment exchanges.  It can be taken for granted, therefore, that there are at least 25,000 out of work. I cannot imagine any individual going to an employment exchange and registering as unemployed if, in fact, he was not; so when the Minister for Industry and Commerce thought fit to endorse Deputy MacEoin's statements, that there were only 10,000 people unemployed in the Free State in January last, he must have been going on the assumption that the official figure which he gave me was either a miscalculation on the part of some official or else that there are a number of individuals who register as unemployed for the amusement of the thing, but who are not out of work at all.  I am prepared to take the figures submitted by the Minister as official and <Col N="1689" /> accurate.  There are at any rate, at the very minimum, about 25,000 people out of work, and 25,000 people without work is not a small number in a country the size of ours. It is, in fact, quite a large proportion&mdash;sufficiently large, at any rate, to justify this Dáil taking the question seriously into consideration when it is asked to pass a Bill to vote a sum of this size out of the Central Fund.  The number of people insured under the Unemployment Insurance Acts is approximately about half the total number of persons gainfully occupied in the country according to the census of 1926.  We can safely assume that the proportion of unemployment amongst persons employed in occupations insurable under the Unemployment Insurance Acts is the same as amongst persons normally employed in industries not within the scope of the Acts.</P>
    <P>We are, therefore, safe in reckoning that the number of persons without work is about double the number of persons registered as unemployed, because only those who are employed in insurable occupations under the Unemployment Insurance Acts take the trouble to register at the employment exchanges.  Even of these there are numbers who do not register.  If we put the number of unemployed at 50,000 we will not be very far wrong.  There may be rainbows in the South City of Dublin, and there may be a number of other interesting phenomena to be seen throughout the country by the Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies, but if they will contemplate the 50,000 people who are at this moment without work and, consequently, without the means of providing the necessities of life for themselves and their families, they will be doing more useful work and be more useful as public representatives.  They would, at least, attend in the Dáil and give their views when matters relating to the expenditure of public funds are under discussion.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is not necessary. That is a statement that requires to be proved.  There is a large number of people who are inclined to argue <Col N="1690" /> in this wise&mdash;that there are always unemployed, that it is a natural phenomena the result of the inevitable operation of economic laws. That is a very usual argument with these people.  We have heard it in this House.  The mentality that it is associated with is well represented in the Executive Council.  The existence of unemployment and poverty at the same time, is, to anyone who has examined these questions, an obvious contradiction.  By poverty, we mean that there are numbers of persons in the country who are unable to get all the goods they require to satisfy their material needs.  By unemployment, we mean that there are people unable to get work at producing goods required to satisfy the needs of the people.  I say, therefore, that the existence within the one community of the evil of unemployment and the evil of poverty is an anomaly and that it indicates that the economic organisation of that community is defective.</P>
    <P>We had a good crop of potatoes last year.  And because we had a good crop of potatoes last year, quite a number of farmers were brought into a position of financial difficulty. In the economic organisation that exists here and throughout the world, one of the greatest evils that can be experienced is that which is described as over-production.  I wonder do Deputies ever take into account the fact that this over-production takes place at the same time that there are large numbers of human beings actually starving, certainly without possessing all the necessities of life?  We read of Scottish fishing fleets sailing out into the North Sea and throwing loads of fish overboard because the putting of them on the market would so depress prices that the fishermen would be ruined.  We read of Canadian farmers sometimes using wheat as the cheapest form of fuel. At present the Canadian Wheat Ring is fighting with its back to the wall to prevent wheat being exported from Canada in order to force an increase in wheat prices throughout the world.  And all that is due to the fact that the wheat crop <Col N="1691" /> was particularly bountiful in 1928 and that the Canadians had a bumper crop of wheat.  In these peculiar circumstances that Ministers are apparently prepared to recognise as normal the greatest disaster which can overtake human beings is to produce too much of what they need. A country in which over-production is a disaster and in which unemployment and poverty can exist side by side, has some serious defect in its economic organisation which must be eradicated if any social progress is to be made.</P>
    <P>The problem of poverty is not one of production.  We can produce in this country all that we require in the way of food, clothing and houses. We can produce a surplus, over and above what we require, to trade abroad in order to get the goods that we cannot produce here.  If we have 50,000 unemployed workers who are only too anxious to be set to work producing the goods we require, but we are unable to put them to work, then it is obvious that we have not yet devised the industrial machinery that is best suited to the supplying of our needs.  We have a system of distribution and a system of financing distribution that is defective. Every difficulty here, the difficulty of inadequate housing, the development of agriculture, and the revival of industry resolve themselves down in the last analysis into a question of the cost and price&mdash;the cost of production and the price of purchase.  I do not say that the detecting of the defects in our economic organisation will be an easy matter, or that the solution will be easily found.  I do say, however, that the situation is being made more difficult by maintaining the pretence that our present financial organisation is perfect.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recollect that the Banking Commission which the Government established in 1925 submitted a report which could be boiled down into one statement: that the financial system of the Free State was the best possible under the existing circumstances.  The Government apparently accepted <Col N="1692" /> that statement as being correct, and they have repeatedly indicated in this House their adherence to it.  I say that the results of the operation of the financial system existing here has shown that system to be defective, and that we will not succeed in locating the defect if we repeatedly delude ourselves and the people into the belief that the defect does not exist.  I believe that one of the Government's representatives upon that Banking Commission, while agreeing to the majority recommendations, suggested that the Commission should be re-established after a period of five years in order to re-examine the position.  That five-year period must be very nearly at its end now, and I would be very glad if the Minister would tell us whether the Government has been giving the matter any consideration, or if they propose to re-constitute the Banking Commission or to set up a Committee to examine the question anew with particular reference to the relations existing between the banks and industries.  I do not intend to go into the question at any great length now, but I do say that any attempt to find the solution of the problem of unemployment which ignores the question of finance is bound to fail.  When I say that, I am referring to a permanent solution of the problem of unemployment. Even within the limits of the existing economic organisation, there is no reason whatever why there should be one unemployed person in the Saorstát at the present time.</P>
    <P>[<i>Professor Thrift took the Chair.</i>]</P>
    <P>There are ways by which unemployment, as now existing, can be abolished.  I do not say that it can be abolished permanently without a complete overhaul of our economic organisation; but existing unemployment need not be if the Government is prepared to tackle the problem properly on either of two lines which can be indicated.  The first line along which the Government should act should be to endeavour to provide work directly upon public utility schemes.  In the depression which followed the stock exchange collapse <Col N="1693" /> in the United States some weeks ago the Government called a conference of leading industrialists to discuss the situation, and one of the ideas which received general acceptance by all parties in the United States was that in periods of depression the Government should put into operation large schemes of work of a public utility nature in order to relieve unemployment and to provide the purchasing power that would enable a revival of industry to take place.  The general theory was that the Government should increase the number of such schemes in operation as depression deepened.  In periods of prosperity these schemes would be suspended; in periods of great depression they would be in full operation. There are quite a number of directions in which the Government here could directly provide employment by undertaking schemes of work of a nature which will not be undertaken at all unless the Government offers special facilities.  We have repeatedly indicated the nature of the schemes that I am referring to.  There are a number of towns in the Free State which have not got either a proper sewerage scheme or a proper water supply.  The difficulty in getting the local authorities to undertake the provision of these services is that the burden which will be placed on the ratepayers in consequence of the capital expenditure involved will be very heavy and will continue over a very long period. The area of charge is generally much too small.  No doubt the Government are prepared to make loans and grants available in certain circumstances to enable such schemes to be undertaken.  I suggest that if the methods which they have adopted heretofore have not resulted in the schemes being started, they should go much further and indicate their willingness to finance such schemes entirely out of the Central Fund or out of moneys specially borrowed for the purpose.</P>
    <P>The matter of housing is one that I would like to refer to most particularly. The Government's reaction to the publication of the figures relating to housing ascertained by <Col N="1694" /> the Census of 1926 was to reduce the building subsidy.  It was discovered that in the year 1926 some 55,000 houses were immediately required in the Free State, to secure that what the census authorities described as &ldquo;overcrowded conditions&rdquo; would be abolished.  I say the Government's reaction to the publication of these figures was to reduce the housing subsidy.  The Minister for Local Government appears to work on the theory that by reducing building subsidies he can reduce building costs.  He has, in fact, stated here that the various reductions effected in the subsidy since 1923 have resulted in a substantial lowering of building costs, and he advanced that argument as proof of the effectiveness of the Government's contribution to the solution of the housing problem.  That theory, of course, has been held elsewhere than in this country.  The late Conservative Government in England also worked on the same idea.  The new Labour Ministry in England, as one of their first acts on taking office, reversed the housing policy of their predecessors and cancelled the further reduction in the building subsidy which had been announced to take place in the autumn of last year.  The Minister for Local Government supported his theory by quoting figures showing the reduction in building costs which took place in each year as the housing subsidy went down.  The figures he produced seemed to support his case, but only because he had not taken all the factors into account.  He should have taken into account not merely the actual average cost of building subsidised houses, but the number of such houses constructed, and he would then have found that as the subsidy went down so also did the number of houses erected by local authorities decrease.  The number of houses built in 1928 was very substantially less than the number built in 1927. The reduction in the subsidy merely reduced the number of houses which local authorities were prepared to order, and consequently there was much greater competition amongst building contractors for orders and, <Col N="1695" /> consequently, a lowering of the average price.  This country wants not merely cheaper houses, but it wants more houses.  The policy designed to bring down prices is obviously useless if its effect is to decrease construction. The cost of building can be reduced, and it is undoubtedly desirable that the cost of building should be reduced, but certainly not by the method hitherto adopted by the Department of Local Government. There is a paper published in Dublin called &ldquo;The Star.&rdquo;  I have no doubt some members of Cumann na nGaedheal read that paper religiously every week.  It is described as the semi-official organ of Cumann na nGaedheal.  It is therefore extremely likely that the particular quotation which I am going to read from a recent article published in that paper has already been studied by the Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies who are now present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate it will do no harm to remind them of it. The lines along which the solution of the housing problem is to be sought has been indicated in that journal.  It has conferred one great benefit on the Cumann na nGaedheal Party by reproducing in a recent issue an article published in the &ldquo;Manchester Guardian Weekly&rdquo; relating to the method in which the housing shortage was tackled in the municipality of Vienna.  As I have said, the publication of this article in the semi-official organ of Cumann na nGaedheal created the impression that the Government had at long last seen the error of its ways and was about to tackle this housing question on right lines.  Obviously the purpose which the editor had in mind in inserting it was to conduct a sort of preliminary propaganda campaign amongst the sixty-four readers of the journal.  I will read it:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How is it possible that the <Col N="1696" /> municipality can give these flats at such low rents?  The Vienna Town Hall calculates the rents in such fashion that only the costs of maintenance, and not of amortisation, are included in the rents. Even so, the rents appear remarkably low, especially if we take into consideration that building costs have increased seventy per cent. over pre-war and that the interest rates on loans are enormous: the official discount rate of the Austrian National Bank is 8 per cent., so that no building loans can be had at less than 10½ per cent. But the municipality is building these houses not out of borrowed money, but out of taxes.  This reduces the building costs.  The real secret of the cheapness of construction is, however, the collective buying of building material and the direction of building operations through a central office.</P>
    <P Just="Center">A Five Years' Programme.</P>
    <P>The director of the building department of the Vienna municipality gave me the following information concerning the low building costs:&mdash;</P>
    <P>We buy wholesale.  We ordered our brick supply for five years ahead, and for so huge an order, guaranteeing the brickworks ample occupation for years, we got greatly reduced prices.  We order 35,000 windows and 25,000 doors at a time.  Instead of consulting architects and incurring heavy fees we have twelve architects employed on salary, and similarly we have one engineer on salary for every three buildings. Consequently the average cost during the last four and a half years of a flat of about forty-seven square metres surface amounted to 11,500 Austrian schillings, or about £340.</P>
    <P>I think if the Government here decided to tackle the housing problem on the same lines, by the establishment of a central authority and the combined purchasing of building <Col N="1697" /> materials, they will be also able so to reduce building costs in the Free State so that the construction of the 50,000 houses required in 1926 would be proceeded with at a much more rapid rate than heretofore.  Official figures indicate that the construction of housing is not keeping up with the growth of the demand.  We have already produced statistics here to show that the number of persons in single-roomed tenements in Dublin is increasing.  We have produced statistics to show that the number of persons living in condemned dwellings in Dublin is increasing.  There is great evidence of building activity upon the outskirts of the city, but, great as that activity is, houses are not being constructed at the rate which would enable the growth of the demand to be met, much less at the rate which would ensure that something would be written off the arrears inherited by this Government when established.</P>
    <P>The system of giving small building grants to local authorities or private builders is not going to solve the housing question.  It can only be solved by the establishment of a housing board, financed by and under the control of the Government, with power to enter into the building of houses either directly or by contract, and to purchase the materials required for the whole country through a central office and operating so as to secure the construction of the 55,000 houses now required within a maximum period of ten years.  On the construction of these houses a very large number of the unemployed could be given work.  On the preparation of the materials required for these houses another large number of the unemployed could be engaged.  There are, in fact, no building materials required except timber which cannot be produced within the country.</P>
    <P>We have a number of brick fields in different parts of the Free State which are either out of production entirely or are only working on an output very much below their total capacity.  If there was a central housing authority which could attack the question of the provision of bricks from Irish yards in a direct <Col N="1698" /> manner, every one of these brick fields could be brought into production by being guaranteed a market for its output over the ten years during which the national housing programme would be in operation. The Minister for Industry and Commerce talked very big here last week about the benefits of rationalisation. Why will not the Government apply rationalisation to the building industry? It is required in that industry more than any other.  If they will rationalise there they will be able to undertake this particular task with much more efficiency than they have shown in relation to it heretofore.</P>
    <P>Take also the question of slates. I raised the question of the use of Irish slates on subsidised houses here by way of question last week.  The Minister for Local Government replied that Irish slates could not be used because they cost more than the imported artificial slates.  That answer was only partly true.  The actual financial cost of roofing a house with imported artificial slates is undoubtedly less than the cost of roofing the same house with Irish slates will be.  The fact must also be taken into consideration that the Irish slate carries with it a guarantee for one hundred years.  If it wears out within one hundred years the manufacturers undertake to replace it free of cost.  The imported artificial slate is guaranteed only for twenty years, and only guaranteed to be watertight for twelve months. When we are reckoning the cost of roofing a house, obviously the life of the roof is an important factor to be taken into account.  Now, twenty years is not the normal life of a house, and if we build houses on which we put roofs that are only guaranteed to last, without necessarily being watertight, for twenty years, then we are doing something that, in my opinion, is obviously uneconomic, because there must be added to the construction costs of that house the cost of replacing the roof in twenty years' time.  If, on the other hand, we build these houses now with Irish slates, we will not merely be providing a better article at a cheaper cost, but also will be <Col N="1699" /> giving work to Irishmen on the production of these slates here instead of giving work to Frenchmen or Belgians on the manufacture of these artificial slates abroad.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that there was a saving of £8 per house at Donnycarney by using artificial slates.  The cost of Killaloe slates is 40/- per square of 100 square feet delivered at any railway station in Ireland On an average-sized house such as those being constructed at Donnycarney, the total cost of the slates would be about £12.  About six squares of slates would be required. If the Minister is correct in telling the House that there is a saving of £8 per house by the use of artificial slates, then those slates are being secured at £4 per house on the Donnycarney scheme.  I would be very glad to be informed that that is correct, because I find it very hard to believe it, and I am sure the Minister gave his answer upon incorrect information.</P>

      <P>We can produce, I believe, glass.  I do not know if the deposits of glass sand in places like Muckish Mountain, in Donegal, have ever been properly surveyed.  I have heard it stated, however, by persons who can be regarded as authorities on that matter that the glass sand deposit at Muckish, in Donegal is capable of being economically worked if a market could be secured within the country.  I think we can produce piping, earthenware and other requirements for house building.  I think if we were put to it we would get every material required in the production of houses except timber.  We would have to import timber.  If there was, as I have suggested, a housing authority with full control over the construction <Col N="1701" /> of houses in the country, properly financed and empowered to enter into direct purchasing, we could develop the production of all these commodities within the country and give very considerable employment by doing so.  On housing, on public utility schemes, and on similar undertakings the Government could directly provide employment for almost the entire number now seeking work.  If they are not prepared to do that, however, they can provide employment for these people in another direction.</P>
      <P>According to the official statistics published by the Department of Industry and Commerce, the number of persons employed in industries protected by tariffs has increased since these tariffs were first imposed by 13,000.  That figure must be taken into consideration in relation to the decline in employment in industries which have not yet been tariffed. According to the figures published by the Department of Industry and Commerce, for example, during the year 1929, employment in the coachbuilding industry decreased by 47 per cent.  The coachbuilding industry applied for a tariff in 1926.  The Tariff Commission is still considering the application.  The report has not yet been published.  That fact becomes of special significance in view of the substantial decline in the employment given by that industry last year.  There will probably be no industry left at all by the time the Tariff Commission's report is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During last year we imported £9,500,000 worth of goods which the Government is of opinion could be manufactured in the country, and which they attempted to secure would be manufactured in the country by making them subject to tariffs.  In addition to that £9,500,000 worth of goods, there came in £7,500,000 worth of goods not tariffed, but which are, at the present time, being produced within the country, such things as slates, flour, bread, buns, packing cases and articles of that nature.  Altogether, there are seventeen million pounds worth of goods coming in annually <Col N="1702" /> which can be produced within the country.  The census of production showed that the total value of the transportable goods produced in the Free State in 1926 was £20,000,000, and engaged in the production of that £20,000,000 worth of goods there were 65,000 workers.  Working on that proportion, we could provide employment for substantially more than the 50,000 workers now seeking work merely by confining the home market in these goods, tariffed or capable of being tariffed, to Irish industrialists.  If we could secure that all our requirements on tariffed goods and all our requirements in such goods as flour, bread, and buns which are obviously capable of being manufactured here was supplied from within the country, the unemployment now existing would be abolished.  There is, as I have said, no reason whatever that there should be one man without work in the Free State area to-day.</P>
    <P>In relation to these tariffed goods, there are some points that I would like to have cleared up.  In a discussion during last year, for example, the Minister for Industry and Commerce informed us that it was useless to consider increasing the duty on imported boots because, owing to the scarcity of skilled workers, the industry was incapable of immediate expansion.  I accepted his word for that, although I noticed when I asked him if it was a fact that there were no skilled workers unemployed in the Free State he did not reply.  Some time ago I was in Cork, and I was informed by a proprietor of a boot factory there that for three months last year his factory had to be closed down because of their inability to find a market for the stock they had produced.  They were suffering from this evil of overproduction to which I referred earlier.  That fact did not seem to indicate that the development of the boot industry here could not be further fostered by an increase in the existing duty, which is obviously too low.</P>
    <P>There is an impression that these tariffs have increased the cost of <Col N="1703" /> living.  That impression has been created by the Minister for Agriculture more than any other individual. If, however, he will discontinue making general statements and seek to prove his case by the production of statistics, he will find, when he goes looking for the statistics, that the very reverse has been the case. The cost of living has fallen in the Free State since 1925 proportionately more than in Great Britain or in the United States.  The actual cost of the imported goods has also fallen.  That is particularly noticeable in the case of boots.  If the Minister will take the average price of British boots exported to the world and compare it with the average price of British boots exported to the Free State since 1924, he will find that the average price of British boots here has been reduced by more than the fifteen per cent. duty imposed.  The British manufacturers have been cutting their prices to meet the tariff.  That is noticeable in relation to the majority of tariffed articles.</P>
    <P>We discussed the question of agriculture here at great length last year.  There is not unemployment, but under-employment in the agricultural industry.  Production per head of the workers in agriculture here is much lower than in any other country with which comparison is possible.  The Fianna Fáil representatives on the Economic Committee and in the Dáil have advocated the adoption of a scheme for the provision of a guaranteed price and a guaranteed market for wheat as one of the methods by which a way could be found out of agricultural depression. The scheme was described by the Minister for Agriculture as economically unsound.  The leader of the Farmers' Party was quite eloquent in denouncing it.  Other Deputies also thought fit to regard it as a matter for levity.  Deputy Good, who voted against it, will be interested to learn that his spiritual affinity in Great Britain, the Leader of the Conservative Party has just discovered the great benefits which might be conferred upon <Col N="1704" /> Great Britain by the adoption there of the Fianna Fáil scheme.  He has been advocating a guaranteed price and a guaranteed market for British wheat.  He took the Report of the minority on the Economic Committee, struck out the words &ldquo;Free State&rdquo; wherever it occurred and inserted the words &ldquo;Great Britain&rdquo; and presented it to his Party as a magnificent new idea, by which British agriculture could be put on its feet again.</P>
    <P>Not merely has the Conservative Party seen the benefits of that scheme, but the Labour Party also embodied in its programme schemes for the encouragement of wheat growing almost identical with the Fianna Fáil proposals which were turned down here.  Of course, that fact, I know, would not convince Deputies opposite that the scheme was right.  The mere fact that British parties have endorsed it would, in fact, with such ultra-patriots as they are, be a condemnation of it, so that we can leave Great Britain out of account. The scheme is also in process of being adopted in Germany; it is in operation in Poland, Norway and a number of other countries in Europe. If the Economic Committee conferred no benefit on the Free State, it has at least conferred substantial benefit on mankind.  The proposals put forward by the Fianna Fáil representatives were rejected here, but accepted by thinking men throughout Europe.  There are one or two other matters which I should like the Minister to refer to when replying. I should like to take advantage of the general discussion now taking place to deal with them, as I may not get another opportunity. This Bill gives the Minister power to borrow.  Within the last few days statements have appeared in the Press to the effect that a £5,000,000 national loan will be issued at home in the autumn of this year.  The statement appeared in a number of papers simultaneously, and was obviously inspired.  I think it is very undesirable that statements of official policy on important matters of that nature should be made to <Col N="1705" /> Press correspondents before being made to the Dáil.  Obviously the Minister had only to wait a couple of days to have a suitable opportunity on the Second Reading of this Bill for announcing the Government's intention with respect to the proposed loan.  The Minister should state definitely what the intentions of the Government are in that respect. Is it proposed to issue the loan this year?  Is it proposed to issue it at home, or does he intend to seek any part of it abroad?</P>
    <P>There is one other matter, which has no connection with anything I have said heretofore, but which might be considered relevant nevertheless, and that is statements which have been made by persons applying to retire under Article X. of the Treaty and recently published in the Press.  Some of these persons gave as their reason for retiring speeches made by the Minister for Agriculture, and I do not blame them. Others gave as their reason for retiring the fact that Deputy Moore was elected to the Dáil in 1927.  Quite a number gave as their reasons their belief that a Fianna Fáil Government, which they considered inevitable, would abolish Civil Service pensions.  As far as I am aware, it is not, and never has been, the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party to abolish Civil Service pensions.  Those, therefore, who have applied to retire on that ground can remove their doubts and withdraw their applications forthwith.</P>
    <P>These are all the matters I wish to deal with, but I shall be glad if we can get from the Government not merely a number of debating points in relation to this question of unemployment, but some indication that they have given and are giving the matter their serious consideration. In the past, when this matter has been raised, they have limited themselves to the production of figures to show that unemployment is not as serious as some person or persons have said it is.  When the matter was raised before the Christmas recess and when the Government were urged to make relief works available <Col N="1706" /> in Dublin over the Christmas period, the Minister for Local Government read out a statement showing that the number of unemployed was less than it was twelve months previously. That statement may have been considered satisfactory by the Minister, but it was of very little benefit to the actual persons who were without work and who were hoping to get employment of some kind that would make their Christmas somewhat brighter than it turned out to be.  There is, I notice in the speeches of Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies throughout the country a tendency to criticise Fianna Fáil on the ground that it is not always talking about the splendid condition of affairs that exists in the country.  If we say that the weather here is not as good as it might be, we are supposed to be running down the country and are told that it may possibly do damage to the tourist traffic.  If we say that unemployment exists, we are doing damage in some other direction. Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies appear to think that the only way by which the evils which affect the people can be removed is by pretending that they do not exist and by stating that fact on every occasion an opportunity offers.  We believe that the proper way to deal with a situation of this kind is to face up to actualities.  If there is unemployment, that evil must be abolished.  If it can be abolished, then we will not discover a method of doing so by pretending that everything in the garden is lovely, or that rainbows are to be found by Deputy Batt O'Connor every time he visits my constituency. These rainbows may be there; sober persons may be able to see them; but whether that is so or not, the fact remains that unemployment is also there, and that only the Government can, in present circumstances, do anything to make that unemployment less serious than it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Heffernan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal, in a very few words, with some of the questions raised by Deputy <Col N="1707" /> MacEntee.  I do not intend to follow him into an analysis of the general financial situation, because I think it was premature, and must naturally be premature, on the Estimates, as it is not possible at this stage to judge what the exact financial position is, or what the actual recurrent expenditure is until we have the Budget statement of the Minister for Finance.  I want to deal with a few points made by Deputy MacEntee with regard to the work of the Economy Committee, and other aspects pertaining to that. Perhaps it is due from me, in appreciation of the work done by other members of the Committee, to mention some of the work done by the Economy Committee since its establishment. It held something like 64 meetings.  During the course of these meetings it has examined something like two-thirds of the Votes in the Estimates, and it has examined them in thorough detail.  The other members of the Economy Committee are all heads of important Departments of State, and they have given their time, at great inconvenience to themselves, in the work of analysing and examining the expenditure under the various Votes.  I think it is only right that appreciation should be expressed of the time they have given to that work.  I have long recognised that the useful work of the Economy Committee will not, necessarily, be the report which will be issued; the real use of the Economy Committee, in my opinion, is the information which is obtained as examination goes on.  We have the statement of the Minister for Finance that suggestions which came from the Economy Committee enabled him to make actual tangible economies in his Estimates and in the Budget.  Now the difference between the demand for economy by the Farmers' Party, which resulted eventually in the establishment of this Committee, and the demand for economy from Deputy MacEntee and the members of his Party, is that the demand for economy by the Farmers' Party was an actual demand, and an expectation and hope of real economy, whereas the demand for economy by <Col N="1708" /> the Fianna Fáil Party is nothing more than political propaganda.</P>
      <P>If Deputy MacEntee will go back to the debates which took place on the Estimates in past years, before the Fianna Fáil Party appeared in this House, he will find that the Farmers' Party made every effort to face up to the realities of the situation as it existed, made every effort to show where economics could be effected, made every effort to analyse the Votes and to stand up to their analyses and to argue for them in this House.  I think it can be claimed that certain of the economies that resulted since that period were economies indicated and pointed out by the Farmers' Party in this Dáil.  I might also point out that Deputy MacEntee speaks as if no economies had been effected at all but it will be found that since the period when the Farmers' Party first demanded economy the reduction in expenditure has been very considerable.  I have not the actual figures before me but it will be found that very considerable reduction has taken place since then amounting to several millions, and that despite the fact that automatic increases in expenditure are taking place from year to year and that various Bills are introduced that have the effect of increasing the expenditure of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now Fianna Fáil gives lip service to economy.  I have not yet seen Fianna Fáil oppose any Bill introduced into the Dáil on the ground that it was imposing an unnecessary charge upon the taxpayer.  I have seen them support Bills in this House and go into the Lobby and support them there, which had the effect of increasing very definitely expenditure and the consequent demand that must be laid upon the taxpayer.  I have seen Fianna Fáil support a Housing Bill for the Gaeltacht which has resulted in a definite increase in expenditure.  I have seen Fianna Fáil Deputies get up and demand increased expenditure by the Land Commission in the acquisition and division of estates, which always results in increased expenditure. Fianna Fáil wants to have it both <Col N="1709" /> ways; they demand a reduction in taxation and at the same time continue to demand increased expenditure. Their demands for reduction in taxation are purely political propaganda. They pick out such things as the Gárda Síochána, but I doubt very much if it was seriously suggested that the Garda should be reduced that we would have the support of the Fianna Fáil in matters of that kind.</P>
    <P>I might point out that the conditions that make necessary the retention of the Garda and the expenditure on the Garda at the present time are largely due to the situation that has been created in the country by Fianna Fáil itself. The conditions of insecurity and instability and uncertainty which exist and make people afraid and very genuinely afraid to ask for the Gárda to be reduced are due to a large extent to the actions of the Fianna Fáil Party itself.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee, in his zeal for reduction in expenditure, naturally selected the Department for which I am personally responsible, and he suggested that economies had not been effected in the Post Office and in the Wireless Broadcasting Service.  The Deputy might have made some little attempt to ascertain the actual fact in regard to expenditure in both these Departments.  If he had he would surely have had to give credit for the reductions we have brought about in expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Deputy had examined the matter he would have ascertained from the Commercial Accounts of <Col N="1710" /> the Post Office that the deficit on the Post Office Vote in 1922-23 was something about £1,100,000, and if he saw the Commercial Accounts for the year 1928-29 he would have seen that the deficit at that period was something around £200,000.  There was, therefore, a reduction in the deficit which amounted to a saving, of about £900,000.  That has taken place in the Post Office Department since the year 1922-23.  Fianna Fáil Deputies might occasionally give credit for achievement, and they might have given credit for a considerable reduction in the Post Office Department, a reduction that was obtained without curtailing services to any considerable extent. The greater portion of that reduction has been brought about by actual economy rather than by the curtailment of services.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee talks about wireless broadcasting and says that there is an increase in the Vote for that.  He suggested that the service would be of the least possible advantage to the people I represent, the farmers of the country, but on that point he might have gone to some little trouble to ascertain the facts; and, if he did so, he would have found out that there is going to be no increase in taxation because of the expenditure in regard to the erection of a high-power broadcasting station.  He would have found out that it is estimated that the station will be self-supporting and that the revenue accruing from broadcasting will pay the charges resulting from the establishment of that station.  Deputy MacEntee, who, I believe, is an engineer and should, therefore, know something about the technical side of broadcasting, should have known that one of the main justifications for establishing the station was to enable the people, whom I claim to represent, namely, the farmers and others living in rural areas, to have an opportunity of getting wireless broadcast reception at a reasonably cheap cost.</P>

      <P>The main purpose <Col N="1711" /> in providing wireless facilities is for the benefit of the people who, according to Deputy MacEntee, get the least possible benefit from them.  His statement was a complete distortion and inversion of the situation, and I do not believe that he went to the slightest trouble to ascertain the facts in connection with it.  Productivity of taxation is hardly a point to be dealt with in connection with expenditure of this kind, but it is very easy for Deputy MacEntee to talk about productivity of taxation and to point out that the amount resulting from taxation is not increasing from the existing rate of taxation.  Again, Deputy MacEntee and his Party cannot get away from the fact that the productivity of this country, the productivity of the agricultural community in particular, has been set back for a generation by the conditions of instability and uncertainty that prevailed because of the action of the Fianna Fáil Party, and the Party of which they are the natural successors, when they brought about the situation which existed in 1922-3.</P>

      <P>The productivity of the agricultural population was undoubtedly set back for a considerable period, and the deficit which resulted from the situation at that period has not been and, in my opinion will not be, made good for a considerable time.  I have no intention of following Deputy Lemass into his analysis of the general economic situation beyond saying that Deputy Lemass is constantly propounding economic theories which mean, in effect, the building of a wall around the country, the theory of living within ourselves and producing practically everything that we consume. Surely Deputy Lemass and other Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party who propound such theories must be aware that nations live, like individuals, by producing and trading and, instead of it being a disadvantage to produce and trade, the ideal condition <Col N="1712" /> for a country which wants to prosper is to produce things which it is best fitted to produce and to buy from other countries the things which those countries are best fitted to produce, even if these products are in some cases agricultural products. It is not a sound theory, or one that can be held to be sound economically, that a country, which is an agricultural country, is fitted to produce every form of agricultural product which can be produced by humanity.  There are things which our climatic and natural situation fit us to produce.  Let us concentrate on those and produce them as the best of their kind.  Let us use the modern system of transport which civilisation has placed at our disposal, and let us sell those things which we are best fitted to produce and buy back articles which we are less fitted to produce, even if those articles consist of agricultural products.</P>

      <P>I have listened to many speeches on this subject in this House, but I have never listened to anything, since I came into it, more futile, if I am in order in saying so, than the speech to which I have just listened.  In his own particular sphere Deputy Heffernan talks about certain things with which he is supposed to be intimately concerned, such, for instance, as the broadcasting station.  I will, however, leave that for another time.  So far as I can see from the discussions that have gone on in regard to this particular subject, it is, if I may say so, a kind of free-for-all discussion and any Deputy within certain limits may talk about almost anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to go outside any bounds that may be granted by the House in this particular debate, but there are certain things that could and should be dealt with now. Deputy Heffernan talked about this country, its trade and products, and told us what we should produce, what we should not produce, and also what we could and what we could not produce.  We have a certain amount of licence, and, if I can use that licence, I would point out <Col N="1713" /> to Deputy Heffernan, who apparently is not aware of the fact, that at one time this country&mdash;I mean Ireland of 32 Counties&mdash;had as big a population as England, and imported very little except luxuries.</P>
    <P>We had an export trade with England and the Continent.  We had an import trade, principally in luxuries, from the Continent and England, but unfortunately our export trade was interfered with because we could not help it.  Once upon a time we had a trade, and our merchants were recognised in the marts of Belgium, France and Germany.  There came a time when the linens of Ulster, and the cloths of the rest of Ireland made from linen and cotton, were banned by the English Government. They could not be exported to the Continent except through an English port.  Thereby the trade of Ireland both in linens and woollens was killed in the seventeenth century. We had a trade, once upon a time, in iron products; it was killed too.  On the other hand, while our trade was being killed England was building up an export trade with countries she had conquered&mdash;the Dominions of India, Egypt, America, the Southern Pacific Islands, etc</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not dwell on these things for very long.  Anybody who preceded me spoke generally. They had spoken on tariffs generally.  I am only pointing out how my predecessor in this debate has been wrong.  Our principal trade is concerned with England. Deputy Heffernan has stated, and so have a number of other Deputies, that England wanted free trade and we want tariffs.  She wanted free trade because she had free imports of the raw materials from America, from her free ports in China, in India, in Egypt, in Africa.  She had tobacco, she had cotton, she had copra.  If I said that she produced dope in India for export to China I would be right, too.  She had every raw material from which she could produce the finished article in England. She produced the finished article and dumped it into the country which produced the raw material.  We produce hides in this country, and Deputy Heffernan wants to continue to produce hides in future so that a man in Wolverhampton may produce boots from these hides and sell them at an exorbitant price to the poor unfortunate farmer here.  The men in Wolverhampton get a good week's wages for an eight-hour day week, and they can afford to laugh at the poor unfortunate farm labourer in Ireland, who works from dawn until dewy eve.  It takes the unfortunate farm labourer a long time to earn the price of a pair of boots.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Heffernan wants us to continue in the same old strain producing raw material to send to England to employ, on an average, I would say, 250,000 men producing the finished article for the people of the Free State.  For example, supposing, as we have had for some years, an adverse trade balance of £17,000,000 or £18,000,000, and that we spent £27,000,000, £28,000,000, or £30,000,000 in England buying English products, would the Parliamentary Secretary tell me, are we better off because we spent £10,000,000 or £12,000,000 more by buying products from England than England spends in buying products <Col N="1715" /> from us?  England has a population of, perhaps, 50,000,000.  We have a population in the Free State of less than 3,500,000.</P>

If the Parliamentary Secretary believes that the Free State should produce everything that it is possible to produce in the Free State, to manufacture articles for the consumption of the people in the Free State, that these people should be fed by the products of the Free State, and that any surplus of agricultural products should be exported, then I would agree with the Parliamentary Secretary but not until then.  The Parliamentary Secretary never said anything like that.  If the Parliamentary Secretary holds that the Provisional Government should, to the best of their ability, use these moneys which they are asking for to make the Free State self-supporting as far as it is possible for it to <Col N="1716" /> be self-supporting, and that they should produce as far as possible everything that is needed in the Free State and, as far as agricultural products are concerned export any surplus they may have, I will agree with him but not until then.

      <P>The members of this Party welcome the statement made by Deputy Lemass this evening&mdash;I presume for the first time&mdash;when he said that he and his Party were prepared to join with the Labour Party in putting a certain housing policy <Col N="1717" /> into operation.  The housing policy that the Deputy propounded here this evening was the very policy put before this House about five years ago by Deputy Johnson on behalf of the members sitting on these benches.  However, we are glad the Fianna Fáil Party have now decided to join with the Labour Party in trying to carry that policy into operation. Though we may differ on other matters, if both of us continue to pursue that policy, we are satisfied that we will eventually drive the present Government out of office if they fail to adopt it, and put another Government into office that will adopt that policy throughout the whole State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We intend to oppose the Second Reading of this Bill because we differ in the most definite way with the present Government on their whole financial policy, their housing policy and several other matters which we have opposed them on from time to time.  I was pleased and surprised to hear Deputy Heffernan telling the House about the great work which the Economy Committee had carried out.  As far as I can see there has been no result from that Committee, though there have been 64 meetings held.  When I read the announcement by the Government of their intention to appoint Deputy Heffernan as Chairman of the Committee I said it was one of the finest things they had ever done, remembering, as many of us here can, the brilliant speeches made by the Deputy when he was a member of the defunct Farmers' Party and when he advocated the policy of economy in this House.  We can now look back on the amount of work he has done, or rather failed to do, as Chairman of the Economy Committee.  The body that calls itself an Economy Committee held 64 meetings but did no practical work.  I remember Deputy Heffernan protesting in his usual eloquent way about the policy of the Government in paying war bonuses to Civil Servants.  He was appointed Chairman of a Committee, was surrounded by some of the ablest men in the Civil Service, and had ample power to do what he thought was <Col N="1718" /> best in the interests of the people that he represents.  He comes here to-day and stands for the payment of bonuses to the Civil Servants, and he thereby admits his failure to wipe out that particular bonus which he so strongly objected to as a member of the Farmers' Party.  That is the best proof that Deputy Heffernan can give to the people he claims to represent of his incompetence to do the things he professed his inclination to do.  He was in a position to put economies into operation but he did not do it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that he has learned since.  I understand that Deputy Heffernan intended to do away with certain rural postal deliveries. It is to the credit of his master Minister, assisted by his colleagues, that Deputy Heffernan was prevented from depriving the farmers of the postal services to which they are rightly entitled. Deputy Heffernan did not quote one particular estimate where an effective economy had been carried out, not even in the Department over which he has the honour to preside. Looking over the estimates, I observe there is an increase in almost every one of the non-productive services.  I hope I am not misrepresenting Deputy Heffernan, but I think he protested against the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party, and presumably the members of the Labour Party who join with them, in demanding an increase in the estimates making provision for social services such as local loans, and particularly an increase in the item which makes provision for the improvement of estates when acquired by the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely Deputy Heffernan would not go to his constituents in Tipperary, people amongst whom the lands are being divided much against his wishes, and say that the Government are wrong in providing free grants for the erection of boundaries between holdings or building houses where houses are essential and are <Col N="1719" /> urgently needed.  I would indeed, be surprised to find that Deputy Heffernan would do so, and I am certain that if he had the hardihood to tell his constituents that the Government are wrong in that particular matter, they would tell the Deputy in turn that he himself was wrong.  The members of this Party hope to have another and an early opportunity of dealing with the so-called policy of the Government on the housing question.  For that reason I do not intend to go into the matter any further here.  We propose to oppose the Second Reading of this Bill because we are definitely opposed to the policy of the Government and to the manner and method in which they propose to spend the money which they are now asking the House to vote.  During a discussion the other day the Minister for Local Government and Public Health was invited to indicate to the House the Government policy in regard to the roads and to justify the existing policy of continuing to increase the amounts which are to be raised from the rates from year to year for road maintenance, at the same time as the revenue to the Road Fund has increased from year to year.  I hope that the Minister for Finance, seeing that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, who is primarily responsible for that matter, has refused to indicate the present policy of the Government, will give the House some indication of the Government's policy on roads, and I hope he will give it at the end of this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Heffernan indicated to us in his speech the great economies that have been carried out in the Post Office in the past seven or eight years.  In the absence of the Parliamentary Secretary for Posts and Telegraphs I would draw the attention of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to the economies that can still be carried out, and in this respect I wish to state that if economies have already been carried out that the Post Office service must have been <Col N="1720" /> very bad seven years ago when we find it to-day in one aspect, namely, the telephone service, so bad as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Repeatedly I have asked the question here in the House about the system of connecting rural areas with the telephone service and I have been met by the usual stereotyped reply I have got the usual official reply. The result is that this telephone service in the rural areas is not availed of to the extent that it should.  Consequently the service is not as remunerative as it should be.  If the service were as remunerative as it should be, the loss on the Post Office would not be so high.  I will take a typical example.  As a result of the manner in which Westmeath has been linked up with the telephone service I will cite this case.  Delvin is situated in the County Westmeath. It does its business with Mullingar, the county town, but we find that its telephone service is linked up with Athboy and Trim.  To get a call from Delvin to Mullingar the call has to go through Athboy and Trim, up to Dublin and then back to Mullingar. The usual time it takes for a call to be put through is approximately an hour.  I know of one case where persons after waiting a quarter of an hour for a call drove down to Collinstown, five miles away, got their call put through, drove back to Delvin, and cancelled their call at Delvin.  The same applies to Clonmellon and other areas.  Last year I asked on the Vote for Posts and Telegraphs that that matter should be looked into and a better telephone system evolved across the Midlands that would bring a bigger return as regards the number of calls, that would be of more benefit to the community, and would pull down the loss in the working of the Post Office Vote.  That is one of the reasons that I speak on this Vote&mdash;to again draw the attention of the Ministry to the inefficient service in the rural area. In this particular debate the Parliamentary Secretary for Posts and Telegraphs said that one of the causes of the dear services of the Gárda Síochána was the lack of security in the country&mdash;that that necessitates a large force, and that <Col N="1721" /> that lack of security was brought about by the Fianna Fáil Party.  Any security in the country at present is due to the Fianna Fáil Party.  Any security that the institutions of this State have are due to the presence in this House of the Fianna Fáil Party. Nobody knows that better than Deputy Heffernan, and his statement is simply the eyewash that we get on political platforms.</P>
    <P>I have indicated here again and again that throughout the country there were Gárda Síochána barracks which were not needed. When the Ministry of Justice decided to close a number of those barracks last year the daily Press talked about the people in the areas being perturbed and that they were sending petitions to the Ministry and that there was weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth because of the closing of these barracks.  Nobody can tell me that a stream of mourners came in from Brittas, in the County Dublin, when the barrack was closed there, and nobody can say that there were howlings and screamings in the Crazy Corner when the barracks were closed there, because there were none to howl or scream in it.  If the Ministry decided to close the barracks in Coole, Westmeath, and administered the Gárda Síochána services from Castlepollard there would be no weeping or wailing or gnashing of teeth.  Deputy Heffernan's statement that the high expenditure on the Gárda Síochana is necessary is wrong.  Economies can be carried out in that service which would pull down this Vote considerably.  We should approach every State service in this particular light.  If a business community is carrying on a business they generally employ a staff at an economic rate.  They see that they carry on their business with no undue overhead charges, and the State has got to ask itself is the work of the State being administered without too great overhead charges.  Certainly, as far as we can observe, that is the case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Heffernan, in reply to our charges, spoke about the Land Commission. We find a very big Vote <Col N="1722" /> for the Land Commission here.  We have got to ask ourselves is that money being wisely spent, is it being spent economically, and is it being well spent.  Has any Deputy in this House ever thought for a moment of the cost of the Land Commission since its institution in the 'eighties?  Has any Deputy ever calculated the millions of money expended on that body?  Has any Deputy ever worked out what amount per acre the Land Commission has cost the Irish nation?  If any Deputy cares to go into these figures he will find that he can easily come to one conclusion, and that is, that it is the most inefficient service in the State.  It has as yet only done one-third of its work.  A business man in Dublin, who has made a very fine success of his business, speaking to me about the Land Commission recently, said: &ldquo;How can you have any result from that place&mdash;look at its inspectors and its head officials going to their work at 10.30 in the morning?&rdquo;  From my own experience, I have seen those officials take one and a half to two hours for their lunch.  I have found that is the case when I wanted to see them.</P>
    <P>Certainly the whole place over there is permeated with an atmosphere of do-nothing, and if you are throwing away a sum of three quarters of a million on that institution it is up to you to ask: are you getting results for the money.  I certainly contend that you are not. You have only to look at the process of vesting of estates under the 1923 Act to know that.  At the way they are going the crack of doom will come before the last estate is vested.  There will be some one on the last day starting out on a 68 years' land purchase.  Deputy Heffernan stated that nations, like individuals, have to live by trading and producing.  He emphasised trading. I remember the war years.  In the midlands you had a type of farmer who went in, bought store cattle, fattened, and sold them.  He did not bother about young stock, pigs or dairying.  He just fattened cattle.  He had all his eggs in the one basket.  He went out and bought <Col N="1723" /> from the small farmers the very potatoes which he ate.  He tilled nothing but his garden and when deflation came after the war all his farms went to the wall.  They were sold out.  He went into the bankruptcy court.  Deputy Heffernan says nations live like individuals.  He should specify the kind of individual. Does he want this nation to live like the type of farmer I refer to with all his eggs in the one basket or does he want the nation to live like the farmer who brings up a small stock, who goes in for tillage, fowl and pigs and who has a multitude of activities about his farm?  I think the difference between the viewpoint put from these benches and that of the Farmers' Party benches is the viewpoint of the rancher and the viewpoint of the small farmer.</P>
    <P>He also spoke about the demand for economy by the Farmers' Party. I think Deputy Davin has dealt fairly adequately with that.  He said our demands for economy were just political propaganda.  As far as we are concerned we cannot see any justification for tacking on say £227 to the salary of a man with £1,000 already under the heading of cost-of-living bonus.</P>
    <P>[<i>An Ceann Comhairle resumed the Chair.</i>]</P>
    <P>Surely we are content that a man with £1,000 is adequately paid already. When we make a case that a man with £50 or £150 needs a cost of living bonus Deputy Heffernan is one of those who, when he would come to a case for economy would hit the man with a salary of from £50 to £150, as he did when he advocated the abolition of the part-time rural postman, and he would leave a man with £1,000 plus £227 alone.  That is the kind of economy the Farmers' Party always stood for, the kind you get from the graziers' representatives on a county council when they cut a road workers' wages by 2/- a week and give an increase of £100, £200 or £300 to the secretary of a county council.  Deputy Lemass made a statement that poverty and <Col N="1724" /> unemployment existing in the same State were a contradiction and somebody on the Government benches said, &ldquo;bunk.&rdquo;  Now I challenge anybody on the Government benches to prove that statement as bunk. Here you have in the Free State&mdash; in Ireland if you like but I am not calling the Free State Ireland&mdash; enough raw material which when manufactured would take the people who are in poverty out of poverty and consequently abolish poverty, and you have 50,000 people ready and willing to manufacture these potential supplies, to manufacture that raw material into the necessary housing, food and clothing, and whilst you have the willing workers and the raw material poverty and unemployment are a contradiction in the one area.  It is up to those on the Cumann na nGaedheal benches, it is up to the Deputy who said &ldquo;bunk&rdquo; to prove that Deputy Lemass's statement that poverty and unemployment in the State are a contradiction is bunk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>As this debate has turned largely on unemployment I think the Minister for Finance should give us some statement as to the present state of the Road Fund and the amount which would be available from that source for the benefit of roads during the year.  It appears from the reply to a question asked during the first week of the present session that at the end of last year there was only £10,000 to the credit of the Fund.  On the same date the liabilities on foot of grants amounted to £501,000.  That is practically half a million, and at the same time there was £640,000 due to be repaid to the Central Fund under the Road Fund Advances Act 1926.  As far as I can read these figures it would seem that none of the present year's income will be available for expenditure on roads, that all the cost of upkeep and such capital expenditure as may be approved of&mdash; the reconstruction and widening of roads, the rebuilding of bridges and so on, will have to be met out of local funds.  At least that is what it would seem from the reply to my <Col N="1725" /> question but as we have never up to the present had any description from a Minister as to how the Road Fund is administered it is perhaps wrong.</P>
      <P>I have been making inquiries from various Deputies, and I find that there is the opinion generally that if there be any money for expenditure for grants to local authorities at present it must be a very small amount. I would personally be greatly obliged to the Minister for Finance if he would state the exact position. Certainly from the figures that were shown there it looks as if the task of maintaining the roads at their present standard is going to be a very difficult one on the present basis of taxation, more especially if the present policy of utilising freely two rival systems of transport is to continue.</P>
      <P>There was another question which I thought I would raise on this Vote, in connection with the forthcoming loan.  It appears to very many people that the present system by which the Agricultural Credit Corporation appeals for money separately on the guarantee of the Minister for Finance is not economical from the point of view of the State, that all the expenditure in advertising and all the energy and expense towards making an issue of the Agricultural Credit Corporation successful is rather unnecessary, that since the Minister has agreed to take responsibility for the issues of the Corporation, by guaranteeing both principal and interest, he might go the whole way and raise the money that is needed to finance the Agricultural Credit Corporation through the national loan.  I believe it is admitted that up to the present the issues of the Agricultural Credit Corporation have not been strikingly successful, and it would seem strange if that policy were to be continued if the efforts have been as unsuccessful as one hears they have been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were a few remarks made by Deputy Heffernan that I, too, would like to deal with.  He told us that all our talk about economy was merely political propaganda, that the Farmers' Party made an effort to <Col N="1726" /> face up to realities some years ago. It is notable that he was speaking entirely in the past tense.  &ldquo;They made an effort,&rdquo; but he did not say why they have given up the effort to face realities.  He did not explain why the first opposition to Deputy Thrift's Bill to reduce the allowances to Senators came from a former leader of the Farmers' Party, who told us that this reform would have to be postponed until some indefinite date, until something or other was done that is, obviously, going to take a very long time to do. Deputy Heffernan is evidently satisfied that there is no longer any necessity for facing up to realities, but he takes satisfaction in the fact that the Farmers' Party made an effort to face up to realities when they were an Opposition Party. Further, he made the terribly serious accusation that Bills increasing expenditure are supported by Fianna Fáil.  He mentioned as one of these things the Gaeltacht Housing Bill. We are very glad to plead guilty to things of that sort.  It is one of the reasons why we desire economy so much.  One of the reasons why we object so strongly to the expenditure on the many futile things that money is voted for is in order that there may be more money available for things like Gaeltacht housing.</P>
    <P>With regard generally to the question of voting for Bills which increase expenditure, whenever the expenditure promises to be productive, whenever there is a promise that by expending £5, £6 will be got back, we are ready to vote for it. That is very different, indeed, from supporting a Bill which is at present before us for an expenditure of a very vast sum, a great deal of which is certainly not productive, and a great deal of which, in our opinion, is certainly not necessary.  No one, I think, who realises the full facts of the situation in the Saorstát at present can agree that such a Bill as is before us to-day is justified.  I believe it has been stated officially by the De-rating Commission that the agricultural production of the country at present is something like £57,000,000 a year, and we know from the returns, <Col N="1727" /> following the census of production, that industrial production is something like £31,000,000 a year. That is, the total income of the country from production, agricultural and industrial, is £88,000,000. In face of that it would be very difficult for the Minister to convince us that estimates which have latterly appeared are justified or that they can be met in such circumstances. We certainly are satisfied that the Bill must be greatly reduced.  We are satisfied that such extravagance is causing not merely discontent but absolute hardship upon the country, and that the need for economy is immediate and urgent.  When one reads in the papers to-day such an account as was given in the courts yesterday of how people who are dependent upon poor relief have to eke out an existence on 7/6 a week, I believe, for two people in one case, and 12/- a week for four people in another case, and when one knows from his personal experience that these things are frequent in every town and village in the country, it is obvious that the expenditure at the top of this State is inhuman.  It is obvious, too, that some effort will have to be made by the Government to see that those who are at present dependent upon home help can get a reasonable allowance.  In the hands of the local authorities that cannot be done, I think, in present circumstances. It is evident, so far as most of the local authorities are concerned, that their expenditure in this way is as much as they can face relative to the means of those who are contributing to rates, and some time or other I think the central Government will have to take in hand an investigation of the whole question of home help in the country, or what would be much better, they will have to make a more vigorous effort to provide employment, so that the demand for home help may be so reduced that those who are absolutely in need of it, and those who are beyond their labour, can be able to get something in the way of a reasonable amount to maintain life.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1728" /> There has been a great deal of ground covered to-day and a great deal of discussion on many subjects, but I am not confident that we are going to get anything very satisfactory from the Minister.  I think that the Government take too light a view of the conditions existing in the ordinary country town and village. They do not realise, I think, the very bad circumstances which confront great numbers of those upon whom this State depends.  They seem to think that so long as the necessary revenue to meet the expenditure of Government can be obtained there is no need for any great worry on their part and that they can talk about the State being prosperous and about conditions improving.  We should like to be able to agree with them in that respect.  It is no pleasure to a Deputy to talk in a pessimistic strain or to say that conditions are otherwise than progressive.  But those of us who go through the country from time to time and who are in touch with our constituents and hear stories of what they have to endure in order to get a living are not satisfied that things are quite as well as the Government make them out to be. We believe that a reduction in Government expenditure would be a great encouragement to those who are struggling to keep their farms going and we think that such a reduction can be effected if a determined effort is made.  But we can see no hope from Ministers who have the mind of Deputy Heffernan, who can only retort to a plea for economy that it is merely political propaganda, and whose outlook is as prejudiced against suggestions for increasing the production of the State as his outlook obviously is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much disappointed with the position of affairs disclosed by the Estimates.  I expected this year to see some relief given under the heading of the Supplementary Agricultural Grant. The grant this year is just the same as it was last year.  We apparently will have to wait until the &ldquo;Kathleen Mavourneen&rdquo; Commission <Col N="1729" /> brings in its report, probably in 1932 when the general election will be on.  I should like to know if the Minister has fixed any definite date by which that Commission will report. There was a definite date fixed in regard to the Grain Tribunal. As the local bodies are now preparing their estimates, we should like to have something definite from the Minister as to whether this £559,000 is all the farmers are to expect this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask him that particularly, in view of the fact that he has taken no steps to prevent the import of agricultural produce across the Border. Farmers up there have to compete, even in their own home markets, with farmers whose annuities go to the relief of taxation and who have no rates to pay.  How long does the Minister expect that state of affairs to continue?  We heard more about the Farmers' Party this evening than I ever expected to hear here.  I never again expect to see the Parliamentary Secretary for Posts and Telegraphs pretending to be the Leader of the Farmers' Party.  I am sorry that he is not in the House now, but when I met him outside I requested him to come back, as I would like him to be here.  He gave us some enlightenment as to what he represents here exactly&mdash;the ranchers' party who come here masquerading as farmers.  One of his complaints against us was that we were increasing expenditure by advocating housing in the Gaeltacht.  I am glad that the late leader of the Farmers' Party has now disassociated himself from any attempt to provide better houses for the small farmer whom he is supposed to represent.  I am glad that he has now definitely let us know that he represents the rancher only.  Another terrible complaint of his was that we were advocating the division of ranches and thus increasing expenditure in the Land Commission.  He should be the last individual to complain in that way.  I put a very pertinent query to him which I hope he will answer at his leisure.  I have here the Official Report, volume 29, page 683, in which there is a very illuminating <Col N="1730" /> statement which was made, not by a Deputy on these benches, but by Deputy Hassett, of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, as to the manner in which this expenditure has been going on and in which ranches have been divided.  Here is the statement:</P>
    <P>The Land Commission can be very generous with some people in my neighbourhood.  There is a District Justice living near me, a man who has a salary of, roughly, £1,000 a year, with his expenses running, I suppose, into £300 more.  He has a beautiful house, with about ten rooms, hot and cold water baths, and he has between fifty and sixty acres of land. That gentleman has been allowed by the Land Commission another 351 acres, with another beautiful home.  I think that was the biggest scandal that was ever perpetrated by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>He goes on to state:&mdash;</P>
    <P>If such a man were given a farm in Westmeath, he would have to hand over the few acres he had in my county to the Land Commission. But in this case that man was allowed to sell this very fine mansion at a big price and, in addition, he was allowed to sell four or five holdings by public or private auction.  He was not asked to give them up.  He was a live servant of the Government, I suppose, but when the fight was on against the Black-and-Tans he was not of much use&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>That is the statement made by Deputy Hassett, one of the Cumann na nGaedheal representatives from Tipperary.</P>

I am proving, in connection with the ranches divided up in his own constituency, that the expenditure should not be Government <Col N="1731" /> expenditure at all, such as expenditure for purchasing 351 acres for a District Justice with £1,000 a year and £300 expenses.  This gentleman, I suppose&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied to leave him out now.  Deputy Heffernan also spoke of the very hard work which the Economy Committee, of which he is Chairman, had to perform. I do not think there is any report from that Committee yet.  He also mentioned that some of these gentlemen were heads of Departments. I think a gentleman who is the head of a Department, with his £1,500 a year and £206 war bonus to help him to live, could not do too much work for his salary.  I do not think he would be overworked, even if he worked a little overtime, for the salary he now has.  I wonder how the Departments are doing without these gentlemen while they are engaged on this Economy Committee. I would far rather hear from the Parliamentary Secretary some statement as to when that Economy Committee are likely to conclude and likely to give us the result of their labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Heffernan said that the Farmers' Party, some years ago, had demanded economy.  I know from my own experience, while in this House, that whatever demand they made for economy they always voted for extravagance. I never saw them out of the Government lobbies yet.  No doubt they are expecting another token of appreciation.  He also said that our policy, as stated by Deputy Lemass, was a policy to build a wall around the country, and he suggested that we should produce what we are best fitted to produce.  No doubt he talked of Tipperary ranches and big bullocks.  Like Deputy Kennedy, I would like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary why we have in this list every year salaries of £1,500 a year and £206 war bonus.  I would like to <Col N="1732" /> hear some suggestion of economy on that score, and I think there is a large field for economy there.</P>
    <P>I am principally concerned here tonight with the anxiety to hear something from the Minister for Finance with regard to de-rating.  Are the farmers going to get any relief this year or not?  After all, agriculture is the only industry we have, and if the farmers are going to be compelled to go on competing both in the English market and in our home market with farmers who have no rates to pay, it is only a matter of time before they are wiped out altogether.  It is all very well to be piling an extra £300,000 or £400,000 every year upon them.  It is out of their own pockets it will come in the long run.  It is time that the Minister for Finance definitely stated when he expects this &ldquo;Kathleen Mavourneen&rdquo; Commission that he has set up to finish its work and to report.</P>
    <P>I notice here in the Estimates that we are still building mansions for the Civic Guards&mdash;£1,400 houses.  I wonder when is that policy to finish up.  I assure the Minister for Finance that the farmers are definitely expecting something from him this year and some result from that De-rating Commission that he set up.  If he intends to carry on the Commission until 1932, until after the General Election, then I suggest to him that instead of the £599,000 here in these Estimates he could very easily give one-and-a-half million pounds.  I would put to him as a fairly honest suggestion that he should put the farmers of the 26 counties on something of the same level as the farmers of the six counties.  He will probably be around looking for votes again from the farmers and the Farmers' Party will be a defunct body by that time.</P>
    <P>Then we have the amazing statement made last week by the Minister for Local Government.  He solemnly assured us he was going to carry on the same policy with regard to the roads&mdash;he said in Volume 33, No. 4, page 1549, of the Parliamentary Debates:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1733" />&ldquo;In so far as Deputies say that farmers have no use for new roads I think it was in Deputy Corry's own country a day or two ago it was explained that the work done on the roads in Cork had reduced the road traffic charges to the farmers by 50%&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He made that statement to refute the statement I had made that the main roads and the trunk roads were impassable for the farmers' horses and they were roads that the farmers could not travel over, and that by a policy of bribery&mdash;I could not call it anything less&mdash;in offering a refund of 50 per cent. of the money expended on the trunk roads, the by-roads of the county were left a disgrace and worse than they were in 1923.  The Minister for Local Government made that statement.  I asked him where he got it from and he said from the Cork County Council meeting.  I have since looked up the minutes not only for the last week, but for the last three months, and I have looked at the Cork Examiner reports of the meeting.  I would like that the Minister in future when addressing the House would try to get at least some facts and not trust his imagination so much.  Imagination is a very handy thing to fall back upon, but it will not stand against inquiry or investigation.</P>
    <P>I shall not delay the House further, but I would like, when the Minister for Finance is replying, to have some definite statement in regard to de-rating this year.  If not I think he will find the farmers will refuse to pay, they will not sell their last cow to help the Minister for Finance, and as things stand they are being hunted out of their own markets. Last year in discussing the Budget I asked the Minister for Finance to consider the imposition of tariffs on agricultural products coming into this country.  If he put a tariff of 4/- in the £ on agricultural produce coming in here he would get enough revenue to de-rate all the land in Ireland, or in the Free State at any rate, and if he did not get the coin he would have the market.  Either of the two would be of some benefit <Col N="1734" /> to the farmer.  I hope we will have some definite statement from the Minister in his reply; the farmers are waiting and expecting it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>My intervention in this debate will be very brief.  I would not take any part in it but for the fact that I have a letter before me from a representative of another section on whose behalf we have heard nothing demanded.  We have heard the woes of the farmers put up by the Farmer deputies, but we heard very little about the people from the towns.  I wonder how many Deputies are familiar with the position of things in the small towns to-day.  When we go back to our constituents and meet the shopkeepers in the small towns they ask &ldquo;are you trying to reduce the cost of living for us?  Evidently,&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;you are unable to do anything to increase our income but you might do something to keep down the cost of Government and to reduce our rates and taxes.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that they are making any serious effort to do it.  Personally I am not against wise expenditure at all.  I think that money spent on the people of this country, such, for instance, as on the extension of the old age pension scheme, or money spent on housing, is well spent because it all comes back to the people again.  There are, however, branches of expenditure which, I think, could with good reason be seriously curtailed and, if they are not curtailed, I believe that in the end we will find that the people will be unable to meet any taxation.  In this letter, which I have before me, the writer states that for the first time in many years they find it impossible to square accounts.  They say that business is so bad that unless some change comes they will be compelled to dismiss employees, with the result, of course, of further increasing the number of unemployed and unfortunately interfering with their business.  Under present circumstances they say that they cannot keep things going.  The same situation prevails in every little town in Ireland, and it is disheartening to <Col N="1735" /> us, when we go back to our constituencies, to hear these people asking what we have done for them. Unfortunately one side is endeavouring to score little points off the other, whereas we should all endeavour to bring down the cost of living for the people.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate, but the presence of the Minister for Lands and Fisheries always acts on me like a red rag on a bull, not that I feel very aggressive towards him.  I have heard from all sides of the House to-day complaints about the Government policy as it affects people in the small towns and cities, but it is for the people whom I represent, the people on the western seaboard, the people of the Gaeltacht, that I intend to intervene. About two years ago, I think, I spoke on the conditions in the Gaeltacht, and the Minister for Local Government, who had been at that time travelling round the country with the Gaeltacht Commission, stated that it was a bad thing to preach pessimism, that though conditions were bad there was no use in talking about them; that formerly it was all right to talk about distress in the West, and in the Gaeltacht, when we had an alien Government, but nowadays people knew the conditions in the Gaeltacht, that there was no need to dilate upon them, that they were well known to the Government, and that he personally, as a member of the Government, was aware of those conditions.  I thought when he spoke in that strain that we would see some definite and settled policy for the Gaeltacht and that the Government would start to deal with the Gaeltacht problem.  The only start that was made was the formation of a more or less Gaeltacht Ministry, but not much more has been done since.  I do not want to preach pessimism, and I do not want to tell harrowing tales of the conditions in the Gaeltacht.  Some Deputies know the conditions, but the majority of them do not.  A group of people recently came together and formed a <Col N="1736" /> Gaeltacht Defence League to give publicity to the conditions there, but I am afraid that the Press did not give them the publicity that they should have given.</P>

      <P>I notice that this strain of optimism has been practised very much by the Government Party of late.  This may be due to the fact that the conditions are so bad they intend to practice a certain amount of Coueism on the people&mdash;&ldquo;every day, in every way, we are getting better and better.&rdquo;  Deputy Roddy spoke recently in Sligo about Fianna Fáil taking up an attitude of defeatism and pessimism, and preaching that to the country.  If Deputy Roddy knew the Gaeltacht and knew the conditions there&mdash;he has been round there occasionally and should know something about the conditions&mdash;he would not blame people for talking about those conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I hear Deputy Rice and others on the Government benches say that we should look upon this as a rich country, should not talk of poverty, and should not, as they put it, show our sores, I say that we do not want to do that, but we expect the Government to do something for the distressed people of the West. Emigration from the Irish-speaking districts is alarming.  I have no figures at hand at the moment, but I know that in every townland, every boy and girl who reaches the age of 17 or 18 emigrates to America if the passage money is available.  If they can they earn it at home, but if not they send for it to America and then clear out.  The Government appear to have no policy to prevent that and to give work.  The Shannon scheme of course, did give a large amount of work, but that is finished now and the people are thrown on the market as there is no work for them.  Time <Col N="1737" /> after time I advocated various remedies, but have not heard them discussed since, industries such as afforestation, the development of fisheries, turf-cutting, and other rural industries in South Connemara. In my area we had a number of rural industries some years ago, but more than 50 per cent. of them are now closed, and the wages have been also cut down.  I do not think that the Government showed any initiative in the running of rural industries.  The only Act so far that benefits us in areas, which are really country slums, though it has not yet come into force, is the Gaeltacht Housing Act.  If you look on that as a start it is all right, but I hope that the Minister will let us know what his policy is towards the Gaeltacht.  It is a good thing to build houses, but a man can be as hungry in a three-roomed house as in a one-roomed house.  Have the Government given up migration as a cure for the congested areas, have they considered the development of the fishing industry, rural industry, afforestation, or any of the numerous schemes that they have been talking about at every election for the last few years?</P>

      <P>One would like to take it that the absence of the Vote for the Relief of Unemployment for the last few years is an indication that the problem has disappeared from our midst, but anyone in touch with the situation, especially in provincial towns, knows that that is not the case.  Whilst unemployment may have decreased to some extent in places like the City of Cork, where a large industry like that of Ford's has absorbed a great number of the unemployed, the position in most of the provincial towns, and, I think I may say, in the City of Dublin, shows very little, if any, improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One wonders if the Government has become so callous altogether as to turn a deaf ear to the pleas that are being made from day to day by the unemployed themselves and by the people who speak on their behalf.  I wonder is it too late even now to ask the Minister for Finance to reconsider the position so <Col N="1738" /> far as unemployment is concerned. Day after day, Irish newspapers have leading articles about the increase of unemployment in England under the Labour Government.  We have very little references in the same Irish newspapers to the unemployment that prevails here.  It is one thing, of course, to criticise the Government at the other side of the water, although it has nothing to do with the taxation in this country at the moment, but it is quite another thing to say anything about unemployment here, because they are not, of course, interested in the unemployment position.  As I said before, the position is very little better than it was three or four years ago, when the Ministry found it necessary to include in the Estimates certain sums for the relief of unemployment.  The first year in which the grant for the relief of unemployment was dropped, the Minister gave us as a reason that no employment of a remunerative nature could be found, no employment that would give returns.  While in some cases that was absolutely correct, I think if the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Industry and Commerce would set themselves properly to the task they would find that there is a great amount of work which can be done in the different cities and towns which would be of immense benefit to the people in these particular areas.</P>
    <P>The question of housing has been raised by Deputy Lemass to-day.  He talked of central purchasing and things of that kind.  They would certainly be of help in solving the housing problem, but in a great many cases and in a great many places, municipalities are faced with a big problem in so far as the development of housing sites is concerned. In a great many cases the land is being wasted because of the fact that municipal councils and the different authorities are not in a position to develop the land, because the development cost has to be added on to the rent which a workman is asked to pay after the house is finished.  I believe it would be a <Col N="1739" /> very wise policy on the part of the Government if they were at once to set aside a certain amount of money for each municipality to enable them to develop housing sites by means of a free grant so that a house could be let at its full economic rent and so that that economic rent would not be too hard on the person who would eventually have to live in the house.</P>
    <P>Whilst unemployment is said to have gone up in England, and people are talking about the Labour Government not being in a position to deal with it, the Labour Government at least have done one thing.  They have brought in a new Insurance Act since their advent to office, and practically everybody is maintained at any rate.  Here we have no such thing as uncovenanted benefit.  We hear people who do not understand the situation referring to the &ldquo;dole,&rdquo; but anybody who does understand it knows that there is no such thing as a &ldquo;dole&rdquo; in this country.  We feel that the time has arrived when any man for whom we cannot get employment should be at least maintained.  One wonders what is going to become of the next generation.  If anybody takes the trouble to visit the back streets of the cities in various towns in Ireland, he will find a state of affairs there which is inhuman.  He will find there puny children, children who are not getting sufficient nourishment.  The next generation, so far as the workers are concerned, will be a very poor lot physically. It is all very well for the Government to turn a deaf ear to the pleadings of the unemployed at the moment. Eventually it will react on the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer for a moment to the question of coast erosion. During the debate last week I referred to this question, and asked the Minister if he would declare the policy of the Executive Council on the matter.  In the course of his statement last Friday, he said it was not the intention of the Government to make any announcement in that connection until the Commission of Inquiry had made its report.  I am <Col N="1740" /> wondering why it was necessary at all to have a Commission of Inquiry so far as coast erosion is concerned. Coast erosion is absolutely apparent to the most inexperienced person. It does not require any expert evidence to be brought forward at a Commission to show the ravages of erosion on the south and cast coasts of the country.  Some time ago, when a Supplementary Estimate of £3,000 was brought in as a subsidy for the Automobile Association towards the expenses of motor racing in the Phoenix Park, a great deal was said by the President and the Minister for Finance about tourist development. I think I am right in saying that much more depends on the development of our seaside resorts in order to attract tourists than on the motor races that are going to be held in the Phoenix Park next July.</P>
    <P>I believe the Government should at once set about doing something to relieve the state of affairs which prevails at the different seaside resorts. I mentioned last week a part of my own constituency which was affected&mdash;Rosslare.  An eminent engineer in this country has already submitted a report to the Rosslare Development Association in which he states that £1,500 would prevent further erosion at a particular place, the present condition of which is very detrimental to Rosslare as a tourist resort.  If the work is not done this year it will take three or four thousand pounds to do it next year.  Surely it would be a wise policy for the Government to examine that engineer's report now and endeavour to do something this year in order to prevent the expenditure of three or four times the amount next year.  As I have stated before, a number of people consider that these Commissions are called together in order to throw dust in the eyes of the people, and to indulge in a certain amount of window-dressing. They believe that the Government has sufficient information at their disposal.  It is perfectly obvious to them that a certain amount of work has to be done, and it should be done quickly.</P>
    <P>I would also like to join with <Col N="1741" /> Deputy Corry in requesting the Minister to let the country know something regarding the policy of the Executive Council so far as de-rating is concerned.  The position of the Irish farmer to-day is very uncertain, so uncertain that a great amount of land tilled last year will not be tilled this year.  I believe, and a good many people believe with me, that it is necessary that between now and the Budget, or, if not between now and the Budget, during the Budget discussions, the Minister should say something, and that he should go further than saying something&mdash;that he should do something on behalf of the farmers of the country.  I do not profess to be a farmers' representative, but I certainly represent an agricultural constituency, and I know the conditions under which the farmers are trying to exist to-day.  I know that it is absolutely necessary that something should be done for them, and that something should be done quickly for them.  I know that if the present condition continues on a little further there will be very few tillage farmers left in the country.  The country will go into grazing.  It is not fair to the farmers who control the largest industry in the country to be kept in the suspense which they are in for the last twelve months.</P>
    <P>In Northern Ireland de-rating is in operation, and it is very hard for our farmers to compete in the English markets with the Northern farmer who has de-rating already. It ought not be necessary for me or for any Deputy to point out that obvious fact to the Minister for Finance.  I do hope that the Minister for Finance will say something about these important matters, that is, coast erosion and de-rating, and that he will not content himself with telling us that Commissions have been set up to inquire into these two matters. I say that because people have come to look upon these Commissions merely as eye-wash.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the question was asked recently by Deputy Lemass as to why Irish slates were <Col N="1742" /> not used by housing authorities, and I observed that the Minister's answer was that Irish slates would mean an increase per house in the building costs of about £8.  Leaving that aside, one would imagine that in the matter of the buildings that they have erected throughout the country the Government were not interested in Irish materials being put into the buildings.  That is what one would gather from some of the statements made here.  But that is not the case. Anyone who takes up a specification of the Board of Works will find that it is not so.  In the last few years hundreds of thousands of pounds have been expended under the supervision of the Board of Works, and in all their specifications they ask for Irish slates and for Irish materials. In these buildings practically every article of Irish material that can be used is specified for by the Board of Works.  Take that and compare it with what the local authorities are doing in this matter of Irish material. The local authorities spend a large amount of money on buildings. I would like anyone to notice the contrast between the specifications of the local authorities and the specifications of the Board of Works. If one will compare the interest that is taken by the local authorities in the provision of Irish manufactured material in the building of houses with the interest taken by the Government, one will see that there is a very big difference.  One will find that in the specifications of the Board of Works everything possible is done by the Government for the relief of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see therefore that any charge can be made against the Government in this matter.  I know for my own part that in the specifications I have seen, so far as the use of Irish material is concerned, everything is done to see that Irish material is used.  Now as to local authorities, we must remember this, that on the question of housing we find that Irish slates will cost £8 per house more than artificial imported slates.  We all agree that at present building costs are rather high and one must remember that even <Col N="1743" /> £8 in the building of a house is a big thing.  I would like to know from the Minister for Local Government and Public Health when he speaks of this difference of £8 per house if that difference really comes in as between the Irish slates and the artificial slates or whether some of it is made up in the difference in the cost of the timber portion of the roof. I expect that when roofing with asbestos slate, the woodwork of the roof will be cheaper than the woodwork required where Irish slates are put on.  Then there is another matter we will have to consider and that is the life of the artificial slate as against the length of life of the Irish slate.  I would like to know if the Minister for Local Government and Public Health could tell us approximately the life period of both slates.  If we find that there is a big difference in the life-time of the Irish slate, that it lasts longer than the other slates, then the matter of £8 per house is a very small matter. If you take a house that costs from £300 to £500, a difference of £8 in the cost of slate is a very small matter indeed.  For myself I would like that in all their building schemes local authorities would act in the same way in the matter of Irish material as the Government has been acting through the Board of Works and see that wherever they are putting up a house they will specify Irish materials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I deal with what was perhaps the main subject of the discussion this evening I just want to mention one or two matters that were raised.  I was asked about the issuing of a national loan and when the remaining part of the Second National Loan would be issued.  Decisions have not yet been definitely come to as to the conditions under which that loan will be issued or the exact date of the loan.  Deputies will be aware that the fall in the bank rate that has taken place recently makes the position more favourable.  Unless there was to be a change in the opposite direction, there would certainly <Col N="1744" /> be no justification for the postponement of the issue of the second part of the National Loan beyond the present year.</P>
      <P>Our position has been that if the conditions of the money market were unfavourable we would not issue even in the present year the second part of the loan, though the amount of the floating debt has now become so large that it would be inconvenient to carry on.  In spite, however of that inconvenience, we would carry on for a further period if it were necessary.  It is clear now that there will be no necessity for postponing the issuing of the loan beyond the present year.  The exact amount to be asked for in the future issue is a matter that will be determined a week or two before the issue is made, because it will all depend on the precise conditions of the money market at the time the issue is made.</P>
      <P>With regard to the matter of de-rating, about which Deputy Corry asked a question, whatever may be the findings or recommendations of the De-rating Commission and no matter whether their report be issued next month or whether it is issued at the end of six months from now, it may be taken that there will be no assistance beyond the amount already provided from the Central Exchequer towards the relief of rates on the farmers in the financial year that begins on the 1st April. Even if we had their recommendations next month and were able to make proposals in the forthcoming Budget to enable de-rating to be carried out, it would not be possible to carry it out so as to give effect to it during the year which begins on the first of next month.  I think that is all the reply I can give to Deputy Corry on that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the re-summoning of the Banking Commission, no consideration has yet been given to that, and I am not sure that even if we were re-summoning it in pursuance of the suggestion to which Deputy Lemass referred, it could be satisfactorily done within so early a period as five years from the date <Col N="1745" /> of the last sitting, because there were certain delays in drafting the Bill which became the Currency Act after the Bill had been passed. There were certain delays even connected with the passage of the Bill, and after the Bill had passed there were delays in putting the Act into operation.  The delays were not very long, but still they were appreciable. I now refer to the putting of the Act into full operation.  The result will be, for instance, that the first reallocation of bank note issue, which would be one of the important functions of the Currency Commission, will not be due to take place for something like one and a half years.</P>
    <P>Questions were asked about the Road Fund.  I think that Deputies should ask for the information they require by way of Parliamentary Questions to the Minister for Local Government.  He does not happen to be available at the moment.  If they are not satisfied with the answers he gives it would be possible to have the matter raised on the adjournment.  It is doubtful if anything relating to the Road Fund arises in a definite way on this particular Bill.  There is no money being provided for the Road Fund here.  Of course, there is money being provided for the salary of the Minister for Local Government, and perhaps then it could be raised; but it does not arise very clearly out of this Central Fund Bill.</P>
    <P>I was glad that Deputy Lemass made the statement he did make with regard to the Wigg and Cochrane case, but I do not believe it will produce any beneficial results.  I do not think that the people who make allegations of uncertainty really believe that Fianna Fáil is going to return to power at the next election. I think that they are ready to make any wild statement in support of their application, and hence the appearance of believing that there is going to be a Fianna Fáil Government soon.</P>
    <P>The main questions that arose in this discussion were the burden of taxation and the problem of unemployment. I think that Deputy MacEntee and certain other speakers <Col N="1746" /> in different parts of their speeches, and Deputy Lemass in the main part of his speech, were at variance.  They were arguing for totally different things.  Deputy MacEntee's speech, and parts of the speeches of other Deputies, were a call for less expenditure, for a lightening of the burdens on agriculture and industry. A good deal of the speech of Deputy Lemass, in fact the main part of it, was a call for increased burdens. Speeches of other Deputies were composed more or less of definite demands for increased expenditure, and hence increased burdens on agriculture and industry.  I know that whether industry can or cannot bear a particular burden does depend to a very large extent on the objects upon which expenditure takes place.  Nevertheless, any expenditure whatever does tend to make the task of those who are carrying on industry and agriculture somewhat more difficult.</P>
    <P>I must confess I do not take the demands which are made from the other side of the House for a lessening of the burdens on industry and agriculture, and for a policy aiming at a remission of taxation, very seriously.  I think the main policy of Fianna Fáil, and perhaps of other groups&mdash;perhaps the main attitude of the majority of Deputies in the House&mdash;is to ask for more expenditure. Some Deputies want additional expenditure for one object; other Deputies want it for another object.  In this debate, as in nearly all debates, even debates on the Estimates, suggestions are made that the State should undertake new activities, that they should do things they are not doing, or that they should increase their activity and expenditure on things that are already done. All that simply amounts to a demand that fresh expenditure should be incurred, with the inevitable consequence of fresh taxation.  Suggestions that all sorts of new expenditure, whether on social services, education, or whatever desirable object they are to be incurred in connection with&mdash;different forms of fresh expenditure&mdash;can be incurred without increasing the burden of <Col N="1747" /> taxation are really altogether nonsensical. When we come to discuss Estimates Deputies will have an opportunity, if they are able, of trying to point out to the House where economies could be effected, where savings could be made that would enable new types of expenditure to be undertaken without asking anything more from the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I believe that any Deputy who will be quite frank about the matter will confess, after detailed examination of the Estimates, that very small sums can be obtained in comparison with the sums that are being demanded by anything in the nature of economies on existing services.  In the end it will be found that if Deputies want to undertake new services they must be prepared to suppress existing services.  If we leave out one or two things which are mainly interesting because of their political character, and which are of relatively little importance financially, there is practically no demand in the House, and there has not at any time been a demand, for the suppression of services.  The sort of thing certain Deputies will say is that the expenditure on the Governor-General's establishment should be wiped out, and one or two other things like that which would not provide money for financing large schemes of any sort. Beyond that all existing services will find supporters in the House and will find a majority of the members supporting them and, in a great many cases, even asking for an increase in connection with them.</P>
    <P>We have to face the fact that if the State is to do more in any direction, it is going to mean more taxation. If we are going to do more towards the solution of the unemployment problem it will mean more taxation, with whatever consequences may follow from that taxation. If we are going to give incentives to people to establish industries, that means more taxation and increased burdens on the people as a consequence of the increased taxation. The same thing applies to education and every other service. <Col N="1748" /> It even applies to Bills which may have been introduced and that do not directly involve any great expenditure. Even a Bill that does not seem to involve expenditure very often does result in increased charges falling on the Exchequer and on the people, because when it becomes law it has to be put into force, and whether it is a civic guard or another official who has to enforce it, the cost of enforcement is something and adds to the burden. The time required in the enforcement of a particular Act may be the deciding factor as to whether in a particular section in an office another clerk is required or as to whether in a particular barrack or a particular police sub-district an additional civic guard is required.</P>
    <P>On the Order Paper at the moment there are three notices of Bills to be introduced by Fianna Fáil Deputies which would all tend to increase expenditure, if passed.  The Old Age Pensions Bill would involve a very great increase in expenditure, perhaps more than £300,000 per annum. The first of the notices of motion, No. 23, if passed, would presumably involve some annual expenditure, and, if the House were to pass No. 25 I think one way and another it would result in a considerable waste.  There would be a considerable expenditure of public money on a most futile project.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Revenue is a charge on the people.  It might be very refreshing to the Minister for Finance simply from the point of view of the Budget to have a motion like that passed, but it does not really affect the point I am putting before the Dáil now.  That would bring revenue in, but it would involve expenditure on the collection of revenue, even if it brought it in.  Deputy Lemass then urged that drastic steps should be taken to deal with the problem of unemployment.  He urged that it was not merely the duty of the Government, but the wisest policy of <Col N="1749" /> the Government, as representing the people of the State, to adopt great schemes for the immediate solution of the problem of unemployment.</P>
      <P>Now the consideration of the question of unemployment, I quite freely admit, is not the monopoly of any party of this House.  Deputy Lemass suggested, perhaps more jocularly than otherwise, that representatives of Cumann na nGaedheal had not considered it.  Of course they have considered it, and were bound to consider it as members of the Government were bound to consider it.  I do not retort by saying that representatives of the Fianna Fáil Party had not considered it.  It is a thing none of us can ignore.  It is a thing heartrending instances of which are brought before all of us from time to time, and a great deal more frequently than could happen without a person feeling the matter to be very serious indeed.  There is the question of whether or not this problem can be solved by Government action or whether it must be solved, indirectly, in so far as the Government contributes to its solution, by inducing, encouraging or helping private employers to give employment or simply by leaving the way open for private employers to give employment.  I personally do not believe that it can be solved by any Government action which it would be possible to take in a democratically organised State with parliamentary government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Great experiments are being carried on in other countries at present. Some of the results of those experiments are terrible results, but I do not know what knowledge or what useful methods will ultimately be evolved as a result of those experiments. It may be that things will come out of these experiments which will be of benefit to all countries&mdash;knowledge, information and technique in regard to industry. These things may come out of these experiments in State control of industry which are being carried on, one of them being an experiment of a more drastic and radical type than another, but I do <Col N="1750" /> say if the State sets out to solve the unemployment problem it must be prepared to go a great deal further than I think there is any possibility of the people of this country being prepared to go.</P>
    <P>Our form of State machinery was really organised, I suppose, primarily to maintain order, to keep a system of law courts, generally to carry on police work, and to give protection from international attack. From that we have passed on to the carrying on of a good number of important and valuable social services. Nevertheless our whole system is really built up on the supposition that you have private enterprise, the freedom of the private individual in carrying on his industry, dependent on his intelligence, his interest in the work and his general capacity.  If the State is going to deal in a radical way with the question of unemployment it involves, I think, more perhaps than Deputy Lemass has contemplated.  His suggestion, that we can deal with unemployment even temporarily, while promoting public utility schemes on a large scale, I do not think will bear examination.</P>
    <P>For instance, there are very large numbers of our unemployed who could not possibly be put to work on public utility schemes no matter how extensive the public utility schemes we were carrying out might be.  You cannot put to work, say, a woman of delicate physique digging trenches for one of those sewerage and water schemes.  There are large numbers of men unemployed you could not possibly put to work on anything in connection with public utility schemes.  If we are to carry out public utility schemes on a very large scale we are up against this difficulty that you cannot borrow all that money unless you can see that the expenditure will come to an end in a very short time.  The only part of the money you would be justified, strictly speaking, in borrowing would be the part the local authority would repay.  If the local authority is not going to repay any of it&mdash;and Deputy Lemass went so far as to <Col N="1751" /> suggest that we should finance these works wholly out of the Exchequer &mdash;then we would be justified in borrowing very little of it unless we can clearly foresee that neither that expenditure nor any expenditure replacing it was going to be continued beyond two or three years.</P>
    <P>If we were going to take the point of view that it was going to continue, and would have to continue&mdash;I think that was the only reasonable point of view&mdash;for a considerable time, then we would have to raise large sums by additional taxation.  These large sums will have the effect of reducing employment somewhere else.  If a great increase of £5,000,000 of taxation were to be added, many people who are able to carry on and give employment would cease to be able to give employment, and in consequence, even if we were able, by some comprehensive scheme of public work, to employ all those at present unemployed, the immediate consequence would be that new unemployed would come in to take their place.  It would require very little pressure on industry and agriculture in the way of additional taxation to squeeze a new 50,000 people out of employment, if we were to take 50,000 as the number.  There are certainly, very distinctly, two sides to the whole story.  With regard to the great scheme of housing which would solve the housing problem in a few years, which Deputy Lemass suggests, I think that practically none of the results that he foreshadows could be obtained.  First, it is very difficult for a Government Department to carry on a scheme which involves business transactions on a large scale and the employment of great numbers of people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>You might get over some of the difficulties by having a Board, for the individual acts of which the Minister would not be responsible. Of course it would be impossible for any Board who would have to answer say to the Comptroller and Auditor-General and comply with the strict tests which he would require, to carry on business transactions. <Col N="1752" /> You might by putting it outside the ordinary range of Government departments, as in the case of the Shannon Board, remove a number of the difficulties, but you cannot by any means remove them all.  A thing like a great Housing Board would result in so much political pressure that I doubt whether it would be possible for a Minister to say &ldquo;I have no responsibility for that, it is the Board's job, and they must be left to do it.&rdquo;  I think that, as a matter of fact, it would be impossible to prevent issuing from the Dáil directions of one sort or another, it would be impossible to prevent the passing of resolutions by the Dáil that houses should be let at this particular rent, or should be built of this particular type, or in this particular place, or that the strike which had taken place should be settled on some particular terms.  I believe it would be very difficult. Once that sort of thing began you would have the agitation of the large number of people employed for favoured conditions, conditions better than they would have in outside employment, higher wages, shorter hours and all that.  Undoubtedly, a large number of people in State employment would agitate for that and would employ all the political pressure they could muster in order to obtain it, and differences of that sort would arise.  I believe again that the carrying out of housing at a very much more rapid rate than it has heretofore been done would run up the cost.  There would be apparent at once a labour shortage and the consequence of the labour shortage would be what they call labour troubles.  Even if the State were acting as contractor there would be great difficulty in organising a new thing like that.  A thing I must say which has a great deal of effect in my mind in connection with these things was the difficulty even of organising&mdash;of course it was under civil war conditions&mdash;such a simple thing as an army which, after all, is a very simple thing to organise, the tremendous difficulties of getting anything like discipline, efficiency, economy and order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1753" /> I believe the organisation of a big scheme for carrying on a thing like housing would be very great.  If it were built up slowly one could get efficiency as one went along, but if there were any attempt to create a great organisation suddenly I believe you would have innumerable misfits, you would have all sorts of problems imperfectly understood, and there would inevitably be great blunders, great waste and a great deal of general inefficiency.  If the Board carried itself beyond the erection of houses in the cheapest way possible to the provision of slates, bricks, cement, paint, glass, pipes, and so on, then we would have a whole series of technical and difficult processes of manufacture to supervise.  If the Board were not to carry out these manufactures itself and had to get other people to do it, it would be subject, in its anxiety to get on in the peculiar situation, to a great deal of pressure, a great deal of something that would correspond to profiteering.  Apart from the mere question of profiteering, if you are going to set up a new industry specifically to supply the needs of a particular corporation, you are going to have very high costs; you are going to pay for all the cost of the training of a staff, the initial mistakes, and everything that handicaps an industry at the start.  I think the inevitable consequence of trying to do housing on the very large scale that Deputy Lemass suggests and by the means Deputy Lemass suggests would be perhaps that you would get more houses, but that you would get them on the whole at a very much dearer rate. If you went out to get materials specially made and all that sort of thing, it would mean anything up to 50 per cent. more than the houses are costing at the present time.  I believe that a board like that, even if it confined itself simply to ordering in bulk and to setting up a staff to supervise the erection of houses, could effect very few economies.  I doubt very much whether any economies at all could be effected.</P>

      <P>Every country has its own conditions.  A particular action of the State or of the State authority in a country will produce its own reactions.  In one place where people perhaps have passed through starvation and the most harrowing times, you will be able to get from all classes a co-operation that you would not get in a country where, although great numbers of people are very poor, the whole population has not passed through the difficulties and the hardships that they have experienced in other countries.</P>
      <P>I am not saying for a moment that in any sphere of Government activity the last word has been said or that absolutely everything possible has been done.  I am not really talking now about the possibility of speeding up housing, because that is a matter that will come on in other debates and can be discussed at length.  I am really discussing the possibility of doing housing in such a way as to contribute substantially towards the relief of unemployment. Deputy Lemass suggested that by a housing scheme and by the carrying out of public utility works like water and sewerage schemes it would be possible to provide for all those who are at present unemployed.  I do not want to hold him to that phrase, because I think he left out of account the fact that large numbers of the unemployed are women and large numbers are men who would not be physically fit to take part in work of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy proceeded to suggest that, apart from these things which were rather in the nature of temporary expedients, the unemployment problem could be met by wholesale tariffs.  He said that there are nine and a half million pounds worth of tariffed goods being imported and seven and a half million pounds worth which, although not tariffed, were goods which could be produced here and presumably could be made the subject of protective tariffs.  I <Col N="1755" /> think there is not a shadow of a chance that if you put on the highest possible tariff the number of people that Deputy Lemass suggests will be absorbed in industry.  The stoppage of the import of some articles which are of a fairly high value would not give very much employment.  He mentioned flour, which is a case in point.  It is admitted that although flour imports bulk largely and account for a large sum of money, if the import of flour were stopped by the imposition of a tariff very little extra employment would result. As a matter of fact, it is even arguable, although some people at present employed might be put on whole time, whether additional persons would be employed as a result of the stoppage of the import of flour, because larger units would be created, units where a less amount of employment would be given per thonsand sacks, or per any other quantity.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>When it is said that 13,000 people had been given employment as a result of the tariffs already imposed, there is no doubt that other people have got employment in subsidiary industries or businesses. If you have a large number of people employed in a particular industry in a town where there was no industry before, you are going to have grocers and bootmakers, and even bookmakers, employed consequentially, and the 13,000 persons, I do not think, represent by any means the full number of those in employment who would not be employed if tariffs had not been imposed.  I do not want to get involved in a tariff debate, but I think I should state my view again, that any group of tariffs do result in an increase of cost to the consumer.  You can find individual tariffs that may not result in an increased cost.  There are <Col N="1756" /> individual tariffs in operation here which have not resulted in any additional cost to the consumer, whether we reckon the cost in a higher price or in an inferior quality supplied. There are tariffs which have resulted in no extra cost to the consumer, but other tariffs have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think somebody mentioned boots. It is very difficult to show in individual cases whether an extra cost has fallen on the consumer or not, and, if an extra cost has fallen on the consumer, what it amounts to. I mentioned a long time ago in this House that home boot manufacturers were with very great difficulty able to compete with outside boot manufacturers.  I mentioned that in many cases where contracts for army boots were being given they had to be given to outside firms, because, even when fifteen per cent. had been added to the price of the outside firms, it was still substantially lower than the lowest tender put in by any Irish manufacturer.  Only the other week I saw a list of prices submitted by firms tendering for the supply of army boots and boots for Post Office messengers, and I saw that several English firms, in the case of one of these contracts, quoted at prices which, even when fifteen per cent. had been added, were substantially lower than the lowest price which an Irish firm had put in, not a mere sixpence or anything like that, but substantially lower.  When one sees that happening again and again, it is impossible to resist the conclusion that the tariff, say, in the matter of boots, is actually resulting in an increase to the consumer.  So far as the foreign boots are concerned, of course, that increase does not matter, because anything extra that the consumer is paying in respect of foreign boots will go into the Exchequer and is serving to prevent some other tax being put on, just as when the boot tax was first introduced the revenue which was obtained from that tax enabled the tax on tea to be taken off.  But so far as Irish boots are concerned, the position seems to be that the consumer is paying about the fifteen per cent. more than he would otherwise pay, and the Exchequer is getting nothing out of it. <Col N="1757" /> There is there a direct subsidy which is being paid by the general consumer to keep the boot factories in operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarney" hpid="Mr. Carney Mr. Carney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister what price was quoted for boots for the Army or the Post Office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to tell the price.  I would not mind letting any Deputy privately see the price of a contract which had been given, say, two or three years ago, which would not affect tendering in future, but I would not like to show the last price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister mind if I told him the price quoted for boots for the Army in the past?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The position, as I say, as far as it can be judged, is, that an actual subsidy is being paid, and I believe will for long continue to be paid, by the consumer to the home boot manufacturer.  If the boot manufacturing industry really establishes itself here, as I hope it will, a point will be reached when the boot factories will be able to carry on, and there will be sufficient competition amongst themselves to enable them to hold the trade of the country and to reduce their prices to something like the outside level.  If and when that takes place, we will have a considerable body of employment given throughout the country at no cost to the consumer.  Meantime what is actually happening is that for the development of that industry the public at large is being taxed.  I believe that while there are exceptions, and perhaps we can point to exceptions already, and while if a general scheme of tariffs were adopted, more exceptions would be seen, the general result would be that the actual cost to the consumer would be increased.  That is that the amount which the consumer would pay would be substantially greater than anything that would come into the revenue; the additional amount <Col N="1758" /> he would pay for the goods would be substantially greater than the amount coming in to the revenue and the taxpayer would be compelled to pay to these various industries a subsidy for as long as they were unable really to compete with outside firms in order to help them to develop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we put on a general tariff, as suggested by Deputy Lemass, we would get a substantial amount of additional employment in industry. If the tariffs were high enough we would get that increase fairly rapidly.  If the tariffs were moderate it would be slow.  But if the tariffs are very high and almost prohibitive in their nature we would get that increase very rapidly but subject to a certain handicap.  If we put 100 per cent. on boots instead of 15 per cent. the immediate result would be that firms would rush in, and companies would be established, which would buy up existing buildings anywhere and would put in machinery, almost regardless of cost, anxious to get into the market and get a share of the profit while the going was good.  We would have factories very badly laid out, over-capitalised, and all sorts of commitments entered into which would burden the industry for all time.  If we put on such a tax as 100 per cent. we could within a few years have seven or eight thousand people employed in the boot industry, but we would have done something that would mean that the price of boots would remain, for as long as the tariff lasted, higher than the price of boots in England or the price here if there were free imports.  We would have that industry getting a permanent subsidy from other industries in the country.  If we similarly put a tariff on other industries each of these would impose some burden on the boot industry, and make it difficult for it to carry on.  Besides, if we had 75 or 100 per cent. increase in the price of boots it would undoubtedly be a very substantial burden on other people and would make it difficult for them to carry on.  It would mean that capital helping to enable a small firm to be <Col N="1759" /> carried on would be eaten up by this additional and great increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>I believe, again, if we went in for this policy of wholesale tariffs with a view to a rapid solution of the unemployment problem we could not solve that problem.  It is quite possible that the result of that particular thing would be greater unemployment in the country rather than less, because of the fact that people would be squeezed out of agriculture and out of any odd industry, if any were left, which was not tariffed, and we would be in the same position as before with this permanent burden of overhead charges arising from the uneconomic methods of starting industries.  I believe if good results are to be got from tariffs we should not look for too speedy results.  We should not put on tariffs more than will enable an industry to get established if everything is done in the most economical way possible.  Industry can only carry on if every care is taken to establish factories on reasonable sites, to give them a proper lay out, and to avoid burdening them with unnecessary initial charges.  I believe these are the methods whereby industries can be increased.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it is possible by tariffs to get a speedy remedy for unemployment.  I believe that while the State may do many things&mdash;and the State has done a great many things to help industry and give employment&mdash;the main work can only be done by private firms, individual business men or groups of business men developing manufacturing industries here.  I believe if the State could find fully reproductive expenditure the State should enter into it. The State should have a look out for schemes such as the Shannon scheme or any other scheme which seems reasonably certain will repay what is laid out upon them.  If this State could devise or find any such scheme it ought unhesitatingly to enter upon it.  I think it is reasonable for the State to do a certain amount of work which is not fully reproductive in <Col N="1760" /> order to give some relief when unemployment is exceptionally acute or when there is any special circumstance that aggravates the evil.  But I do not think we could solve it by carrying out public works on a great scale or at great expenditure or by any scheme such as wholesale protection. I think a certain alleviation could be effected but what we have got to do, in the main, is to promote and assist and encourage private enterprise to develop and to extend industries which are already in existence and to find new industries.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee, I think, asked for a reduction in expenditure and for the owner of private business to be assisted.  When Deputy Lemass is asking for great schemes to be carried out by the Government he is almost asking for a disregard of the persons conducting private business and suggesting that the whole thing should be taken on the shoulders of the State.  If we really decided to take the main burden upon the shoulders of the State I think we must assume it should be taken almost entirely upon the shoulders of the State because if we are having great increases in taxation and great schemes of new works then there will be no hope that very much will be done by individual firms.</P>
    <P>We would be raising new difficulties before them every day.  On the other hand, I do not think it is practically possible to say that it is all a matter for the private business man. I have heard people put up very extreme views in that respect.  I have heard people say that all sorts of common services should be abandoned, or almost abandoned.  I have heard people suggest that the whole of the Insurance Acts should be repealed. I do not think that that is practicable.  I do not think that it is possible to abandon these social services.  I have heard people urge that except primary education all other sorts of education should be left to private individuals.  I do not think that that is practicable either. I do not think that it is going to give good results.  Consequently, I think that there is no policy that could be more effective than the policy that <Col N="1761" /> has been pursued up to the present, a policy of carrying out schemes like the Shannon scheme, which we calculate to be fully remunerative, schemes like afforestation, arterial drainage, and small drainage schemes, which are reckoned to be partially reproductive, encouraging housing, partly to give employment and partly to improve the health of the people, and for other social reasons&mdash;doing these things concurrently with the giving of protection to industries, after the best type of investigation that could be carried out, the provision of facilities, for what they are worth, under the Trade Loans Act and other measures of the same kind.  I cannot see that simply putting down our heads and taking some course, irrespective of the consequences of pursuing that course, numerous indirect consequences, will help us at all.</P>
    <P>I think that if what is being done in regard to unemployment is to be improved it is to be improved, not by adopting some entirely different method, but by bettering the details of the method which we have already adopted, by thinking out new reproductive schemes, by trying to get local authorities and others to do more on their side in connection with the housing problem, by generally tightening up details bringing other elements in the community, both local authorities and private individuals, in to help, and making them conscious of their duty in the matter.  I do not, however, think that it is possible to find any royal road towards the solution of the grave problem of unemployment. That problem is rampant in many countries and in countries where we do not find it we find conditions in many respects radically different from our conditions.  In some countries where there is less unemployment the extra work is secured at the price of very much poorer standards of pay and much poorer standards on the part of the workers. In some countries, unemployment is, at any rate, partially solved in that way.  I do not think that we can very rapidly get rid of this terrible evil.  I think that one of the reasons <Col N="1762" /> for unemployment here, although perhaps very often we see a manifestation of the evil more clearly in towns, lies in the effect of the depressed conditions in England on our agriculture.  I do not know how we are to avoid suffering for a long time from the effects of the depressed conditions in England.  This country is mainly agricultural.  It is not an economically well-balanced country and remedies that may be immediately available in countries well-balanced economically, countries with industries substantially developed, would not be effective in a country which had not yet reached that stage.  If we had big industries here we could do things for agriculture which we cannot do now, because, if we do them now, we would be taking the money out of one pocket of the agriculturist and putting it into another pocket.  We are dependent on agriculture and we can only solve our problems by improvising industry.  Industry, if it is to be a source of wealth, rather than a burden, must grow and must have the time it requires to grow on sound lines.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister say whether there is any possibility of money from the Local Loans Fund being advanced for housing at a lower rate of interest in the near future in view of the fact that the bank rate has been reduced by one and a half or two per cent. since the annuity was fixed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that there is any possibility of that.  The annuity was fixed not with a view to the prevailing money rates, but with a view to the rates of interest at which the Government has to borrow. I think, having regard to the conditions under which we must borrow, to the price at which the loan is issued, to the cost of issue, including advertising and anything else that may fall to be met, the repayments of the loan, the interest and other burdens which fall on the Exchequer, also the fact that the loan to the local authority will be given over a longer period than that for which the Government has borrowed, <Col N="1763" /> and that the Exchequer will have to meet the difference in the rates of repayment&mdash;there may be a fractional difference but I do not think that any less rate would be what I may call a business rate.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Minister whether in pursuing the policy which he mentions, of assisting and encouraging Irish industries, he has ever considered the advisability of carrying out a national drive to persuade the Irish people to buy Irish goods, or of devoting a sum of, say, £10,000 for carrying out a drive of that kind by advertising or otherwise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great difference of opinion about that.  I have not much belief in its efficacy, but I think the President has some belief in its efficacy.  While you might get some people to buy Irish goods by action of that kind, there is just a possibility that you would convince other people that Irish goods were not up to the mark.  A boot manufacturer told me that when, in certain shops which he controls, he marked boots with the name of the firm, he could not sell them, but when he marked them A. B. and Co. he sold them all right, because they were not known as Irish goods. I do not profess to say what the effect of such propaganda would be, but I have been told that while the campaign which was carried on for years in favour of Irish goods had the result of making a certain number of people go to great trouble and even expense in order to secure Irish goods, it had on other people the effect of making them feel that there was something fishy about Irish goods.</P>

      <P>There is just one question.  How can the Minister reconcile his attitude in regard to the question of supplying boots to the Free State Army with the attitude he took up when I was Chief Supplies Officer to what is now called the National Army?  When they were offered 50,000 pairs of boots, cast American Army boots, at 5/- a pair, they would not take them because they were not of Irish manufacture.  Now the Minister tells me that they are taking foreign boots because they are cheaper than the boots made by Irishmen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it needs to be, but then I suggest to the Deputy that he should put down a question on the various points in connection with the Road Fund on which he wants information.  I think it hardly arises in this debate, and the Minister for Local Government is not here.  I do not think that it was arranged that the sum would be paid in any one year.  I believe from recollection that there was a period of years laid down.  I think the Deputy should put down a question in regard to the matter.  In regard to the question which Deputy Corry raised, for instance about Irish bacon, although I did not discuss it at great length, I believe it has been discussed at great length in the Dáil.  The real point of the matter is that a tariff on American bacon would do the farmer no good, and it perhaps would deprive <Col N="1765" /> large numbers of people of the sort of bacon they want.  If the sort of bacon they want were to be supplied from home factories it would introduce certain complications, because I understand that home factories have really complained that Irish farmers, or at least a certain number of them, do not produce pigs exactly of the weight and in the condition in which they want them.  If you are to have a farmer taking out his pigs in the condition and at the right size for the bacon factories for the existing trade, and producing other pigs for home use, you are probably not going to help the export trade, and there is any amount of trade to be done in the export of bacon.</P>

      <P>Last Thursday I was endeavouring to show the cost of the Seanad and Dáil at present as compared with the cost of Government before the setting up of the Free State. Another matter that weighs very heavily with Deputies in coming to a decision on this Bill is the fact that the mode of election to the Seanad has been changed by recent legislation. That convinces me that in the very near future the Seanad will be nothing more or less than a mere creature of the Dáil since the members of the Seanad will depend very much for their election to the Upper House upon the votes of members of the Dáil.  Speaking generally on this Bill, I think that Deputies should keep before their minds the present economic position of the country, and they should do something in the way of reducing taxation.  There has been a tendency during this debate more or less to raise a smoke screen around this Bill.  References have been made to party funds and how these funds were acquired.  I am not going to enter into that part of the discussion.  The Bill is a very simple one and it requires a very straight and definite answer.  I think the country expects that Deputies will vote for the measure.  The country is looking forward to some tangible proof of the bona fides of Deputies when they state that taxation should be reduced.  They have now an opportunity of reducing taxation.  So far as I am concerned I have no hesitation in supporting this Bill.  I believe it will be only the beginning of a policy of retrenchment which is so badly needed if this country is to get back to a prosperous condition.</P>

      <P>The only consideration that should make people decide whether they vote for or against this Bill is whether the State is justified in paying £360 a year to members of a merely criticising body.  The Seanad, I admit, makes useful criticisms at times, but they have no executive powers.  The Seanad cannot interfere with Money Bills, I understand.  They have, theoretically, powers to hold up legislation for a short period of time; but really it amounts to this, that it is only a criticising body. Moreover, the members of the Seanad are more or less recruited from the leisured classes, and I doubt very much if a single member of the Seanad would resign if Deputy Thrift's Bill becomes law; in fact, my opinion&mdash;and I go further than Deputy Thrift&mdash;is that we would get a better body of critics if the members of the Seanad were not paid at all.</P>
      <P>I agree with a great deal that Deputy Mathews said on Friday, but he was very inconsistent.  He pleaded for economies.  He said every mickle makes a muckle, and then he told us he was going to vote for this mickle.  Apparently he is the inventor of a new theory, that half a loaf is worse than no bread. I hope, however, that when he comes to reconsider his decision he will change his mind about the way in which he will record his vote.  I take it that as this is a Private Deputy's Bill the Government forces and the forces of the chief Opposition, Fianna Fáil, will not be marshalled and that everyone in the House will be free to give his opinion as to what he thinks is the proper course.</P>

      <P>I shall not detain the House for many minutes, because there are really only two points that I want to make.  The first point is in answer to the different criticisms that have been made on the Bill.  I think that the one point really answers them all&mdash;whether it is a point like that of Deputy Law, who objects to our dealing with Senators and not dealing with ourselves, or a point made by a Deputy like Deputy <Col N="1770" /> Esmonde, who, with much misplaced ingenuity, tried to find abstruse reasons for the introduction of the Bill.  In fact, every criticism that was made against the Bill is answered by one single point, and it is this.  I want the House to consider the state of things in 1928, and the point I am making is so simple and clear that it can be argued almost with mathematical precision. In 1928 the Dáil and Seanad held that the circumstances and the expenses of Deputies and Senators were such that equal allowances were justified for both.  In 1928 a Bill was passed into law which altered those circumstances in favour of Senators.  It altered them in a very substantial way, because in future Senators are to be elected without the very large expense of election which then prevailed.  Therefore, I contend it is perfectly clear that, if the circumstances were such as to justify equal allowances before 1928, in the autumn of 1928, when we altered those circumstances, we made the position such that the Senators cannot any longer justify equal allowances.  On the Committee Stage of the Bill, if the Bill ever gets to a Committee Stage, it will be for the House to say whether the figure mentioned in the Bill is a proper figure to which the allowances of Senators should be reduced.</P>
      <P>It seems to me to be perfectly and mathematically clear that if you make an alteration which alters the circumstances in favour of the Senators, that should be accompanied by a corresponding alteration in the allowances they are to receive.  That is the reason why this Bill was introduced.  This Bill was introduced immediately after the Bill had passed into law which made an alteration in the method of the election of Senators.  Senators are no longer put to the expense of circularising a huge constituency; they are to be elected in the future simply by the votes of the Dáil and the Seanad, a method without expense to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point I wish to make is really a consequence of the first. So far as I am concerned, I would be <Col N="1771" /> prepared, on the Committee Stage, to accept an amendment that this reduction should take place for future Senators only.  I wish to emphasise that what I have stated is the real reason for the introduction of the Bill.  I am prepared, as I have said, to accept an amendment by which this will apply to future Senators only.  That is simply stated on my own responsibility.  I do not know whether the other Independent Deputies will take that view or not.  I state that as my own view and I put it forward as a confirmation of the main argument which I have given as the reason for the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill is capable of amendment <Col N="1772" /> on the Committee Stage in at least these two ways.  As for the main principle of the Bill which we are discussing here on the Second Reading, it seems to me to be unanswerable that if before 1928 the circumstances justified equal allowances&mdash; and I have no doubt that the Dáil and Seanad were right in saying their circumstances justified equal allowances&mdash;then when you alter those circumstances in favour of Senators I submit that you should correspondingly diminish their allowances. I think the case for the Second Reading is unanswerable, and I ask the House to give the Bill a Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the Second Reading of this Bill.  This Bill is not intended to represent the Fianna Fáil policy in the matter of old age pensions.  It is intended to remove certain sections of the Old Age Pensions Acts that are being interpreted by the Free State Government to the disadvantage of the very poorest classes in the community. The Bill, I think, embodies such changes in the law as can scarcely be opposed by the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  If a fair and reasonable interpretation were being put on the Old Age Pensions Acts, many of the sections dealt with in this Bill might not be interfered with, but from my knowledge of the interpretation being put on them and from certain knowledge gained largely by an interest in appeal cases there appears to be no alternative way of securing even the benefits that the British Old Age Pensions Act intended for the poor.  There seems to be no means of getting these benefits unless by carrying out the amendments which this Bill proposes. I notice that the Press predicts a strenuous opposition to this Bill.  The political correspondents, who are usually better informed of the policy of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government than some of the members of the party, are already preparing the way by informing the public that the passage of this Bill would involve an additional expenditure of £250,000 a year, and that responsible Ministers of the Executive are not prepared to increase expenditure under this head by an amount that is less than ten per cent. of the present expenditure. I do not know whether these forecasts of the policy of the Department of Finance are correct, but if that turns out to be the Government attitude on the matter, we on these benches will presumably satisfy the House and the Executive Council that the money can be found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first part of Section 2 of this Bill aims at repealing paragraph (d) of sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the Act of 1911.  This paragraph sets out that in calculating the means of a person, account shall be taken of the yearly value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by that person. When the British Government administered the Old Age Pensions Acts in this country this paragraph was interpreted in accordance with the obvious intention of the law, and a benefit or privilege that was not enjoyed as a legal right was not taken into account in calculating the means of the claimant.  I have reason to believe that the Free State Department of Local Government was prepared to continue that interpretation of the law, but that the Department of Finance insisted on the view that a benefit or privilege enjoyed by a claimant must be taken into consideration in calculating the <Col N="1775" /> means of that claimant even when such benefit or privilege is enjoyed as a matter of charity or extended as a matter of sentiment.  That view of the law hits at the very poorest classes of the community and the people who possess nothing whatever as a legal right are deprived of a pension because some charitably disposed person or organisation will not allow them to go without the necessaries of life.  It appears to me that this interpretation is not only harsh but it is nothing short of disgraceful from a Government that claims to be national, and in my opinion, at any rate, it is as absurd as it is cruel.</P>
    <P>Various other sections of the Old Age Pensions Act of 1911 set out the basis of calculation of means, and in order that we may understand that the ordinary means that a person might have will still be taken into consideration in calculating the means if this sub-section or paragraph is repealed, I will read Section 2 of the Act of 1911, which deals with the calculation of means. Sub-section (1) of Section 2 states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In calculating, for the purpose of the Principal Act, the means of a person, account shall be taken of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the yearly value of any property belonging to that person (not being property personally used or enjoyed by him) which is invested, or is otherwise put to profitable use, by him, or which, though capable of investment or profitable use, is not so invested or put to profitable use by him, the yearly value of that property being taken to be one-twentieth part of the capital value thereof;</P>
    <P>(b)  the income which that person may reasonably expect to receive during the succeeding year in cash, excluding any sums receivable on account of an old age pension under this Act, and excluding any sums arising from the investment or profitable use of property (not being property personally used or enjoyed by him), that income, <Col N="1776" /> in the absence of other means for ascertaining the income, being taken to be the income actually received during the preceding year;</P>
    <P>(c)  the yearly value of any advantage accruing to that person from the use or enjoyment of any property belonging to him which is personally used or enjoyed by him, except furniture and personal effects in a case where the total value of the furniture and effects does not exceed fifty pounds; and</P>
    <P>(d)  the yearly value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by that person.</P>
    <P>I submit that all possible contingencies of income are covered by paragraphs A, B and C, and that this omnibus clause has been inserted lest by any mischance anything should have been overlooked.  If we turn to Section 7 of the Act of 1924 we find provision made for the transfer of certain properties.  We find that a person may transfer or assign a farm of land, the poor law valuation of which does not exceed £10. Such a person can apply for an old age pension in the knowledge that the income derivable from this farm of land will not be taken into account in calculating means.  There would have been no point whatever in making this provision that a person holding a farm of land of under £10 valuation can transfer that farm and apply for an old age pension without having the income from that farm taken into account if it were held to be necessary that the person to whom the farm was assigned would have to turn the old man or old woman, as the case may be, out on the road in order that they should qualify for a pension, and it would not, with the present interpretation put on paragraph D, be sufficient to turn out the old person on the road. In such case it would be necessary that they should be kept out and that no charitably disposed person should come to their relief with food or shelter, because if they did the yearly value of that would be calculated against them for old age <Col N="1777" /> pension purposes, and the average amount of such a calculation usually works out in actual practice at from 10/- to £1 per week.  I submit that this interpretation cannot be sustained and ought not to be sustained. Every poor person living in Ireland to-day must be in receipt of benefit or privileges, either from their own relatives or from charitable neighbours or charitable organisations, the yearly value of which, if estimated in cash, would be such as would deprive them of the maximum old age pension.</P>
    <P>The yearly value of food, clothing, shelter, Christmas boxes and charitable donations is taken into account and a true return made when a claimant applies for the old age pension. I submit that nobody, however poor he might be, could become entitled to a pension in these circumstances, because, if he was to live at all, the yearly value of these benefits and privileges would be bound to exceed £15 12s. 6d. per year, 6s. per week, or 10½d. per day.  The poorer the person is the more harshly does this section operate against him.  A person who is absolutely destitute is hit more harshly by this interpretation of paragraph (d) than if he had moderate means.  For example, if a man owns a small farm of land under £10 valuation, or even under £5, and he applies for an old age pension, the pension officer will make a certain estimate of his income from that farm of land, and that will be the only income that will be estimated against him.  But if he has nothing whatever as a legal right, no means in this world unless what is extended to him as a matter of charity or sentiment by somebody else, the pension officer will estimate that he is worth from £26 to £52 per year by reason of the fact that somebody else is looking after him.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary to develop that point further.  I think a case cannot be made against the repeal of that particular sub-section. If the Minister has any doubt as to the interpretation that is being put upon it, and if it is necessary to cite cases in support of my contention as to the interpretation of this particular <Col N="1778" /> sub-section, I shall cite cases. But I think the Minister for Finance might admit that there has been considerable controversy as to the interpretation of these sections, and this one in particular, between the Department of Local Government and the Department of Finance, and, as I said earlier, the Department of Local Government is prepared to continue the interpretation that was being put upon this section by the British Government, but the legal luminaries in the Department of Finance discovered that there was a legal way of making certain economies. For the sake of the dignity of the House, that we hear so much about, I hope there will be no opposition to the repeal of this particular sub-section.</P>
    <P>I do not profess to pretend that the repeal of this sub-section would not mean a considerable additional expenditure under the heading of old age pensions.  Many people who are not in receipt of old age pensions at present will become entitled to a pension; many people who have no means, but who are credited with maintenance by their friends or relatives, and are so deprived of a pension, will also become entitled.  Many other people who have small pensions will have their pensions increased.  But I claim that the additional expenditure under this heading is essential, and one that we cannot in all reason or decency refuse to meet.  The largest section of the community that would benefit by the repeal of the sub-section would be the small farmer with a valuation under £10; the man who can, under Section 7 of the Act of 1924, transfer his farm or assign it to his son, and not have the farm taken into consideration or the income from it calculated as means. It is no use to have that section of the Act of 1924 if the fact that the man is still allowed to live under the roof and is given food and shelter is to be estimated as means against him.  It is the same with an old housekeeper or servant who may have served a life-time in one place, and whose period of usefulness as a wage-earner comes to an end when <Col N="1779" /> she reaches 70 years of age.  I know of some such cases.  If such a person is to get a pension under the present interpretation of the Old Age Pensions Act, the master must turn her out on the roadside.  She may not have anything in her own legal right, but the benefit or privilege of living in the master's house will be calculated as being worth so much per year to her, depending on the degree of comfort enjoyed, not by the claimant, but by the master.</P>
    <P>Others who would benefit considerably if this were repealed are old people who perhaps in educating and placing some member of the family in a position in life where he or she is able to enjoy a certain degree of comfort, have reduced themselves in their worldly possessions and are practically destitute in their old age.  They may have a son or daughter who has got a position in life that enables him or her to live with a certain degree of comfort. Such a son or daughter may take in the old parents.  In other cases, a son or daughter returns from America after slaving for a life-time. The old home is redeemed, and the old person is taken into the house to live.  The benefit or privilege of living with such a son or daughter would be estimated as being worth anything up to £52 per year, depending on the success in life of the returned emigrant.  I think that was never intended by the Old Age Pensions Acts; it was never the intention of the law, and, as I said, it was not the actual working of the law until recent times.</P>
    <P>The practice of calculating charitable donations as income does not agree with the publicly expressed views of the Minister for Finance.  I notice some time ago that the Minister, when speaking of the work of the St. Vincent de Paul Society, is reported in the Press as having said: &ldquo;Any support given to the Society should not have any effect on what the State or the public authorities should do.  The work of the Society should only fill the gaps that must necessarily be left by the best scheme of public assistance.&rdquo;  I <Col N="1780" /> want the Minister to put these sentiments into operation in the matter of old age pensions.  The Minister for Local Government used to lecture us on the question of stern morality.  It is true that we have not heard anything about that lately &mdash;I suppose the Minister came to see the joke.  Anyhow, the position has to be faced that one of two things is happening at present: either many people are getting pensions who are not legally entitled to them, or many people who are getting pensions have got them by making a false declaration, because if this sub-section (d) were carried to its logical conclusion, nobody could live and not be in receipt of benefits or privileges, the yearly value of which would deprive him of a maximum pension.</P>
    <P>Section 2 also proposes to repeal paragraph (a), sub-section (1) 3 of the Act of 1919.  This paragraph enacts that persons otherwise qualified for old age pensions become disqualified on becoming an inmate of a poor law institution.  It is true that a person who enters a county home or other poor law institution for the purpose of receiving medical treatment can retain the pension for a period of three months, but if the illness extends beyond a period of three months that person loses the old age pension unless he comes out of the institution, whether cured or not.  If he becomes an inmate of a poor law institution and is not in the hospital department, such person loses the benefit of the old age pension merely the day he enters, because he enters a poor law institution. I think it ought not to require much argument to secure the removal of that sub-section from the Old Age Pensions Act.  It means that infirm and destitute people in this country must become paupers, and it makes sure that they shall remain paupers as long as they live. The reason I say it aims at securing that they shall remain paupers as long as they live will be found in the fact that a fresh application for a pension has to be made by such a person on leaving the poor law institution, and it may take two or three months to secure the re-establishment <Col N="1781" /> of the pension.  I cannot see how such a person can leave the institution and may have no one to look after him during the period which must elapse before the pension is restored.</P>
    <P>It is hard to see why those poor old people should be deprived of their legal rights because they have to enter a Poor Law institution.  They are legally entitled to the pension and the only reason why they are deprived of it is because of their destitution. I submit that such treatment of our poor people is no credit to us.  When these county homes were being set up some years ago those of us associated with that particular movement had hoped that the stigma of pauperism would be removed from our poor people.  That stigma cannot be very well removed so long as we allow this particular section to remain in the Old Age Pensions Act where it lays down that we must pauperise them.  Instead of allowing them to go into such institutions with their heads up, and enabling them to hand over their old age pensions to the local public bodies to pay for their maintenance, with the feeling of independence that their old age pension of 10/- per week would carry with it (which would be a more Irish way of dealing with the destitute poor), we deprive them of their legal rights and aim at securing that they must remain paupers in this Poor Law institution until they die.</P>
    <P>From another point of view it does not appear to me to be right or fair that those people should be made a charge upon the local rates.  They are legally entitled to a certain retiring allowance; their poverty has entitled them to it.  Why should they be deprived of their legal rights and their pensions taken away from them?  Why should these old people become a charge upon the local rates?  According to the Report of the Poor Law Commission under the present system the amount lost to the local rates is £50,000 per year. I think, seeing the tremendous lot of public attention given at present to the question of de-rating that that is <Col N="1782" /> a point that might be considered. Let us remove the stigma of pauperism from the poor people and incidentally relieve the rates of £50,000 per year.  Section 3 of this Bill aims at securing that on the death of one of a married couple both in receipt of the old age pension no steps shall be taken to deprive the survivor of the pension.  The Old Age Pensions Act provides that in the case of a married couple living together in the same house the means of each is taken at half the total amount.  When one of the couple dies the entire means may revert to the survivor.  Take the case where two old people are in receipt of 6/- per week pension each.  One dies; the entire means reverts to the survivor and instead of two 6/- pensions coming into that house, if the question is raised against the survivor's claim by the Pensions Officer the survivor will lose the pension and the whole 12/- will go.  The amount of money involved in effecting this amendment of the Pensions Act would be very small.  As it is, it appears to me to be a mean form of economy.  I suggest that so far from the worldly position of the survivor in the case I have mentioned becoming improved the position of such a person is considerably disimproved. If one of a couple of old age pensioners dies somebody must replace the person who is gone. The surviving old person will not have very long to live and will require to be looked after.  In my opinion, at any rate, the person who has passed away cannot be replaced to the survivor at that advanced age.</P>
    <P>I think it is a form of economy that should not be continued and that no Irish Government, even one that does not function for the whole of Ireland, should accept responsibility for the continuation of such a clause in a British Act.  I am quite sure that an Irish Government would never insert such a clause in an Old Age Pensions Act, but seeing that it was put there by an alien Government which had not much sympathy with the poor of this country, I think it is time that it was removed. <Col N="1783" /> There is just another point in relation to that.  That is that it will take probably two or three years' pension in such a case to pay for the immediate expenses, the funeral expenses, of the one who is gone.  If the survivor lives beyond that period I think the pension should be left alone.  When we consider that the question of providing pensions for widows and orphans received considerable attention from members of the House and that it is at the present time, we understand, receiving the consideration and attention of the Executive Council, it is hard to make a case against leaving a pension with a widow who is over seventy years of age.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of this Bill if carried would bring us back to the basis of calculation of certain income that was in operation under the British Government under the 1919 and 1911 Acts.  Section 2, paragraph 1 (a) of the Act of 1919 read as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In calculating for the purpose of the Principal Act the means of a person account shall be taken of &mdash;(a) the yearly value of any property belonging to that person (not being property personally used or enjoyed by him) which is invested, or is otherwise put to profitable use by him, or which, though capable of investment or profitable use, is not so invested or put to profitable use by him, the yearly value of that property being taken to be one-twentieth part of the capital value thereof.</P>
    <P>In 1924 the Minister for Finance carried an Amending Act which secured that the yearly value of such property would be taken as one-tenth of the capital value.  Let us see how that alteration in the law operates.  A claimant who had £300 in the bank would be credited with an income of £15 under the British Act.  Under the Act of the Minister for Finance such a claimant would be credited with an income of £30 per annum.  Another class of case is that of a man who invested his life savings in purchasing a house which, let us say, cost him £325.  Subsequently, <Col N="1784" /> owing to circumstances which he was not able to avoid, he found it necessary to leave that rather expensive house and live perhaps in a room in order that he might derive an income from the house in the form of rent.  He would be credited with an income of £30 per year, although the rent only brought him in £10, under the amendment of the 1911 Act carried by the Minister for Finance in the Act of 1924.  Under the British Old Age Pensions Act such a man would be credited with an income of £16 5s. a year.  There are many such cases, and if it becomes necessary to satisfy the Minister who is charged with the responsibility of opposing this Bill by citing cases, we will have to give some examples of how this provision operates.</P>
    <P>I think the greatest hardship in my experience under this alteration in the law is the case of a small farmer who is no longer able to operate his farm.  I have in mind such a case where the man concerned went into the county home.  He remained there for some months and while he was there his old house fell. When he came out of the county home he had to go to live with a relative. He was not able, of course, to operate the farm.  He remained living with the relative and let the farm yearly.  All he was able to get in the form of an old age pension was one shilling per week.  The pension officer admitted, everybody concerned in the case admitted, that the income derived from letting the farm was £13 per year.  The rates and the rent had to come out of that and he lived on the balance.  Here is where the amendment to the British Act came into operation to the disadvantage of this old man.  He was not operating his farm, and instead of taking the actual value derived from that farm, the capital value was taken under this particular section. The capital value was put down at something around £300, and his income being calculated as one-tenth of that, according to the lawyers in the Finance Department at any rate, he was left in possession of an income <Col N="1785" /> of £30 though his actual income was only £13.  Under the British Act this man would have got his full old age pension.  It was only after a great fight that we got him any pension at all, and we would not have got him any pension beyond the shilling per week were it not that we had the valuation of the farm reduced by reason of the depreciation in land.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill deals with sub-section (1) of Section 7 of the Act of 1924.  This is a rather complicated section.  Before the passing of Section 1 of the Act of 1924 a person could assign or transfer any property and become entitled to the old age pension without any such property being taken into consideration in the calculation of means.  In Section 7 of the Act of 1924 the Minister set out to put a limit to this privilege of assigning property and getting the old age pension without having such property taken into consideration.  He evidently intended by Section 7 of the Act to secure that three years must elapse before a person who had signed or transferred such property could claim an old age pension without having such property taken into consideration.  Now, owing either to faulty draftsmanship or the ingenuity of the legal luminaries in the Department of Finance, a loophole was found in the section, and it has been held, and it is now the universal interpretation of this particular section, that if a person who assigned certain property, say, a farm of land over £10 valuation, applies for a pension before the full three years has expired, such person becomes disentitled for life to a pension.  Now the Act never intended that.</P>
    <P>The events of 1924 are not such very ancient history, and the people who were associated with the passing of the Act will acknowledge that it was never intended that if a person made a technical mistake or did not take down the date upon which the transfer or assignment of certain property took place, or did not wait until the three years after such assignment had expired, that <Col N="1786" /> such a person should be disqualified for the rest of his life.  There are cases in which people who have transferred such property have applied one week before the full three years had expired, and they are deprived for the rest of their lives of a pension, whereas if they had waited that week they would have been entitled to the pension.  I think the Minister will agree that he never intended that that interpretation should be placed upon the section when he was getting this Bill, before it became an Act, through the House. I do not think anything so foolish could ever have been intended, and the amendment that I suggest here is meant to clarify the position. Whether the Minister will agree that it clarifies it or not, is another question. It has the disadvantage of being based on the existing clause, and I have no hesitation at all in admitting that anything based on it would be difficult to clarify.</P>
    <P>The latter part of Section 7 of the Act of 1924 provided that a farm of £10 valuation or under (including buildings thereon) could be transferred or assigned and a pension could be claimed or awarded without necessarily waiting for any period to elapse following the transfer or assignment.  My amendment aims at securing an extension of the privilege to owners of a farm of £12 valuation excluding buildings thereon. I have not put in the amendment &ldquo;excluding buildings thereon&rdquo; because I do not think it is necessary. If this Bill passes Second Reading and it is necessary to clarify the position by putting in these words, that can be done at a later stage, but in support of excluding the buildings I want to say that it appears to me that the buildings on an agricultural holding are as essential for the proper working of the holding as the farm implements are.  I do not think it is right or fair that the valuation of the buildings should be included under this particular head.  The inclusion of the valuation of buildings has the effect of penalising the small farmer who is industrious and thrifty and tasty, the small farmer who tries to <Col N="1787" /> improve the appearance of his holding, who perhaps builds additional outhouses and keeps the place in a fairly reasonable state of repair. As a result the valuation of his holding is increased.  That tends to give an advantage to the man who lets his buildings go derelict and so keeps down the valuation.  In the same way and for the same reason, a small farmer will be deterred from availing of the housing grants for the purpose of building new houses. If he avails of the grant and builds a new house, the valuation put on the new house will be much higher than that on the old house and that fact will operate against him when he comes to look for the old age pension.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has stated on more than one occasion that he looks forward to the time when the social advantages here and the economic conditions in the Twenty-Six Counties will bring about the undoing of partition.  It is interesting to compare the conditions as regards pensions existing in the Six-County area with the conditions existing in the Twenty-Six Counties. In the Six-County area widows' pensions and allowances for dependent children are paid to the widows of men who were insured under the Widows and Orphans and Old Age Contributory Pension Act, 1925. Widows' pensions are also payable to widows between the ages of 55 and 70 of men who died prior to the passing of the above-mentioned Act, notwithstanding that the deceased husband never contributed for pension purposes.  Both classes of widows' pensions are payable at the rate of 10/- per week and children's allowances are paid at the rate of 5/- per week for the eldest child and 3/- for other children. These children's allowances continue up to the age of fourteen or to the 31st July following the sixteenth birthday if the children remain in school.  Orphans' pensions at the rate of 7/6 per week are paid in respect of the orphans of a man or woman insured under the Pensions Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1788" /> These pensions continue payable to the age of fourteen or to the 31st July following the sixteenth birthday if the children remain at school. Contributory Old Age Pensions at 10/- per week are paid at the age of 65 to persons insured under the Pensions Act.  The wife of a man who is entitled to one of these pensions also receives a pension on attaining the age of 65.  The pensions continue to the age of 70 when they are replaced by the usual &ldquo;over seventy&rdquo; pension free from all tests as to means.</P>
    <P>Now compare the conditions with regard to the ordinary old age pensions with the conditions here. The yearly income which a person may have and yet be entitled to a full pension is much less in the Free State than in Northern Ireland. The limit for a 9/- pension is £15 12s. and if the yearly means exceed £39 5s. he cannot receive any pension. In the Northern area a person may possess an earned income of £26 5s. and an unearned income of £39, or £65 5s. in all, and yet receive 10/- a week, whilst he might have £49 17s. 6d. of earned income and £39 of unearned income, or £88 17s. 6d. in all, and still be entitled to a pension of one shilling per week.  There is not much inducement to the North in the social conditions disclosed in that comparison. I submit that this Bill cannot in all reason be opposed and even if its acceptance by the Government involves an additional expenditure of £250,000 I say that that burden should be undertaken.  The passage of the Bill into law would greatly diminish the number of appeals and there would be a considerable saving in the matter of administration.  I think a reduction in the number of appeals has become more necessary now than it was before the order by the Minister for Local Government preventing Deputies from making personal representations on behalf of claimants.</P>

      <P>I rise to support this Bill.  I do so from a sense of duty which I consider I owe to the aged poor; I do so having due regard to the responsibilities which are imposed upon supporters of this Bill, and I do so because in my opinion the sections which this Bill proposes to repeal and the sections which it proposes to amend, were not framed in the best interests of the people of the country.  After Deputy Ward's speech, I do not think there is very much left for me to say.  However, I desire to draw the attention of the House to the more important sections of the Bill.  There is one section, Section 2, that I think is very necessary, because it proposes to repeal what I consider as a penal enactment, inasmuch as it penalises a recipient or claimant to an old age pension, because sometimes a relative of his takes him in and gives him a good bed.  Let us take a concrete case, the case of an old age pensioner whose son or daughter goes to America and returns, starts a little shop and gets fairly well-to-do.  If this son or daughter brings in the old age pensioner to his or her house, the pension officer comes around, looks at the house, says it is a fine house and questions the old man as to whether he is boarded there.  Then he calculates the means, and, I daresay, the pension officer would calculate it at 10s., 12s., or 15s., as the case may be. At any rate, the pension is reduced, if not taken away altogether from the old man.  That is what happens when charitably-disposed persons give shelter to old people rather than having them wandering around the country.  If the old person leaves his home and goes to live in a hovel he gets the full pension, but if he is taken care of by his relatives or by charitably-disposed persons and given shelter, he is deprived of his pension.  I think that section should be repealed.  It is driving a wedge <Col N="1790" /> into the good relationship existing in families.</P>
      <P>[<i>An Ceann Comhairle resumed the Chair.</i>]</P>
      <P>Let us take the case of a farmer who has ten or twelve cows.  He has a brother who did not go to America. At the age of 70 that brother is unable to do any more work, and there is nothing for him except he goes into the workhouse.  His brother does not like to see him going to the workhouse and he decides to take him into his house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a commodious house and the pension officer comes along and starts off calculating means.  Perhaps he will put it at 10s. or 12s. a week and he thereby deprives the poor old man of his pension or at any rate of most of it.  I think all fair-minded people will agree that this section should be repealed. Let us come to paragraph (a) of sub-section (1) of Section 3 of the Act of 1919.  That deals with the case of the person who goes into the workhouse. There are many pensioners in the country who go into the workhouses in the winter time and stay there a couple of months.  Perhaps it is that the accommodation outside is not so comfortable and they prefer the treatment they get in the workhouse. They should not be deprived of their pensions and it is wrong so to deprive them.  Of course, they should be made to pay for their keep, but then over and above that they would have a couple of shillings a week left for tobacco; they could walk out occasionally and have a little comfort.  Sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the Bill says: &ldquo;In calculating the means of a person being one of a married couple living together in the same house, the means shall be taken to be half the total means of the couple, and the subsequent death of either of such couple shall not operate to decrease the pension already awarded to the survivor.&rdquo;  I think the loss of a partner is sufficient hardship besides inflicting the additional hardship caused by way of depriving the old person of the pension.  I think <Col N="1791" /> one calamity is enough without having a second.  I hope the members of this House will view this matter from the same angle as I do.</P>
    <P>We propose that paragraph (2), sub-section (1) of Section 5 of the Act of 1924 should be amended to read as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(ii) the yearly value of so much of the capital value of the said property as exceeds the sum of twenty-five pounds shall be taken to be one-twentieth of the capital value thereof.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand at all how the framers of that Act of 1924 put down 10 per cent. as the income to be derived from any investment while the Government themselves are paying only 5 per cent. on money invested in the National Loan.  In the face of that I cannot see how the framers of the Bill came to the conclusion that people claiming old age pensions or in receipt of them were getting 10 per cent. interest on whatever money they might have invested.  As a rule, any money that these people may be possessed of is deposited in the bank.  Should they have a couple of hundred pounds they have it on deposit in the bank, and the most they can get <Col N="1792" /> for it there is 2½ per cent.  That is a ridiculous section anyway.</P>
    <P>Now we come to sub-section (1) of Section 7 of the Act of 1924.  I think that is a section which is simply putting a premium on filthy unsanitary conditions.  Let us take the case of a man aged 67 years, a farmer with a valuation of £9.  He intends to get his son married.  At the time he is living in a thatched house, we will say, consisting of two rooms with a loft.  I am now speaking of the conditions that prevail in country districts.  This man intends to get his son married, and in order to do so he has to improve his house. He raises the walls and puts on a slate roof.  The reviser comes along and puts an extra valuation of £2 10s. on that holding, thereby raising the valuation to £11 10s., and thus depriving that man for ever of his pension.  Not alone does the man have to pay extra rates because of the improvement to his dwelling, but he is in addition penalised to the extent that he gets no pension because he is so industrious as to improve his dwelling.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
