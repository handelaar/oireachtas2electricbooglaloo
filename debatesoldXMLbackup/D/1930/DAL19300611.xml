      <P>asked the Minister for Finance to what purpose the proceeds of the excess charges imposed under the Totalisator Act upon bookmakers for admission to racecourses on which the totalisator is in operation are being devoted; further, if the Minister is aware that most of the Executives impose the maximum charge permitted under the Act; if he is further aware that according to the Report of the British Betting Control Board the proceeds of similar charges made on British racecourses are applied to purposes of racing, such as the assistance of the horse-breeding industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Totalisator Act the Executives of racecourses on which the totalisator is in operation are obliged to provide accommodation for licensed bookmakers and are limited as to the extent to which they may charge such bookmakers <Col N="786" /> for admission.  I understand that most of the Executives impose the maximum charge permitted under the Act.  I have no information as to the purposes to which the proceeds of these charges are being devoted, but it is reasonable to assume that they are being devoted to the same purposes as the ordinary admission charges and that they thus contribute to the upkeep of horse racing.  I am not aware that according to the Report of the British Betting Control Board the proceeds of similar charges made on British racecourses are applied to purposes of racing, such as the assistance of horse breeding: in fact it is stated in paragraph 22 of the Report of the Racecourse Betting Control Board for 1929 that it was agreed that the owners of racecourses should have free disposal of the funds received from the additional charges made by them to bookmakers.</P>

      <Col N="789" /> Cavan have been lodged in the Land Commission under the provisions of the Land Act, 1923, but it is not possible at the present stage of the proceedings to say when the lands will be vested in the tenants.  The Land Commission are at present dealing with the Farnham estate, and hope within the next few months to be in a position to publish a provisional list of the lands which will vest in the Land Commission on the appointed day.  There are difficult questions of drainage, turbary, etc., arising on the estate which must be settled before the provisional list can be published.  The Maxwell estate has not yet reached its turn to be dealt with under the purchase proceedings of the 1923 Act, but when so reached will be dealt with as rapidly as possible.</P>

    <P>Our legislation is quite in line with all that is required.

That particular Agreement is an administrative measure.  It asks us to establish an authority charged with the duty of centralising information relating to or facilitating the tracing and repressing of acts constituting infringements of their municipal laws as to obscene writings, drawings, pictures or articles, etc., and supplying information tending to check the importation of publications; communicating the laws that already have been, or subsequently may be, enacted in that regard.  We intend to establish the Department of Justice here as the authority for this purpose, and that Department has agreed to undertake the obligation.

      <P>I move amendment 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  In page 7, section 17 (1), line 62, to delete the word &ldquo;issue&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;acquisition.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of the amendment is slightly to extend the range of investments which might be purchased. If we could only purchase investments maturing twelve months from the date of issue it would be confined to Treasury Bills, whereas with the amendment it would be possible to purchase certain shortdated Treasury and Exchequer Bonds which would yield a much higher rate of interest.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;Where it appears to the Minister for Finance that the interest accrued during any year of account (whether ending before or after the passing of this Act) from the securities standing to the credit of the Post Office Savings Bank Fund exceeded the total of the interest paid or credited to depositors during such year of account in pursuance of the Acts relating to the Post Office Savings Bank and the expenses incurred in such year of account in the <Col N="795" /> execution of those Acts, the said Minister may in the next financial year after such year of account or (in the case of a year of account which ended before the passing of this Act) in the next financial year after the last of such years of account.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point I would like to say something with regard to Section 20 of the Bill which, owing to the exigency of time, I had not an opportunity of referring to on the Second Reading of the measure.  This is a section which, in fulfilment of the terms upon which the Third National Loan has been issued, gives the Minister authority to accept stock in that loan at par value in discharge of any death duties which may be due to the State.  This is an important special taxation privilege.  I have looked up the figures for the various years since 1926 and I find that, on the basis of the figures for Free State Government securities represented in the aggregate total of the gross personalities of estates dealt with by the Revenue Commissioners in the years 1926, 1927 and 1928, the total amount of stock likely to be presented for death duties in this way will be, I think, not less than £150,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of his Second Reading speech I think the Minister stated that the value of the privilege would be about £6,000 per annum; he apparently estimates, therefore, that the amount of stock thus presented will not be more than £100,000.  For reasons which I do not wish to go into in detail, because the figures are rather involved, I think that is a low estimate.  I am prepared, however, to split the difference <Col N="796" /> with the Minister and to assume that the total amount of Third National Loan securities which will be presented to the Exchequer in discharge of Death Duties will be about £125,000.  That is to say, the Minister will have presented to him stock to the nominal value of £125,000, for which he will only have received 93½ per cent. when it was issued, and which on acceptance by him will represent, therefore, a net loss to the Exchequer each year of about £8,100.  If we capitalised this on the terms on which the loan was issued we find that the present value of that amount, if it be paid each year, say, over a period of twenty years, is about £268,000, and that, I estimate, will be the total cost of this concession.</P>
    <P>What are we going to get for it? I think we will get nothing.  I think this is one of those concessions which are very like the ornaments which one sees upon a wedding cake; they appear to make it slightly more attractive but they add nothing to its value.</P>
    <P>First of all, the concession as to death duties is of very uncertain value to the recipient.  He does not know how soon his heirs will have the privilege of presenting stock, which he bought at 93½, to the Minister and getting credit from the Minister for it at £100.  Even a patriarch may be an optimist in this matter.  I certainly have no doubt that a person, who invested in this Third National Loan, even if he were ninety years of age, would still hopefully aspire to celebrate his centenary. We may be quite certain, therefore, that a person buying a loan with this kind of concession attached to it discounts it to the very uttermost.  I have absolutely no doubt that the concession in the particular case of our Loan, counted for nothing in the minds of most of the individual investors who purchased this stock, that it was something which the Minister simply gave away without getting any adequate value in return.  If you consider the fact which I have put before you that even the oldest of us hope to live <Col N="797" /> more than the allotted span, and if you also bear in mind that it is their heirs more than the individual purchasers of the stock who will benefit by a concession of this sort, you can see, as I have said, that this kind of concession makes the stock very little more attractive than it would be if the concession had not been attached to it at all. I submit that it would be far better for the Minister to have faced this matter boldly, and even if he had to fix the nominal rate of interest on the loan at a slightly higher figure it would be better and more straightforward to have done that, because both the State and the investor himself would know where they are.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the reactions of this matter upon the private individual. I have endeavoured to give the reasons why to my mind the concession is not very attractive to him. Neither is it of great attraction at first sight to the corporate investors. In many cases this Loan was purchased by corporations, insurance companies and banks, which will, in due course, I presume, proceed to unload a large amount of their holdings upon the market.  When they considered the terms upon which this Loan was issued they looked at the immediate return which it would give them.  The thing may appear to them as a kind of catch-penny concession which, as soon as its value becomes appreciated by a certain number of people&mdash;and that will take time&mdash;will enable them to dispose at a fairly substantial profit of the stock which they have purchased. A bank buying stock buys it upon the basis of its nominal rate of interest, in this case 4½ per cent., and upon nothing else.  In the course of a year or so it may proceed to dispose of it to its customers. There will be a certain number of elderly men to whom the manager may tactfully hint that it would be a good thing for them to transfer their holdings from the First or the Second National Loans into this, simply because of the fact that if by any chance they should pass away <Col N="798" /> at any date subsequent to six months after the transfer of the stock to them their heirs would get a very substantial benefit from the Exchequer. Some may accept that point of view and may buy.  But remember this will be merely a transfer, I submit&mdash; on the figures for the past three or four years&mdash;from one form of Government security to another. You will have people realising their holdings in First and Second National Loans and investing them in the 4½ per cent. Loan.  What will be the effect?  You will have the 4½ per cent.  Loan appreciate in the market and you will have the 5 per cent. Loan correspondingly depreciate. At the same time you will also have this effect, that every future Minister for Finance will have to accept at its face value stock which his predecessor issued at 93½ per cent.</P>
    <P>I think that is simply another case of what is being so often pointed out from these benches, of the Minister's predilection for mortgaging the future.  If he can tide over today he does not give a thought for to-morrow.  It does not matter to him that every year this will make it incumbent on his successors to find an extra £8,100 for which they receive no adequate return.  If there is anybody in the community who will get benefits from the concession in Section 20 it will be those large corporate investors who bought this stock in the hope that later on, when they could point out to individual investors the advantage that that section might afford them so far as their heirs' liabilities for death duties are concerned, who will be able to make a profit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be unnecessarily insistent, but I have asked the Minister two or three times to tell us exactly what is the financial significance of one clause in this Bill, the one which makes the Electricity Supply Board liable for income tax.  I asked the other day what amount of actual new obligations for income tax was put on this Board.  The contention by him was that the obligation was there all the <Col N="799" /> time.  The evidence of very competent lawyers to the Electricity Supply Board is that they did not think so, and the Board refused to pay it. We want to know what is the amount involved in the matter.  As far as I can see it the position is this, that the Electricity Supply Board, quite apart from the submerged assets, are concerned with the interest and the sinking fund of the two sums already voted by the Dáil, the six million pounds and the £2,500,000, which undoubtedly will be £3,000,000, and in the course of time possibly £5,000,000 or £6,000,000.  I asked the Minister whether they paid income tax on that, and he replied, &ldquo;Interest paid to the Exchequer will be allowed as an expense.&rdquo;  That is equivalent to the income of an ordinary firm functioning in the same way.  The interest which the Electricity Supply Board will pay upon their borrowed money is, as far as I can understand, exactly equivalent to the dividend which is paid by an ordinary company upon capital invested in that company.  The sinking fund would be equivalent to a repayment of capital.  Of the two it seems to me that interest on the actual capital is much more directly equivalent&mdash; at any rate is, at least, as directly equivalent&mdash;to profit.  The sum involved would be somewhere about £6,000,000, of which at least three-quarters would be interest, and probably less than one quarter would be sinking fund.  This clause ostensibly makes them liable for income tax and, according to the explanation given by the Minister, it makes them liable for one-fourth of the income tax.  That is as near as I can understand the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The actual income tax which they would be made liable to in this Bill, if they were an ordinary commercial firm, leaving out the submerged assets, would be, at least, £50,000 to £60,000.  It seems to me that £45,000 of that is not to be collected and possibly £15,000 is.  I think the Minister should tell us exactly what are the figures.  Another thing I am <Col N="800" /> not at all sure about is this, whether the Bill as it is now drafted does carry out the intention expressed by the Minister.  I have made certain enquiries on the subject and, certainly, authorities are not agreed that it will, in fact, do what the Minister says he intends to do in the answer he made to me.  I will read the answer again: &ldquo;Interest paid to the Exchequer will be allowed as an expense.&rdquo;  The Board will pay income tax on sinking fund and certain resources which it will create.  I am not at all sure that we will not need another Bill to remove doubts as to the difference between the ostensible meaning of this clause and the explanation given by the Minister.  I think that point ought to be cleared up.  We ought to be told the position exactly.  They can calculate very nearly from what they know of the resources and commitments of the Electricity Supply Board what is the income tax to which they are being made liable and what is the income tax from which they are being allowed to be exempt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee referred to Section 20.  All I have to say about his remarks on that matter is that he has drawn a picture of what is, in his opinion, likely to happen.  The examination that has been made on my behalf does not produce results that agree with the Deputy's anticipations.  I think there will be no such sum as £8,100 required any year by way of an advance from the Exchequer to the fund, which it is proposed to create under this section, and I think after a few years the amount that will be required to be advanced in any year will be very small.  It is obvious that if £100 were received in stock for payment of death duties, and if the price of the stock had advanced to 98, the amount to be found in any year would only be £2,000.  I believe, before the lapse of any great period, that no appreciable sum will be required, and that the total amount that will have to be advanced from the Exchequer under this section will reach a relatively small amount.  It depends, of course, <Col N="801" /> to some extent on the course of interest rates, and nobody can with absolute certainty foretell what the course of interest rates will be and, consequently, what will be the price of the Third National Loan after a few years.  But I confidently anticipate that it will rise very considerably above the issue price, and that long before the first redemption date it will be quoted at par.  When the point is reached that the Loan is quoted at par no loss will arise under this section, and I think the anticipations of the Deputy are not correct.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly the giving of this concession did influence considerably the terms on which it was possible to issue the Loan, and I am satisfied, and those who advised me are satisfied, that it was an advantage to the Exchequer to issue the Loan at the price at which it was issued rather than to refuse to grant this concession and to issue the Loan at a lower price or at a higher rate of interest.  With reference to the matter raised by Deputy Flinn, I have nothing to add to what I said already.  Obviously, the interest payable to the Exchequer on the advances made by the Exchequer will be allowed as an expense.  The amount on which interest will be chargeable or on which income tax will be chargeable is a matter which will depend on two or three factors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill.  Section 238 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, provides that the amount borrowed by sanitary authorities for the purposes of these Acts shall not exceed twice the annual valuation of the area that <Col N="802" /> is involved.  In the case of houses for the working classes, moneys borrowed for that purpose were included as part of the debt that had to be taken into consideration when estimating the borrowing powers of a local authority.  In the case of houses of the working classes, so far as urban districts are concerned, in 1908 moneys borrowed for that purpose were removed from under the scope of the Public Health Acts, so that debts on an urban district arising out of borrowings made for that purpose were not taken into consideration when the borrowing powers of the local authorities in connection with work under the Public Health Acts were being considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position, however, has remained that moneys borrowed for the purpose of building labourers' cottages are still taken into consideration when estimating the borrowing powers of a local authority other than that of an urban district.  The resultant position is, that in many cases where important works of drainage and sewerage are required in towns where there are town commissioners but not an urban district council, the limit of borrowing is exhausted, or very nearly exhausted, because of the fact that moneys borrowed for labourers' cottages are taken into consideration.  This Bill proposes to put moneys borrowed for the provision of labourers' cottages in the same position as moneys borrowed for the provision of houses for the working classes.  The position under this Bill will be this, that places like Balbriggan and Mullingar and some other places where waterworks and sewerage schemes are required and where it is not possible to allow them to raise money at the present time to carry them out because of the extent of the borrowings they have already undertaken, will now be able to undertake such works because moneys borrowed for the provision of labourers' cottages will be removed from consideration of the amount of their debt.  This restriction was placed at the very beginning in 1885.  While to some extent a restriction like it might be <Col N="803" /> warranted at the present moment, while removing it there will be full administrative examination of the general condition of affairs of local authorities before they will be allowed to borrow for public health purposes.  We are not running any risk that the borrowing powers of local authorities will be unduly exercised simply because we are taking off this restriction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the restriction that this Bill proposes to remove is one that ought to be removed. It is one, perhaps, that should have been removed a long time ago.  That the restriction was there may, perhaps, be one of the reasons why we have been so slow in developing sewerage schemes, water schemes and other schemes of that kind in various parts of the rural areas in the Free State.  I do not know whether the presence of that restriction had anything to do with the slowing down in recent years in the number of labourers' cottages that were built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister has the figures handy, we would be glad to know from him the number of labourers' cottages built in, say, the last five years.  My impression is that over the last ten years there has been a considerable drop in the number of cottages built.  Of course, there were more reasons than the presence of this restriction for the failure to build these cottages in recent years. This restriction probably affected the borrowing powers of local authorities in carrying out other matters as well as the building of labourers' cottages.  It would be interesting to know the number of labourers' cottages that have been built by local authorities in the last ten years, and particularly in the last five years. We hope that the removal of this restriction will have the effect of so increasing the borrowing powers of local authorities that the carrying out of works such as the Minister referred to&mdash;drainage, sanitation, water schemes&mdash;as well as the building of labourers' cottages, will be <Col N="804" /> expedited, and that local authorities will be encouraged to borrow largely for these desirable purposes.  On the whole, the proposal to remove the restriction is a good one and has our support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T. Murphy Mr. T. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to say that in my opinion it is not making the best use of Parliamentary time to introduce a Bill of this kind.  The Minister, in his very brief statement, in appealing for support for the Bill, said it was intended to remove the restriction in operation at present in the matter of rural housing, and that its passage would enable housing schemes for rural areas to be proceeded with.  I think the Minister, Deputy O'Kelly and most members of the House who are conversant with the affairs of local authorities must know that the real restriction in the way of providing houses for labourers in the country is not to be found in the reason given by the Minister.  The real reason, as the Minister must know, why these schemes are not being carried out is to be found in the refusal of the Minister's Department to provide the money to initiate schemes of rural housing.  While this Bill will only affect in a very small way probably a few areas, it seems to me to be a rather cruel joke that we should have Parliamentary time taken up with the discussion of a Labourers Bill that, even in its title, is entirely misnamed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought when I saw mention of this Bill in the newspapers the Minister was bearing in mind certain criticisms that were made here on the Local Government Estimate, and that in this Bill we were to have some contribution made by his Department to rural housing.  Members of local authorities are aware that month after month at meetings of the boards of health there are applicants numbering eight, nine or a dozen in many cases, looking for the tenancy of labourers' cottages.  The only opportunity local authorities have at the moment for providing houses of the kind is by making application to their treasurer&mdash;a local bank.  The real restriction to housing  <Col N="805" /> is to be found in the fact that money cannot be got on more favourable terms for a period of ten or fifteen years.  I wish to direct the Minister's attention to a report that appeared in the Press within the last few weeks as to the terms upon which the Board of Health in North Tipperary were able to obtain a loan for rural housing, and which the Department was not in a position to provide.  The Board of Health were able to get a loan from an English insurance company of a sum of money for sixty years at five per cent. for the purpose of building houses in Roscrea.  The Minister will find that the real restriction as regards rural housing is the difficulty of being able to obtain a loan on favourable terms.  The proper course to adopt is to withdraw the Bill and embody it in a subsequent Bill that will deal with the removal of obstacles to rural housing.  The provisions the Minister has inserted in the Bill are in some small way necessary, but they do not deal with urgent questions that should be dealt with in a Bill of this kind, if there is any desire to remove obstacles to rural housing, and which the Minister knows can only be removed in a certain way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support Deputy O'Kelly and Deputy Murphy in their demand that the Minister should have a definite policy to put before the House in this matter.  Last week I called attention to the fact that a number of small towns throughout the Free State are suffering very grievously by reason of the fact that their inhabitants are living in absolutely primitive conditions. I would like the Minister in his reply to state what is the responsibility of the county medical officers of health in this matter, and whether they have any power by which they can bring pressure to bear, with the Minister's assistance, upon local bodies to deal with these matters.  I am aware of the fact that the whole difficulty of dealing with this question lies in the fixing of the area of charge.  Now that the Minister is, as I understand, calling together a <Col N="806" /> national conference, he should take the opportunity of putting a strong case before the local bodies who have been very backward and he should point out to them that this work is one of the first importance, and work which must be done eventually.</P>
      <P>I support the previous speakers in their complaint that nothing has been done for rural labourers as far as we are aware.  At present whatever amount of work is available on the roads is the sole thing that the rural labourer can look to, as so far as work on the farms is concerned it is at a very low ebb.  The Land Commission should be expected to give some assistance to labourers, and where land is available if the labourers give proof of their industry they should have a right to get portion of the land.  It is the settled policy of the Land Commission not to give land to landless men. The excuse is there is not enough of land to go around to be divided amongst the congests or the uneconomic holders in the vicinity of the land that is being distributed. The effect of not having an alternative policy to providing allotments and cottages to rural labourers is that nothing has been done for them, while a good deal has been done for other sections of the community.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister should bear that in mind.  The small holders, and there are many of them in my constituency, who have only a few acres of land and no capital, no matter how good a character they may bear, find it impossible to get any land.  As these people are an asset, and a far bigger asset than the people who have hundreds of acres of land and give no employment, I appeal to the Minister to produce something definite and not merely to come along with a proposal to extend the borrowing powers of the commissioners, for that in itself means very little.  The resources that will be available to the local commissioners will be exceedingly small.  I think all sections of the House would like that the Minister would do something imaginative in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the appeal made by Deputy Murphy to the Minister.  I think the real reason the Minister has introduced the Bill is that in examining the accounts of the public bodies he has found innumerable cases where borrowing powers were exhausted, and that they were unable to proceed with drainage or waterworks schemes, or matters of that kind, and not that he is interested in the housing of rural workers.  Those who are members of public bodies have experience of the Minister's attitude towards the housing of the working classes in the rural areas. There have been appeals from almost all the public bodies in Ireland to extend the local loans and to give to the boards of health the same facilities as are given to the urban councils.  That would not settle the housing problem, but it would go a long way towards providing houses for agricultural labourers.  The Minister in his speech on the Local Government Bill gave the real reason why houses are not being provided when he said that the agricultural labourers are unable to pay an economic rent of 5/- or 6/- a week out of their wage of 10/-.  Then we will take the Minister's speech at the Chamber of Commerce when he gave an account of his stewardship to the very people who are opposed to building houses for the rural workers.  One of his supporters admits that if that is the only contribution of the Minister to the housing problem he sees no hope of its being solved.</P>
      <P>We have had experience of the Minister's inspectors where in order to satisfy certain elements in an area after private visits they refused to give land for the building of houses for agricultural labourers. The Minister stated he has no power, but surely he could bring in some Bill to give him power to override the decision of an inspector who is glorying in the fact that he has more powers now than the Minister.  This particular inspector was right.  He had in mind people of the same class as the members of the Chambers of Commerce.</P>

I would like to ask the Minister to tell us the number of boards of health that have applied for loans to build houses for rural workers on fifteen-year terms from the bank.  If the Minister gives the correct answer as to the number of Boards that have applied in the last two years, the Dáil will find that there is no necessity for this Bill, which is intended to encourage public bodies to look for loans for sewerage and drainage purposes.  If the Minister is so keen on housing, will he explain why no reply was given to a public body who sent on their plans in April last?</P>

      <P>Deputy Everett is quite right, and, if the talk on this Bill is a waste of Parliamentary time, as Deputy Murphy would say, it is not my fault, as the Bill is directed to enable public bodies who want to carry out public health work, and who are prevented from doing so owing to the fact that loans for labourers' cottages are counted as part of their debts, to carry out such work.  We are doing away with the restrictions which, as Deputy O'Kelly says, might have been done away with some time ago, but the necessity for that only arises now.  In reply to the remarks made on the housing side of the question and the restrictions that prevent labourers' cottages being built, I will first answer Deputy O'Kelly who asked the number of cottages that have been built.  The number built <Col N="809" /> before 1926 was 20,357, and before the 31st March, 1927, the total then built was 42,189.  By the 31st March last the total number of cottages, either built or provided for, that is, money allotted for them, was 42,303.</P>

      <P>I am enabling the House to put the figures which I propose to give in their proper perspective. Since 1924 the following cottages were provided for&mdash;County Cork, 45; County Dublin, 244; Laoighis, 5; Longford, 16; Offaly, 5; Meath, 40.  These are the numbers. With regard to the restrictions, I am, as I have said, only addressing myself in this measure to enabling local bodies, who want to go ahead with public health work, to do so. When we address ourselves to the Labourers Act there is another restriction which we will have to deal with and we will deal with it in a general Housing Bill later on.  There is a restriction of one shilling in the pound on the rates, extended to 1/3, where the Minister gives special powers.  There is also restriction of money.  Since July we have been providing local loans to urban authorities to build houses.  The commitments up to the present amount to about £230,000.  There is greater activity on the part of urban bodies in the matter of building houses for the working classes at present than there has been at any time since the Acts were passed.  Our urban housing problem is a much more insistent one than that in rural districts and we would be well advised to get some idea as to what we will be involved in, in the matter of loans to urban authorities, before we address ourselves to the question of rural authorities.  Deputies who quote my phrase on the question of rents are very near the most important point in the whole question. You cannot give local loans in rural districts for housing at the present cost of building and expect to rent the houses at from 1/2 to 1/6 a week.  As I have said, the labourers' <Col N="810" /> cottages question can be dealt with in a general Housing Bill.  There are certain restrictions on the matter that may be removed even if the Local Loans Fund were not open. That is no reason why this Bill should not be dealt with, as it is now being dealt with, to relieve a definite situation.  When you come to deal with towns like Roscrea, the essential to further houses in such towns is the provision of proper sewerage and proper water supply.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the Second Reading of this Bill. The Local Government (Dublin) Bill provides that a register of commercial electors shall be prepared in accordance with the franchise enacted in that Bill, that the election shall be held on that register, and that while such election shall be held as a separate election it shall be held approximately at the same time as the election on the ordinary register. The Bill provides machinery under which the register will be prepared and such election carried out.  It deals principally with three points. <Col N="811" /> First as regards the franchise.  It clears up under Section 2 for the registration officer the persons who shall be entitled to vote in respect of different classes of premises.  The registration officer and the returning officer will be the Dublin City Manager and Town Clerk.</P>
      <P>In the second place as regards the register, the Bill makes provision by which the register of the commercial electors shall be prepared in practically the same way as the ordinary register.  The register will only be prepared in those years in which there will be an election.  The register will be published not later than the 1st June in any year and will contain the names of persons who were qualified to be on that register on the 15th November previously. The register will be formed in the same way.  There will be the same house-to-house inquiry and the registration officer will have the same responsibility for having a full and proper register as he has in the case of the ordinary local government register.  There will be the same publication at suitable dates and the same dates for receiving fresh claims and for hearing objections. In the matter of appeals there will be an appeal to the Circuit Court against any decision of the registration officer that is objected to, and any such appeal will be heard by the Circuit Court on a case stated by the registration officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be clear that in respect of the first register it will not be possible to have the same period for the preparation of the register.  The Bill provides that the first register shall be prepared to contain the names of those who were qualified on the 15th July, 1930, and that for the purpose of making out that register the Minister for Local Government will specify the dates upon which a notice will be given by the registration officer, so that those people entitled to be on the register may claim to have their names put on it.  There will be specific dates by which the preliminary list of electors <Col N="812" /> will be published, by which further claims will be made and objections stated, by which the register must be published.  The main point is that there will not be in the case of the first register the same house-to-house examination of the position as there will be in subsequent years, and that persons entitled to be on the register will have to claim to go on the register, but they will get a suitable published notice of the fact that it is being prepared.</P>
    <P>As regards the election the second schedule refers to the conduct of the election&mdash;that is, the reception of nomination papers and the issue of ballot papers.  The ordinary rules which apply to elections of this kind for the Oireachtas where postal voting is involved, will apply to this election.  Schedule 3 is taken from the Electoral Act, and deals with the counting of the votes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill, as the Minister has stated, is to implement certain sections of the Local Government (1929) Bill recently passed through the House.  If I might say so, the dirty work having been done by the Minister in that Local Government Bill of 1929, this Bill is merely to implement it, and to secure that that work will be accomplished to the satisfaction of those who keep the Minister in power&mdash;the moneyed classes and the reactionary elements in the City of Dublin.  There is not much, therefore, in the Bill now before us to discuss. It is a matter of rules and regulations. There is, however, this much I would like to say about it.  I do not think there is time between now and the date provisionally fixed for the holding of the municipal elections in which to prepare a proper register.  I think that that is more or less admitted in the Bill itself.  The Minister admits that there will not be a house-to-house canvass for the first register.  He provides for the making of such a canvass in future years when the register is being compiled.  It is probably correct to say, therefore, that almost anybody who makes a claim can get on the register this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="813" /> Everybody knows that the officials have not time.  I do not want to blame the officials.  I do not want to say that there will be any corruption so far as the officials are concerned, but I do say that anybody who thinks that he has a claim, whether he is right in thinking so or not, has a good chance of getting on the register, whether he be a trader, a professional man or anything else.  Therefore I think it is unwise that such a register should be permitted this first year.</P>
    <P>I think, if necessary, the time for the election should be postponed, certainly long enough to enable the house-to-house canvass that the Minister recognises as necessary in order to provide a proper register, a reliable register, and a register on which the name of everyone appearing can be vouched for.  That you cannot have so far as this first register is concerned.  Therefore it would be within reason for people to claim that those who would be elected as a result of the first register, or on the first register, might be people who would not be properly on that register and that the register itself might be anything but a just one&mdash; one that could be packed, and probably efforts will be made to pack it. I say that the Minister would be responsible for that, because he is not giving time for the compilation of a register such as should be insisted upon in a matter of this kind.</P>
    <P>On principle, of course, we on this side, as we stated during the time the Bill was being discussed, are opposed to a special franchise of this nature.  We object to setting up class distinctions of this kind in the government of the municipality. Probably what was recently done for Dublin in the Local Government Bill, 1929, will be sought to be extended elsewhere.  We object not alone on principle, but we object to setting up a headline here which might be copied and introduced into other municipalities and other franchises. It is thoroughly reactionary, and, therefore, in our opinion, a thoroughly bad proposition.  However, <Col N="814" /> we went into that in detail and at considerable length in the discussions on the main Bill, and I do not propose to go into it any further.</P>
    <P>I will just repeat the argument I have made, that it is not wise to introduce a Bill making provisions for a hurried register, a register that will be largely a bogus one and upon which bogus members may be elected; bogus members upon a bogus franchise will be elected to the new municipal body.  For that reason alone the Bill is bad and will have bad results.  Therefore we will not take any responsibility for it.</P>

      <P>Yes, really bad Parliamentary language.  I want to know from the Minister if there is any section in this Bill which deals with the prospective commercial voter who, on the 15th November would be qualified to look for a vote and who, between the 15th November and the date of publication following on the 1st July would become bankrupt?  It is quite possible that some antique furniture type of businessman who may claim to be included in this register may be bankrupt of money as well as of brains between the date of the application and the date of the publication of the register.  What steps, therefore, does the Minister propose to take to see that the names of so-called businessmen of that kind will not be included in the register of commercial voters?  The Minister and his colleagues will have to register their names for the information of generations to come and afterwards justify themselves for producing and introducing a measure of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Davin that this is a rotten Bill.  It is so rotten that it is not even printed right.  Those printers who were asked to prepare it in a form so that Deputies could read it, were so astounded at its terms that they could not get the words right.  However, the printer's errors can be easily rectified.  Its other errors, which I might describe as errors of principle, are more serious and the Dáil only can rectify them.  The most objectionable feature in the Bill is that it enables those commercial voters to exercise the franchise <Col N="816" /> by post.  I can see no reason, nor has the Minister given us any reason, why the special privilege of postal voting should be given to those whose names will be recorded on the commercial register.  Postal voting has only been used in the past to give a privileged franchise to special classes such as University graduates voting for the election of members to represent the University; and members of the Army voting for Cumann na nGaedheal candidates. In both these cases it is quite obvious that no form of voting other than postal voting would be possible.  But in the case of the City of Dublin, in the case of the election of a municipal council for Dublin, these special circumstances do not apply and there is no reason why the privileged members of a commercial register should not be asked to go, like the ordinary members of the community, and cast their votes in person.  No doubt the purpose is to provide machinery to see that there will be a 100 per cent. or almost a 100 per cent. commercial vote.</P>
      <P>The Minister is not at all anxious that the poor sections, the non-commercial classes, should vote in full, because if they did, of course, the adherents of his Party would have no chance.  The objection to the introduction of a system of postal voting, however, is not merely that it increases the privileges which have been given to a special class in the community, but also that it opens the way to considerable abuse. I have no doubt that the Minister is well aware that the system of postal voting has been widely abused in the past, so as to make the representation that results from it farcical. We have pointed out here that on the occasion of the General Election in 1927 a very large number of well-known supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party who were entitled to vote did not get ballot papers.  They were somehow intercepted in the post.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In this House.  I have mentioned it to some members. Deputy Fahy is one of them.  I have a recollection that when I stood for election in South City in 1925 or 1926 a postman came to me with a bundle of postal votes, envelopes containing 27 votes to be delivered to the voters, and offered them to me.  He asked would I like to have these votes.  I refused to take them from him.  I myself thought it was a trap to get me entangled.  I thought it was a trap by some Cumann na nGaedheal agents.  Obviously the postman went to some other member of my Party, because when the votes were counted I got 27 postal votes.  These were the only postal votes I got when the votes had been counted.  It is well known to anybody having anything to do with election machinery that postal voting is capable of being abused, and has been abused, and I have no doubt whatever that in the City of Dublin the same abuse will prevail unless special safeguards are taken to prevent it.  Deputy O'Kelly thinks that the machinery devised for the compilation of the first register will result in a large number of people getting their names on the register who should not be there. Personally, I think that a large number of people entitled to be on that register will not be there at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see why a house-to-house canvass cannot be carried out for the purpose of compiling the first register.  Certainly the insertion of a notice in the Press asking persons claiming to be registered in the commercial register to communicate with the registration officer will not produce anything like a full register. It will result largely in that section of the commercial community which is organised in the Chamber of Commerce or in one or other of the political parties being on the register.  The unattached member of the community will take no notice of anything appearing in the Press even when he sees it.  Those to whose notice the opportunity to claim a vote is brought either by a political party or by some other organisation interested in the result, <Col N="818" /> will undoubtedly get their vote.  The net result is likely to be that the first register will be most incomplete, and it is likely to be made less complete than it otherwise would by the amazing powers which it is proposed to give to the registration officer to lodge and decide an objection without notifying the person that he intends to make an objection to him.</P>
    <P>It always was, and still is, the rule in relation to any individual objecting to a person claiming to be registered as a voter, that he must notify that person that he intends to lodge an objection against him.  Apparently, in this instance, the registration officer can make an objection without so notifying the person and the case can then presumably be decided without the voter being aware that any objection has been made against him or, in fact, that the matter has come before the registration officer at all.  The matter is dealt with in Section 12 (2) of the First Schedule.  The Minister has not given us any estimate of the cost of preparing the register and I think he should do so.  No doubt the fact that the register will have to be prepared only once in three years will be an economy.  However, the fact that it has to be prepared at all involves expense.  If we could dispense with the register and with commercial representatives on the Council, in my opinion, not only would local government in the City be more efficient but it would cost much less.  We are anxious to know what it would cost to prepare this commercial register.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Kelly thinks that the date on which the election for the new Council will be held will render it impossible to enable a proper register to be prepared. I am anxious to have the election held in Dublin City at the earliest possible moment.  I am anxious that the Council would be elected as long as possible before they have to deal with next year's Estimates.  I hope to have the election taking place about September or October&mdash;say October.  Suitable <Col N="819" /> notice, widely given, will draw the attention of people having claims to the fact that they should make their claims to be on the register.  The rate-books will be a fairly good index to the Town Clerk, who will have the preparation of the register under his control, as to whether the claims are or are not bona fide. Apart altogether from the careful way in which I am sure the work will be approached by the Town Clerk and a very efficient staff, they will have very considerable assistance in the rate-books in seeing that only bona fide claims are entertained. If there is not a widespread application for these claims&mdash;well, it will be very interesting.  We, at any rate, are doing our part to see that the register is properly made up.  I am not at all filled with the same kind of doubt as that with which Deputy O'Kelly is filled.</P>
      <P>As far as the postal vote is concerned, I am hardly impressed by what Deputy Lemass has to say with regard to the University register.  I would very much like to know what kind of representations were made to the registrar at the University and what took place there.</P>

We have pointed out that the electorate on this register will be anything up to 7,000 or 8,000 persons.  It is also a fact that there will be a large number of companies which will vote by seal and suitable counter signature.  I have not seen many of the seals, and I do not know whether it would be possible to hawk them around to polling booths. I know it would not be possible to have the seal of the Local Government Department.</P>

When you compare its cost with what it would cost if you had to have separate boxes at every polling booth in the place you will more readily appreciate the difference.</P>

I submit to the Deputy that, apart altogether from waiting for experience in the matter, common sense would suggest that the postal vote, as well as being more convenient, will be more economical. With regard to the point raised on the First Schedule by Deputy Lemass, on the question when the registration officer becomes the objector to a claim for admission to the register, the Bill sets out: &ldquo;Whenever an objection made by the registration officer under this rule is not included in a list of objections published under these rules the registration officer shall send notice of such objection by post or otherwise to the person to whom such objection relates.&rdquo;  I take it that an objection having been made in this particular way the claimant's appearance before the registration officer will take place just as if the objection were made by some other person.  I think the Deputy will find that in every case where an objection takes place before it is entertained the registration officer must be satisfied that the person objected to has been notified.  I think you <Col N="822" /> will find that Section 12 (2) of the First Schedule meets the point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In resuming the discussion on this Estimate I should like to say that there is another matter which calls for some comment this year, and that is the serious drop in the price of milk.  Apart from the very direct result of that, the slump in the price of butter, I want to refer, first of all, to another matter. I have already stated that I believed abortion amongst cattle was responsible in some part for the high price of calves during the present spring&mdash; that is, that calves were scarce.  But it is possible also that it was due to the low price of milk: that farmers found they had to make use of their new milk and, perhaps, came to the conclusion that the best use they could make of it was to feed it to calves or young pigs instead of sending it to the creameries and, as a consequence, that the price of calves <Col N="825" /> went up.  There is also the fact that young pigs at the present time are as dear as they were at the very dearest time, while fat pigs, on the other hand, have gone down 20/- per cwt. in many cases.  It is rather difficult to see how a farmer who buys small calves at £5 each, or small pigs at £2 10s. or £3 each, can ever make them pay.  They may be good stock at present to consume cheap milk, but when the calf or the pig matures it is hard to see how anything can be made out of it.</P>
      <P>There is another matter which also occurred during the year.  Some ten or twelve years ago, before the Free State was formed, when we were enthusiastic followers of the late Arthur Griffith, we used to read in the Sinn Fein papers that one of the most important needs of this country was a mercantile marine. During the year the Irish Cattle Traders' Association also came to the conclusion that the only hope for their trade, and the only possible way that they could give a better price for cattle than they are giving at the present time, would be by establishing a shipping service, owned and controlled by Irishmen. The Cattle Traders' Association approached Deputies of all Parties, and they approached Ministers concerned, for sympathy and help in this matter, and I believe that they have found neither encouragement nor sympathy.  They also have been disillusioned in whatever support they have been giving to the present Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find that the only matter in the Estimate in reference to transport is that there is a railway rates inquiries officer paid £150 a year.  I do not know what the functions of this man are.  He is referred to in the Estimate as an inquiries officer.  Evidently he is there to answer inquiries that may be made about railway rates, but there is no indication in the Estimates of what the policy of the Department is in regard to either external or internal transport.  I find also that the railway rates inquiries officer is to be paid £150 this present financial year.  But the same <Col N="826" /> officer was paid £300 last year, so that his services, whatever they may be, are only valued at half the amount this year as compared with last year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I see.  The position was vacant for half the year.  Last year in discussing this Estimate I drew attention to some figures with regard to the prices realised for Free State butter and eggs as compared with the prices realised for these articles by other countries on the British market.  Last year I went to the trouble of making out these prices over the whole year. This year I have only taken prices for the last two or three weeks.  I find taking the prices for the week before last that Danish butter was quoted from 133/- to 137/-; that is an average of 135/-.  Swedish butter was quoted from 132/- to 136/-; New Zealand and Australian from 130/- to 134/-; and Irish Free State butter from 127/- to 131/-.  These were the only four quoted in the Liverpool market, when I looked the matter up on the 23rd May.  We found that Irish Free State butter was 3/- below the lowest of the others, that is, New Zealand and Australian, and 6/- below that of Danish.  Then on the next date that I selected, that is, this day week, 4th June, Danish butter was quoted at 133/- to 135/-; Swedish 129/- to 131/-; Finnish 127/- to 131/-; Irish Free State 124/- to 128/-.  There again it is four shillings lower than either Finnish or Swedish and 8/- lower than Danish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said last year I do not believe that the Irish Free State butter is in any way inferior to Danish, Swedish, Finnish, New Zealand or Australian butter but, evidently, it is owing to some defect in the marketing. If the Irish creameries find it impossible to compete with the system they have at present in other countries, it is the duty of the Department of Agriculture to give them some help, <Col N="827" /> and the trade representatives of another Department in London should also be in a position to point out in what way Free State butter could be marketed so that it would realise the price it deserves.  Certainly that position has not improved to any great extent from last year, and we are still lagging behind other countries in the prices we obtain. The same is true to a certain extent of eggs.  It is rather difficult, on looking at the daily papers, to make a comparison between the prices quoted for eggs from other countries and those from the Free State, but on June 4th I find that Free State eggs are quoted at 11/3d. for 17 lbs. while eggs from Northern Ireland are quoted at 12/6d., a difference of 1/3 for similar eggs.  It is very hard to understand how that difference arose.  Various reasons have been suggested.</P>
    <P>For instance one was that the British people when asked to buy Free State eggs will not do so&mdash;not I believe for any political reason&mdash; but because, in some cases, their experience has been that they have not been good.  One reason that has been suggested by people who know something about the matter is that the buyers in England buy Irish Free State eggs in a cheap market and keep them too long before selling them, the result being that the eggs are stale before the consumer gets them.  If the consumer gets stale Free State eggs on one or two occasions he is not inclined to buy them again.  The remedy that has been suggested for that state of affairs is that the eggs should be dated.  I do not know if I am giving the correct reason why eggs from the Free State do not sell as well as those from other countries, and I do not know if I am correct in suggesting that dating the eggs would be an effective remedy, but the Department of Agriculture, at least, should be able to cope with this matter, and to point out where the defect in the marketing of Free State eggs lies, so that our people would get as good a price as is obtained by other countries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="828" /> When introducing the Estimate the Minister gave the number of officials under the headings of administration, educational and so on, and gave a rather rough classification of their work.  In answer to some questions which I put to him a few months ago I got a considerable amount of information with regard to the various officials who work amongst the farmers.  The Minister for Finance accused Fianna Fáil some time ago of wanting a government official to meddle with everybody's business.  In view of that I would like the Minister for Finance to look into one answer I got with regard to overseers and assistant overseers.  I was told there are four agricultural overseers, and fifty-seven assistant agricultural overseers, whose various duties would, I believe, compel them to meddle with everybody's business. Not only are they to instruct farmers on matters of a complex scientific nature, but they are to instruct them on matters that they have been doing themselves for the last two or three thousand years&mdash;the care and treatment of live stock, the spraying of potatoes, the use of suitable seeds and manures&mdash;but also the erection of fences and outhouses.</P>
    <P>Surely if the farmers know anything, at least, they know how to erect a fence, and hardly require agricultural overseers to show them how to build a fence.  The answer stated that each assistant overseer paid on an average two thousand visits to farmhouses during the year. As we have fifty-seven assistant overseers, that means that they pay 114,000 visits in the year.  That was a considerable amount of meddling in other people's business, and if Fianna Fáil is going to do what the Minister for Finance fears they may do, and that is to have Government officials meddling in everybody's business, the worst they can do is to carry on the present system.</P>
    <P>I find that, in spite of a protest that I made last year about it, the sheet headed &ldquo;Agricultural Conditions in Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; is still being issued on the 7th or 8th of each month, dealing with matters in the previous month, and it costs £740 <Col N="829" /> to collect the information contained in it.  The copy of it which I have is dated 1st May, 1930.  It reaches the people to whom it is sent three or four days after publication.  This copy tells the people what sort of weather we had in the first fortnight of April.  It states: &ldquo;Wintry weather continued throughout the first fortnight of April, during which period rains fell heavily and harsh winds prevailed, conditions which retarded growth and impeded outdoor farm work, so that little progress could be made with spring seeding operations.&rdquo;  If wintry weather prevailed it is fairly evident that it impeded outdoor farm work, and it is hardly worth an expenditure of £740 in order that we should be told that rains fell heavily and harsh winds prevailed and that growth was retarded.  There is not a farmer, not even a man who is attempting to farm, who does not know that for himself.  We are given that information for April in the first fortnight of May.  Of course, there is a great deal more in this publication, but nothing more useful than that.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Act, passed a few months ago, contained a clause which stated that all regulations made under it would be laid on the Tables of both Houses of the Oireachtas, but that condition has not been carried out by the Minister. I do not know what redress we have against a Minister who refuses to carry out his undertakings to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister has done so, but not as I understand it.  If these regulations had been laid on the Table we would have learned of it from our Order Papers, and we might have looked into them to see if there was anything that was <Col N="830" /> so objectionable that we should ask the House to annul or reject them. One of the regulations that has been issued says that a dehairing machine shall be installed in every case &ldquo;where the work of inspection would frequently be unduly prolonged by hand-scraping and dehairing.&rdquo; As the Minister will remember, he told us over and over again when that Act was going through that it would not put any considerable additional burden on the factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been sent to me by a bacon factory.  They believe that it is a regulation.  This would appear to be a most arbitrary rule&mdash;that a bacon factory should be compelled to instal a dehairing machine so that the veterinary surgeon will not lose his time waiting for the hand-scraping process to be carried out.  The factory people say that under the Act they will pay the fees of the veterinary surgeon, and they ask why the Department should be so very solicitous about his time, that if the factory have to pay the official they should at least have the privilege of making him wait for a few minutes, if necessary.  There was certainly no hint that any such regulation would be issued when the Act was going through.  It would have been a much fairer thing if that had been put into the Act so that the House would know what it was voting for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed from the same source that there is a danger that crating is to be made compulsory.  It has not been proved by any means that crating is absolutely necessary either in the summer or in the winter.  It is admitted by most of the exporters that the crating of <Col N="831" /> fresh meat is advantageous in very warm weather, but there is no proof that that is so in cold weather.  I will quote an extract from a statement made by a firm that has been exporting fresh meat for a good many years.  They say: &ldquo;We have ourselves proved on several occasions that London pork salesmen are quite unable to distinguish between carcases which have not and those which have been packed in crates, and crated carcases do not fetch a farthing more than those shipped uncrated.&rdquo;  However, as there appears to be a little doubt as to whether these regulations have been issued or not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>These may be draft regulations.</P>

      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that draft regulations have been issued with the object of obtaining opinions from the people concerned as to whether they would be just or unjust, and with the object of obtaining useful comments. During the past year we have had, perhaps, one of the most useful publications on agriculture that have been issued within the last six or seven years, and that is with regard to the total agricultural output of Saorstát Eireann in 1926.  According to that publication the gross output amounted to £64,757,000.  We find, according to it, that when all the land of the Free State was taken as one farm, and when the commerce, etc., was examined, that between the land and other sources this gross output had to bear certain charges. There was an import of feeding stuffs of £6,559,000, of fertilisers £1,301,000, and of seeds £689,000. We also find that the farmers had to pay in land annuities £3,250,000; in rents on unpurchased land, £1,500,000; in rates, £2,250,000, and for machinery, tools, etc., £1,500,000. These items of outgoings make a total of £17,049,000, and when that <Col N="832" /> is taken from the gross output there is £47,708,000 left.</P>
      <P>When the destination of the output was examined it was found that the agricultural community itself consumed £23,071,000 worth of food, so that if we want to know what amount of cash was left to the agricultural community when they had paid for such things as imported feeding stuffs, fertilisers, seeds, annuities, rents, rates, machinery, etc., the amount is £24,637,000.</P>
      <P>In the year 1926&mdash;that is, the year under review&mdash;we find from the finance accounts of Saorstát Eireann that the amount collected in revenue that year was about £25,000,000.  In the same year we find that the agritural output was 70 per cent. of the total output.  That is to say, the industrial output was only 30 per cent. as compared to the agricultural output of 70 per cent., so that if taxes were found out of production and output in that year it is only natural to assume that the farming community contributed seventeen and a half million pounds to central taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President said on one occasion in this House that the farmer, if he wished, need pay no taxes.  He said that if the farmer did not eat sugar, did not drink intoxicating liquor, did not smoke tobacco, did not deal in stocks and shares and did not use the post he would have to pay no taxes.  That may be a very deep and a very clever statement of the case, but I suggest it might refer to any other class just as well as to farmers. It could refer to the President himself or to any member of this House.  If people did not do any of the things mentioned by the President, if they did not pay income-tax&mdash;the President might have included income tax when referring to farmers&mdash;there would be no taxes payable, but the farmer has to contribute to taxation in many ways. The farmer has to buy sugar and on that he pays a tax of 1¼d. per lb. Many farmers smoke tobacco, and contribute 5d. per oz. to the revenue on every ounce of tobacco smoked. The farmer may drink beer.  If so, <Col N="833" /> he contributes a little over 2d. on every bottle of stout he consumes. In many cases the farmer has to use the post.  He has to pay for the use that he makes of the post office, both in the prices charged for stamps and in other ways.  The farmer buys matches and on them he has to pay a tax.  If he keeps a dog he has to pay a tax for the dog.  At times he may have to pay the entertainment tax.  When the farmer dies someone representing him has to pay death duty on his estate.</P>
    <P>At any rate, the sum of £25,000,000 went to the upkeep of government in this State in 1926, and it is natural to assume that if the country was solvent and paying its way in that year, all that revenue was found out of production and out of output.  If so, the farmers contributed their share of that to the extent of seventeen and a-half million pounds.  That being the case, the farmer and his family, the agricultural labourer and his family in the Free State had between them about seventeen and a-half million pounds to meet other charges&mdash;per working farmer and per working agricultural labourer they had something like £11 each.  Even if we drop this matter of central taxation altogether, and if it is disputed that they paid their share, they had £38 per worker each.  With that money they had to meet all other charges, such as the cost of clothes and groceries, to provide for the education of their children, while many of them had to pay interest on bank debts, and some of them to pay arrears of annuities to the Land Commission.  They had to pay these charges and many other things that could be counted up out of that small sum of £38 each.</P>

      <P>Would the Deputy tell me what all this has to do with the administration of the Department of Agriculture during the last twelve months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am not out of order I will try to come to that in a moment.  During the year that I am dealing with, the agricultural labourer was paid an average wage <Col N="834" /> of 27s. 4d.  When we turn to the Irish Trade Journal for this year we find that amount has since been reduced to 23s. 6d.  Comparing the agricultural community with the other parts of the population of the Free State, we find that the cost of living decreased during the first four months of this year by eleven points, but on the other hand we find that the cost of human food was reduced by sixteen points&mdash;that is, the prices of butter, eggs, milk, and so on decreased much more rapidly than the prices of any of the other articles in the list which go to make up the cost of living figure.  If the cost of living comes down it may be an advantage to the other members of the community, but it is a disadvantage to the agricultural community.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, the people who are producing milk are in a more difficult position to-day than any other member of the community, agricultural or otherwise.  During the time that these figures were made out in 1926 the creamery price for milk was 6.04d., but now it has gone down in many cases to 4½d., and even to 4d.  Therefore, the position is that, taking farmers in the aggregate, their income is going to be reduced by about three million pounds if this drop in the price of milk from 6.04d., as it was in 1926, is to continue. When, however, we take the case of the individual farmer living entirely on the production of milk his losses are going to be much more heavy than this figure of three million pounds represents when spread over the farmers of the country in the aggregate.  In the case of farmers depending altogether on the production of milk, a drop in price representing about one-third of their total income is a very serious matter indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In discussing the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture, I think I am in order in drawing the attention of the Minister to a very serious drop in the price of any particular commodity or article so that the Minister might at least be able to tell us whether or not it is possible <Col N="835" /> for his Department to do anything to relieve this serious situation.  I am not sure whether it is possible. If it is not possible to relieve this very serious situation in the price of milk, perhaps the Minister would be able to give some kind of indication of the policy of his Department for the coming years, and that he will say whether he or his Department advised the farmers who are producing milk to stay in the production of milk, and that there is a reasonable prospect the price of milk will again improve, or whether it is the advice of his Department that the farmer producing milk should at the same time go in for mixed farming, in order that he may cover the losses he may have on the production of milk at present.</P>
    <P>There has been a big difference of opinion with regard to the different methods of farming from the point of view of remunerativeness for this country.  It is a most extraordinary thing that in this book I have been referring to dealing with the agricultural output of Saorstát Eireann, the costings when they are analysed of live stock as against tillage are certainly not encouraging to the live stock producer.  The total output of live-stock was £50,555,000.  The cost of imported foodstuffs was £6,559,000 and the cost of home grown foodstuffs was £29,258,000.  The cost of milk fed to live stock was £1,550,000. That makes a total of over £37,000,000, leaving £13,138,000 to pay for the grass which was fed to live stock.  We know that during that year there were 8,416,000 acres under pasture, and the only cash available to cover the cost of giving a profit to the farmer for that pasture was £13,000,000, so that the output of an acre of pasture according to that was only £1 11s. 3d.  If we compare the output of an acre of pasture according to the statistics made out in 1926 with the output of an acre of tillage we find that the output of all lands under crops and hay was £2 3s.  In addition to that output there was animal food produced to the value of £12 7s. 6d., so that an acre of crops and hay was <Col N="836" /> worth £9 15s. 6d. as compared with £1 11s. 3d. for grass.  Leaving out hay and taking all crops, an acre of crops was worth £13 15s, as compared with £1 11s. 3d. for pasture. I quote these figures as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle may have been correct in his ruling that I was not altogether in order, but I was trying to put before the Minister for Agriculture that the policy of his Department of relying on an acre of grass for giving as good value as an acre of tillage has been proved to be altogether wrong by this book.  The costing for live stock is given only in an indirect way in the book.  It does not give the figure of £1 11s. 3d. for an acre of grass, but if we deduct the cost of tillage it leaves the grass at £1 11s. 3d.  I ask the Minister to look into the figures and see whether they do not prove that we are not losing enormously both in output and production for every acre of grass we have as compared with an acre of tillage.</P>

      <P>In or about five weeks ago the Galway Board of Health passed a resolution directing that a copy of the report of the county medical officer of health relating to the number of tubercular cows in the Agricultural Station at Athenry should be sent to each Galway Deputy.  The matter was raised here at that particular time and it created more or less of a scare. From the statement of one Deputy one would imagine that the milk supplied to the town of Athenry was tubercular.  I would like to know from the Minister whether any inquiries or tests have been made regarding the milk supply from these cows during the last twelve months.  Dr. O'Beirne, the county medical officer of health, writes:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I visited the Athenry Agricultural Farm on the 8th instant, and inspected the cattle kept for milking purposes.  In all, there are 28 cows most of which supply Athenry town with milk.  I understand that the official Veterinary Inspector found that 8 of the cows reacted to tuberculin tests.  They are kept separate from the other <Col N="837" /> cows, but the milk, up to my visit there, had been distributed amongst the people of Athenry.</P>
    <P>Immediate steps should be taken, if not already taken, to have the milk from those cows tested; measures should also be taken to ensure that if they are sold for food purposes that the carcases be first passed as fit for human consumption.</P>
    <P>Dr. O'Beirne issued a report which he stated was confidential, but it has since appeared in the Press.  He said:</P>
    <P>I am sure you will treat my report of to-day's date to you as confidential, that is, that it is not given to the Press.  It is based on Doctor Foley's suspicions and the Farm Manager's admissions to me when I visited the place.  Though the question is purely scientific, at the same time it should be brought under the notice of the Departments concerned, so as to clear the air and end rumours and fears in that particular area.</P>
    <P>The medical officer of health based his report on the suspicions of the dispensary medical officer.  When the matter got into the Press it created somewhat of a scare, and again when the matter was raised here at a later date people began to get very uneasy.  I would like to know from the Minister is he aware that there is any danger of the cows reacting to tuberculin tests, or if samples of the milk have been taken regularly by orders of the Galway Board of Health or the local medical officer.  He seems to be very keen on it at present.  I would like to know how often samples have been taken.  I would also like if the Minister for Local Government would see when causing appointments to be made as county medical officers of health that it should be in the terms of their appointment that they should not be creating scares throughout the country.</P>

      <P>Looking over the Estimates and comparing them with those for last year, I am glad to see that there are increases in two very important items, to which I drew <Col N="838" /> attention last year.  Both of them relate to veterinary research.  There is an increase under one head of £1,300 and, under another, of £2,000. It is time that the farmers realised the importance of such research.  The agricultural community in a country like this, where agriculture is the staple industry, depend largely on such research work for the health of their stock.  In connection with that matter there is what, to my mind, is an absolute scandal in any country depending on its agricultural products. I refer to the position of veterinary inspectors.  I notice that there are thirty-five inspectors attached to the Department of Agriculture with salaries varying from £200, rising by £10 increments, to £300, rising by £15 increments, to £400.  In a footnote, it is stated that fifteen of these posts are unestablished. That, apparently, means that fifteen of these inspectors are working under the Department and that their services do not count for pension purposes, that they may continue to work for the next ten or fifteen years, but that their services for pension purposes will not count.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I happened to be at the Spring Show in Dublin recently with a particular friend of mine, and we met a gentleman who had been an officer with the Department of Agriculture but whose services had been dispensed with, and when he retired his pension was less than £50 a year. A contemporary of his, who started with the Department at the same time but who was transferred to Northern Ireland, got on retirement a pension of £150.  If that is so&mdash; and I have no reason to doubt the information&mdash;I say it is simply a disgrace. I do not see how we can expect to get the best results from our officials if they are to be treated in that way.  The success of our live stock depends to a large extent on the efficiency of these men and on the way in which they do their work.  It is, of course, well known that a certain amount of disease is transmitted from animals to human beings, and I think it is playing not alone with our chief industry, but <Col N="839" /> with human life if we do not treat men in charge of such important duties properly.</P>
    <P>They have not alone to diagnose disease and apply the latest scientific treatment but our export trade is entirely in their hands.  I think that they ought to be placed in a position which will allow no room for suspicion and that their salaries ought to be such as to put them in an independent position so that there will be no accusations of any kind. There is another matter which I think is to the credit of the Minister, namely, the increased grants to county committees and the special grants to congested districts.  These are very important and when they were cut down they were a big loss to the county committees.  I am glad that the Minister has to a large extent restored them.  In regard to a matter mentioned by Deputy Doctor Ryan, namely, statistics, I may mention that some time ago I warned the Minister that statistics were very dangerous playthings.  I do not for a moment think that Deputy Doctor Ryan believes that his deductions from statistics are reliable.  They could not be.  I think that the closer we keep to actual knowledge in such matters the better.  The Minister promised last year to look into the question of the veterinary staff which I think is in a very dangerous position. I have heard nothing since from him but I hope to hear something satisfactory in that respect when he replies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am glad to see the increase in the grants to congested areas I have to state in relation to the schemes for the breeding of livestock, that in more than one county there is great dissatisfaction with the attitude of the Minister in interfering with local committees in the allocation of bulls of a particular type.  Though such committees are composed of farmers with long experience of the conditions and requirements of their own locality they are forced to adopt the views of the Minister as to the most suitable type <Col N="840" /> of animal for their district.  Their opinions are, of course, often in conflict with those of the Minister.  One would think that in matters of that sort local experience and knowledge would, as Deputy Brennan suggested, be availed of.  Though the Minister approves of such sentiments, we find that his attitude towards county committees, whose opinion clashes with his, is quite different.  A good deal of difference of opinion exists on that important question and it is having serious results within the areas affected.</P>
      <P>Last year I had occasion to make representation to the Department of Agriculture on behalf of a few persons who, acting on the advice of the Minister's officials, had taken a type of bull for their area which in local opinion was not suitable.  They kept the bulls for a few years, and experience proved that local opinion was correct, with the result that in one case only eight cows came for service, and in another only sixteen. Clearly, these were instances where unsuitable bulls were forced on the people.  Although the Minister was appealed to to give these men permission to dispose of their bulls, and to release them from the agreement to hold the bulls for a specified period, permission was not granted. In one instance the man took the responsibility of getting rid of the bull at a big loss, which he could not afford, and he was met by the Minister's Department with a demand for the payment of the entire amount, which would have been made good for him in the ordinary way.  That is an attitude of the Minister to which I object.  I think he should put into practice some of the sentiments which he applauds as being correct, especially the sentiment that experience and common sense are important factors in such questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another item upon which I would like some explanation from the Minister is the sum of £29,000 for the improvement of milk production. I wonder if the Minister could give us any figures as to the result of this experiment.  There is also provision <Col N="841" /> here for a contribution of £8,500 to the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, and I note that the expenditure out of this grant will not be accounted for to the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  That seems a rather strange item.  I fail to see why any public expenditure should not be subject to the ordinary control of the Auditor-General in the ordinary way.  My own experience of the I.A.O.S. is not unfortunately of the kind that would warrant my giving it that amount of confidence that is demanded if public money is to be spent on the service without its being accounted for.  I think the time has really come when the Minister should say what is to be the future position of that special Department.  That it has had a most unfortunate influence on agricultural development generally throughout the country for a number of years seems undoubtedly to be a fact. I have had experience of some of the officials working there for the last twenty years.  While I found them to be very sincere, hard-working men, there seems surely to be some screw loose somewhere, because the result of their work has been very detrimental to agricultural interests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In what way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>To give you one instance: at present there is an area in Co. Longford in which the Minister and some Deputies of the opposite side are keenly interested, and the people of that locality find themselves charged with the responsibility of meeting a debt of £30,000, the result of a failure of a big concern established under the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society.  I could give the Minister several instances in Co. Leitrim of similar ventures established through the Society and its agents.  It appeared to the people of the country that this Organisation was acting in some semiofficial capacity or had some official standing.  As a result of that people were encouraged to become members, to start societies and to become shareholders.  Quite a number of <Col N="842" /> people invested money in that way, on the distinct understanding that the Organisation had some form of Governmental authority over it.</P>
      <P>I believe that, up to 1921 at least, authority to the extent of an annual audit was maintained over the Society, or, at least, over the societies founded by it.  Since then that has lapsed and there have been only occasional audits&mdash;once in five years, once in three years, or perhaps once in two years with the more punctual.  Clearly there has been a good deal of mismanagement in that way.  No person could stand over the work of a society that will allow a departure from an annual audit and have an audit only every five years.  During that time a lot of damage has been done to the development of agricultural societies generally, not so much because of the fact that failures have taken place in these districts as that there are numerous small depositors who invested money in these ventures, and they have consequently lost everything. Not alone have we to complain of individual losses, but we have also to complain that the whole community has suffered because small investors will not be encouraged to invest in any local concern of that sort in future, with very grave consequences to local credit and to the development of local societies generally.  For the reason which I have stated, and which can be substantiated by any person who has any doubt about the inefficiency of the Society and its very damaging effect on agricultural development in the past, I maintain that the time has come when the Minister should take responsibility for the Society and bring it under a proper State department, where proper order and proper control can be exercised over the various works which it undertakes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say both. As regards the purchase of creameries, there is a sum of £90,000 provided in the Estimates for this purpose.  I would like to know from the Minister if he is satisfied that the money he has invested in this way for the past five or six years has proved a sound investment and if it is profitable to extend this development all over the country.  I am inclined to think that the Minister was over-optimistic at the time he undertook a general reorganisation of the creameries throughout the country.  I do know of one or two creameries at least that were started in the last three or four years and that now find themselves in a pretty difficult position owing to various reasons.  This year there has been a considerable drop in the price of milk.  As I have stated, when the Minister was organising these creameries he was very optimistic about the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might now review the arrangement he made two years ago when he advised this extension of creameries in view of the fact that his optimism has not been quite correct as is shown by the depreciation in prices.</P>
      <P>As a result many of the creameries established within the last two or three years find themselves very much embarrassed by the conditions they were prepared to undertake owing to the hopeful view of the outlook which the Minister then had of the prospects the creameries had before them.  I would like to know now if the repayments from those creameries have been quite satisfactory; and if he feels that the present rate of repayment of the money advanced for these creameries is more than the creameries can afford to bear I would ask if he would undertake to examine the question of an extension of the period for the repayment of these loans?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of these agricultural colleges I notice an item on the Estimates for a fairly large sum of <Col N="845" /> money.  I would like to know from the Minister in a general way what the results from these colleges are and what are the actual benefits derived from them by the State.  The item is in sub-head F 4.  He might tell us what has been the return to the State from these colleges.  I would like to know what would be the approximate number of people, who, during the last five years, have taken advantage of the courses in these colleges and what have these people turned their attention to after these courses.  Have they taken up farming; have they become officials or have they left the country?  I believe that, perhaps, these schemes or these colleges will have to be recast before they come to meet the actual requirements of the farming community.</P>
    <P>As regards the poultry scheme, I should like to make a remark to the Minister, and that is, that while the Department of Agriculture surely has done a great deal to improve the position in the matter of poultry from the egg-producing point of view, yet his Department is entirely neglecting an important factor in that industry, and that is, the marketing of the pullets or cockerels. In some parts of the country those birds are really a waste product owing to the fact that the producers having a small number of them, a couple of score or so, no arrangements have been made by which they can be marketed.  That is mainly because the birds are not in a uniform condition or in good market condition generally.  This is a matter in which thousands of people scattered around the country are interested.  If these pullets could be marketed in uniform size and in a condition suitable for the market, great benefits would accrue to the people who go in for this industry. At present no markets exist for this purpose.  I suggest to the Minister that he should find some means of specialising so as to prepare these birds for the market and market them in the best possible way.  I know that in the opinion of some of the instructresses throughout the <Col N="846" /> country that would be a very necessary improvement in the poultry industry and it would be of great service to many poultry keepers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillianRKent" hpid="Mr. Kent Mr. Kent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kent</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few matters which I wish to bring under the notice of the Minister.  One is in respect of abortion in cows.  Down in the East Cork constituency from which I come, the disease is very prevalent.  I would like to know from the Minister has the Department taken any steps to remedy that state of affairs there?  A lot of these cows, when let out to grass in the summer, are sent to the fairs afterwards. A number of farmers buy them for breeding purposes.  I know farmers who have twenty, twenty-five or thirty cows this year who have no calves, as most of the cows have aborted.  I also know that large numbers of calves are hawked around the country and a great many of these calves bring the disease into farmers' places.  I would suggest to the Minister that these calves should be medically examined when they are sent around to the fairs before they are sold to any farmer.  I do not speak now from statistics.  I speak from my own personal experience.  I have in a few cases bought these calves, and after feeding them and treating them well they died in a month or so from white scour, or pneumonia, or a number of such diseases.  Now when diseases of this kind are brought into a farm it takes a considerable time to eradicate them.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will give this matter very serious consideration. In East Cork almost every farmer has suffered losses through abortion in cattle.  Whether it is caused by the bulls belonging to the Department or the bulls that are used by members of cow-testing associations I do not know.  There is one fact, at all events, and that is that farmers belonging to cow-testing associations and farmers who send cows to premium bulls suffer greater losses than anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to say that as regards the breeding of pigs there has been a great improvement in my locality <Col N="847" /> within the last few years.  A great breed of pigs has been introduced into East Cork.  I would suggest that where a premium boar is brought into a district he should not be left there for a considerable time. He should be changed around from place to place so that there would not be too much in-breeding.</P>
    <P>When looking over this Estimate I find that a considerable saving could be effected in the matter of paying bonuses to very highly-paid officials.  As far as I can make out in this Estimate for £475,456 there are bonuses paid to men amounting to nearly £70,000.  I think everybody will agree that this is a grievance on the taxpayers.  The giving of bonuses to highly-paid civil servants and highly-paid public officials is most glaring and scandalous. Officials who enjoy large salaries have 20 per cent. or 30 per cent. bonuses added to an already very large salary.  In such cases this system of giving cost of living bonuses is beyond the intelligence of an ordinary member of the community.</P>
    <P>Besides, these bonuses were given originally as war measures.  The war is over now for more than eleven years, and it is about time that this incubus of giving bonuses should be stopped in the case of highly-salaried officials.  The country cannot afford to pay these bonuses. I hope the Minister for Agriculture will set an example in this matter by strict economy.  I ask him to remember the hardships on the taxpayers and to do away with these bonuses. His doing so would greatly relieve the taxpayers and the farmers of the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows as well as I do the strenuous times through which the farmers of the country are at present passing.  This year, especially, is one of the worst on record.  The Minister has stated himself from a few public platforms that there was a very bad time before the farmers of the country. By adopting the suggestions I have made the Minister can do a great <Col N="848" /> deal to lighten the burdens on farmers.  Putting an end to the scandalous system of paying bonuses to highly-paid officials is one way in which he can help the farmer.  In doing this the Minister would be setting an example to every other department of the Government, and I am sure they would follow suit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hennessy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ryan was rather anxious to make for the Minister's benefit, a comparison between an acre of tillage and an acre of grass.  I think a great deal depends on where the acre of land is.  I know, and Deputy Ryan knows, that in the County Wicklow the farmers think themselves very fortunate when they grow oats if they can get the straw free.  That is the only profit they look to.  My own personal experience of tillage there is that we do not get the straw free.  That may be accounted for by the fact that I spend more on manure and more expensive seed than the average farmer, but I must certainly say this, that when I grow an acre of corn I do not get the straw free.  The profit is less than the value of the straw.  Tillage is not everything. Certainly in some counties the farmer must have tillage, because it is the only method by which he can have winter fodder.  If you have land that will grow a reasonably good crop of hay, say three or four tons to the Irish acre, it would be a great mistake to till that land&mdash; that is, if you are only looking out for profits.  If you put down root crops, such as mangels or turnips, the amount of nutrition in these crops, as Deputy Ryan knows, is very limited.  We might, in fact, describe turnips and mangels as purely dessert for the cattle, just like an apple after dinner.  They contain very little nutrition and they do very little good, but I think they do help to keep the cattle healthy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been looking over the Estimate of the Department of Agriculture, and many things have struck me as being worthy of comment.  I notice a very great inequality in salaries.  I do not see any reason for wiping out the bonus, because, on <Col N="849" /> the whole, and especially with regard to the smaller salaries, I think the bonuses are well deserved. There are men in the smaller positions who are doing very important work, and the knowledge they have obtained in order to do that work cost them a good deal of time and money.  I would like to know how the interference of the Department of Finance in the Department of Agriculture affects the efficiency of the latter Department.  I know that the Department of Finance has limited money at its disposal, and it has to make that money go as far as it can; but I do not at all agree with the way they allot the money amongst the officials of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan drew attention to the veterinary staff.  I know that the Minister, for many years past, has received representations from the Veterinary Medical Association with regard to the unsatisfactory position of veterinary officers.  I believe there is one section, numbering about thirty, approximately half of whom are unestablished.  Some of them have twelve or fourteen years' service.  They have no guarantee that the unestablished time will count when they come to get pensions.  The Veterinary Medical Association told me that there was a promise made to them that either by means of legislation or regulation the matter was going to be dealt with.  I think that the Veterinary Medical Association has very little idea of the scope of this settlement. I ask the Minister to make sure that either by legislation or regulation he will give those men, especially when it comes to their pension time or the attainment of their maximum salary, full credit for the time they have served, whether under the British Government or under the Free State Government.</P>
    <P>I was in Belfast early this year, and I met an official who was in Dublin for many years under the British regime.  He rather boasted to me about how the Northern Government was able to take away <Col N="850" /> some of the best officials of the Department of Agriculture.  They took them away by giving them better salaries.  He mentioned that they took away a few of the most promising men in the Seed Propagation section.  I asked him how they managed that, and he said that they gave them better salaries there, and did not question their religion or their politics; they simply knew they were good men, and were worth paying. I think the Minister for Agriculture is as appreciative of a good official as any Minister, and I wish that the Department of Finance would not be putting obstacles in the Minister's way when it is a matter of getting or retaining the services of an efficient officer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hennessy</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not go any further with that part of it.  I am more concerned with the fact that the Northern Government were able to take away a couple of our efficient officials by giving them higher salaries.  I am coming now to the point about the veterinary surgeons. These men have an initial basic salary of £200 a year.  I know many of them are very capable men and I do not know how long the Minister will be able to retain their services at such a salary.  We know what they are getting in England.  There is a very great improvement there on the salaries that are paid in the Free State.  We will be told that in the Free State we cannot pay such high salaries as they are paying in Northern Ireland or in England.  We <Col N="851" /> must consider whether a salary is adequate or inadequate and certainly we ought to try to pay adequate salaries if&mdash;and I am sure it is our desire&mdash;we are anxious to get the best officers we can to discharge the duties of this State.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan mentioned the case of a veterinary officer who had thirty years' service and he had to retire on a pension of £50.  That was altogether due to the fact that he was not allowed for his unestablished time.  I know the case he referred to.  There was a brother official of the one mentioned and he went to Northern Ireland and was immediately put on the established service and allowed his back time. He retired with a pension of £150 while the Free State official retired on a pension of £50.  That is not to our credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing I see occurring all through the Department of Agriculture is the penalisation of bachelors. It is the meanest form of raising revenue that I have yet struck.  I have seen bachelors here, and because they are bachelors they are penalised, but I, for one, do not know what is the offence.  They have been penalised in their salaries to the extent of £100 to £150 a year.  I think that is disgraceful.  I do not know that it is any crime to be a bachelor.  I am a married man, but I do not look on other men, bachelors, as anything worse.  It might be said that he has no family to keep.  The fact of the matter is that many of these men have to remain bachelors because they have to keep a widowed mother or an infirm sister on their salaries.  I think it is a disgrace, and not at all creditable to the Department of Agriculture, that there should be such victimisation of these men.  In some services it is considered an advantage to be a bachelor&mdash;that he is more devoted to his work, that he has no divided responsibility between his work and the interests of his family.  I should say that that would hold good for veterinary inspectors or any other inspectors in the Department.  I do <Col N="852" /> not hold the Minister responsible for this, but I hope that he will put up a fight against this kind of victimisation of these officials.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>I was endeavouring to follow Deputy Ryan in his remarks and in the comparison he made between tillage and grazing. Whether he was quoting the figures as recorded, or whether they were his own, I could hardly follow.  He seemed to favour tillage at any rate, and to think that the profits were ten times greater than from grazing. If we go back to the crop of 1929, I wonder how we are going to get £13 15s. profit per acre out of that crop.  I do a fair amount of tillage considering the land I own, and I could not see that there was any such profit as that.  It would seem to me that the crop was valued without the costs of producing it&mdash;without rent, rates, taxes, seeds or manures.  Certainly, as they say in the country, it is better to produce something to feed the man and the beast, but to go into tillage, irrespective of what the land is fitted for, would not help the country.  Deputy Ryan himself was complaining earlier in the year that we had produced so much of oats, barley, etc., in the Free State that there was no market for them.  In my district we sell very little oats or barley; we feed them to stock. Instead of sending what we produce on the land away on wheels we like to send it away on four feet.  In that way we think that we are using the produce of the land as raw material and producing a finished article.</P>
      <P>In regard to the import of feeding stuffs and seeds which was compared with the value of our agricultural exports, there is no one who works at tillage but recognises the value of a change of seed.  Anyone who looks at the difference in the appearance and in the yield of the fresh seed procured from another locality or imported from a good seed-growing district will see at once that it is a good plan to change the seed and that it is well-spent money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The creamery question was touched upon.  I think the only hope for Irish butter is through the <Col N="853" /> creameries.  As long as I remember, the marketing of the home-manufactured butter has been severely criticised, so much so that when the home-made butter is mixed together and put on the market across the water the producers themselves admit quite frankly that they would hardly like to have to use it.  So that we are thrown back on the creamery as the proper place from which to export butter; to collect the milk and to separate the cream from it and churn it and present a uniform article.  Unfortunately, as the Minister for Agriculture has said, we have fallen upon evil times. Our system, however, in the Free State is such that one thing is contingent upon another.  If the price of milk and butter is low, the young stock which we feed with by-products are, fortunately, a fair price at present.  Owing to the system of economy pursued here, we cannot jump out of a thing and into it again in a month or two.</P>
    <P>I should not like to go from this House without protest against what has been said about the work of the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society.  I have known that Society from the inside as well as the outside. I was a member of it for a number of years until, owing to other interests, I could no longer continue as a member.  I think that the Society has performed very useful work up and down the country. My experience, however, is that in some districts it is because the creamery committees or the co-operative committees will not take the Society's advice that things go wrong.</P>
    <P>I have known societies which were fast going to the bad and the I.A.O.S. organisers went to the committees and told them to get busy because they were going the wrong way.  These societies however, disregarded that advice and found themselves in bankruptcy in the course of a few years.  It is not the policy of the I.A.O.S. only to have an audit once in five years.  I have known the society to insist or advise that there should be an audit every <Col N="854" /> year and sometimes every half year, and that things should be done in a proper way.  The society has organised co-operative creameries. Surely it is not wrong that farmers should try to own the business and co-operate in order to get whatever profit there is to be got from the production of milk and butter.  The I.A.O.S. has always endeavoured to get farmers to co-operate so that the milk and butter produced by them should be exported in the right way.  The only thing I have to say in criticism of the I.A.O.S. is that perhaps it has not concentrated sufficiently on the marketing end; that in years gone by it let its sympathies go a little with the buying end.  Perhaps it was not the fault of the society; it was not the society put up the capital.  The society is there to offer advice. Those of us who have had any connection with the I.A.O.S. will not grudge this grant to the society for the useful work which it does.  I am connected with a creamery and the advice given by the society to that creamery committee, and upon which they acted, has led them in the right direction.</P>
    <P>There is just one thing that I may say in criticism of Deputy Hennessy's plea for the veterinary surgeons in connection with the Department of Agriculture.  Complaints have been made to me that their services might be more effective at the shipping ports.  Of course we do not believe all the stories that we hear, but now and again actual cases are brought to one's notice which show I think that there could be an improvement. Some of these men at the shipping ports get the name of being overzealous in some things and not zealous enough in others.  Some of the shippers have complained bitterly that their cows are stopped sometimes unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>One instance, which I admit it is hard to believe, but which was vouched for at the time, is this: A veterinary inspector stopped a particular cow from being shipped on the ground that it would be likely to <Col N="855" /> calve on the voyage.  Word was sent to the owner, and he wrote in reply that it must be a mistake, because the cow had already calved. There must be some laxity if incidents like that could occur.  Deputy Hennessy suggests if we pay them better they will do their duty better. If a man does his work well we will not grudge paying him.</P>
    <P>Another matter that I would like to mention is in regard to bulls.  I am with the Minister for Agriculture in his desire to improve the standard of cattle in the country.  I know that his ideal is the right one, but there is a notion in the country that the Minister, through the people he sends out, is moving too fast towards that ideal.  There is a great deal of abortion in certain districts in the country, and it is alleged in some cases to be due to the scarcity of bulls; that there are too many strippers in the country, and that the price of bulls at the March sales was altogether prohibitive for the ordinary farmer.  I think it would not do any harm if we moved less quickly in that direction, so that there might be sufficient of these animals in the country for the work. But, on the whole, I thoroughly endorse the work of the Department of Agriculture.  It is the one Department which we unhesitatingly support, because we believe it is through the Department of Agriculture and its work that the better days that we all hope are in store for this country will come.</P>

      <P>Deputy Haslett has stated that the work done by the Minister for Agriculture and his Department is work of a very important nature, in so far as it is work in connection with the most important industry we have in this country.  The only criticism I have to make of this Estimate is that it shows an increase this year.  I believe that the time has arrived, in view of the prices prevailing at the moment for agricultural produce, when we should have a reduction in these annual estimates.  Of course, when you have Deputies such as <Col N="856" /> Deputy Hennessy having a particular interest in a certain type of official&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;it would, of course, be hard to reduce expenditure.  I would like Deputy Hennessy to consider the conditions generally of agriculture existing at the moment in the Free State.  When dealing with this question of cost I may say I am out for efficiency as well as Deputy Hennessy, but I would like always to consider the position of those who have to pay&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite true, and perhaps more than some of us, but, really, the fault lies with the people who expect too much from our Department and ask them to do too much.  Notwithstanding the different Acts passed, and passed with the best intention, I admit, during the last few years, one cannot get away from the fact that these Acts have not led to an increase in agricultural prices.  Take butter and eggs, for instance.  They show at the moment a downward tendency. Another very important fact in connection with the cost of the Department is that while we pay very large sums for our premium bulls, if my information is correct, thousands of young calves are slaughtered every year in the south of Ireland and exported to the English market&mdash; London, Manchester, and so on.  It is rather peculiar that, after paying big prices for premium bulls, calves should be slaughtered and exported. I do not know whether the calves left over would be the right type or not, but it seems a peculiar arrangement that that should be allowed to go on at the present time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">

      <P>There is no use waxing eloquent over a slip of a word. I do not pay such attention to a mere slip.  We want to be more natural and less artificial and then we might get on better.</P>
      <P>There is another matter to which I wish to refer, and that is, to ask the Minister for Agriculture whether representations were made to him from the Committee of Agriculture in Louth in reference to the granting of premiums for Ulster boars. There is an opinion that the fact that premiums have been refused for Ulster boars by the Department has inflicted great injury on many of the farmers who at the moment are doing a very limited trade with the North of Ireland.  While the large Yorkshire may be the best type of pig for the bacon industry in general, I think the Minister should consider whether it would not be right to allow the committee there to grant a premium to people who are willing to keep the large Ulster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I come to what may be called the hardy annual, viz., the Cooley potato question.  As the Minister knows, this question has presented great difficulties for a number of years.  It is a question, however, all Deputies will agree, I think, that must be faced sooner or later.  When I tell Deputies that the farmers of Cooley who sowed potatoes were offered five shillings a ton for them in the market, it will be readily admitted, I think, that this is a very serious question and one that requires very serious consideration.  In order to bring this matter home to Deputies who, perhaps, owing to the fact that they do not represent that constituency may not have any live <Col N="858" /> interest in the welfare of the farmers there.  I would like to point out a few facts in connection with the position as it exists at the moment. To plant an acre of potatoes costs from £28 to £30.  If we assume that the average yield per acre is about 14 tons&mdash;it may probably be 18 to 20 tons&mdash;at 5/- a ton, the prices received by farmers in that area at present would be from £3 to £4 per acre.  Potatoes being the staple industry, one can visualise the position of these farmers there.  I really think the time has arrived when something should be done, either by way of giving monetary relief to the farmers of the district or by the Department taking some steps to have the disease of black scab eradicated from the soil.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested by the Minister that the whole danger of allowing potatoes out was the likelihood that the soil adhering to them would be the means of spreading the disease.  Not being an expert in this matter, I would not like to put my opinion against the opinions expressed by the Minister's officials, but, as one of those who believe in the practical rather than in the theoretical side of questions, I find that for a period extending over seven or eight years, turnips, cabbages, and other root crops were allowed to be exported out of the area, and in not one single instance was black scab discovered as a result. That is a rather significant fact.  Whilst I have never advocated that potatoes should be let out wholesale at all times of the year, yet, I think, in justice to the farmers, the Minister could, with safety, allow potatoes out when the planting season is over, that is, from now on.  I cannot see that there would be any danger of the disease being carried in view of the reasons I have stated&mdash;that other root crops were allowed out for years&mdash;and that the Department itself, seeing the consistency of the argument put forward by the farmers, issued an Order prohibiting the export of these root crops from the area.  I think the Minister will admit that <Col N="859" /> the position there now is anything but rosy.</P>
    <P>While Deputy Hennessy was speaking about the salaries of the veterinary inspectors, I was thinking of the potatoes that are being sold in Cooley at 5/- a ton.  The two things cannot go hand in hand.  I readily admit that the Minister has been more or less sympathetic to the people there lately.  He has certainly gone far to meet their demands, and he tried to help them by giving them an extra acreage of beet to grow, for which they are deeply grateful.  I am not one of those who would like to belittle the efforts of the Minister, or to minimise in any way what he has done.  However, I think something might be done to allow the farmers of that district to get out the potatoes they have in stock, and to dispose of them in a free market.  That would do much to ease the situation.</P>
    <P>I do not know if I would be wise in referring to the importation of foreign oats.  The importation of German oats into the Free State was recently raised by questions in the House.  I think it is high time that something was done to keep out foreign oats, owing to the very large stock of oats that still remain in the hands of the farmers.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the position of Irish Free State eggs in the market, and to ask the Minister if it is a fact that eggs exported to Great Britain have commanded a lower price than those exported from Northern Ireland.  Is it a fact that Free State eggs are practically put in the same category as Chinese, Russian, and other foreign eggs in the British market?  There again one must consider the utility of all the Acts that have been passed for the express purpose of improving our agricultural products.  I am afraid the rules governing ordinary supply and demand upset all calculations, and whilst I appreciate the work that has been, and is being, done by the Minister and his Department for the better marketing of our produce, and also for the education of <Col N="860" /> our farmers, still in all sincerity I think the time has arrived when the Estimates, instead of showing an increase, should show a decrease. After all, we must take into consideration the position of the country at the present time, and the prices prevailing for all our produce. There is no use in putting one section of our people on a pedestal&mdash;in other words, giving them all the plums&mdash;and letting the rest have all the haws.  It is better to have a more equitable distribution of the wealth of the country.  I hope in the near future, if for nothing more than it would be some comfort to the Minister and his officials, that the prices of agricultural produce will show an upward tendency.</P>
    <P>The cattle industry has certainly been greatly improved as a result of the various Acts that were passed. During the last four or five years I have made it my business to make inquiries from graziers and from men interested in the cattle trade, and they all say that these Acts have been very beneficial to the trade in general, and that the only thing that is wanted is enhanced prices.  Taking everything into consideration, I hope that the Estimates will show a steady decrease, and that when replying the Minister will refer to the points I have raised, especially that affecting the potato growers in Cooley.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothySheehy1927Cor" hpid="Mr. Sheehy (West Cork) Mr. Sheehy (West Cork)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehy</NameTxt>
      <P>(West Cork): I support this Estimate.  I consider it would be a great blow indeed to agriculture if the Dáil were to do anything which would postpone or delay the activities of this most important Department.  Every Deputy has admitted that in a measure the fate of the country hangs on agriculture, and that if agriculture were not to progress we would be more or less down and out.  As a close student of the work done by the Minister for Agriculture, I must say that to my mind no man could do better work in that Department than he is doing.  Only last week I had the honour to accompany fifty farmers from my constituency on a visit to the College of Science in Cork.  They visited the Munster Institute; <Col N="861" /> they saw the great farm that has been obtained for the Dairy Institute at the University, and they saw activities being conducted there in connection with their industry that filled them with great joy, so that after a prolonged visit they went home, satisfied that, as far as the Minister and the Government were concerned, they were doing their best to educate boys and girls who were born and brought up on the land in such a way that when they grew up they would be able to carry on agriculture in the most scientific way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk about the fall in prices.  At the last fair in Skibbereen a few weeks ago I felt it my duty, while on the way to the railway to come up to the Dáil, to interview farmers from the surrounding country who had brought cattle to the fair.  Each and every one of them said that the fair was a good one, that prices were good, and that there was a great demand. Could anything be more satisfactory than that?  So far as the pig industry is concerned, I would invite Deputies opposite, who are so despondent as to the future of agriculture, to come down to my constituency and to go along the seaboard from Skibbereen by Crook-haven, Bantry and Castletownbere-haven, and they will see sights there that will astonish and surprise them. They will see small farmers of from seven to thirty and forty acres, each with what amounts to a little factory on his farm, rearing large quantities of bonhams, pigs and calves.  They will see what the real patriots in the country are doing, because the men along that seaboard and in the backward parts of the congested areas do not talk, but work.  They are working all the time.  They will see small farmers in my constituency with thirty cows, who have four or five sows and about sixty bonhams, so that they never need buy a bonham. They will see the real pillars of the State there.  They will see a farmer with thirty or forty cows, who tests his cows and who gets rid of bad cows.  If some of the farmers <Col N="862" /> in my constituency had the courage to do so, they could send their cows to the Show in Dublin and win prizes with them.  That is where there is intensive farming and work.  If Deputy Ryan likes to come down, I will take him round to these places myself&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Sheehy Mr. Sheehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and I will show him what real farming is.  Farmers there are not at all despondent when there is a little fall in prices.  They are intelligent; they know perfectly well that there is a great crisis on the other side, where their stuff is sold. They know that because of unemployment in England prices are falling in the Free State, that men and women are not working in England as they were, and that as a matter of course the prices of eggs and butter are down, but that is only a temporary matter.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on continuing his activities.  Let him continue his endeavours to have better butter and better eggs produced and he will be on the high road to success. I heard Deputy Ryan refer to the price of butter.  What price would we get for butter if it were made up as it was fifty years ago?  It would be of the third or fourth quality and it would not be sold in England; it would have to be sent to Portugal and to Africa, as it used to be in the old days.  Now, thank God, our butter is going to the highest market, and it will continue to go there, owing to the activities of the Minister and of the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephGorry" hpid="Mr. Gorry Mr. Gorry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorry</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity of calling the attention of the Minister for Agriculture to the fact that there is now plenty of time ahead of us before the coming harvest to go into this question of the marketing of Irish produce, particularly our grain. In the midland areas at present, which are tillage areas, there are hundreds of tons of oats lying on the lofts, and farmers tell me that they require very little corn this year, except in some cases where they use it for feeding.  I would like the Minister for Agriculture and his Department <Col N="863" /> to examine the question as to whether it is advisable to allow the continued importation of corn, no matter whether it is from Germany or elsewhere.  I believe that the farmers in the tillage areas, who are at present hard pressed, would be willing to produce the amount of corn that is now imported, even if it were to go to other areas, and I do say that immediate attention should be given to this question.  This is a sad state of affairs in a country like this, and when I make that assertion I blame farmers and I blame everyone. I take a certain amount of responsibility too, as I am a farmer. We need a great deal of co-operation between the farmers and the Department to solve this question.  The situation is a serious one, and there is no use in trying to get away from it.  The Press invariably makes capital in both directions out of the importation of corn.</P>
      <P>When we see other countries seriously considering the question of the protection of their home industries, I think we should consider this matter before the coming harvest, because undoubtedly huge quantities of corn are coming in.  If we could see, after close examination, that the home market could be saved for the Irish farmer, and particularly for the farmers in the tillage area, I think we should do it.  Now is the time to tackle this question, because the harvest is almost with us, and we will have a worse condition of affairs this year than last year if things are not looked into immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with that I would ask the Minister when we might hope to have the Report of the Commission of Inquiry into Grain Growing, a matter about which some people are anxious.  On the question of grain-production in general, I have one fault to find with the Estimate&mdash;that there is not enough money in it for the plant-breeding section of the Department.  I think that no Irish farmer or taxpayer would grumble if the Department were given adequate facilities for <Col N="864" /> experimental research.  It is certain that the finding out of the most suitable varieties of corn and of cereals in general for the Irish farmer to grow, under different climatic and soil conditions, is one of very great importance.  I personally think that section of the Department deserves very great credit for what it has already done.  I think, however, its work is hampered, and I would like if the Minister would go further into the question to see if more facilities could not be given to it.  As regards some of our southern officials who have been attracted northwards.  I think it is a pity, when we have able and efficient young men in the South of Ireland, young men who have been educated here, that we should not try to keep all of them to help to develop our part of the country.  If they have gone, please God we will have them back with us some day, working with us when we have a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>On the question of the creameries, I think the best advice the Department could at the moment give the farmers in areas where creameries are working, particularly in areas where creameries have been lately established&mdash;new areas like the one I am associated with&mdash;would be that they should stick to their creameries and maintain their milk supplies. As one means of increasing the milk supply from these areas, I think the Department should encourage newly established cow testing associations as against the ones that have been long established.  I think they should make some little differentiation between the two.  I have had practical experience of this work and I know it is hard to attract farmers into the newly-established cow testing associations.  You have to get a supervisor to work for a remuneration that is unsatisfactory. He may be dealing with 150 or 200 cows when it would be just as easy for him to deal with double that number. Until the stage has been reached that farmers have been convinced of the advantages to be derived from cow testing, I would suggest to the Department that, in the <Col N="865" /> establishment of new cow testing associations, they should be a little more generous than they are in the allocation of their funds to them. Areas where cow testing has been carried out for a number of years could be helpful by not expecting the same generous treatment as that given to new associations.</P>
    <P>I think if the question was examined into the Department would find it would be better if smaller areas were decided on when cow-testing associations were being formed. I am closely in contact with our own area and I know the difficulties that have to be met with.  Last year and this year difficulty was experienced to get enough cows to form an association, but now that the association has been formed, and that the farmers are interested in the creameries they are well satisfied with the work done.  They find that cow testing is of real advantage to them.  When they get an opportunity of examining the returns in respect of the cows under test, we find that they are inclined to come into the association and become interested in its work.  I have hopes that in our particular area we will have a greater number of farmers joining this year than last.  I think it would be advisable to give these new cow testing associations generous treatment in the initial stages of their development.  I must say that in our particular area we have got good assistance from the cow testing section of the Department, their officials and all concerned.  Speaking on behalf of the supervisors from whom we expect efficient work, if you have not good supervisors, men who are interested in their work and are fairly well paid for doing it, then you cannot expect really good service.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a word with regard to the loans granted for the building of creameries within the last few years.  I would make this suggestion: That this year the Department should not ask for the repayment of the principal on the loans outstanding.  What I am suggesting is that the repayment of the <Col N="866" /> principal might not be insisted on this year, but that the creameries simply be asked to pay the interest on the loans this year.  I make that suggestion because of the present depression in prices.  I hope that depression is not going to last; that, as a result of the labours of the Tribunal that has been set up to inquire into the marketing of butter, the position in the matter of prices for agriculture will brighten.  If the Department could see its way to adopt the suggestion I have made, it would be found to give great relief in these new areas where creameries have been put up.  It may be impossible to do what I suggest, but the question is one that ought to be considered.</P>
    <P>A question that is intimately related to agriculture, and that is arousing a good deal of debate at the present time is that of de-rating.  I am not going to discuss the question of de-rating on this Estimate.  There is one suggestion I have to make, and it is, that the Department of Agriculture might be doing a very useful work by bringing the agricultural instructors throughout the country together, and getting them to discuss this question.  It would be very valuable.  I think, to have their opinions on it.  The agricultural instructors are looked up to by quite a lot of farmers throughout the country.  They are men who have had a scientific training.  As a result of the efficient training they have received, their contact with the people throughout the country, and their intimate knowledge of the conditions prevailing, they would be able to give impartial views on the question.  In my opinion, their services in that respect might prove very helpful.</P>
    <P>On the question of wheat-growing, that is one on which I think we might reasonably ask the Department to concentrate again.  This week I was speaking to a man who has been milling wheat for quite a number of years.  We discussed the question of wheat production and the milling of Irish wheat.  He was of opinion that, as regards Irish <Col N="867" /> wheat, we could aim at producing 50 per cent. of our wheat requirements; that no one could grumble at the bread produced if we had a 50 per cent. admixture of foreign wheat with Irish wheat.  He told me it was usual to expect a 10 per cent. reduction in the kiln drying of wheat.  When you contrast that with the fact that the milling of foreign wheat contains a certain moisture, it is possible that in the mixing of Irish wheat and foreign wheat that difficulty could be lessened. It certainly would be a great advantage if more could be done in that respect.  I would like if the Department would take up that question again and concentrate on it.</P>
    <P>I know that other countries at present, including our nearest neighbour, are taking it up very seriously. It is going to be a matter of vital concern for the British farmer in the near future, so that I think we should try and do more in that respect. With regard to marketing, I hope the inquiry that is being set up on the butter question will succeed in finding a solution for the problem. I think the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, no matter what developments may have occurred, will have in future more and more of an onus thrown on them in this respect.  As the agricultural body in contact with the co-operative societies in the country more will be expected from them on the marketing question.  I am not in agreement with Deputy Maguire as regards something he said about the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society.  Certainly they have some faults, but as far as my connection with them in the development of creameries is concerned I certainly pay tribute to the efficiency of their organisers and the help they gave us.  The Department and the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society would want to work in close cooperation. The Society will in the future of necessity require more and more assistance from the Department, and it is under this particular <Col N="868" /> Estimate that assistance will have to come.  I hope the Minister for Agriculture will consider these matters, particularly the question of cow-testing and the question of the repayment of the principal on loans to creameries.</P>

      <P>At any rate the farmers are suffering.  There is dissatisfaction in my area as regards the creameries that have been made redundant.  Farmers now have in some cases to travel seven or eight miles to creameries and that is a great disadvantage.  On the question of grain admixture, of course grass farming and tillage are independent. In Lower Ormonde and other parts of North Tipperary where tillage is done on a large scale they buy 90 per cent. of their sheep in North Galway. I think it is up to the Minister to help the tillage farmer as far as possible.  As regards bulls, there is dissatisfaction that some of the bulls passed are not up to the standard the ordinary farmer would expect.  I do not claim to be an expert but I have some knowledge of cattle, and in my opinion some of the bulls that have been exposed for sale in markets or fairs should not have been passed.  Some farmers grumble that their bulls have been disqualified and they say they are <Col N="869" /> far superior to some of those that have been passed.  I would like to get a reply from the Minister on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKilroy" hpid="Mr. Kilroy Mr. Kilroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilroy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a matter I wish to put before the Minister which particularly concerns the sheep farmers in the West.  In Mayo we have a large mountainous district and there are many thousands of sheep raised on it.  Great objection is taken to a recent order regarding sheep dipping made by the Department. Sheep raisers in the West do not object to dipping their sheep three times in the year.  They have always been doing that and they are interested in it.  Most of them have their own dipping apparatus.  The seasons which have been ordered by the Department for sheep dipping are not what the farmers consider suitable and they are anxious an alteration would be made in that particular order.  This is a matter they regard as of very serious importance. As I said they are prepared to dip their sheep three times a year.  The first summer dipping would be most suitable between the 1st August and the 15th September as against the Department's Order from the 13th June to the 31st July.  They desire to carry out the second dipping between the 1st October and the 15th November as against the Department's Order for two dippings between 1st September and the 15th November.</P>
      <P>Apparently the Department specifies two dippings in that period within fourteen days of each other. The farmers' argument against that is that the sheep will suffer great hardship, having to be rounded up twice inside of 14 days.  In many areas the sheep ramble over an extent of ten miles of mountain, and it is very difficult to have to collect them twice over such a huge area. Those concerned are anxious to have the third dipping about the 1st February.  Mountain sheep lamb late in the season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the dipping operation was to be extended to a later period it would be hardship on the sheep because of <Col N="870" /> the near approach of the lambing season.  The sheep raisers are anxious to keep their sheep clean, hence their desire for the February dipping before they lamb.  With regard to the sheep dip, they say it would cost between 2d. and 3d. per head to dip their sheep under the order in force.  At present there is a charge of 1d. per head for the dipping of their sheep levied.  The farmers consider that this amount is not likely to be sufficient to cover the quantity of sheep dip which would be required to do the job thoroughly according to their wishes. They are anxious that the arrangements for the dipping should be left to themselves and that instead of being notified by an inspector to have their sheep dipped at the particular period they should be left the option of notifying the inspector, or preferably the Civic Guards, when it would suit them to have their sheep dipped.  They are prepared to have the dipping done at stated periods, but to be held to a particular date by order of the inspector would not suit them owing to the fact of the sheep rambling over such a large area and also because of weather conditions and many other reasons.</P>
    <P>It may not suit the farmers to have their sheep collected on a particular day.  In order that a clash would be avoided the farmers' interests should be considered, particularly when, as I have stated, they are prepared to dip their sheep three times and in every way within reason to comply with any order which will further their interests and safeguard their stock from infection.  I am informed that the present order seems to be designed more to combat the maggot fly and its consequent results than for protection against scab.  Also, I am informed that mountain sheep, while on the hills, do not suffer from the fly or maggot. The farmers have a particular objection to men being appointed as inspectors of dipping by contract.</P>
    <P>The farmers are anxious, therefore that they should be left in a position to notify the Gárda that sheep are being dipped or, are having them collected <Col N="871" /> for dipping, that the dip should be left in their own hands and that they be permitted to buy their own dip and put what they consider a generous supply on the sheep.  They do not desire to use the dip sparingly.  It is a remarkable fact, I am told, that in the mountainy districts there is not a trace of scab. I should explain that I am not a farmer and that I do not know anything about the matter except what deputations whom I met recently have told me.  Scab, they say, is only got in the lowlands and that while the present order may be suitable for the lowlands where sheep are in enclosed fields and where they can be gathered at short notice, it is unsuitable for men who have to cover large areas such as those in mountainous districts.  They desire to be given an opportunity of notifying the Gárda, instead of having the superintendent or inspector coming round and notifying them to dip on a certain date.  They do not wish to avoid the dipping operations. They are, in fact, anxious to have these operations carried out three times a year as they have done in the past.  The dates which I have mentioned are those given to me by the farmers who are particularly concerned, and who consider them of vital importance.  There are large areas in North and South Mayo and in both areas the opinion is the same. I am anxious that the Minister should give this matter immediate consideration and that he will see his way to meet the wishes of the sheep raisers of Mayo and Galway in this matter, some of whom own many hundreds if not thousands of sheep and are therefore very seriously concerned.</P>

      <P>It may have gone to the Department, but I have not seen it.  In regard to Deputy Kilroy's point, I may say that that is a matter that could be much more suitably discussed in Committee than by way of speech in reply.  It raises all sorts of detailed questions. As the Deputy pointed out, there are three or four periods during which sheep have to be dipped, and there are special reasons why they should be dipped during those periods and also within a fortnight of each other.  The regulations governing such dipping have been put into operation after considerable consideration, and any changes would necessitate a detailed examination of the regulations and a discussion with the parties concerned. We have to make regulations to suit the people of the whole country and not those of one particular area.  The Deputy mentioned that he had recently received deputations on the matter.  I may say that I have received deputations, too.  I will be willing to discuss matters of that sort with deputations, but it would be out of the question to discuss matters so highly technical as these by way of speech from the Deputy and answer from me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Dr. Ryan's points, the first he mentioned was the question of contagious abortion.  That disease is easily diagnosed.  So far as we are concerned, we have as much information about it as they have anywhere else.  First of all, we do a certain amount of research ourselves, but research work is going on all over the world.  Large sums of money are spent on it, much larger sums than we can afford, and we are in touch with the latest developments and receive the information <Col N="873" /> obtained as a result of that research work.  The Deputy can take it that as soon as any reliable data or conclusions are reached we get them.  So far as we are concerned, the only thing we can do is, having all the knowledge that there is to be got at the moment, to act upon it.  We do so, and we advise the farmers as to what they should do when an outbreak takes place and how to limit it by isolation.</P>
    <P>In particular we supply at a nominal cost the vaccine recommended as a preventative.  We supply that through veterinary surgeons. We believe that it should be administered by veterinary surgeons for a number of reasons.  That is all we can do in the matter.  I quite admit that contagious abortion entails very big losses in this country, and causes big losses also in other countries.  There is, in fact, less attention paid to it than to a number of other matters not nearly so important. All we can do is to get all the information to be had in America, Denmark, England, or any other country where they do research, in addition to any conclusions we can come to ourselves, and spread the light through our instructors. We do the only thing that could be done in any country, namely, we supply the vaccine practically free of cost.</P>
    <P>There are various forms of mamitis.  There again the treatment is known and, in so far as it is known, the farmers can avail of it. I do not think that the Department can turn itself simply into a veterinary department to supply a free veterinary service to all farmers throughout the country.  If it did we would have to pension off all the veterinary surgeons in the country. that would be expensive and unpopular with Deputy Dr. Hennessy, and probably Deputies opposite.  In addition, we would have to employ four or five times a bigger staff, with the result that Deputy Dr. Ryan would have still further cause for complaint about Government interference with the private lives of the farmers.  So far as tuberculosis is concerned, I am a little bit chary of <Col N="874" /> discussing it with medical men, no matter on what benches they sit.  I have a theory, as an ignorant layman, that they think too much about it, and that it is not nearly as important as they think.  I say that as a layman and a farmer, with all deference to Deputies Dr. Ryan and Dr. Hennessy.  So far as we are concerned we take the only effective steps that can be taken.  We make it worth while for the farmer to report the presence of tuberculosis.  We pay him one-third of the value in advanced cases and two-thirds in cases that are not advanced.  I do not think that we could do anything more effective.  That should appeal to people who call themselves practical people.  Nothing is more likely to induce a farmer to notify tuberculosis and to dispose of such stock than to get something for them.</P>
    <P>Tuberculosis is not nearly as serious here as in other countries where cattle are in-fed.  Everybody agrees that bad housing produces tuberculosis amongst in-fed cattle as compared with those that are out-fed and fed under natural conditions. The Deputy complained about the Cattle Traders' Association coming to me and getting neither help nor sympathy.  I have a longer experience of that Association than the Deputy and I venture to offer him a little advice about them.  I gathered from him that he gave them a lot of sympathy.  They have not much use for sympathy.  That is the reason that I did not waste any on them.  They want the goods delivered and not sympathy.  They did not come to me looking for anything specific in connection with transport. They did not suggest that I should purchase a line of steamers to trade between this country and England. They asked for certain information from the Department.  They got all that information and, as knowledge is power in so far as we can give them such knowledge if they are seriously considering the question of transport between this country and our principal markets they will get it from us.  That is what they want and not sympathy.</P>
    <P>In regard to the officer in the Department <Col N="875" /> who deals with transport inquiries, the position is vacant at the moment but I think it will be filled again.  He of course was in constant touch with the Department of Industry and Commerce because it is necessary, as the Deputy knows, under the Act which amalgamated the railways, to have certain freights settled by the Railway Tribunal. Before the Department of Industry and Commerce make representations to the Railway Tribunal with a view to fixing industrial or agricultural freights, it is necessary that they should have some officer in the Department in touch with them who would give them all the technical and agricultural information they require for the purpose of making a case before the Railway Tribunal to fix the rates.</P>
    <P>The Deputy was very pessimistic about the price of produce in the English market.  He quoted a lot of statistics, some of which, I dare say, are quite sound, but which I do not understand and which would take too long to follow.  In any event they are of very little importance.  I agree with Deputy Brennan that statistics are worse than immoral literature and that they are doing more harm.  They are nearly doing as much harm as sedition.  They have become almost seditious, and a seditious use is made of them, in fact. So far as certain of the statistics are concerned, I will put in a few figures on my side.  These figures are the official figures of the English Ministry of Agriculture and therefore, from my point of view, are more likely to be reliable than, I do not say those which the Deputy himself produces, but those taken from commercial sources.  These are the figures of an impartial body which has got an efficient organisation to get them.  It is a Department which has no axe to grind and no interest in cooking the figures one way or another.  The figures which it gives in the case of eggs are as follows:&mdash;For 1928 for the twelve months from January 1st to December 31st, the price of Irish Free State eggs was 17. 5s. per long hundred, for <Col N="876" /> Dutch 16.7s. and for Danish 16.3s. These are not Cumann na nGaedheal statistics or Fianna Fáil statistics. They are statistics which are given in the official publications of the British Ministry of Agriculture, and the Deputy can take it from me that, for the purpose of a sensible discussion, they are about right.  That was the position in 1928.</P>
    <P>The price of English or Northern Ireland eggs is not given here, but I will come to that later.  I am merely concerned to point out that Irish eggs have been sold at a better price than Dutch eggs or Danish eggs.  For the same period in 1929, in respect of the same produce, we only got the figures quite recently, and we have not been able to get the Danish figures so far.  The figures are:&mdash;Irish Free State eggs 18.5s. per long hundred, Dutch 16.5s. per long hundred.  The Deputy can take it from me, regardless of the welter of statistics which he quoted, that Irish Free State eggs are now being sold at a higher price than any imported eggs in the British market. Deputies can further take it from me that that is as a result of the passing of the Irish Agricultural Produce (Eggs) Act.  Our eggs were becoming a bye-word on the British market until that Act was passed.  There is no question of doubt that the Agricultural Produce (Eggs) Act not only stabilised the price of Irish eggs but gradually forced them to the top of the market as compared with foreign eggs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister state what is the price of eggs coming from Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. Quite recently the British, being a sensible people, and wanting to do a turn for their own, made regulations that all foreign eggs should be stamped.  Unfortunately, economically we are regarded as a foreign people.  Politically, it is fortunate, perhaps, that we are regarded as a foreign people, but economically, in this instance, it was unfortunate. Northern Ireland being regarded as part of the same political unit as Great Britain had not to stamp their eggs.  The first reaction to that Act <Col N="877" /> was an increase in price of unstamped eggs.  Quite naturally the English housewife is much the same as the housewife of any other nationality in the matter of buying eggs. She has a rough and ready method of shopping.  She knows that if she gets an unstamped egg it is a home-produced egg, and in nine cases out of ten she is right in thinking that a home-produced egg is likely to be fresher than a foreign egg, because, after all, it takes longer to bring a foreign egg to the market.  As a result of that, the first thing that happened was a very big discrepancy between the price of British eggs, including Northern Ireland eggs, and any other eggs.  That particular margin is getting smaller.  It is smaller than last year, and as time goes on it will get smaller.</P>
      <P>I think that with a certain amount of efficient administration of the Agricultural Produce (Eggs) Act, if we continue to administer it as stringently as we have been administering it, we will close the gap entirely, because I think that the English housewife will come to realise that the fact of an egg being stamped &ldquo;Irish Free State&rdquo; is a genuine guarantee that it is likely to be as fresh, if not fresher, than the English egg.  I am hoping that the first reaction of the English regulation will pass away, and that by continuing to do what we are doing consistently, sending over Irish eggs of the best quality, it will in the long run do us a good turn.  In the long run the name &ldquo;Irish Free State&rdquo; on an egg will be a mark of freshness and quality, and the Act which created slight reactions against us at first will be to our advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to butter, I am again giving the prices for 1928 and the official figures of the London Ministry of Agriculture as given by the Stationery Office here.  The figures are as follow:&mdash;Irish Creamery 182/6; Danish 192/6; Australian salted 171/-; New Zealand, salted, 179/-; Argentine 172/-.  I have the figures month by month and these are the arithmetical average to a decimal point.  The <Col N="878" /> 1929 figures taken from the same source are as follows:&mdash;Irish Creamery 179/-; Danish 186/-; Australian 175/-; New Zealand 177/-; Argentine 174/-.  The first thing the Deputy may notice is that in 1928 the difference between the Irish and Danish figures was 10/- and that in the next year it had dropped to 7/-.  The second thing he might notice is that Irish creamery butter seems to be higher in price on the English market than any other butter except Danish if the British figures are reliable, and I suggest that they are more reliable than anything he can quote.</P>
    <P>The third thing he should remember is that it is not a fair comparison as we have only a seasonable supply. The butter we send out during the months of January, February and March is cold storage butter and that brings down the average price. I have not had time to examine our figures month by month, but if we compared the figures for May, June and July it would be seen that the discrepancy between our figures and those of the Danish figures would be much less.  I think that we will be able to reach the Danish standard. We are near enough to it, but we will have to get over one great disadvantage and that is that we have a seasonable supply.  We have to open shop for the year in the month of March or April, whereas the Danes have the shop open the whole year round.</P>
    <P>That is the state of affairs that is likely to last for good and sufficient reasons, and it will put us at a slight disadvantage against the Danes. Again, anybody who says that Irish butter has not improved as a result of the operations of the Dairy Produce Acts does not know what he is talking about.  It is important that it should be clearly understood it has improved.  Again, I want to say that, on the question of eggs and butter, no Government can get any producer any higher prices for their produce than the world market prices.  No Government department is responsible for the fall in market prices.  Deputies talk as if the Department <Col N="879" /> was responsible for the fall in world prices.  The Department cannot increase the price of Irish produce and should not get any credit for world prices.  All that Government action can do is to improve the quality of the goods.  If you improve the quality of the goods you will get higher prices, not because you are increasing world prices but because you are selling a different article.  I suppose that is pretty obvious to everybody, and yet people speak as if it were not.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, I might mention that no State action in this country can increase the price of Irish butter in the Irish market, because in all these articles we have a surplus, and we will have a surplus for a number of years.  The prices in the home market are governed by the prices in the world markets.  The prices in the home markets cannot be increased by tariffs.  They can only be increased by subsidies.  I will not go any further in that matter, because that is all irrelevant.  So much for prices.</P>
    <P>We do not pay the assistant overseers entirely to teach the farmers how to fence.  There are assistant overseers in Connemara, Mayo, and places like that, where there are large stretches of unfenced mountains, and where there is very little livestock, where the question of fences is not a general problem, but a special problem.  The assistant overseers, in my opinion, are doing extremely good work in the congested districts.  In the congested districts most of the people are small farmers, not so well educated, unfortunately, and more technical education and facilities are required than by people in other parts of the country.  Every scheme that we have in the way of getting new seeds and new livestock into these districts was made possible by the operations of the assistant overseers.  In fact, it is a high testimony to the assistant overseers that there has been no failure in the potato crop since their operations began.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="880" /> We have not yet made regulations under the Dead Meat Act.  Before the Department make those regulations they will consult all the interested parties.  I do not say that they will agree with every proposal put up to them, but they will consult them and hear everything that has to be said.</P>
    <P>I heard the old story again that my policy is grass and that Deputy Ryan's policy is tillage and that an acre under tillage is worth £13, while an acre under grass is worth £1. When I hear that sort of talk I am left gasping.  I have an acre of mangolds. They are no good to me unless I have an acre of grass.  I could go on and draw an interesting deduction for years as to the comparative value of grass and mangolds.  I have an acre of mangolds and unless I have a few acres of grass to keep the cows alive the mangolds would be no good to me.  Therefore, to grow grass is of equal value with the growing of mangolds.</P>
    <P>I now come to deal with the Athenry Station.  Deputy Brodrick raised the question of Athenry and about the cows in Athenry.  The position about the cows is this&mdash; quite a silly scare was started there by the M.O.H. of the county, who talked about his suspicions and so on.  When the Local Government Estimate was under discussion here Deputy Jordan raised the point. But I heard nothing about it since. The real trouble is that the standard is being left where it was.  The scare was first raised by the M.O.H., next by the Board of Health, and finally by Deputy Jordan, and they are all running away from it.  The fact of the matter is that there is nothing in it.  It was an attempt to start a silly scare.  The position in Athenry is that we have 30 cows.  Eight of them are reacters.  That is, they react to the tuberculin test.  If Deputies are highly nervous about this matter I want to say that they have no clinical examination there.  The animals have been examined by veterinary surgeons.  I want to say further that the milk of these cows for some time was being examined <Col N="881" /> biologically and there was no sign of tuberculosis.  But I stopped the biological examination as a gratuitous piece of expense that should not be carried out.  The cows were also microscopically examined and there was no sign of tuberculosis. If the M.O.H. had gone into the station at Athenry five or six years ago he would find a lot more reacters. At present these eight cows are kept separate.  We do that sort of thing in Athenry because it is a State Department.  I would not do that if they were my own cows.  The fact that they react does not prove that they have tuberculosis at all. The point about the tuberculin test is this, that if a cow does not react she certainly has not tuberculosis. If a cow reacts she may have, but she may have no clinical sign of tuberculosis, good, bad or indifferent. If no sign is revealed either by a biological or microscopical examination then there is no tuberculosis.  These are amongst the best cows, and I have not the slightest intention of slaughtering these cows for human food.  I will keep them until I get good heifers out of them&mdash;if I am Minister for Agriculture&mdash;and then I will let them die at a ripe old age.</P>
    <P>With regard to the veterinary surgeons, I agree with a lot of what Deputy Hennessy and Deputy Brennan have said.  The live-stock trade in this country is a most important trade and will always remain one of the most important industries in the country.  Above all things we want really efficient veterinary surgeons. We have efficient veterinary surgeons and I agree that they are hardly well enough paid.  I am glad to say that the Minister for Finance has now agreed to establish the veterinary surgeons and to let them proceed to their scale of salaries.  Up to this there was a bar to their scale. The scale was from £200 rising by £10 to £300 and there was a bar there.  Then it proceeded by £15 to £400.  There were only half of the veterinary surgeons established. Now they are all established.  They proceed along that scale yearly increasing <Col N="882" /> from £200 to £400 with the cost of living bonus whatever it may be, £163 would be the maximum bonus I think.  A salary of £200 to £400 is not an exorbitant one for professional men who have to spend three to five years in a secondary school and three or four years afterwards in the university, and who have to pay for their education all the time.  These men have important responsibilities in taking charge of the live-stock of a country like this where live-stock is so very important. I agree that it is long past the time when these men should be established.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the veterinary inspectors were first brought into the service unestablished, and their scale of salary was £200, rising by £10 to £300.  There was a bar there.  Some of them might never become established, and would remain at the £300.  Half of them became established.  For instance, fifteen out of thirty would become established, and that fifteen would proceed to £400.  Under the new state of affairs, everyone who comes in and passes the examination becomes automatically established, and then proceeds to the £400, getting an annual increment.  Apparently what the Deputy is concerned with is the position of a man who was on £300 for three, four or five years, and who now gets the benefit of establishment. The Deputy wants to know will that man get the increments over three, four, or five years at once.  Is not that the Deputy's point?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We take up the position here that we have to have our own scales.  This country must have its own standards.  Of course the salaries in Northern Ireland are the same as the salaries in England. There is a great lot to be said on the point that the veterinary surgeon here has at least as important a task as the veterinary surgeon in England, but England is not an agricultural country.  The position we take up generally is that this country must have its own standards, and it is no sound thing to say that the standard in the North or in England should apply here.  You must defend the whole matter on its merits.  The fact is, however, that the veterinary surgeons here are about to be established and there <Col N="885" /> will be increments given to the portal supervisors at our various ports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrThomasHennessy" hpid="Dr. Hennessy Dr. Hennessy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>What it means is that the veterinary surgeon with that service in this country has a salary of £400 plus bonus, and that comes to £563.  I agree it is not a big salary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrThomasHennessy" hpid="Dr. Hennessy Dr. Hennessy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hennessy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the increase was only in the one end.  In practice, the main point about it is that the Northern veterinary surgeon may reach a salary which is higher by £50.  With regard to the matter of creameries raised by Deputy Maguire, there is no sub-head for the purpose of lending money to societies to start creameries.  There is a sub-head for the purchase of creameries.  The matter of whether the price of butter is high or low is quite irrelevant.  Assuming it is high, the farmer should get his proportion of that high price; assuming it is low, then that is all the more reason why the farmer should get his due proportion.  His due proportion is the amount he should get after the minimum overhead expenses are deducted.  Our policy with regard to the purchase of creameries was really one aiming at <Col N="886" /> reducing the farmer's overhead expenses. It takes £500 a year to run a creamery.  If you can make the same quantity of butter with half the amount of money you can save a lot and that money should go back into the farmer's pocket.  If the price of butter is low that is all the more reason why the farmer should get the full amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the I.A.O.S. is concerned, I have no control over it, and the I.A.O.S. has no control over creameries in the sense that they are not responsible for the actual operation of creameries.  Deputy Maguire envisages a particular situation.  He rather seems to think that the I.A.O.S. should be responsible for the operation of, let us say, Ballinacargy creamery, and every other creamery in the country.  That is an entirely wrong point of view.  No Department in Dublin would be responsible for the day-to-day operations of 500 creameries.  That would be, if you like, State socialism, but State socialism on that scale is impossible. If the I.A.O.S. is to take responsibility for what every creamery does, it must have complete control.  It must have the power to employ a manager and to employ dairymaids, and it must have the power to procure machinery or sell butter.  If it is not to have all those powers there can be no halfway house.  The society itself should have complete control.  It is for Deputies to make their choice.  Do Deputies want a place in Dublin which will own, regulate and control all the creameries in the country, or do they want the committees to have control? The point is that each committee should be responsible for its own creamery.  There should be some organisation body, some educational body, to give them advice if they want advice.  That body should be responsible for giving them advice on matters of organisation and on technical questions.  So far as making a creamery a success is concerned, that is the business of the committee, and not even of the manager. If a co-operative society fails, let us <Col N="887" /> put the blame or the onus on the proper person.  In this country, everybody is running behind somebody else.  Nobody wants to take responsibility.  You must always get someone above to be blamed&mdash; some stalking-horse.  You cannot have any business in the country or any sort of backbone on these lines. The I.A.O.S. should not be blamed for the failure of societies; the committee should be blamed, and nobody else.</P>
    <P>As we are speaking of the failure of co-operative creamery societies, I may say that for every society that has failed twenty have succeeded. Deputy Maguire ought to wake up to the fact that co-operation has succeeded in this country.  There are hundreds of prosperous creameries all over the country, wanting money from nobody, and able to compete with the private concerns.  The I.A.O.S. should not take credit for that and should not be blamed for those that have failed.  His final proposal was that the Department should take over the I.A.O.S. and run it, and by inference, I suppose, run all the creameries.  We are not able for that.  We shall have to wait for a republican Government for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr Maguire Mr Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister suggest that the I.A.O.S. in no way interferes with the appointment of managers of creameries?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The I.A.O.S. has no power to insist upon anything. Certain societies have come together and said to the I.A.O.S. that it ought to have some arrangement under which any society that cares to may apply to it as a sort of selection board to select a manager or a dairymaid, for instance, and the I.A.O.S. has agreed that if any society likes <Col N="888" /> to get out of certain trouble with a committeeman's nephew or niece by asking the I.A.O.S. to choose a manager or a dairymaid for them the I.A.O.S. will do it.  Then do not blame the I.A.O.S.; blame the committee that has asked them to do that.  They must take the responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>If a local society appoints a manager, any interference on the part of the I.A.O.S. or the Department of Agriculture with such an appointment would be quite irregular?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just pointed out that if there is any interference by the I.A.O.S. it is at the request of the committee of the society.  They have asked the I.A.O.S. to advise them as to a manager.  Just as the managing director of a firm asks an outside person for his opinion as to such-and-such an applicant whom he intends to employ, in the same way creameries have often asked the I.A.O.S. for its opinion of a candidate or actually to choose between two for them.  That is quite a voluntary thing; they can take the advice of the I.A.O.S. or leave it.  As well as that, an I.A.O.S. organiser may be down the country and may go in to the manager of a creamery and say: &ldquo;You are looking for a dairymaid; such-and-such a person was no good in the last creamery she was in.&rdquo; The Deputy may call that interference, but the I.A.O.S. has no power to insist&mdash;the full responsibility is with the committee.  The committee if they are wise, will listen to any advice they may get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture have this power: that no manager can be appointed unless he has certain technical qualifications.  We do that under the Dairy Produce Act. A creamery can appoint any manager it likes within certain limits&mdash;provided the manager has certain technical qualifications.  Take an exaggerated case of a creamery employing a draper's assistant to run it.  We would not register that creamery; we would say that he has no technical qualifications.  On the <Col N="889" /> other hand, if the creamery produces a certificate from University College, Cork, that the man has the necessary qualifications, it is not for us to inquire whether he is a good or a bad or an indifferent man&mdash;we have to register automatically.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the power which the Minister claims to exercise over the appointment of managers to a certain extent State interference, which he terms as ridiculous if applied to the I.A.O.S.?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The interference that I say is impossible is for either a State Department or a body like the I.A.O.S. to be responsible for the operation of a creamery.  As I pointed out, when a creamery is appointing a manager we can interfere to this extent only, that if they employ, for instance, a draper's assistant without any technical qualifications for the position we will not register the creamery.  If, however, they put up the formal qualification which everybody who has gone through the course has got, then it is not for us to say that the person is a good or a bad or an indifferent manager.  That is the business of the creamery.  We are not in any sense interfering with or taking away from the responsibility of the creamery to do its work properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Haslett's point about some veterinary surgeon at a port stopping a cow because he said she was too near her time when as a matter of fact she had actually calved, I can hardly credit that.  It is essentially a case in which to make direct representation to the Department.  I should like to hear the whole of that story.  I think I have answered Deputy Coburn's point about higher prices for our produce.  With regard to Cooley, we could not let the potatoes out after the planting season, because the refuse could very easily get into manure pits and infect the ground <Col N="890" /> next year.  If the refuse got into the manure pits the infection would remain alive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any danger?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There may not be a terrible lot of danger, perhaps, but black scab is highly infectious.  We are comparatively free from it, and it would be a betrayal of the rest of the farmers if we, with our eyes open, did anything which might be likely to spread infection.  I quite agree that Cooley has been hard hit this year, but we have gone a long way to meet the case.  We have increased their acreage under beet, which will be a permanent relief, and we gave them facilities for procuring manure, and we can only hope that the market will be better next year&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>They have very large stocks on hands at the present moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>They have very large stocks, and they will not part with them.  They are, unfortunately, in the same position in England and Scotland and other countries where they produce crops for sale.  The only countries that have come well out of the depression of the last two years are countries not producing crops but livestock and livestock products.  They have not come well out, but they have come out better than countries producing wheat or oats or other produce raised for sale.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Gorry's point as to the keeping out of foreign oats, it would be quite as logical to keep out foreign wheat; there is as good a case for the one as for the other.  We need not argue it now, however, because the export of German oats, I think, is stopped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know when the Grain Tribunal will report.  Nobody seems to want the report.  As to that particular agitation, I knew all you had to do was to air it and the farmers would shy off.  I say that without prejudice to the report.  I have not the faintest idea what that report is going to be, but no one seems to be pressing for it now, but it will be <Col N="891" /> out long before it is time to plant next year's crop.</P>
    <P>Then there is another matter with regard to plant breeding.  We have given big facilities and big monies to University College in connection with that matter.  We have established a faculty in University College, Dublin.  We have given them all they asked for.  They have a very fine plant breeding collection and they have every facility for developing the matter.  It is the duty of the University rather than the Department as it is essentially research work.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be possible as a practical matter to give extra funds to new cow testing associations at the expense of the old.  The old ones would not stand it.  There would be fierce criticism and they would not agree to it and some of the old cow testing associations would disappear.  If cow testing is a good thing, and undoubtedly it is, surely the State provision under which we pay four shillings for every cow while the farmer is only asked to pay three shillings is really good.  As well as paying four shillings for every three shillings the farmer puts in, we give certain other grants in aid of the association.  It is admitted that that scheme is altogether in the farmer's interest, and puts money into his pocket.  While the State pays considerably more than half the expense which he has to put up for doing something which is bringing money to himself yet they want more. There is not enough money to give more for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The loans that were made to the creameries are maturing and are coming in all right.  Any special knowledge which the agricultural instructors have, and they all have special knowledge, which might be useful in the question of de-rating, will go to the de-rating commission through the representative of the Department of Agriculture who is on the Commission.  Deputies can rest assured that all experience that the outdoor staff have on this question will go in that way to the de-rating Commission.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="892" /> I know it is hardly relevant, but Deputy Sheehy was quite right when he said that the closing down of certain redundant creameries did cause a certain amount of hardship, but what can you do?  You can only settle a question like that by the system of trial and error.  There were too many creameries.  It would have been easy at the beginning to deal with redundant creameries side by side but that would leave half of the problem undealt with.  But we had to go further and re-organise areas.  Certain people who had only a hundred yards to go to a creamery before, have now to go a mile and some people who before the reorganisation had to go two miles to a creamery have now to go only half a mile.  The former class of people are displeased and the latter of course are pleased but taking the farmers as a whole the fair thing has been done with them and undoubtedly they have saved money by the reorganisation.  Easily the most sensible speech with great respect to prominent agriculturists, was made by Deputy Sheehy.  Before his speech everybody suggested numerous things that the Department of Agriculture and State offices might do and the number of ways in which they might interfere. That was the contribution of almost every speaker before Deputy Sheehy. But Deputy Sheehy really showed how excellent farmers actually work. He pointed out that the farmer can do far more for himself than the Department of Agriculture can do for him, and that farmers in West Cork were actually doing so.  That was considered a joke.  In my opinion it was sound horse sense, and in my opinion until that point of view gets down through the farmers of this country there will be no real progress in agriculture.  Fortunately, the farmers of this country are considerably better than one would judge by listening to debates in this Dáil.  Deputy Sheehy spoke for a large number of farmers&mdash;more than 60 per cent. of the farmers&mdash;who, as well as breeding cattle and keeping sows, do mixed farming.  These men <Col N="893" /> are producing cattle, sheep and pigs, and eggs, doing mixed farming and intensive farming, and working hard. There are 60 per cent. of the farmers of the country who do that, and they are the backbone of the country. <Col N="894" /> They are doing more for themselves than we can do for them, and there will be no real progress in agriculture until the rest of the farmers do the same.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The total net amount of the Vote is £59,969, showing a net increase of £3,156, the main increase being in the provision for land acquisition (sub-head C 1) where a sum of £10,000 is proposed as against £7,000 last year.  Sub-head A&mdash;salaries, wages and allowances&mdash;speaks for itself, and so does sub-head B&mdash; travelling expenses.  Sub-head C 1 is a big sub-head&mdash;£10,000.  The provision under this head is made by way of a grant-in-aid in order that unexpended balances may be carried forward. This arrangement has been found to be necessary in view of the difficulty of forecasting the length of time which may be required in any particular case for negotiation and conveyance.  During the year 1929-1930 5,132 acres were acquired by purchase and 992, practically 1,000 acres, were leased, making a total of 44,256 acres acquired for State afforestation up to 31st March last. Negotiations are in progress in regard to approximately 10,000 more acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-head C 2, amounting to £43,000, deals with cultural operations, maintenance, etc.  Foresters' and caretakers' wages amount to £4,000.  This item is necessarily increasing <Col N="896" /> with the addition of fresh centres.  Foresters are grouped into three classes, varying with the experience and seniority of the individual concerned and the importance of the centre under his charge. There are at present employed five Grade I. foresters, 14 Grade II. foresters, and twelve foremen.  Maintenance comes to £9,800.  In this item is included £5,300 for labour which will be required for the cleaning and after-care of areas which have already been planted.  The sum of £4,000 for materials will be expended mainly on fencing&mdash;wire, netting, stakes, etc.&mdash;and tools. Cultural operations&mdash;labour&mdash;come to £24,700.  This item covers the wages of workmen required for nursery work, the preparation of ground for planting, and for the actual planting operations.  There is a miscellaneous item of £1,000, which includes various items, such as manures, cartage and nursery ploughing.  I do not think any other item calls for any remark.  The Appropriations-in-Aid speak for themselves.  The total area of land acquired by the Department for forestry purposes up to end of March last is 44,256 acres.  Of this 31,277 acres were purchased; 9,165 acres leased, and 3,814 acres were transferred from the Department of Defence.  The total area planted or replanted by the Department to date is 23,332 acres, of which 3,041 acres were planted in the past season.  Of the leased lands 2,333 acres have not yet been taken over.  For the purpose of administration the forest lands are divided in 34 forest units, each of which is in charge of a local officer.  The Forestry Act was brought into operation on 1st April last.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister should tell us whether the Department intends to publish any further report.  The last report was published for the year 1928.  It is now June, 1930, and we have not the report for 1929 yet.  I think it should be the aim of a large Department which is due to publish an annual report to have that report out before <Col N="897" /> the Estimates are discussed.  It is really very hard to say anything on most of these Estimates unless there is some statement from the Department concerned as to what progress they have made and what their activities have been during the year.</P>
      <P>I do not think any Deputy can be satisfied that forestry is being carried on as satisfactorily as is desirable.  I think it is a fact that the area under trees in the Saorstát is at present no more than it was when the Saorstát was established in 1922.  That is a very extraordinary state of things, seeing that the Free State's percentage of area under woodlands is nearly the lowest of any country in the world.  The figure of 23,000 acres planted in eight years shows a very low rate of progress, and before this Estimate is passed I suggest that the Minister should give some assurance that the rate of planting will be expedited.</P>
      <P>The present rate of planting, if continued, taking into account the fact that clearing has been very rapid in recent years, would mean that soon there would actually be a decrease in the area under timber. Of course the Forestry Act, if it be administered as intended, will check the clearing of trees, but my information is that up to the present there has not been much severity in the enforcement of the Act, that permits are granted very freely to timber merchants and that it is only a matter of making an application to get a permit.  Every Deputy would like to see greater energy put into the work of increasing plantations, and I hope that the Minister will be able to make some statement that will cause the position to look more satisfactory than it looks at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T. Murphy Mr. T. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, with Deputy Moore, that we need a far more detailed statement in support of this Vote than we have received from the Minister.  So far as many of us are concerned our only knowledge of the operations, or perhaps the existence of the Forestry Department, is obtained each year when we come to consider this Vote.  In justice <Col N="898" /> to the Minister, I should say that it is very unlike his policy generally to permit the extreme slowness and delay that characterise the whole operations of this Department to continue, and I thought this Vote would provide him with an opportunity of making a statement as to what his general policy with regard to afforestation is.  I remember seeing some weeks ago a report of a meeting of a county committee of agriculture at which some scheme was discussed involving an offer to landholders to encourage afforestation.  I am not quite clear as to the details of the scheme, but it appeared to me from reading the report that it would not carry us very far if we were in earnest in regard to reafforestation.</P>
      <P>The constituency I come from is peculiarly suitable for afforestation, but the people there are quite unaware of the existence of the Department except when the annual discussion on this Vote comes up.  I would like the Minister to give us some definite statement as to his intentions. We are very often asked to produce some constructive schemes to help to relieve unemployment.  A general policy of reafforestation would go a long way to relieve unemployment, apart altogether from its value in other directions.  I want to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that in the constituency of West Cork two or three years ago several offers of land were made to the Department and they could have been examined with a view to ascertaining their suitability.  I have heard nothing in connection with the matter since.  In the extreme west end of the constituency a very acute problem exists, of which the Minister is quite well aware, and the newspapers have been discussing that problem and have suggested that afforestation should be undertaken on a fairly extensive scale with a view to dealing with that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this short notice there is not an opportunity of going into this matter as fully as I would like, but I think the Minister ought to inform us as to the exact extent of the operations for reafforestation that are <Col N="899" /> taking place.  I have a general idea that they are confined to one or two counties and that the advantages of the application of a policy of this kind generally have been so far overlooked. I am not impressed by the way in which the Department is managed.  I do not know what the Minister's views are, but I think we should have a much more exhaustive statement in defence of the Vote than the Minister has given us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. G. Wolfe Mr. G. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see several difficulties in the way of getting good land for afforestation, because, as we all know, there is a demand for land on all sides and, naturally, all the good land is required.  If you want to have good timber of any value it must be planted on good land.  There is not much use in planting timber for paying purposes on poor land, unless a few exceptional kinds.  That is my experience.</P>
      <P>I think there are places where replanting might be done, in places where woods have been cut down in derelict demesnes, where the landowners, before selling out, cut down all the trees and practically destroyed not only the demesnes, but the appearance of the country.  I have noticed on motoring through the country that such a thing as that has been done in a good many places.  These are places that I think might be taken in hands.  They might be replanted and have valuable timber grown on them with great advantage to the country. Except for the purpose of giving employment, I do not think it is a good thing to take up poor, boggy land for the purpose of planting. The trees grown on such land will be stunted and most of them will die.  Unless fairly good land can be got, without interfering with the enlargement of holdings or the division of land, I think it is unwise to spend money on planting except so far as it helps to give employment. There are a good many places where planting might be carried out with advantage to the country, with the added advantage of providing some of the unemployed with work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On looking over this Estimate, one finds that more than half the entire provision in it goes to labour.  Sub-heads C 2 and C 3 indicate that a sum of £30,000 is paid in wages to labour out of a total Vote of £59,000.  Therefore, more than fifty per cent. goes directly in wages to labour.  I think the same thing could not be said of any other Estimate that we have to consider. Considering the times that we have in this country and the scarcity of work, there is a big argument for forestry, from the point of view of relieving unemployment, even if we had no other argument.  As the matter does not come within the province of the Minister for Agriculture alone, I think on the question of doing more in that direction, of relieving unemployment, that we should make an appeal to the Executive Council as a whole.  Already to-day I referred to the writings of the late Arthur Griffith in the early Sinn Fein days when speaking about an Irish mercantile marine.  Forestry was, I think, one of the big ideals that Arthur Griffith held out to us years ago when speaking of what a free Ireland could do.  He showed the great faith that he had in the planting of this country, and in order to test the faith of individual Sinn Feiners throughout the country as well as in their enthusiasm. Arbour Day was established&mdash;that was a voluntary planting of trees by the people throughout the country in or about the 1st November each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now it is an extraordinary thing that having got the power to plant trees as much as we like, we have not made the use we should have made of that power.  To the casual observer, at any rate, there does not appear to be nearly as much land under timber, even under young timber, taking the country as a whole, now as there was before the Free State came into being.  It would appear that there has been more land cleared of timber within the last ten years than there has been land planted.  The Minister gave figures about the amount of land acquired <Col N="901" /> during the period since the Free State was established.  He also gave the number of acres planted.  If possible, I would like to get from the Minister figures with regard to the amount of land cleared of timber. Apart from finding out whether there is more land now under timber than there was at the time the Free State was established, I would like if the Minister could give us some figures with regard to the land that was cleared of timber by the Forestry Branch, to know what was their experience with regard to costings and so on and whether or not afforestation can be made an economic proposition for the country.  If the Minister has any figures of that sort, I am sure the House would be glad to know what the experience of the Forestry Branch has been.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>What appears to me to be the greatest drawback in connection with tree-planting, so far as the Forestry Branch is concerned, is that we are going in for doing the thing on too big a scale.  What I mean is that the Forestry Branch want to get areas of large dimensions before they will pass them.  I think if the Department could frame a scheme whereby they would agree in the case of farmers or landowners prepared to give one, two or three acres of suitable land for planting, to plant that land for them, the farmers and landowners agreeing to look after the planting for a certain number of years, it would meet a lot of our present wants.  We have in this country a lot of high hills, and some of them would grow timber very well.  We have some very low-lying ground, but we have not very many acres to give for planting.  I think, until some scheme is devised by which the planting will be done free of charge for the owner, that in this matter of afforestation this country will never reach the point that it ought to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>In my district there has been a lot of forestry work going on during the last seven or eight years. The people there appreciate it very much.  It provides a lot of valuable <Col N="902" /> employment, especially in the winter months when there is no other employment to be had.  Deputy Ryan made a comparison between the amount of timber cut during the last ten years and the quantity of planting carried out in the same period. There was a lot of timber taken out of the country over the last ten years.  I know myself that it was prematurely cut.  It was cut because the opportunity presented itself to do so.  There was as much timber cut in the country during that time as would not have been cut during the next twenty years were it not for the opportunity that presented itself of doing so.  I suggest to the Department that more nurseries should be established so that we would not be under the necessity of importing foreign trees and, incidentally, importing disease with them.  The setting up of more nurseries would provide additional employment to the big amount already given.  In my district there is still a good deal of waste land that could be acquired. There is a lot of land between Fermoy and Castletownroche and Rath-cormac that, if acquired and planted, would provide much-needed employment. We are very grateful for the amount of employment that has been given in the district during the last five or six years.  The timber planted is growing up and the countryside is becoming more beautiful every day. I would like to see more afforestation work carried out.  It is reproductive work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the reasons.  Deputy White knows very well how my heart feels, and I know all about Deputy White.  It would be well if the Minister would, as was pointed out by Deputy Brennan, allow the acquisition of smaller plots of land for the purpose of afforestation. In my district, a man who has 300 or 400 acres of land, and who is in arrears with his rent, is prepared to give half the land over for afforestation, but it appears the Forestry Department will not plant anything <Col N="903" /> under 500 acres or 600 acres.  I hope the Forestry Department will take over the place I have in mind.  I beg to tell the Deputies that I, as one representing a district where there has been an amount of planting for the last five or six years, am very pleased to say that everything is going on well.  The trees are growing well, and the men are delighted with the employment they are getting.</P>

      <P>Seeing that Deputy Daly is so satisfied with the operations of the Forestry Department, I make the request to the Minister that he would do something for the Inishowen area in Donegal.  So far as I am aware no scheme of afforestation has been put into operation in my part of the country.  I would like to impress on the Minister that the Inishowen area is still in Donegal, notwithstanding the views of some of his officials and some of the officials of the Land Commission, who seem to be of the opinion that because the Swilly divides the area from the rest of the country that we are a sort of orphan child or a noman's land.  As the Land Commission Vote has been disposed of I know I cannot discuss the Land Commission now, and I will only say that any of the money spent on the improvement of estates schemes has never reached our area, but I have a strong suspicion of where it has been spent.  I would like to hear if forestry schemes must be initiated by the county councils.</P>

      <P>I do not want to occupy the time of the House further.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy of the Forestry Branch is to plant 200,000 acres at the rate of about 4,000 acres a year.  That policy is being carried out.  Last year, however, only 3,000 <Col N="904" /> acres were planted.  The policy is to have 200,000 acres of timber State controlled and State-owned within 50 years.  So far as timber diminishing is concerned, the Forestry Act is to deal with that.  It came into operation on 1st April.  I was asked was forestry economic.  It is, if you are prepared to wait fifty years, and it is only the State can carry out forestry on a big scale.  I claim that with the finances we have at our disposal we could not go much faster.</P>
      <P>I quite agree that forestry gives a considerable amount of employment. We spend over £50,000 a year on forestry, which is not an inconsiderable item.  On the question of a more ambitious programme and a bigger area of forestry, that is simply a matter of more money, but it must be remembered that land is not available as easily as people think for forestry purposes.  There is an idea that any sort of land will do for forestry.  That is not so. You require fairly good land for forestry, and you cannot plant where the altitude is too great. People talk of hill-tops and mountains, but on most of those you can only grow scrub timber.  The same applies to areas near the sea, such as Connemara.  There are very big tracts in those areas where for one reason or another planting is out of the question.  There is a big area of land in the country which could be replanted.  I do not think there is any need to worry.</P>

We got the Bill this morning, and is it fair, right or proper, even though it is such a short Bill, that we should be expected to discuss it to-day?  I do not think it is.  The Bill admittedly is not a very complex one, but, nevertheless, I feel it should not be expected of the House that a Bill only circulated and received by members this morning should be discussed  <Col N="905" /> on the Second Reading to-day.

      <P>I leave myself entirely in the hands of the House in the matter.  It is expected the Dáil will rise next week.  The Bill simply contemplates an additional amount of money under the Act of 1929. That is all the Bill is intended to do. I do not know whether I said that at any particular point before.  If, however, there is any objection to taking the Bill now I can arrange to take it on a date that will suit Deputies. The only point is that if the Bill is not taken until next week I would have to ask for all stages to be taken next week.  There is not very much to be said on it.  It might be just as well, I suggest, to take the Second Stage now.  It is not a Bill that can be particularly amended on Committee, but if there was any desire to debate the subject at greater length than Deputies are prepared to debate it now it could be debated on the Fifth Stage.</P>

It certainly appears to me to be a rather tall order that we should be asked to debate now a Bill that was only received by post this morning.  For my own part, anything I have to say on it I am quite ready to say without having given the Bill any study.  On the question of housing generally I could say what I want to say to-night just as well as to-morrow.  I think that it is absolutely wrong in principle and is a procedure for <Col N="906" /> which the House should not stand. After all, the question of housing is important, and a Bill dealing with such an important question and which was only circulated to members this morning should not be discussed this evening.  If nobody else but myself objects, perhaps, it could be taken to-morrow, but I would enter a strong protest which, I hope, will be borne in mind when such procedure is again contemplated.</P>

      <P>I would ask the House to accept this amendment as it stands.  I put forward my own views before this House some <Col N="909" /> time ago to the effect that I thought that there was no need, in regard to applications made under the Bill, for any departure from the ordinary principles of our Courts, these ordinary principles being that cases should be heard in public and should, subject to certain limitations under the Censorship of Publications Act, be fully reported by the Press.  The House took a different view, and an amendment was carried which, I think I may say, was not a very satisfactory one.  The Seanad dealt with the matter very fully and they have brought in an amendment which provides for a hearing in camera, but a reasonable hearing in camera &mdash; that is to say, they follow out the provisions of the Children Act and, I must admit, that the provisions of that Act seem to have worked satisfactorily so far as the Act itself is concerned.  Therefore, though I myself would prefer to have these cases heard in public Courts and reported in the ordinary way, I recognise that the feeling of both the Dáil and Seanad is the other way, and it seems to me that if you are going to have any in camera hearing this particular method of hearing, with the safeguard contained in the section &mdash; namely, the safeguard of the presence of the Press &mdash; is the best kind of hearing in camera you can have.  Accordingly, I move: &ldquo;That the Committee agree with the Seanad in the amendment.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In amendment No. 2, in sub-section (6) of the proposed new sub-section to add after the word &ldquo;party&rdquo; in paragraph (a) the words &ldquo;except where the Judge decides to exclude such names.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is of interest to examine the history of the controversy which has arisen over the question concerning a hearing in camera.  It was first suggested by the Poor Law Commission. They recommended that cases of this sort should be taken in camera.  Here is the whole of Paragraph 258 from the Report of that Commission: &mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We recommend that the District <Col N="910" /> Court be given power to make an Affiliation Order on the application of the mother, and that the Board of Health be also given power to apply for an Order, if the mother and child are in receipt of public assistance.  All cases of this character should, we think, if possible, be tried in a Special Court by the District Justice without the presence of the Press or public.  When the mother is young and friendless, the District Justice should have power to arrange for a suitable woman to accompany her to Court and remain with her while she is giving evidence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That recommendation has been carried out almost entirely by the Minister, except the one item about the exclusion of the public and Press. When the Bill was introduced a considerable amount of opinion was expressed in the public Press by institutions and social workers to the effect that cases of this sort should be tried in camera.  The main argument put forward was that in cases of girls who were first offenders &mdash; persons who had such a sense of shame in the matter that they did not like coming into court &mdash; it would be very difficult to get them to come to court at all if their names were to appear in the Press.  On the strength of that argument, this House, which is fairly strongly in favour of trials being held in public courts, decided, despite the eloquence of the Minister, in favour of the amendment, directing that the cases be heard in camera, and it was carried.  The opponents of the amendment, having been driven out of the front door, came in by the back, and this amendment, coming down from the Seanad, really defeats the object of the in camera clause because the names are mentioned.  It is essential that it should be possible, in some way or other, to exclude the names.  I would much prefer to see the amendment withdrawn altogether.</P>
    <P>If we cannot defeat the Seanad amendment then at least we ought to try to make it possible that such cases shall be tried in camera, and for that reason I put down two <Col N="911" /> amendments.  I put them down separately on purpose because each of them involves a different principle. The original sub-section in the Bill reads as follows: &ldquo;All applications to the District Court and all cases under this Act shall be heard in camera, and publication of such cases shall be limited to the statement of the fact that an affiliation order has been granted in a particular court against a person whose name and address shall be included.&rdquo; The amendment is a lengthy one.  I need not go into in detail, but the part of it which I wish to deal with first of all is as follows: &ldquo;On the hearing of any case under this Act in the District Court or on appeal in the Circuit Court, the Judge shall order the exclusion from the court of all persons... except the Press.&rdquo; Then under sub-section (6) it lays down that &ldquo;it shall not be lawful to print or publish anything concerning the case except the following.&rdquo; The first of the exceptions is the names of the parties, the second is the court in which, or the Judge before whom, the proceedings were tried, and the names of the solicitors and counsel professionally engaged, etc.; the third is a concise statement of the charges, the defence and counter-charges; the fourth is particulars of any point of law arising, and the fifth, the decision of the court and the observations of the Judge.</P>
    <P>I think if all these details are published, certainly in the country, it is tantamount to publishing everything about the case.  For that reason I regard the whole amendment as unsatisfactory, but in case we cannot defeat the amendment as a whole, we want to reduce the mischief it may do to a minimum so as to make it possible for these persons to avail of the court in some shape or form. We propose to amend the first of the exceptions, that is to say, that the names of the parties shall be published. The first of my amendments is that the names of the parties shall be published except where the Judge <Col N="912" /> decides to exclude such names.  This gives a power of discretion to the Judge, and it is a type of case which requires a certain amount of discretion. It implies a considerable amount of prudence and ability on the part of the District Justice.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will agree that there has been on the whole no dissatisfaction found with the District Courts in the country and that they are quite competent to deal with cases of this kind and to exercise certain discretion, because it is not merely the question of the application of a rigid law.  I have been told that in a great many cases the litigants as a result of the proceedings get married in cases of this sort where the responsibility is brought home to the parties.  It may not always be a happy marriage, but that is not an argument against attempting to get the parties to repair the damage that has been done and to prevent persons from becoming second and third offenders.  By having full discretion to exclude the names, the Judge has a better opportunity of getting questions like this settled in the best possible way.  Then the persons who are not hardened sinners are more likely to come into Court. If you insist on keeping the names in, you will be legislating for the hardened types of people who are indifferent as to whether the names are published or not and who may very likely make use of the Bill for blackmailing purposes, because, of course, the greater the publicity the greater the possibility and the value of blackmail.  Then, again, this principle of affiliation orders is new to the law.  It is not exactly a criminal proceeding.  Formerly the only action that could be taken was either criminal proceedings or the action was such as to be much closer to criminal proceedings than this.  This is somewhat in the nature of civil proceedings.  It amounts to an action for damages.  There will be &mdash; or at least I hope there will &mdash; a different atmosphere in dealing with these cases than in dealing with the ordinary trial for seduction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="913" /> Of the two amendments which I propose, the first involves the principle of giving the judge an opportunity to decide.  It may be found in the course of applying the new principle contained in the Act that it is a far better thing to have the case tried in camera or from experience the judge may find that it is a good thing in first offences to have them tried in camera or that afterwards it may be a severe punishment to have publicity.  For that reason, I think the Minister would be well advised to accept this principle in order that the judge may have the amplest opportunity to find out from experience the best way to handle cases of this kind.  On the bigger issue, the principle upon which the Minister has been standing pat all through the controversy &mdash; namely the publicity of the court &mdash; we are in agreement in general, but we are in disagreement with it in particular.  For instance, the Minister was entirely against upholding that principle on the Juries Act because he held that, under certain temporary circumstances, if you like&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Minister himself must admit that there were severe restrictions on publicity as to the names of jurymen, and so on, and that members of the Press would not be allowed to be present nor the members of the public generally.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that the Minister has made a breach himself in the principles of complete publicity of proceedings in court, for reasons best known to himself. On that Bill we fought tooth and nail, and not only was our opposition strong, but the opposition of other parties in the House was so strong that the Minister was obliged to limit the period of the Bill.  On <Col N="914" /> that matter the Minister was on one side and we on the other.  Now we have changed about, and we do think there is a limitation to the principle of publicity.  It is not a question of principle itself.  Every great principle, no matter how valuable and sound it is, has its limitations and history is strewn with the wreekage of the extravagant application of good principles.  This is simply a particular instance of where you have that.  I think I need hardly mention an instance of it, but I think we might take the purity of the Puritan iconoclasts.  That is a good illustration of a good principle wrongly applied and causing damage.  The Minister has taken up an attitude which is as dry as dust on a question that requires real human treatment.  We have the evidence of social workers and authorities who understand this matter, and, after all, the Minister should bow to the superior authority of persons who know the problem at first hand.  A lawyer is not an authority upon all the human subjects that come up.  In other cases I think the Minister would lean towards allowing a certain amount of secrecy in the case, for instance, of the Moneylenders Bill, because he would consider it a matter of public policy to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indications that the Minister would think it a wise thing to do.  Even good principles may be carried too far.  This is the case where one should press very strongly.  I hope the Minister will see the wisdom of giving the judge the fullest discretion of deciding whether a case should be heard in camera or not.  In a very short time the judges will be able to say whether one particular line is a wise and discreet line or not, and they can change later; if it is found that the law is not satisfactory it will be very easy to change it.  I think it would be absolutely essential to change it. In another case that we pressed here the Minister would not give way, <Col N="915" /> for instance, in the publication in the general Press of the names of books censored.  He already admitted that he has no power to prevent that and that it is doing a great deal of damage.  He is putting us in the painful position of being able to say &ldquo;We told you so.&rdquo;  In this case I hope the Minister will take a little advice from those best qualified to speak on this matter.</P>

      <P>I go a little bit further than Deputy Little.

I do not approve of giving discretion to the judge, and I sincerely hope the House will reject the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I take up a slightly different position again because I prefer to accept the amendment put forward by the Seanad with one exception, and that exception is the section to which Deputy Little refers.  I think the whole seriousness to our view of the Seanad amendment lies in the publication of the names of the parties. I take the same view that I took when this Bill went through the Dáil before, namely that in the important cases to which we want this Act to apply no proceedings will be taken by the girl in question, or even by her parents, if the name is to appear.  I do not see the advantage of publishing the names of the parties at all.  I am afraid if you accept the amendment suggested by Deputy Little the same disadvantage will lie.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are very many cases, I am sorry to say, where very respectable girls fall the victims, possibly through impulse, and afterwards they are so repentant for it and so much ashamed of themselves that if their names are to appear as a result of the proceedings in court, they will refuse to take proceedings.  I fear if the names are to be published it will make the utility of this Bill very little in its application.  That <Col N="916" /> is what Deputy Little says.  It seems to me the right thing is to adopt the Seanad's amendment, leaving out paragraph (a) in sub-section 6.  If that were done I would be quite prepared to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to discuss the Juries Bill, I do not propose to discuss the Moneylenders Bill, and I do not propose to discuss whether an iconoclast is a Puritan or not.  I would just like to get down to the Illegitimate Children Bill, and I would like to point out to Deputy Murphy that if this amendment of the Seanad is rejected the amendment passed by the Dáil will stand, and that amendment, I recollect, is such an undesirable embodiment of the principle of partial hearing in camera that Professor Thrift, who believes in hearing in camera, voted against it.  It is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All applications to the District Court in all cases under this Act shall be heard in camera and publication of such cases shall be limited to the statement of the fact that an affiliation order has been granted in a particular court against a person whose name and address shall be included.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that section will get one single person to stand up for it. If you have publication you shall have the name of the defendant and his address and you will have nothing else.  You have got, in fact, now to choose between two amendments &mdash; between the section as it stands &mdash; the amendment passed by the Dáil and the Seanad section.  Delete the Seanad's amendment and you fall back on that; you fall back on an impossible state of affairs.  Let me come to the second amendment. The main objection that was put up here in public against hearing in camera was this: that a girl should not be brought into the witness-box and made to tell her story before a crowd of loafers, before anybody who happened to come into the court out of curiosity.  That was the main argument.  That was the whole <Col N="917" /> weight of the main argument.  By the Seanad's amendment the ordinary loafer &mdash; any person in court who has no business there &mdash; is excluded from the court during the hearing of the case.  Therefore, any shyness that the girl might have, arising from the fact that she was telling her story before a crowded court, is gone.  On the other hand, the newspapers can, under this amendment, be present and they can report the names of the parties and certain minor details about the case.</P>
    <P>I might point out to Deputy Thrift that no paper would report a case in which it could not give the name of the parties.  It would be like this: that A to-day in court sued B and that she got a decree for 5s. a week against B.  A report of that kind would never be published.  That would be doing away with any reason for publication.  After all, there is no very great interest in this class of case that A got a decree against B for, say, ten shillings a week on an affiliation order.  That would not be of any interest at all. I do not believe that such reports would appear.  Deputy Thrift has not an amendment to this effect and there is no amendment to the effect that the names of the parties should be left out.  There is no such amendment before the House at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister suggest that my amendment does not exclude the names of the parties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not dealt yet with the Deputy's amendment.  There is no amendment to the effect that Section 4 should be deleted; there is an amendment in connection with sub-section 6 (a).  The object of publicity is that a person who has been wrongly charged should have it made perfectly clear that he is vindicated, and a person who has brought a wrong charge, a charge which has been dismissed by the court, should also have her name thoroughly known.  Deputy Little goes on to say that it would keep girls out of court, and that there is <Col N="918" /> authority from social workers that it would do so.  I will point out to Deputy Little that the social worker is not the best person to give you advice in a matter like this.  A social worker is a person who looks on the whole question from one angle and one angle only.  A social worker simply sees that one particular girl has been betrayed, and looks at the case precisely from her point of view, not considering all the other cases in which there are women who deliberately fling themselves in the way of temptation, or rather who are themselves the temptresses.  I do not believe that any single girl will be deterred from taking proceedings by the fact that her name would be published.</P>
      <P>Deputy Little suggests that on the first occasion her name should not be published; that the judge should have discretion that her name should not be published the first time.  But the time when she appears in court need not of necessity be the first time that she has had an illegitimate child.  She may have had two or three, and have made settlements out of court, and then she might have brought one case into court.  It is highly advisable in such circumstances that her name should be known.  If nice girls who have been betrayed were deterred from bringing their cases into court because of being examined in public, then surely some evidence might have been collected from a country where a similar Act has been in force for many years in order to show that it has had that effect.  It has never been suggested in England, and surely there must be girls there in exactly the same position as any Irish girl.  It has never been suggested there that there has been any weakening through cases not being heard in camera.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy has nothing more to go on except the suggestions of certain charitable workers and the report of the Poor Law Commission. The report of that Commission is, of course, a document of very considerable weight.  It is not a document which should be lightly brushed <Col N="919" /> aside.  But that is not one of the main matters which the persons who constituted the Commission which made that report, considered.  I do not believe they called any witnesses with knowledge of legal procedure and of what has actually happened in courts in such cases.  The persons who really have experience in this matter are the persons who are acquainted with legal proceedings in these cases.  We must bear in mind that in most cases in which an affiliation order could be made an action for seduction would lie.  I have never heard it suggested and, though I have asked again and again, nobody has ever been able to give me one concrete example, of a girl who could have brought an action for seduction and who refused to bring it because of the fear of publicity. Under this Act she would have a great deal more privacy than she would have if she or her parents were bringing an action for seduction because in this instance she would have none of the ordinary public present at the hearing.</P>
    <P>I do not see that there is any necessity to give discretion to the judge.  Even if there were, I do not see how the judge could carry out an amendment in these terms &mdash;&ldquo;except where the judge decides to exclude such names.&rdquo;  How is the judge to make his decision known? The Deputy does not give us any indication. I suppose the Deputy means that the judge shall by order direct that there shall be no publication of the names of the parties; but &ldquo;where the judge decides to exclude such names&rdquo; appears to me to be rather a meaningless collocation of words.  It is not the judge but the Press that excludes names. What the Deputy means is that the judge shall order that the Press shall exclude the names.  I suppose that is what he means.</P>

He would know whether it was the first time a person came to court; he would know from the evidence whether it was a case of a first offence; he would utilise his experience in forming an opinion of the persons coming to the court and he would be able to decide whether or not the names should be published. It is the practice to substitute A and B or any other letters in place of the names of persons.  That has been done in famous cases elsewhere.  And there is no reason why letters should not be substituted.  This amendment provides for the setting out of the charges, the main facts, the decision <Col N="921" /> and any question of law that arises, so that all these matters will be on the records and will be in the public Press.  The only thing is that the names will be excluded.  Except for the curiosity mongers, everything is achieved that can be achieved.  It would be hard to know how the ends of justice are not achieved if curious people are disappointed.  The Minister suggests that inquiries should be made as to how the Act has been working in England.  Really, I think with the machinery the Minister has at his disposal, it was for him to find out through the ordinary official channels how the Act had been working in England.  It would be very difficult for an ordinary individual to find that out.</P>

      <P>The Minister might have instituted some inquiries.  He has the machinery for doing that and nobody else has.  I saw some complaints about the working of another Act &mdash; not this measure.  It was by the merest accident I came across it. It is not easy for people to find out these things in an authentic way. Private individuals are not entitled to write to courts about such matters. They have not the authority the Minister has to find out.  Social workers have been at this for a number of years.  It is not individual cases.  What they have before them is the larger problem.  They endeavour to meet the whole situation and find out the best method of giving back to people their self-respect.  All these essentials are present to the mind of the social worker.  On the other hand, the lawyer's attitude is <Col N="922" /> very restricted.  He is applying the letter of the law and the letter killeth the spirit.  The lawyer has to apply the law too strictly; he is very limited in his outlook.  The social worker is the person who should be referred to, and in forming a judgment we should allow them to influence us.  It is easy enough to arrange the matter so far as we are concerned if the Minister is agreed on the principle, but, apparently, he is not agreed on the principle, and so I suggest that the House should vote in favour of this amendment to the amendment of the Seanad &mdash; if, indeed, the best way would not be to vote down the whole Seanad amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not at all agree with the Minister when he says a newspaper would not print these reports if the names were not available.  With the great majority of latter-day newspapers, the names are of no consequence.  It is the facts that afford the spice, and when the Minister said that they would print nothing about the case, I think he drew a wrong conclusion.  Even if a point of law should arise it makes it important that the newspapers should print something about it, and, therefore, I say we should accept the main purpose of the Seanad amendment, but I say it is a mistake to regard the insertion of the names as vital to the publicity of the case.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 2:</P>
      <P>In amendment No. 2, in sub-section (6) of the proposed new sub-sections to add after the word &ldquo;parties&rdquo; in paragraph (a) the words &ldquo;and except where the parties consent to have their names excluded.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment applies to the same sub-section.  I do not know whether it is necessary to argue this case, or whether the Minister is willing to accept the principle involved and allow, where the parties wish their names to be excluded, that they should be excluded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">

      <P>I think this amendment is wrong in principle and would be utterly unworkable in practice.  It is obvious that the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; in the proposed amendment should be struck out and that the words the Deputy proposes to add are &ldquo;except where the parties consent to have their names excluded.&rdquo;  To whom are they to signify their consent?</P>

      <P>The Press is going to publish their names unless they consent not to have their names published.  Suppose no question is asked; there is nobody to <Col N="925" /> propose that they give their consent. The amendment seems to me to be completely unworkable.  Let us take another point.  How are they to carry this out?  Let us assume that they have been asked to consent. What is the machinery by which they are to carry it out?  Is the consent to be in writing?  Is it to be lodged in Court and made a Rule of Court?  How is all that to be done?  There is no suggestion how it could possibly be carried out by this amendment.  I suggest it is completely unworkable.  But let us get away from the amendment and try to get at what is in the Deputy's mind.  I think it is entirely undesirable. It might be very much to the advantage of the man in some cases to have the names published.  If there is no decree made against him and that the verdict is in his favour it might be greatly to his advantage to have the name published.  In a great many other cases it would not be of the slightest disadvantage to the man to have his name published, but it might be of very great importance to the community to have the names of the parties published. I have already explained on the last amendment how it will stop blackmail and let undesirable persons, both of the male and female sex, be known to the public.  A man may be the father of many illegitimate children.  He would be a man for girls to avoid.  A girl may be the mother of illegitimate children, and she would be a person to be avoided also.  So that it is in the interests of the public that the names of the parties should be published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister asks how is a consent to be arrived at.  I do not know if the Minister has forgotten about the way in which consents are arrived at in courts, but the consent could be made an order by the court.  It is a very simple thing.  It could be made clear to the judge by the lawyers on each side that a consent has been arrived at between the two parties that the names should not be mentioned in the public Press.  In any case it is <Col N="926" /> a matter of such minor detail that if we got agreement in principle on it there would be no difficulty whatever in getting words to please the meticulous taste of the Minister. There would be no trouble about that part.  But as it is the amendment is perfectly clear.  A consent implies that the two parties to the action must consent to having the names excluded.  This question of publicity seems to have obsessed the Minister.  He would never suggest for a moment that in a case which in some ways has a similar type of feeling attached to it, namely, the case of a person of unsound mind, the whole matter is kept out of the public Press.  That is a case where regard is had for the dignity of human nature and the feelings of the parties concerned.  Cases of that kind are kept from being published. I suggest that in these cases, at least where both the parties desire that the names should not be published, it is proper that the court should have power to prevent the names being published.  I am very sorry that the Minister should have made this a Party matter, because it has vitiated a fair consideration and decision by the House.  There are Deputies who are loyal members of their Party, and on account of the Party discipline they have had to sacrifice their individual judgment in this matter, simply owing to the whim of the Minister, who has put on the Party Whips.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of whether any Party votes on one side or the other; the question is whether it is a matter of confidence from the point of view of the Government. It is a very natural thing that any Party, or any mixed group of members from various parties, should form a committee, discuss the thing among themselves, and come to a common decision.  It happens that various Parties do have their own committees, and having formed a particular view, vote together on a <Col N="927" /> matter, because they think it is the proper way to vote.  But that does not involve a question of confidence. This is not a Party matter in the ordinary sense of a main political issue, and I think it is most unfair to put on the Party Whips.  Not only were our Party Whips not on, but if any members of the Fianna Fáil Party were strongly against our view on this question they would not have been obliged to vote with us, because you cannot have dogs tied and stones loose; what is good for one side must be good for the other.  A Party's committee may make a decision and the members of the Party may be convinced by that.</P>

      <P>Apparently the Minister made a decision, and members of his Party were not entirely convinced by his decision, but it was not a main political issue and it should not be made a question of confidence. I hope that the Minister will not continue to vitiate legislation on matters like this where people hold different views by introducing a political atmosphere which is entirely alien to the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question: &ldquo;That the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 2,&rdquo; I suggest that we should reject this amendment altogether.  It would mean a complete defeat of the Bill, and the time we spent on it would have been wasted.  The Bill will be useless, because the only people who will come into Court under it are those who have lost all sense of shame.  We are now legislating, not for the people whose self-respect can be restored &mdash; the first offenders &mdash; but for the blackmailers and the people who will use the courts for their own purpose.  This is a compromise which is not a compromise, because <Col N="928" /> it sacrifices the only principle we care about &mdash; the keeping out of the names.  I suggest that the Minister should not put on the Party Whips on this occasion.  This has nothing to do with party politics, and we should have an open vote on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been very fully discussed and the Seanad has come to a reasonable compromise on it.  The Seanad put in an amendment which goes very much further than I think it ought to go.  But I have given way on this Bill to a very great extent; I have accepted a principle which I am inclined to think is going too far. I have recognised, however, that there are two schools of thought.  One school thinks that there should be the utmost publicity for all litigation of this kind, and that is the school to which I belong, but the other school thinks that there should be no publicity at all.  A via media has been found between those two schools of thought, and I suggest that the House should follow that middle path.  Middle paths may satisfy nobody, but they are very often the embodiment of common sense.</P>

If an unfortunate girl's name is published, or if she thinks her name is going to be published, she would be deprived of some little commercial solace that she might have got otherwise.  It is not a question of Fianna Fáil or of Cumann na nGaedheal; it is a question of what people think is best for the protection or the help of the girl who goes wrong, and I would appeal to the Minister to take off the Whips for this vote.</P>
