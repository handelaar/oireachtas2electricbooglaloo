      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment 3.&mdash;New section. Before Section 10 a new section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  Where an application is <Col N="975" /> made, before or within twelve months after the commencement of this Act, for the registration of any premises in a register of slaughtering premises and the Minister is not satisfied that such premises comply with the general conditions of cleanliness and suitability of slaughtering premises or the appropriate particular conditions of suitability of slaughtering premises the Minister may, if he so thinks fit, provisionally register such premises in such register for such period not exceeding twelve months as he shall think proper and shall specify at the time of such registration.</P>
    <P>(2)  Premises provisionally registered under this section in a register of slaughtering premises shall, while they continue to be so registered, be deemed for all the purposes of this Act to be registered in such register in accordance with this Act and this Act shall apply to and have effect in relation to such premises accordingly.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where any premises are provisionally registered under this section in a register of slaughtering premises and the Minister, before the expiration of the period for which such premises so registered, is satisfied that such premises have been brought into compliance with the general conditions of cleanliness and suitability of slaughtering premises and the appropriate particular conditions of suitability of slaughtering premises, he may, before the expiration of the said period, confirm such provisional registration, and thereupon such premises shall become and be registered in such register as fully in all respects as if they had, on the date of such provisional registration, been registered in such register under this Part of this Act other than this section.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where any premises are provisionally registered under this section in a register of slaughtering premises and such provisional <Col N="976" /> registration is not confirmed under this section before the expiration of the period for which such premises were so registered, such premises shall, at the expiration of the said period, cease to be registered in, and shall be removed from such register and shall not again be provisionally registered under this section in such register.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Dáil agree with the Seanad in this amendment. In the first year that the Act is in operation it is possible that it may be necessary provisionally to register premises.  This amendment provides that, if the premises afterwards attain to the standard required, the registration shall be permanent.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment 4.&mdash;New section. Before Section 16 a new section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;16.&mdash;(1)  When owing to special circumstances existing at the time the Minister considers it desirable so to do, he may grant to any person, to whom he could under this Part of this Act grant an exporter's licence to export fresh meat and offals of a particular kind, a permit (in this section referred to as an exporter's permit) to export fresh meat and offals of that kind during such period not exceeding one month as the Minister shall think proper and shall specify in such permit.</P>
      <P>(2)  Every exporter's permit to export fresh meat and offals of a particular kind shall during the period for which it is granted be deemed for all the purposes of this Act save as otherwise expressly provided to be an exporter's licence to export fresh meat and offals of that kind and this Act shall apply to and have effect in relation to such exporter's permit accordingly.</P>
      <P>(3)  Section 12 (which relates to fees on exporter's licences) of this Act shall not apply in relation to an exporter's permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="977" /> (4)  There shall be paid in respect of every exporter's permit by the holder thereof at the expiration of such permit a fee (in this section referred to as the permit fee) computed by multiplying the appropriate sum as defined by rule 2 of the Schedule to this Act by the number of animals presented under such permit to a veterinary examiner for examination during the period for which such permit was granted, and for the purposes of such computation sub-rule (3) of rule 4 of the Schedule to this Act shall apply in like manner as it applies for the purposes of that rule.</P>
    <P>(5)  As soon as may be after the expiration of an exporter's permit the Minister shall ascertain and certify the amount of the permit fee payable in respect of such permit and shall issue a certificate (in this section referred to as a certificate of indebtedness) in the prescribed form certifying the person by whom such fee is payable and the amount of such fee.</P>
    <P>(6)  Every certificate of indebtedness shall be conclusive evidence of all matters purported to be certified therein and any document purporting to be a certificate of indebtedness issued under this section shall, on production thereof in any proceedings to recover the amount thereby certified to be payable, be deemed until the contrary is proved to be a certificate of indebtedness duly issued under this section and shall be admitted in evidence accordingly.</P>
    <P>(7)  As soon as may be after the issue of a certificate of indebtedness a copy thereof shall be served by post on the person thereby certified as liable to pay the fee the subject thereof and immediately upon such service the amount certified by such certificate as payable by such person shall become and be payable by such person to the Minister and shall, after the expiration of four weeks from such service, be recoverable by the Minister as a civil <Col N="978" /> debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Dáil agree with the Seanad in this amendment. This is a rather important amendment.  It provides for a contingency such as would be caused by an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease when British and other buyers had purchased a considerable amount of stock for export.  In the case of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in England, the ports are closed against the export of livestock. In such a contingency this amendment provides that the stock may be slaughtered here in the Dublin Corporation abattoir or in the Cork abattoir by special permit. The only fees payable shall be the per capita fees.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment 5.&mdash;Section 17, sub-section (3).  Before the word &ldquo;pork&rdquo; in lines 61 and 64 the word &ldquo;beef&rdquo; inserted in each case.</P>

      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment 6.&mdash;Section 24.  A new sub-section inserted at the end of the section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Regulations made under this section in regard to the manner of slaughtering animals shall provide that all cattle shall, before being slaughtered, be effectually stunned by means of an efficient mechanically-operated instrument of a type approved by the Minister and operated by a male person of not less than eighteen years who is certified by the Minister to be competent to operate such instrument.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Dáil agree with the Seanad in this amendment. It provides for the use of the humane killer for the slaughter of cattle only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know a little more about this amendment and why it should be inserted in the Bill <Col N="979" /> If the humane killer is only to be used for the slaughter of cattle intended for export, what it means is this, that it will only apply to the slaughter of something like 11,000 cattle, while the number of cattle, sheep and pigs killed last year in this country was something like 2,000,000.  It is a decreasing number. Why we should be so humane about the slaughter of 11,000 cattle out of a total of 2,000,000 animals I cannot see.  In my opinion the use of the humane killer is going to put another disadvantage or impediment in the way of people exporting cattle. They will be put to a considerable amount of trouble.  First of all, they must get the Minister to approve of the man who is going to kill the few cattle that are to be exported. But in the case of people killing cattle for home consumption, they can get a boy under 18 or, for that matter, a woman if they like, to do the killing.  There is nothing to prevent them doing that, but in the case of cattle intended for export the person who kills them must be a male and he must be over eighteen years of age.  I cannot see why such a distinction should be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think if the people who are out to prevent cruelty to animals were to look into this matter they would find that if there is any cruelty at all in it, that there is more cruelty in the slaughter of pigs than in the slaughter of cattle.  But this amendment does not apply to sheep or pigs. It only applies to cattle that are to be exported.  The logical attitude for people who are out against cruelty to animals is to take steps to prevent the slaughter of beasts altogether.  I could understand a vegetarian being out against cruelty to animals, but people who are prepared to eat the meat of animals should not be taking up the attitude they are in this.  The logical course for them to pursue is to give up eating meat and so try and prevent the slaughter of cattle. As I have said, this is only going to apply to 11,000 cattle out of a total of 2,000,000 animals slaughtered annually.  I would like to know why <Col N="980" /> the Minister, who has the reputation of being a rather practical man and out against that sort of hypocrisy, should accept an amendment like that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather that the Deputy is against the humane killer for any purpose, and that he makes the point, whether you are for it or against it, why apply it only to such a small proportion of live stock? The answer to the latter part of the question is simple.  This Bill deals only with export meat, and any amendment inserted in this Bill could apply only to meat for export. With regard to the humane killer, the decision on that was left to the Seanad and the amendment with regard to the use of the humane killer was carried.  On the whole, I think there is something to be said for using the humane killer for cattle but nothing to be said for its use in the case of pigs.  I do not know is there any such thing as a humane killer for pigs.  It is agreed that the present method of killing pigs is as humane and effective as any method suggested.  I do not want to go into the merits of the humane killer now.  No amendment to this Bill could affect animals slaughtered for use here, but when there is a Bill to regulate the dressing, packing and grading of meat for consumption in this country we can argue the question in connection with that Bill.  The question of the use of the humane killer was argued at great length in the Seanad by members of all Parties, and I think there was cross-voting.  The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals had, I think, their views clearly expressed. The Seanad adopted the amendment, and I recommend the Dáil to accept it.  The humane killer would cost about £5.  I should say that firms who export meat are far better able to afford that sum of money than the average butcher down the country who is merely killing meat in his own stalls for local consumption.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the main object of the humane killer is <Col N="981" /> to prevent suffering to animals, especially pain of mind.  I believe it would be a good thing to have cattle slaughtered under circumstances different to those under which they are slaughtered at present. Cattle have a sense of smell, and it is the smell surrounding the slaughterhouses that terrifies them, and that terror exists while they are within the surroundings of the slaughterhouse.  If the Bill provided for the use of the humane killer a distance away, where there would not be the smell of blood, it would be very desirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir James Craig</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had considerable correspondence from people in regard to this matter.  I think the Minister has taken a very fair attitude, and I have taken the same attitude.  To the humane killer, if used in the case of large bodies of cattle, I see no objection.  I take exception to the fact that it should be applied in isolated cases throughout the country, and particularly in the case of pigs.  I do not see how the humane killer could be used in regard to the slaughtering of pigs, particularly in a case where a man is killing his own pigs.  So long as the amendment is confined to the slaughtering of cattle for export I think we are not doing an unwise thing, and we are satisfying those people who are making a fuss about it.  I have seen both the pole-axe and the humane killer used in slaughtering.  So far as the pole-axe is concerned I see no great evil in it. I am certain this method could not be used in regard to the slaughter of pigs, and it should not be imposed on people who kill their own meat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister says, this Bill applies only to animals slaughtered for the export trade, but I would be glad if the Minister would introduce a Bill dealing with the slaughtering of animals generally, packing and so on, throughout the country for consumption here.  I am strongly in favour of the humane killer in the interests of humanity as well as in the interests of the animals. It is quite true that the pole-axe may be a humane instrument in the hands <Col N="982" /> of skilled operators, but sometimes operators are not skilled and occasionally the operators are not sober and unnecessary suffering is inflicted on the animals.  Deputy Ryan said that the logical thing for those opposed to the slaughter of animals is to become vegetarians.  Well, States execute men for murder and they try to do it as humanely as possible, but that is a point as to the morality of which I personally have grave doubts.  The cost of the humane killer is not very much.  I agree with Deputy Sir James Craig that it would be ridiculous to enforce the use of the humane killer in the case of a farmer who kills a pig for his own use.  The humane killer is compulsory in many places.  It is so in Belfast, Bangor, Cookstown and elsewhere.  In Scotland, where they are not foolish financially, they have made its use compulsory.  I think we ought to get into line with those who have made the use of the humane killer compulsory.  I could give you the names of half a dozen butchers in Dublin who use the humane killer. I should like to have the use of it compulsory in the abattoir in Dublin so as to give a good example to the country, in the killing of cattle at any rate.</P>
      <P>There is unnecessary pain inflicted by the unskilled use of the pole-axe, and the conditions obtaining in many of the slaughter-houses are very bad. The Minister is aware that many public boards have passed resolutions demanding the compulsory use of this humane killer.  It is a matter that should be considered by the Department of Agriculture.  Will the Minister tell us if his Department intends to have the matter investigated with a view to future legislation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the Seanad amendment will be agreed to. I agree with a lot of what Deputy Fahy has said on this subject.  I have long thought that some improvement was necessary in the slaughtering of animals in this country. It stands to reason that the pole-axe in the hands of an inexperienced person is a dreadful <Col N="983" /> instrument of death and can be mismanaged in an appalling fashion.  It is not necessary for me to go into details, but I have heard of dreadful cases that have occurred in the killing of animals that were truly shocking in their results.  I am very glad that the humane killer is going to be tried.  I am sure the results will be good, and when people see how good the results are I believe the humane killer will be universally used.  We are all agreed that animals should be destroyed in the most humane fashion possible.  I am sure the general opinion will be, when this instrument has been tried for a little while, that it is the proper method of slaughtering animals for consumption as human food.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know what provision the Minister will make for the training of the operators of the humane killer.  Will any provision be made by the Department? A humane killer in the hands of an unskilled person is extremely dangerous, not alone to the operator himself but to his assistants.  It has happened that two or three assistants have been killed by an unskilled operator.  If this Act is to be put into operation in October, and if the humane killer is made compulsory and men do not know how to operate it properly, what will be the consequences?</P>

      <P>I have not a copy of the Bill at the moment, but I was about to suggest to the House that pigs should not be caught with birdlime and that this question of a humane killer should really be dealt with by the College of Surgeons.  I think what is really required is that we should send down a qualified anæsthetist who would see that the animals were properly sent to sleep before any kind of killer would be used on them.  Such a course as that would get over the possibility of a drunken operator, as was suggested by Deputy Fahy.  I do not know whether a humane killer would be any more humane in the hands of a drunken operator than a pole-axe. <Col N="984" /> I really think that there has been too much nonsense talked about this humane killer and I think the Bill was all right without it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I wish to make is that the real torture occurs if waiting cattle are left too near the place of slaughter.  The usual practice is to leave cattle in the pen adjacent to the slaughter-house before they are taken out to be killed and the suffering on the part of the animals is most acute at that particular stage.  It is through the sense of smell that the animals suffer.  Perhaps the most humane course would be if the animals were stunned some distance from the slaughter-house, conveyed in a stunned condition to the place of slaughter and then killed.  If they were penned a good distance away from the slaughter-house so that they could not get the smell of other animals being killed it would obviate a tremendous lot of suffering.  Unless some such course as that is adopted, there is no point in having a humane killer for slaughter any more than a pole-axe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the two assistants being killed, I read that statement as it was made by two responsible Senators.  It was stated as an established fact that some person using a humane killer killed the two assistants holding down the beast. That was a humane way to kill a beast! The two assistants held the <Col N="985" /> animal down and the operator, drunk or sober, killed the two of them but did not injure the beast.  I do not think that that could happen with a pole-axe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That did happen with a particular form of humane killer similar to a revolver.  One would think on account of there being so many people in this country expert in the use of a revolver that such an occurrence would be most unlikely to arise.  That is not the type of humane killer that we would now be inclined to insist on.  The particular type we have in mind is the one with a captive bolt.  With regard to Deputy Fahy's point, I do not think we could insist on forcing a humane killer on every butcher in the country.  It would be impossible to control that and see that every instrument was properly oiled and properly used.  Everybody in the Dáil, with the exception of Wexford Deputies, seems to be in favour of this particular method and, therefore, I suggest that we adopt it.</P>

      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill.  I explained on a previous occasion that the Tribunal had not been able to deal with the cases that had come before it.  The Act provided that Civil Servants who gave notice to retire should retire on a date to be fixed by the Board within certain limits.  Then it provided that for practically all the cases the period should not be later than four months after the passing of the Act.  The Act was passed on the 17th December and that would <Col N="986" /> mean that the Board would have to determine the cases in which the date of retirement would be not later than 17th April.  There are a number of cases which it has not been possible to hear and it is necessary that the time should be extened in order that these cases should be dealt with by the Tribunal in the ordinary way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the Second Reading of the Censorship of Films (Amendment) Bill, 1930. The object of this Bill is to give powers to the Censor and the present Board of Censors of films to censor talkie films in the same fashion as ordinary films are censored. I think it is known to everybody in this House that this new type of film has become very common within the last couple of years. It has largely superseded the older type of film.  As things stand at present the Censor and, an appeal from the Censor, the Board, have no real opportunity of censoring sound. A picture may appear perfectly all right as far as merely looking at it is concerned, but when it becomes associated with dialogue it may become very objectionable and in fact, it does become objectionable.  This Bill enables the Censor and, on appeal from the Censor, enables the Censorship of Films Board, to decide as to whether the two things taken conjointly&mdash;that is, the picture and <Col N="987" /> the sound&mdash;should or should not be exhibited.  That is what the Bill enables the Censors to do.  I would suggest to the House that this Bill is very necessary and I venture to think that the House will not have any objection to giving these extended powers.</P>

      <P>I do not suppose that anybody would object to giving those extended powers in the matter of films.  Within the last twenty years or so films have become of great importance educationally. There is another matter that might receive the attention of the Censors, and that is the general tone or the moral of the film.  There have been some films recently exhibited, and though I have not seen them, for my visits to cinemas number about one per annum, I am told by friends that the general tone of the pictures was demoralising; that the tone was really supporting certain types of immorality but that at the same time there might not be a single scene or sentence to which you could take exception.  Not only should the pictures and the sound be censored, but the general tone should be taken into consideration. That applies particularly in the case of pictures to which children are admitted, and children are admitted to all these pictures.  These pictures appeal not only to the ears of the children and to their sight but to all their senses and some pictures have a very bad effect on children. The influence of some of these pictures might upset the whole teaching received in the schools, nationally and morally.  This is a matter that the Censors should be instructed to consider very carefully &mdash;that is, the general tone of the picture.  It might happen that there might not be any one scene or sentence in the picture to which objection could be taken, but nevertheless its general tone would have a demoralising influence.</P>

      <P>I have been on the Censorship of Films Board for some time and I can assure the Deputy who has spoken that when a <Col N="988" /> film comes up before them for final decision the Board certainly always takes into consideration the general tone of the picture.  That is always so.  We have films to which the Deputy has alluded, sound films.  It is a fact that recently some sound films got out that I must admit would not get out if the Censor had been able to examine the dialogue and had powers to stop them on that account. Through the absence of such powers the Censorship Board has been handicapped during the last few months.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister should understand that there are many Deputies in the House who are not at all satisfied that the provisions of the Censorship Act or the powers proposed to be given under this Bill are sufficient to deal with the matter.  We think the subject deserves a great deal more consideration than is given to it in this Bill, and while we are prepared to facilitate the Minister, we would be more satisfied if we had been asked to consider a much more far-reaching measure.  In particular, we think a strong case can be made out for a positive rather than a negative form of censorship.  In other words, there is a very strong case to be made for the setting up of an authority which would act in a selective capacity and which would be empowered to reject not merely immoral and debasing pictures, but pictures that are entirely worthless.  I think a case can be made for that.  If the State has control of elementary education, if the State has the right of directing the way in which children should be prepared for adult life, if the State has the right to say what sort of elementary readers the child should read, it is altogether anomalous that in the matter of the only provision in regard to the much more powerful influence exerted by the films, the State has only the power to say that nothing immoral shall be shown.  I do not want to take up the time of the House any further in the matter beyond again stating that there are very many Deputies who believe that the present Censorship <Col N="989" /> and the present powers of Censorship are not by any means sufficient. Further, I want to say that we regret the long delay that has taken place in introducing this Bill.  It would be impossible, in our opinion, to overtake the harm done in recent months by objectionable films being shown throughout the country.  These films should have been consigned to the Liffey on their first appearance.</P>

There is another aspect to which attention should be called, and that is the national point of view.  Some time ago a film was shown that was an insult to the Irish people.  Apart from the moral aspect steps should be taken to see that no such films are allowed to be shown.  Representations should also be made abroad, and where such films of an objectionable kind from the national point of view are shown, protests should be sent from this country to the country in which they are produced.</P>

I refer also to pictures that offend in a national sense.  I hope the Minister will consider later the bringing in of another Bill.  In the meantime I want to facilitate the Censorship Board in getting this Bill through.</P>

      <P>I have very little to say except to answer one question that was put.  This matter was very carefully considered by the Committee which brought in the report, and I hope the House will allow me to say that it was a very competent Committee that brought in what appears to me to be a very able report.  It is following this report that this Bill has been introduced.  The Committee recommended a certain type of machine to be installed.  That machine will enable the Censor and the Appeal Board to hear the particular film. The machine will reproduce the sound.  It was necessary for the Committee to consider a great number of machines.  They hit on one which they consider will be most suitable, and this machine is in course of installation.  As far as Deputy Little's point is concerned, my answer is that, of course, if a film was grossly indecent those exhibiting it could be prosecuted under the common law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certainly that is my view, but I have not heard of any film being produced the wording of which was grossly indecent.  Certainly no complaint has ever been sent in to my department to that effect, and vague rumours that go around do not carry much weight with me.  Very often people may see a film and say, this is horrible and so on, but if you come to consider whether a prosecution lies or not that is a different matter.  The sensitive mind may be revolted by certain things which it sees or hears, but it might be completely impossible to successfully prosecute in that case.  Generally, however, I believe that this would give sufficient powers to the Board of Censors to keep films within reasonable limits.  The discussion, if I may say so, has extended a little beyond the scope of this Bill and went into <Col N="991" /> the kind of films which should be produced, as to whether films, for instance, of an anti-national tendency should or should not be banned by the Board of Censors.  That is a very big question and I, personally, am very much of the opinion that the way to deal with things which we do not like because they offend our principles is simply to leave them alone.  A man who believes in his own principles, a man who has a belief in his own country, if he sees a stupid attack on his own country does not get into a state of feverish excitement about it.  He simply treats it with contempt.  It is only the persons who are doubtful, the persons who, for instance, think that Irish nationality is a very doubtful thing and will have to keep shouting about it, who get annoyed when they read books, newspapers and articles, or see films attacking Irish nationality. The person who believes in it, who thinks it is a great rock which can throw off all those waves of attack which may be brought against it, who regards these attacks rather with contempt&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Fahy has raised an important point in regard to the attendance of children at these pictures.  I do not know whether the censor has availed himself of the powers that I think he has under the 1923 Act to specify that certain pictures shall only be available for exhibition under certain conditions.  Certain pictures have been passed for exhibition here in Dublin.  They have been on for three weeks in some of the picture houses and I think there is legitimate ground for complaint, that these pictures are not suitable for exhibition for growing people. There may be an argument&mdash;I think it is a very weak argument&mdash;that these pictures are not subversive of public morality and are not undesirable for grown-ups.  I entirely fail to see how anyone can argue that they are suitable for children and as far as I know I would be very glad if the Minister would point out if I am under a misapprehension.  There seems to be no restrictions whatever with regard to letting children into pictures.  I think there should be a definite ruling with regard to modern society dramas, shooting scenes, night club life, and bedroom scenes.  If the Minister and his censor think that those pictures are suitable for public exhibition I think they are not and that the Act should <Col N="993" /> be interpreted more strictly.  We should not have the disgraceful state of affairs that children are brought into these pictures which are simply a mass of corruption from beginning to end.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fahy's average beats mine absolutely. I think I have heard and seen one talkie in my life only and therefore Deputy Fahy beats me and I cannot speak myself as an expert at all.  Complete powers are given to the Censor to deal with pictures, and if he thinks that a picture is of a type that it can be exhibited to one class of the community and not to another he can make such restrictions in giving his licence.  The power exists under the Censorship of Films Act, 1923.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer the Deputy that because that is wandering very much beyond the scope of the present Bill.  I do not think that any objection was taken until these talkies, as they are called, came in, to the way in which the censorship powers were being exercised, and when this Bill becomes law I think that everything will go rightly and smoothly.  These pictures came in with a sudden rush. They were unexpected and there was no means of dealing with them.  It was necessary for us to consider how they should be dealt with and a committee was set up for that purpose. As soon as the committee considered its report we brought in this Bill. There has been a short interval in which, I think, a few films have passed in which there were objectionable things.  I venture to think <Col N="994" /> when this Bill becomes law that everything will be smooth.  I do not think it would ever be possible for a censor only to allow what you might call educative films to be produced. It would be impossible for him to say: &ldquo;This film will not help the intellectual or moral development of the persons who look at it and, therefore, I will condemn it.&rdquo; It would be impossible for him to put up a standard of that kind.  A great deal must, of course, rest on the good taste of the audience.  If there is an objectionable film, it plays to an empty house.  If there is a good film, it plays to a full house.  It is the audience which ultimately and finally really decides what type of film it wants and therefore, what type of film it will get.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The people have no opportunity for saying what kind of films they will have.  A certain type of film is produced in London and they never get an opportunity of seeing it in this country.  Apart altogether from the question of whether certain tendencies in these films would pass the censorship or not, the fact is that a certain type of American picture is being dumped on this country and we are not getting an opportunity to get any other kind of film.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the censorship, I do not know very much about it but I think it would be a good idea if the film censor took the members of the Dáil to some of these exhibitions and let them express their opinions on these questions.  We have read of theatres in Dublin exhibiting pictures and flattering themselves because certain people have written &ldquo;I find this picture unobjectionable&rdquo; when that picture is considered not objectionable.  I think the members of the Dáil if a theatre is available for these pictures should be given an opportunity to pass comment on them.  I think the attitude of the film censorship office is, so far as I can understand it, that because they succeed in cutting out a very reprehensible part of the film and are able <Col N="995" /> to say &ldquo;The film is not what we would like to have it, but if it had been passed in the way in which it was presented to us it would be desperate. We have at least made an improvement and it is at least tolerable.&rdquo; I think that standpoint is not sufficient.  The attitude should be that there is a certain type of film coming into this country and that that type of film ought definitely to be banned if necessary and that the censor should not be satisfied with cutting out certain pieces of it, bits of a lady's leg here and there.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment 89.</P>
    <P>Before Section 50 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  The Council may, if and whenever it thinks fit, make regulations prescribing the procedure to be followed in regard to the receptions and examination of all or any particular class or classes of tenders for the supply of goods, the execution of works, or any other thing for which the Corporation may lawfully have invited the submission of tenders.</P>

      <Col N="996" /> (2)  All regulations made under this section shall be subject to the approval of the Minister and no such regulation shall be of any force or effect unless or until it has been so approved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed new section gives power to the council to frame regulations, subject to the concurrence of the Minister, that will deal with the machinery for receiving and considering tenders.  It still leaves the matter of contracts to the Manager. In connection with that I would like to say that if Deputies give consideration to it they will come to the conclusion that the Manager once the reception and consideration of tenders have been safeguarded should be the person who would decide the acceptance of tenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to the amendment down to Section 50, with regard to the affixing of the official seal.  Sub-section 8 of Section 50 states: &ldquo;The Manager shall not affix the official seal of the Corporation to any documents save in the presence of the Lord Mayor.&rdquo;  Deputy Lemass's amendment would make it &ldquo;save in the presence of and with the consent of the Lord Mayor.&rdquo; This whole business of requiring the presence of the Lord Mayor when the Manager is affixing the seal that is affixed as a managerial touch to his own act is nothing but a nuisance, and if we require that the Lord Mayor shall give his consent before the seal is put on, it creates a situation in which the Manager, taking the act for which he is responsible for taking, may be held up in the completion of that act by someone else.  In the case of a contract he may be open to action for breach of warranty of authority.  I think I will move on Report to delete that whole business with regard to the seal, and where the Manager <Col N="997" /> has to affix a seal in connection with an act which he is responsible for taking that the Manager shall affix the seal on behalf of the Corporation. Perhaps the Deputy would go into it and see what is involved in that matter of the seal in relation to the Manager being the person responsible for accepting contracts where the contract has to be sealed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The adoption of this amendment will constitute a considerable improvement upon the proposal in the original Bill, but, nevertheless, I think it does not provide against all the contingencies that I see may arise.  Undoubtedly the Council frames regulations which will necessitate the examination of tenders in public.  It will become impossible or almost impossible, except under very exceptional circumstances, for the Manager to reject the lowest tender or the tender which the Council thinks should be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there should be a limit beyond which not merely the reception and examination but the actual acceptance of tenders should be a matter for the Council.  In small contracts relating to ordinary routine duties of the Corporation, there is a good case for giving the Manager power to complete them.  There is, however, another class of contract, the making of which becomes a matter of policy, and it is not clear whether it is the Manager or the Council who would have that power of decision.  The City Commissioners, for instance, decided to terminate the system of cleaning the streets by direct labour and to have it done in future by contract. A contract of that kind is much different to quite a number of contracts that will arise from time to time relating to the work of the Corporation, and which should be determined by the Council and not by the Manager because there are considerations, other than those of the actual ability of the firm to carry out the contract or its cost, to be taken into account.  I mentioned the necessity for giving the Council power to decide that a preference should be <Col N="998" /> given to Irish firms or to firms contracting to use Irish material or to give other concessions of national benefit of that kind.  Matters of policy arise there and not matters of administration.  Therefore they should be determined by the Council and not by the Manager.  Perhaps the Minister will consider between this and the Report Stage the advisability of introducing another section, in addition to the new section which he proposes to insert, providing that such matters shall be determined by the Council so that the Manager shall be subject to the Council in matters of that kind.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to my amendment to the effect that the official seal should only be affixed to documents by the Manager in the presence of the Lord Mayor. The Bill states that it should be done in the presence of the Lord Mayor.  That fact means, I think, that it could only be done with the consent of the Lord Mayor as he could refuse to give his consent by refusing to be present. It amounts to the same thing in the end, as the Lord Mayor could make it impossible for the Manager as the Bill now stands, to affix the seal by refusing to be present.  The purpose of the amendment is to make the position clear.  The real difficulty was that there was no machinery in the Bill to determine disputes between the Manager and the Lord Mayor.  If the Lord Mayor declines to be present at the sealing of a document it cannot be sealed in consequence of the fact that no machinery exists to settle that matter. Another amendment stands in my name with a view to trying to resolve that difficulty.  I do not say that my method is a perfect one by any means, but it was the only one which occurred to me to be capable of being inserted in the framework of this Bill.  I do not think that the Minister's suggestion to delete these provisions in regard to the use of the official seal will constitute an improvement. In the long run the responsibility for the actions of the Corporation will devolve on the Council.  The Council is responsible <Col N="999" /> for raising the rates and, because of that fact, it cannot delegate its powers entirely to the Manager.  If the Manager is given the power of making contracts there should be some machinery by which his actions will be supervised by somebody, even if it is only the limited supervision provided in the Bill.  The fact that the Lord Mayor would have to be present at the sealing of a contract would constitute a safeguard and it would disimprove the Bill in my opinion to delete that.</P>

It is a check to this extent, that presumably the circumstances would have to be described to the Lord Mayor, and to that extent there is a safeguard in having a person to whom an explanation should be made or by whom it can be demanded.  It would be inconceivable for the Lord Mayor to express an arbitrary &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  It would place him in an invidious position.</P>

      <P>There is no analogy between the circumstances existing when the Bill will be in operation and those which obtained heretofore, as heretofore the Council made the contract, but now it will be the Manager.  There is something to be said for the Minister's suggestion that the sections should be deleted if they are meaningless.  If sub-section (8) means that the Lord Mayor must be advised by the Manager concerning contracts, and must give general approval to the Manager's actions, I think that the words &ldquo;with the consent of&rdquo; should be added so that the seal should be fixed, not merely in the presence of <Col N="1000" /> out definitely with the consent of the Lord Mayor.</P>

It is rather difficult to describe it, but what it means is that it is a kind of check, without actually being a check, to put in within the Lord Mayor's province to say &ldquo;I will not do it,&rdquo; but to say that he will not do it without giving his reason, would be rather absurd.</P>

As a formality, it is a nuisance to the Lord Mayor, and probably to the Manager, and, as a matter of information, such information as it gives can be got in other ways.  I mentioned it in order that we might have mature consideration of it before the Report Stage.</P>

    <P>(1)  Before the appointed day the appointment of a person to be a Manager shall be made by the Minister on the recommendation of the Local Appointments Commissioners, and those Commissioners <Col N="1001" /> are hereby required to make such recommendation on the request of the Minister.</P>
    <P>(2)  On and after the appointed day the appointment of a person to be a Manager shall be made by the Council, and the office of Manager shall be an office to which the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, applies.</P>

    <P>(6)  There shall be paid by the Corporation to the Manager such remuneration as the Minister shall from time to time determine.</P>
    <P>(7)  The Manager may do all such matters and things, including the making of contracts for and on behalf of the Corporation and the affixing of the official seal of the Corporation to documents, as may be necessary for or incidental to the exercise or performance of any of the powers, functions and duties of the Corporation which are by this Act required to be exercised or performed by the Manager.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  Gerald Jarlath Sherlock, <Col N="1002" /> Town Clerk of the City of Dublin, shall be and is hereby appointed to be the City Manager as on and from the appointed day.</P>
    <P>(2)  Before the appointed day the appointment of a person to be the Borough Manager or (in the case of the said Gerald Jarlath Sherlock being prevented by any event occurring before or after the passing of this Act from taking office as City Manager) the City Manager shall be made by the Minister on the recommendation of the Local Appointments Commissioners, and those Commissioners are hereby required to make such recommendation on the request of the Minister.</P>
    <P>This arises out of Amendment 54 which abolishes the position of Town Clerk and makes the City Manager both Manager and Town Clerk.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We feel on principle that it is a derogation of the dignity of the new Council, whatever Council are there, that they are not to be allowed even to select their own Chief Officer.  We think it is not a proper thing no matter who the individual is.  Without in any way bringing in the name of the individual that has been mentioned, we think it is certainly improper that the House should mention the name of the person to be appointed and force that person on any Council.  It is quite possible that the new Council if they were left an absolutely free choice in the matter would select the gentleman named.  We do not want to say anything in regard to the individual, either for or against him, but on principle we think it is absolutely improper.  We think that the fact that the new Council are not to be allowed to select their own official takes considerably from the confidence that we ought to feel and that the citizens would have in the Council.  The President and some others in this House had a long experience of the Municipal Council and a long experience of its chief officers.  I doubt if anybody who has had experience of these officials&mdash;certainly I cannot say it and I have had an experience of almost every official <Col N="1003" /> of prominence and responsibility who has in the last twenty-five years been elected or promoted to a responsible office by the Municipal Council&mdash;can say that officials so promoted were not the best officials that could be got so far as experience went.</P>
      <P>If we are to judge by the Councils that were in existence in the past and go on past experience, we must conclude that the Council will be a responsible body.  That Council, no matter how composed, will certainly have as their primary interest, the interests of the citizens as a whole.  I think it is absolutely wrong that the House or the Minister should insert here the name of any one individual.  I think the Council should be left absolutely free to select their own official.  We could bring up here at this stage appointments that were made by the Department to very responsible offices in the last seven or eight years, in relation to matters of this kind, and which have not proved as successful as appointments made by the old Municipal Council, on the admission of the Department itself. I think the President would be well advised, as he is primarily responsible, to advise the Minister for Local Government, who has not the same experience, to leave the name out and to put the responsibility where it belongs, on the Municipal Council, to select the best official that can be got.  If the responsibility is put on their shoulders they will get a good official, and if it happens afterwards&mdash;I do not say it will happen in this case&mdash;that the official appointed does not prove satisfactory they cannot come here and say: &ldquo;Well, we have no responsibility. This choice was not ours.&rdquo;  In all the circumstances, without reference to the gentleman who is named in the Bill.  I think it is setting up a wrong precedent and a precedent that we should not stand by.</P>

      <P>I agree, but the objection we make to naming the individual in the Bill is that it gives that individual a status equal to the status of the Council.  It is really a matter of psychology.  I think it is very undersirable that the particular individual should be named here as Manager, because that means that the person's title to act as Manager is just as good as the title of the Council to act as the Corporation. The mere fact that the Council have the formal making of the appointment under the Local Appointments Act means that there is a definite acknowledgment of the superiority of the Council.  It means that where an individual is selected by the Appointments Commission and his name sent forward to the Council, although the Council's appointment of that individual is a mere formality, there is a definite acknowledgment of the superiority of the Council which there will not be in this particular case in consequence of the fact that one individual is appointed by statute to be Manager. As Deputy O'Kelly stated, our objection to the section has no relation to the individual mentioned.  I have known Mr. Sherlock to be a competent official.  It is quite possible&mdash; I would go so far as to say it is likely&mdash;that in the circumstances now existing the Council would be almost coerced to the appointment of Mr. Sherlock, because the alternatives would be very few.  The objection is to the naming of the individual and to the status and the authority which this section will confer upon him.</P>

I happened to be in a minority on that occasion.  It was the usual position in which I found myself.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe Deputy O'Kelly was in the majority.  My case was that the person appointed had smaller service and lesser qualifications. The same thing could happen in the present instance.  After all, one's persuasive power would count.  What one might describe as the goods put in the window by certain persons when canvassing are a pretty big consideration.  There are other persons who are not so capable perhaps of putting their goods so elegantly in the shop window and consequently their claims to consideration are not considered as strong.  In this case, this is a very responsible official.  It is also, I think, agreed that if the Manager system, which has got general acceptance, is to work with any degree of smoothness, it is advisable to have a person in the service in question, granted he is a suitable and a competent person, appointed.  In this particular appointment the person proposed as Manager on this occasion has possibly five or six years' service as Town Clerk&mdash;a sufficiently long experience to allow of the smooth working of the new arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will, I am sure, appreciate <Col N="1006" /> the fact that to set up a Selection Board for the purpose of making appointments, such as in this instance, would not be an easy task. It would not be at all so easy to constitute a Selection Board which would in the first place, give satisfaction to the Local Appointments Commissioners, and in the second place to the ordinary public.  The question arises then, is there a person in the service of sufficient experience commanding a sufficient amount of public confidence and at the same time, suitable for appointment?  I would say there are several in the service.  There is another point for consideration.  Is it advisable to consider an outside appointment?  Properly speaking, it would if the system were in operation and if we had experience of its working, but it is due to the city that it should have an opportunity of taking the very best person available for the office, no matter from what part of the country he comes.  As I have said this system is in its infancy and the smooth working of it is one of its most important characteristics. While we might get another appointment by the Selection Board, it is fairly clear that we could scarcely get a much better appointment than that of the person who occupies the position of senior official in the service.</P>
    <P>As the co-operation of the various branches of the service is essential to the smooth and harmonious working of the new system, I think the Minister was well advised in making the nomination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not say that.  There is another side to it.  The Government consider that the circumstances of the time are better served by the nomination of the chief officer of the Corporation in the inauguration of the new system than by having an outsider, even with better qualifications if one were to be found.</P>

Is it not obvious that the Council will be influenced by exactly the same consideration as the Government were influenced by, and that probably they would make the very same appointment, but there would be a decided difference, because the appointment would be made by the Council in the first place, and it is being made by statute in this case. Would the Government consider an amendment to the effect that this appointment shall continue until the Appointed Day and shall then be subject to ratification by the Council?</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the Local Appointments Commission expressed the policy of the Government.  The Deputy's suggestion would vitiate that.

      <P>As to the appointment by the Government this time, judging by some recent appointments by the Local Appointments Commission, it is probably more honest that the Government should make this appointment in the open.  We have the case of the County Medical Officer for Meath and the County Medical Officer for Tirconaill.  What were these but Government appointments? Does anyone think that they were made in any way but by wirepulling? It certainly was not any question of special qualification.  If there is any merit in this, it is because it is done in the open.</P>

      <P>So far as any appointment made by the Local Appointments Commission is concerned, not to my knowledge, direct or indirect, or to the knowledge of any member of the Government, was there ever anything in the nature of influence used.  Are we to take it that a person having the necessary qualifications, but being a member, let us say, of Cumann na nGaedheal <Col N="1008" /> or any other Party, is not to get any appointment?</P>

      <P>On the question of these two appointments referred to, it will be time enough to take up the Deputy's remarks and consider them when the bodies that these two officers are serving have anything to say with regard to the qualifications or application to their duties of these officers.  As Deputy Lemass apparently has noticed, the position is with regard to the first appointment of the Manager, at any rate, that the Bill, as originally drafted, provided that the first appointment was to be made by the Minister on the recommendation of the Local Appointments Commissioners, for the reason that the Council and Manager system had to come into being on the one day, so that the Minister, in the first instance, is simply performing the act that the Council in normal circumstances would perform.  As far as the recommendation of the Local Appointments Commission was concerned, it was simply a matter of formality for the Minister or the Council.  The circumstances in which we are amalgamating the position of Town Clerk with that of City Manager, and when we have in the position of Town Clerk in Dublin an officer of capacity and experience, we make it obvious that we have to do what we are doing.  I do not agree that it in the least puts the person now being appointed City Manager in any way in a different position with regard to his powers, functions, and duties or his relations to the Council, than he would be in if he were appointed by the Council on the recommendation of the Local Appointments Commission.  He is simply made Manager by statute, rather than by order or by express appointment, either of the Minister or of the Council.  But his position from the point of view of status and powers and relation to the Council is simply <Col N="1009" /> as defined in the Bill, which will be the position of any Manager subsequently appointed in the way provided for.</P>

The Council asks the Manager to submit an estimate of the cost of its removal, and he says £50,000.  The Council do not believe that it would cost anything of the sort.  Can the Council in these circumstances get from a contractor, or get the Manager to get from a contractor, an estimate of the cost of removing the Pillar for comparison with the Manager's own estimate?</P>

      <P>(2)  The Manager shall attend any meeting of the Council at which he is requested by the Council to attend and shall at such meeting give to the Council such advice and assistance as shall reasonably be required of him by the Council, and for that purpose the Manager shall arrange for the attendance at such meeting of such of the officers of the Corporation as may be necessary.</P>
      <P>This meets, to some extent, the request to make it obligatory on the Manager to attend the council meeting when asked to do so.  Some amendments suggest the same thing should apply to committee meetings, and I shall see what way we can amend this to meet it.  I shall amend the present section so as to provide that the Manager shall attend meetings of the Council, or of any of its committees, at which he is requested by the Council to attend.  Normally if a committee requests the attendance of the Manager he will attend. There is the difficulty of several committees meeting on the same day, and I do not care to tie up the situation completely.  However, I shall consider what amendment requires to be made with regard to securing his attendance and the attendance of other officials at committees.  In the meantime I move this amendment 107.</P>

The object is to secure the presence of officials such as the law agent or the city surveyor where they might be needed and where it might be necessary to consult them.  It might be necessary, because of their absence, to call a special meeting of the Council to have them present.  It is a matter of saving time.</P>

      <P>Might I ask is the Minister considering amendment 108 in conjunction with the attendance of the Manager and officials at committees of the Council under Section 56?  The Manager has a right to attend meetings of the Council.  May I assume from that that he has also the right to remain away?  The intention of the amendment that I have tabled is to comply with an old Standing Order of the Corporation; that is, if a Committee of the Council require the attendance of an official they can, through their Standing Orders, direct the Manager or other officials to attend, if they so require their presence at any time.  I should be glad if the Minister accepted my amendment.</P>

      <P>I see something behind this, something possibly that some of the Deputies do not see.

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>Deputy Good misses the point.  It is not proposed that the Council should ask clerks to come before them on the question as to whether the Manager is doing his work properly or not.  Officials will only be asked to come before the Council to give it any assistance it may require.  The Manager is not a lawyer, and the Council some time or other may want proper legal opinion upon some question and they cannot get that through the Manager but through their law officer, and, therefore, they should have power to require the attendance of the law officer.  The same would apply in the case of the engineer or any other skilled official.  Their presence may be required for giving information and advice which the Manager could not give without consulting them. One difficulty arises.  The Council can only request that a thing be done by passing a resolution, and a resolution may require notice.  It may conceivably arise that the attendance of <Col N="1016" /> the Manager might be required at a Council, or a committee meeting, in order to resolve a particular difficulty that was not foreseen.  Is it not advisable, therefore, that the Manager should be required to attend, if requested, say, by the Lord Mayor so to do, and that it should not be necessary for the Council to adjourn for a few days in order to have notice given and a resolution passed requiring the attendance of the Manager?</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>My whole attitude towards this amendment is that it is entirely unnecessary, that the Manager will be there whenever he is wanted, simply because the nature of his work requires it. If the Deputy thinks that this amendment means that when the Council requires the attendance of the Manager at a meeting it has to pass a resolution, then I think that my own amendment is thoroughly faulty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister says is correct.  In normal circumstances the Manager will come and there will be no difficulty in the Council getting all the assistance it requires.  But a provision of this kind is put into the Bill to deal with an emergency&mdash;when the Manager and the Council have a row and when the Manager says he will not attend when a certain matter is under discussion.  If that possibility of dispute is not going to arise there is no necessity for the amendment, but I take it that the amendment has been put down because there is that possibility.</P>

      <P>I can quite understand the Minister's attitude on this amendment with regard to the Manager, but I can state from experience that there are occasions when Committees require the attendance of certain officials, and it is easy for an official to avoid attending if he has no desire to be there. It is an inconvenience to a committee to have to require the attendance of an official when he, for one reason or another, wishes to avoid being <Col N="1017" /> there, and there should be power to give a direction.</P>

      <P>How is it proposed to deal with it in the meantime?  We can see the Minister's mind on the matter and the mind of the other side.  Could anything be done in the meantime?  Certainly I am very keen on giving the Council power to send for any official, and I have particularly in mind the City Surveyor. From my experience of public bodies I should say that his presence would nearly always be necessary.  I take the case of the Borough Surveyor for the sake of argument.  If he is an architect dealing with a housing scheme he should be present, because the City Manager could not possibly answer all the questions that would be raised with regard to estimates and other matters, and it would be only a waste of time for him to try to answer.</P>

I do not want to open the door to anything in the nature of indiscipline and friction between the staff and the City Manager.  Deputies will clearly see my mind if they realise that I am anxious to have brought before the Council all the officials whom it is necessary to bring in order to carry on the business properly.  I am anxious that that should be done without the necessity for passing a resolution, and it may be necessary there to change amendment 107 to say simply that the Manager shall attend meetings of the Council as requested by the Council, or something like that, or as requested by the Lord Mayor.</P>

      <P>I think it would be a very good idea if the Minister would table for the Dáil the whole of a proceedings of the Cork Corporation. Then Deputies would know that the Manager himself has walked out of a meeting indignantly saying: &ldquo;I will not stay.&rdquo;  He insolently and angrily told the Corporation that he would not produce any officials.  This is a live issue.  Who is to decide what officials may be necessary?  Does the Minister want to put it in such a form that nobody on God's earth knows until we go to court to decide it?  Is that the sort of legislation <Col N="1020" /> that he wants to pass?  Surely he can tell us that he means &ldquo;such officials as shall be necessary in the opinion of the Manager,&rdquo; or &ldquo;such officials as shall be necessary in the opinion either of the Manager or the Council,&rdquo; or &ldquo;such officials as are necessary in the opinion of the Council.&rdquo;  He cannot leave it open, in face of our actual experience in Cork.  The business men in Cork cannot be accused of any revolutionary activity in relation to the City Manager, so that they cannot be accused of any wild initiative for altering his position, but in the strongest possible terms to me yesterday was put this demand by business representatives of Cork, by the people who voted against any amendment of the Bill.  What is the Minister going to do?  Is he going to leave this as a fly-trap or is he going to tell us what the section is supposed in his mind to mean, to say nothing of what it may mean in the minds of the lawyers when it comes to be examined?</P>

      <P>In my opinion, in the actual working out of things, this amendment is entirely unnecessary. I am putting it in to meet Deputies' objections in the matter. I am putting it in to make it clear that the officials that are necessary to do the Council's business will be produced by the Manager.  But in putting in an amendment like this I want to avoid any possibility of undermining the discipline of the staff under the Manager by an objectionable connection between members of the staff and members of the Council, and I ask Deputies to sympathise with me in that matter and to give it further consideration.  I do not know what kind of changes we can make.  On the Report Stage we might make a change like this: &ldquo;Such officers as the Council or the Manager shall consider necessary.&rdquo; I think the Deputies understand the spirit in which I approached this matter, and if we accept amendment 107 we can see what other amendment would be required to make it more acceptable.  The whole thing is unnecessary.  In connection with <Col N="1021" /> what Deputy Flinn said on one occasion, as far as I know, in certain circumstances the production of a particular officer was refused.</P>

    <P>(3)  Whenever the Manager receives any such notice as is mentioned in the foregoing sub-section of this section, he shall as soon as possible send a copy of such notice <Col N="1023" /> to every member of the Council and shall summon a special meeting of the Council for the date specified in that behalf in such notice at the usual hour for meetings of the Council.</P>
    <P>(4)  When a resolution of which notice has been given under this section has been proposed at the meeting of the Council summoned for the purpose under this section, the Council and the Manager shall consider such resolution and if after such consideration the Council pass such resolution and the number of members voting for such resolution exceeds half the total membership of the Council, the Manager shall, if and when and so far as money for the purpose is or has been provided, do in accordance with such resolution the act, matter, or thing which is required by such resolution to be done.</P>
    <P>(5)  A resolution passed under this section shall not be so expressed as to apply or extend&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  to the exercise or performance of any power, function, or duty of the Corporation generally or to every case or occasion of the exercise or performance of any such power, function, or duty or to a number or class of such cases or occasions so extended as to be substantially or in effect every case or occasion on which such power, function, or duty is exercised or performed, nor</P>

    <P>(1)  The Manager may by order signed by him and countersigned by the Town Clerk authorise the making of any payment out of the funds of the Corporation in respect of any expense or on account <Col N="1025" /> of any liability incurred by the Council or the Manager on behalf of the Corporation in the exercise or the performance by the Council or the Manager (as the case may be) of any of the powers, functions or duties of the Corporation which are exercisable or performable by them or him respectively under this Act.</P>
    <P>(2)  The Lord Mayor or Mayor (as the case may be) may at any time direct by writing under his hand that every order made under the foregoing sub-section of this section during the unexpired residue of his term of office or during any lesser period specified in such direction shall be submitted to him for his signature, and the Lord Mayor or Mayor may by writing under his hand revoke any such direction at any time during the period to which the same relates.</P>
    <P>(3)  If and whenever the Lord Mayor or Mayor (as the case may be) gives any such direction as is mentioned in the foregoing sub-section of this section then, while such direction remains in force, the signature of the Lord Mayor or Mayor (as the case may be) shall be necessary on every such order as is mentioned in the first sub-section of this section in addition to the signature and countersignature mentioned in that sub-section, but the Lord Mayor or Mayor shall not by reason of the fact of his signature being on any such order incur any liability to which he would not have been liable if he had not given such direction as aforesaid.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-sections (2) and (3) and substitute three new sub-sections as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  The Council may at any time by resolution direct that every order made under the foregoing sub-section of this section shall, during such period as is specified in such resolution, be submitted to the Lord Mayor or Mayor (as the case may be) or to some other member of the Council nominated from time to time for the purpose by the Council for his signature.</P>
      <P>(3)  The Council may at any time by resolution revoke a direction given under the foregoing sub-section of this section and for the time being in force.</P>
      <P>(4)  If and whenever the Council gives any such direction as is hereinbefore mentioned, then, while such direction remains in force, the signature of the Lord Mayor or Mayor or of the member of the Council nominated for the purpose (as the case may require) shall be necessary on every such order as is mentioned in the first sub-section of this section in addition to the signature of the Manager, but the Lord Mayor or Mayor or such member of the Council (as the case may be) shall not by reason of the fact of his signature being on any such order incur any liability to which he would not have been liable if such direction as aforesaid had not been given.</P>
      <P>As the section stands it gave the Lord Mayor power to require, at any time, that every paying order should be countersigned by him before it went out.  I thought it better to replace the Lord Mayor by the Council, so that in case the impossible happened of a Lord Mayor taking up the attitude that he was not going to allow any payments, there would be some control of the situation.  The amendment simply proposes to replace &ldquo;the Lord Mayor&rdquo; by &ldquo;the Council.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the replacement of the Lord Mayor by the Council is an improvement, but I do not think the contingencies that made the original proposal objectionable are altogether removed by the amendment.  I take it that this section has been put into the Bill to deal with the possibility of the Manager turning dishonest, or acting in a manner which might give rise to suspicions in the minds of the Council. A similar section was put into the Cork Bill, and the danger of giving absolute power over the Corporation finances to one individual without check was adverted to.  I agree that it is unlikely that the person appointed as Manager will proceed to pocket the Corporation funds, but nevertheless we must safeguard against the possibility, because the funds in question are very large.  If the Council passes a resolution requiring that all paying orders signed by the Manager must be countersigned by the Lord Mayor, or by a member of the Council appointed for that purpose, and if that person comes to the conclusion that a particular paying order signed by the Manager should not be countersigned by him, what will be the position?  Who will be responsible for the determination of the question, whether the paying order should or should not be issued?  The matter is more urgent in relation to the expenditure of money than in relation to other things, because it is conceivably possible that a cause of action against the Corporation might arise in consequence of a refusal of the representative of the Council to countersign the paying order.  I think some machinery will have to be set up by which, if the representative of the Council refuses to sign a paying order, or if the Corporation think the paying order should not be issued, the Mayor can require that the question will be brought before the Council for determination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would seem the natural thing that if the Manager issues a paying order and <Col N="1028" /> that the person nominated by the Council for the special purpose of counter-signing refused to give his signature, that then the Manager would report the matter to the Council. Assuming that it was an honest transaction, the Council would then take the matter into consideration and would have to make up their minds whether they were going to remain in the position in which a payment due to be made was not going to be made because the counter-signature had been refused. At any rate, the matter would come up for discussion before the Council. If the Council was persuaded that it was right to make the payment, then in the event of the counter-signature being refused by their nominee they would have to nominate somebody else to do that particular duty.  I do not think there is any element of the possibility of a deadlock in that particular way.  On the other hand, if the Manager did not bring the matter before the Council it would suggest that there was something dishonest in the transaction.  The situation, however, would be entirely in the Manager's hands, and I doubt if there is any further elaboration of the amendment necessary.</P>

      <P>There are two things in the amendment that I do not understand.  It looks to me that there are two persons in existence to either of whom this thing can be submitted for signature&mdash;the Lord Mayor or somebody else.  It seems to me that if these two people could co-exist it would be a question of choice as to which would give his signature.  There is a second point that I am not clear on.  It was raised by something the Minister said.  I would like to know from the Minister if it is a general power that is being given to this alternative person or is it simply power ad hoc?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking the statement of the Minister from which I gathered that this had something <Col N="1029" /> to do with a specific occasion: that a person will be set up with authority to countersign cheques in relation to a specific occasion.  It seems to me that the authority which will be given to him would be a general authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a general authority for a particular purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the position that arises is this: that if some specific instance arises you can only give general authority.  You cannot give a specific authority.  The second point that I want to make is that there seem to be two people to whom cheques can be submitted.  I have had experience in the case of a certain local body whose cheques were required to be counter-signed by certain members for a specific purpose.  Certain men were chosen to sign specific cheques for it was certain they would do so and others were not chosen because they would object to do so.  Here you have an alternative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention of the amendment really is that the Council shall nominate one person to do that.  That person may be either the Lord Mayor or any member of the Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that possibly that is not clear in the amendment as it stands.  If Deputies think that the nomination of one member to carry out this duty is not sufficient and that it might be more advisable to have more than one, I could bring in an amendment to make that clear.  The idea is that should the Council come to the decision that certain supervision in this matter is necessary, then that supervision should be carried out by one person&mdash;not necessarily by the Lord Mayor.  I am prepared to make clearer the point Deputy Flinn raised, but in the absence of any further recommendation on the matter I intend to leave the position that one person would be assigned to this particular duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Lord Mayor may not be anxious to undertake it. There may be a very considerable amount of work involved in this.  If the Lord Mayor is to be the person, and if he has to be present every time that the seal is to be affixed or an order issued, he may find himself tied up in a multiplicity of small details. Then this may not be consonant with the dignity of his office even though it appeared to the Council that the Lord Mayor was the proper person to see the thing done. You do not want to have this work done by the Lord Mayor if, in the opinion of the Council, it can be more conveniently done by some other person.</P>

      <P>I think there is a misunderstanding about this whole matter.  As a matter of fact, the Council does not make payments at all.  The payments are made by the Finance Committee.  I speak from experience.  Supposing that one member of the Finance Committee is nominated to sign cheques, it may not be possible for that member to be present on a particular day.  It seems to me that if the Lord Mayor, or the person appointed by the Committee to do this, is not available to sign the cheques, surely it would be within the province of the Finance Committee to depute some other member of the Committee to discharge that duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so at all. I think that under the Manager you will have committees just as you have at present&mdash;finance and other committees.  From my reading of the Bill, there is nothing in it to prohibit the setting up of such committees. If you have a Council under the Bill then you will have a certain number of committees&mdash;I hope not as many as under the old system. But when the Council is set up you will have a number of committees to deal with these matters as they ought to be dealt with.  I am satisfied that one of the first committees that will be set up under the Council will be a finance committee.</P>

      <P>I would like to know from the Minister whether it is proposed under the Bill to have a departure from the old system whereby the Finance Committee met an hour or so previous to the monthly meeting of the Council, examined the accounts, and signed them in globo. The treasurer's advice note was signed at the end by three members of the Committee.  If there is to be no departure from that I do not see any necessity for deputing any particular member of the Finance Committee to sign.  When the members of the Finance Committee have <Col N="1032" /> passed the accounts and submitted them to the City Manager and he signs the cheques, I think that is quite sufficient.</P>

      <P>The Manager, under Section 56, is responsible for signing the order to the treasurer authorising payment out of the Corporation funds.  As the section stood, and when there was a separate town clerk, he was to countersign every order.  Sub-sections (2) and (3) are to enable the Council if they so desire to supervise for any particular period payments made by the Manager, that is to authorise the Lord Mayor if he so desired to require by order in writing that those orders to the treasurer should be submitted to him and signed by him, and that no order to the treasurer under these circumstances would be valid unless it bore the signature of the Lord Mayor.  The amendment takes the Lord Mayor out of it as the person who initiates the decision that requires the City Manager's orders submitted.  It puts the initiative in that matter into the hands of the Council, and it proposes that whatever <Col N="1036" /> period the Council thinks it is desirable they will designate in their resolution requiring that these orders before being passed from the Manager to the treasurer will be submitted by the Manager to the Lord Mayor, or some member of the Council designated by them, for counter-signature, and without that signature they will not be accepted by the treasurer as valid.</P>

      <P>The amendment deals with whether this order is to be signed by the Lord Mayor or by somebody else.  I do not think other questions should be brought into the amendment.

      <P>I do not want to accept the amendment as being final. I would ask the Minister what was wrong with the old system?  Has it not worked for years satisfactorily? Every council was kept in touch with the finances of the council. Take Wexford.  There are twenty-four members and they are notified to attend previous to the monthly meeting to check accounts.  Three out of six are supposed to sign the treasurer's advice note.  These are then submitted to a monthly meeting of the Council and examined there and then; the Town Clerk is given authority by the signature of the Mayor alone to issue money orders for items in the treasurer's advice note.  That is the way in which these paying orders are issued at present, and it is the best way in which to do it.</P>

      <P>I agree, but the Minister has agreed to consider what arrangement is to be substituted for the arrangement contemplated in the section.  For that reason I submit that the Minister might consider the proposal put forward by Deputy Corish, that instead of having a paying order countersigned by the Town Clerk the paying order might be countersigned by the chairman of the Finance Committee.  We will have an opportunity of submitting an amendment containing our views between now and the Report Stage.  As the Minister will be required to submit an amendment in any case we would ask him, before drafting that amendment, to consider the suggestion made by Deputy Corish.</P>

      <P>Then I withdraw it. It is not clear to me when we appoint an alternative way whether we appoint an addition or whether we appoint a substitute.  That is the point that is not clear to me.  We <Col N="1038" /> have been familiar in this House with Bills drafted by amateurs and we have been familiar with the strictures offered on Bills drafted by amateurs.  I must say that we never had a Bill drafted by amateurs which was so utterly indeterminate in every clause as this Bill.  This Bill will have to be altered radically. I think it is time that the Minister should have some sense of responsibility for the form in which he throws these things at the House. Nobody knows the meaning of one of these clauses and no lawyer could tell you the meaning.  We have had that situation in relation to three sections of the Bill.  In each of these cases nobody knew what was meant by the wording.  Let us understand the mind of the Minister.</P>

      <P>Yes, I am.  It is utterly indeterminate and the wording is a disgrace from the point of view of its lack of clarity.  A plain man in this House should be able to understand an amendment or a section, if he tries to understand it, but no one could understand the meaning of this.  The Minister should be ashamed of throwing rubbish like that at the House.  I ask again does the section mean whether we appoint an addition or whether we appoint a substitute under the meaning of that clause?</P>

      <P>I might suggest to the Minister to substitute the Lord Mayor for some other member of the Council.  I do not see how an individual member would be in a better position to sign than the Lord Mayor.  It would be otherwise if it were the Chairman of the particular meeting.  The Lord Mayor is close at hand during the whole day or during the principal hours of the day; he is convenient to the Manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But if the Council were to select somebody other than the Lord Mayor there may be some difficulty in getting him at a convenient time to sign these orders.  I think the purpose might be met if it were made <Col N="1039" /> to read &ldquo;The Lord Mayor or Chairman of the particular meeting.&rdquo;  Our procedure in Cork is that we have amalgamated the Finance Committee and all these Committees.  All the old Committees are now simply one Committee and at a meeting of this Committee the financial statement and the Treasurer's advice note are considered and passed in the usual way.  It would be convenient for the chairman of that meeting to sign at that particular meeting.  That would be going back to the system that prevailed in the old days.</P>

In the same way the bridge tax is another charge that the urban or city council could not affect and it is, therefore, of the same nature of charge as the board of guardians. Therefore, any increase there may be in the bridge tax arising, say, out of the making of a new Butt Bridge or anything like that, should be spread over the area to which the bridge tax is referable even though we are stabilising the fundamental urban district rates over a certain number of areas in Rathmines, Pembroke and Killiney.</P>
