      <P>It was mentioned last night that amendments 21, 22 and 23 more or less go together.  Section 33 deals with the method of veterinary examination.  There are certain stages of this examination: (a) Ante-mortem examination; (b) that the animal must be slaughtered in the presence of the veterinary examiner; (c) that the carcase of such animal must be opened and disembowelled in his presence; (d) that the carcase and viscera must be examined by the veterinary examiner. I believe that any disease that can possibly be detected by a veterinary examiner ante-mortem can also be detected post-mortem. Therefore there is no necessity for the veterinary examiner to examine the animal ante-mortem.  I believe also that there is no necessity for him to be present while the animal is being disembowelled.  If the factory people want the work done as quickly as possible they may possibly be held up waiting for the examiner to come along, and may miss some boat that they want to export the carcases on.  They may be put to very serious inconvenience by so waiting.  I know it is the practice in some places where veterinary examination is carried out&mdash;I saw it in the Dublin abattoir, in the case of cattle at any rate&mdash;that the animal is disembowelled, but the viscera are left connected with the carcase until the veterinary inspector comes along. In the meantime, while waiting for him, the people in the slaughterhouse can proceed with the cleansing of the carcase and get ready for the necessary operation of preparing the carcase for export.  The Minister, according to an amendment he has on the Paper, appears to agree that it is not necessary that the animal should be slaughtered in the presence of the inspector.  But the Minister <Col N="339" /> appears to believe that it is necessary that the veterinary examiner should see the animal before slaughter, and also that the animal should be disembowelled in his presence.  These are the two points on which I differ with the Minister. I believe that it is not necessary for the veterinary examiner to see the animal before slaughter, and not necessary for him to be present while it is being disembowelled.  I agree that it is necessary that the veterinary examiner should be present when the viscera are being disconnected from the carcase, but disembowelling up to that point can be done before the examiner arrives.</P>
      <P>If the Minister would agree on these points, it would save a great deal of trouble to exporters of fresh meat if they were permitted to go on with the business of killing and disembowelling the animal and cleaning the carcase, leaving the viscera connected with the carcase until the veterinary inspector arrives. It would also save a considerable amount of time to the veterinary examiners if they have only to come along and examine a carcase with the viscera connected and when everything is ready. They will then be able to get through their examination very quickly and the examination will be effective.  As they will be able to get through the examination very quickly, and less time will be taken, the fees which it will be necessary to pay to these examiners will be much less than under the Bill as it stands.</P>

      <P>I am in a difficulty in this matter for the reason that, on the one side, we have Deputy Ryan, who is a technician, while I am only a layman in the matter.  I am very much surprised at his statement to the effect that it is not necessary to have ante-mortem inspection for the veterinary examination.  I am advised by the veterinary profession as a body that ante-mortem examination is necessary for efficient inspection. Moreover, I am advised <Col N="340" /> that that is an accepted principle in every country in the world.  Veterinary surgeons like medical men are an international body, and I am told that it is accepted in every other country in the world as well as in this country that ante-mortem inspection is essential for efficient inspection for certification purposes. Deputy Ryan suggests the exact opposite.  What am I to say?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to talk as an expert in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is an expert.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, on the basis that we are two laymen in the matter, I am advised by the profession that it is considered, for efficient inspection for certification purposes, essential to have ante-mortem examination. I am advised further that that is accepted in every country in the world, and that no certification, based on merely post-mortem examination, would be accepted in England, Denmark, Holland or Canada, or in any other country as efficient examination.  In that state of affairs I had no option but to insert this. Now, that covers point number one. As to number two, it will cause no trouble at all.  I assume the Deputy has been in a bacon factory, and if so, I shall assume he will agree with me that the problem is a very much bigger one in a big bacon factory than in a small one.  Consider the problem in a big factory.  A drove of pigs come in there, and they are put into pens.  These droves are taken to the slaughter-house together. The inspection presents no difficulty.  The inspector takes his place and sees the pigs pass.  To any veterinary surgeon that is of great help.  Even a person who is not a veterinary surgeon, but who is a good judge of live stock, can spot pigs here and there that are extremely emaciated or show external signs of some disease.  He can mark them and examine them more closely later on.  It is perfectly obvious to a veterinary surgeon or a skilled man that it is a very great help to <Col N="341" /> have an opportunity of seeing the pigs beforehand and culling out obviously suspicious cases.  That is all it asks.  It is absolutely no trouble to the factory.  The biggest factories in Ireland do their business in the way I suggest.  Pigs are put into pens, and only one lot comes in at a time.  You do not have them slaughtered and disembowelled at the same time.  One lot goes up and passes through a little gate.  The veterinary surgeon stands there and sees them pass.  Should he have the right to do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is he compelled to do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>He is compelled. What does that mean in practice? He is compelled to be in the factory, instead of being in the next hotel, if you wish, at the time the animals are going to be slaughtered.  That is what it comes to.  If, on the other hand, I do not compel him, the factory owner is entitled to shut the door in that part of the premises and keep him outside, and so there would be no point whatever in taking this power from the veterinary surgeon.  It is necessary, I am advised, and it is no trouble to the veterinary surgeon or the factory owner.  That deals with (A). Now as to (B), that such animals should be slaughtered in his presence, I have an amendment that deals with that.  The next (C), is to delete the lines &ldquo;that the carcase of such animal was opened and disembowelled in his presence.&rdquo; Again, let us see what is the procedure here.  In every factory I have been ever in, disembowelling does not go on in two places at one time. In small factories, where there are no overhead rails, the problem is easily dealt with.  There are only a few pigs, and the veterinary surgeon can make arrangements to be there, but in big factories, and these are the ones I take it the Deputy was thinking of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the small ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the big factories there is no difficulty.  The veterinary surgeon stands there, the <Col N="342" /> animal is opened and the pluck is taken out.  It is all done at one point.  He watches and sees the process carried out.  In small factories it is easy to make suitable arrangements. I met deputations representing small factory owners, and they raised no objection.  Again, if the veterinary surgeon is not present what is to prevent substitution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They must be left connected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>They must be connected. Can that be done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I remember the factory people put up objections to leaving them connected and waiting until the veterinary surgeon comes round.  Wherever I saw the process carried out, they were immediately disconnected and thrown upon another table.  The surgeon saw them at once and they were taken away.  If they are to be left connected, it might give rise to all sorts of other problems in the factory.  In fact there is no difficulty. There is certainly no difficulty in the big factories.  In the small factories it ought to be easy to make arrangements because it is absolutely essential to prevent substitution. I am told by the veterinary profession that this is essential. They tell me that they could not certify unless this provision was put in.  This is the standard adopted by other countries.  This Bill deals with meat for export, and therefore we must accept general standards. Otherwise our certificates are no good.  It would simply be a waste of time and money to be giving certificates based on examinations which the countries to which we export meat regard as useless.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister has been told by the veterinary profession that this is necessary, I agree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the big factories of which I was not thinking this problem <Col N="343" /> does not arise so much.  I have been through some of the big bacon factories here and have seen the processes carried out.  I witnessed the rate at which pigs are killed.  In a few minutes after they are killed they are disembowelled.  In a case like that the veterinary inspectors would be kept busy going backwards and forwards day after day. The position would be quite different in a small factory where they have only one or two men on the job.  It would be a very serious matter for them if they were held up in the work.  The veterinary inspector may come along in the morning and see the live pigs, but as he may have to go away and undertake other work elsewhere there may be a hold up in the work going on in the factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>

      <P>I move amendment 25:</P>
      <P>In page 22, Section 38 (10), to delete paragraph (c) and substitute the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c)  pork exported into Northern Ireland in one lot or consignment to which none of the marks prescribed by the regulations for the marking of fresh meat are applied and which does not exceed in total gross weight two tons and of which not more than eight carcases belong to any one person, or.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An amendment of this kind is necessary as long as there is a trade in pork between the farmers of the Free State and their markets in Northern Ireland.  It is the custom in the north to kill pigs at home and to deliver the carcases in the markets in the form of pork.  If this <Col N="345" /> exception were not made, farmers taking out a number of carcases and crossing the Border to reach their usual market would become subject to the regulations made under this Act.  That was never intended.  It is absolutely necessary to allow that trade to go on.  Anything contained in this Bill is not for the purpose of regulating trade between north and south.  An amendment of this sort is absolutely essential in the interests of farmers on both sides of the Border.  We are only concerned, of course, in the farmers on our side to see that this trade goes on.  This amendment will allow a total gross weight of two tons and of not more than eight carcases to be exported across the Border without the necessity of compliance with any of the regulations contained in this Act. The custom in the north is for five or six farmers to join together and hire a two-ton lorry to take carcases to the market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 26:</P>
      <P>In page 23, line 6, to add at the end of Section 38 (10) a new paragraph after paragraph (f), as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;offals or plucks from pigs slaughtered for bacon, when such offals or plucks are the only parts of such pigs intended for export as fresh meat.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of one bacon factory <Col N="346" />&mdash;I do not know whether this applies to others or not&mdash;which exports all its offals and plucks, they state that this is really the only profit they have on the business.  They state that as regards the bacon cured for home consumption they have no market at home for the offals and plucks.  They export them all to cities in England.  The average price they get for them is from 2/6 to 3/-.  They say that what they make on them provides their entire profit on these pigs.  Of course that would not be a bad profit if they could get it all the time.  If they were to be compelled to pay an inspection fee of three-pence it would be a very serious matter for them.  It would represent a charge of 10 per cent. on their exports under that head.  If it is not possible to exempt them from a fee, I think the matter might be dealt with by charging them so much per hundred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite impossible to exempt them, for one of the purposes of the Bill is the control of the export of offals.  If the amendment were accepted offals would be excluded from the whole Bill, and that would vitiate the Bill.  In the case of a number of the bigger factories in the country who make their pigs into bacon and export the offals no objection was made to this.</P>

As a matter of fact there is no maximum or minimum fee anywhere except here, where the Minister apparently has a host of those vets. he wants to let loose and to pay.

We will have small factories here, there, and elsewhere, which it would be quite difficult to inspect, and for their inspection it would be necessary to employ more vets. than would be the case if the minimum fee remained.

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the proposal, I take it that there is, generally speaking, leave to introduce amendments on the Report Stage.  What has happened with this Bill is that it has been re-committed twice and there has been a long interval between the two Stages.  That was agreed upon between myself and the Deputies opposite.  Nobody can say there has not been ample opportunity for putting down amendments and discussing every section of the Bill.  Is there any sense in coming along again on Report Stage and repeating that performance? Because if there is, there is no meaning at all in giving long intervals between the two Stages of Bills in future.  It seems to me, if a performance like that is to be repeated, that it is not business, <Col N="355" /> having regard to the history of the Bill.  The fact that it was re-committed and that there were long intervals and every opportunity given for putting down amendments should prevent the re-opening of the same discussion on Report and introducing other amendments.  To do this would be only reducing Parliamentary procedure to an absolute farce.  It merely means that you will be faced with new difficulties. That will make it quite impossible in the future for me to meet the wishes of the Deputies opposite in a similar case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, if I may, with the permission of the Chair to reply to the Minister.  I would say that the fact is that this is a very complicated Bill.  The fact that the Minister's officials have mastered all the details of the Bill is no argument. There is no reason, until the House as a whole understands the Bill, why it should not be kept here, and kept until every Deputy who takes an interest in the Bill will know and understand how it affects the industry.  The Minister says that it has been discussed twice.  It has been discussed twice but the points that were put forward here have not been met at all.  The Minister has made no effort to meet the people who have put up objections to the taxation which it is proposed to put on this industry.  I was greatly surprised to hear the Minister say that he had reached the limit in his concessions, having given away nothing as the Ministers usually do.  Surely the Minister should be reasonable&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have accepted fifty amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The very fact that this matter has been discussed twice shows that it has penetrated the intelligence of Deputies to some extent.  The Minister, who has mastered the Bill thoroughly, has made no effort to meet the views of Deputies.  On this big question of fees, he has made no effort at all to <Col N="356" /> meet the views of Deputies.  If the Minister can make up his mind to meet some of the Deputies during the week-end and discuss the matter with them, perhaps it would be possible to reach some understanding on this matter of fees.</P>
      <P>It is a fact that the Minister knows what the veterinary profession think, what the bacon curers think, and what the farmers think, but we have an idea that they do not think all these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>You got ample opportunity of saying that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I am saying it again.  The Minister has not given a fair opportunity to have this matter discussed.  The very fact that this Bill has been set out in this complicated way and that the Minister is able to bring forward an amendment at this stage which puts Deputy Dr. Ryan and Deputy O'Hanlon at a distinct disadvantage, and also the fact that the whole of the Schedule has to be taken when the rest of the Bill has been passed place the Opposition under a distinct disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the question of order, it has been found useful in the case of a Bill of this nature, where there is agreement on principle, disagreement on details and some complication, to have a second Committee Stage. that is, to do what we have now done, namely, to consider amendments on Report in Committee.  As to whether that process can be brought to a conclusion the answer is that under Standing Orders an amendment which has been proposed and defeated in Committee cannot again be proposed.  What generally happens is that further amendments proposed at this kind of stage are amendments which, owing to the complicated nature of the Bill, could not be proposed now, amendments which are left over for some reason or which bear on points that have not been specifically decided at this second Committee <Col N="357" /> Stage.  That kind of amendment would not only be in order but would be in accordance with the general idea we are following. From the point of view of order you could go further than that.  You could propose an amendment on Report in the ordinary way.  The amendment, if in accordance with the general agreement, should be the kind of amendment that it was not possible to propose at this stage, either owing to the rules of order or to the nature of the Bill or to both combined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not put the Schedule yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Before you put the Schedule I wish to oppose it.  I do so, in the first place, because, as I have just said, the Minister has not made any concessions.  He has only two arguments in favour of the Bill. His first argument is that the charges in Holland are higher, but he has not answered Deputy Corry's point in regard to the minimum fee in Holland.  It remains for the Minister to prove that in fact the Dutch farmer is paying less than the Irish farmer.  I would remind the House that the Dutch or Danish farmer, or any other person engaged in a foreign industry, is in a different position to those who are engaged in the Irish pork industry. The Minister admitted on Second Reading that we were only building up this industry which had, more or less, fallen into our hands through circumstances over which we have no control, and if those circumstances should change to our disadvantage the whole pork industry of the country might disintegrate. The Minister thinks that this Bill and this Schedule will improve that industry.  We think that there is reasonable ground for assuming, since business men everywhere have always protested against State interference with business, that this is going to impede business, apart from the tax which it imposes on the <Col N="358" /> producer, because it is the farmer who will have to pay in the long run.  People who are running factories will get disgusted with veterinary inspection because the inspectors will be able to assert themselves and say that they have the law behind them in matters where personal tact and discretion would overcome a lot of difficulties. I am sorry to say that people who engaged in similar industries in the past did not find that tact and discretion. In that connection you have the Customs Department, the Eggs Department and the Dairy Department about which people complain, rightly or wrongly&mdash;and the Minister cannot argue that right is on his side all the time&mdash;that officials have been somewhat overbearing.  The Minister stated previously that we must not interfere with people engaged in the industry and that we must let them carry on their work. What is the use of saying that when you have all the paraphernalia of inspection and registration to interfere with them?  As Deputy Dr. Ryan says, it must interfere with them unless you are going to keep the veterinary surgeons in small factories all day, and that means that you are going to pay them.  I say that this is a weak industry and that this is not the proper way to build it up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's attitude should be to spend public money in helping to equip these factories and in helping them to get the necessary initiative, the necessary up-to-dateness, and to get them to do things off their own bat without compulsion and to see that it is the best and most profitable thing for them to do commercially. Instead of that you take industry by the scruff of the neck and say: &ldquo;You are not making enough of this; you are a lot of rogues.&rdquo; There are, of course, rogues in every industry and if they were not rogues they might not be able to carry on at all in these hard times.  The Minister takes them by the scruff of the neck and says:&mdash;&ldquo;I am going to make you honest whether you like it or not and whether it pays <Col N="359" /> you or not.  I am showing you the way to build up this industry and I am going to see that our friends across-Channel have no complaints to make.&rdquo;  When the Minister tells us that those in the industry have no objection he is really trying to impose a little too much on our credulity.  I suggest that he should leave these regulations and restrictions in abeyance and concentrate on the technical side and get people to do things of their own volition as otherwise the industry will hardly survive.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is in earnest, I submit that this assembly is not entitled to place suddenly a crushing burden on this industry and then turn round and say: &ldquo;If you do not pay it, the taxpayers will pay it.&rdquo; Remember we are going to pass legislation which will involve interference and disturbance in this industry and then the Minister will turn round and ask these men to pay for what they may not consider to be an advantage but what the Minister considers may be an advantage in the future.  That is very problematical. I submit that the Minister should revise his attitude and make a serious effort to reduce the fee to something nominal.  If he finds at the end of a year or so that the cost of administration is out of all proportion, then let him come along to the House and seek further powers, but suddenly to place the entire onus on the industry is not fair and is not going to benefit it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support Deputy Derrig's contention.  I think the Minister should in all honesty, instead of charging a fee, give those engaged in the trade a bonus.  He will then be doing what has been done in other countries, in the case of German oats for instance.  Instead of charging the industry with the cost of all these vets., I think it should be a Departmental charge. He will then give the industry a chance to get on its feet.  He knows very well that the present scheme is going to kill the industry.  He told us that he has met pork exporters <Col N="360" /> and others.  My information has been obtained from one Cork exporter who is exporting more than all the rest put together, and I know he has not met that man.  I would honestly say that this Bill will kill the industry. The Minister knows that if he is going to shove these vets. into the factories, and if the proprietors want to slaughter pigs at a certain hour the vet. will come along and say: &ldquo;You cannot slaughter these pigs until three o'clock.  I have to be in such a place at such an hour, and the pigs cannot be slaughtered till I come back.&rdquo;  The result may be that the proprietors may miss the boat.  Such things will happen if the Minister is going to allow this army of vets. loose on the industry.  They are going to kill the Department and kill the farmers.  My attention has been called to the probability that these vets. will not convenience the pork exporters.  You may have five or six survive in spite of the Minister, but they will find it difficult to carry on. I think that the whole Schedule should be deleted, and that instead of putting a charge on the industry which will kill it, you should give these men a bonus which will eventually go back to the farmers.</P>

      <P>I pay no attention to what has been said by Deputy Derrig.  He says now, &ldquo;Let business alone, do not interfere.&rdquo;  That is complete laissez faire.  He belongs to a Party who advocate a Control Board for wheat, compulsory admixture of grain and State regulation for everything, but when it comes to this Bill, because I say that certain factories have to be controlled, he says: &ldquo;Oh, no; let business alone; let there be no State interference.&rdquo; It is merely a question of his saying &ldquo;No&rdquo; when I say &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  I do not pay any attention whatever to his statements.</P>

      <P>We would like the Minister to withdraw the second section of the Schedule of his own volition.  The Minister will remember that recently he expressed his disapproval of the large number of tariffs which were imposed on farmers. This Schedule in effect will impose an export tax on what the farmers have to sell.  That is not in keeping with the policy which the Government has adopted in regard to other industries.  They have put an import tax on foreign goods to help the Irish producer to produce goods which we have imported up to now.  The Minister knows perfectly well that whatever fees are paid by bacon curers and meat exporters are bound in the long run to be taken from the farmers.  These exporters will not continue business unless they are able to pay these fees and make a profit.  The farmer will get a less price for his meat or pork <Col N="362" /> in proportion to the amount that the meat exporter has to pay to the Government. Instead of having an export tax on Irish goods, such as this is, we should, as Deputy Corry says, give a bounty if necessary to Irish exporters.  It is particularly necessary, if we are not able to give a bounty that we should not, at least, impose any burden on industries which give employment in this country, and the extension of the dead meat trade will certainly give employment.  I hope that between now and the Report Stage the Minister will at least withdraw Section 2 of the Schedule.  If the Minister wants funds to recoup the Government for any expense they might incur in the running of this Bill when it becomes an Act, they could very well recoup themselves by having an export tax on live animals instead of on dead animals.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That it is the opinion of the Dáil that proposals for legislation should be introduced by the Executive Council to provide:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  for the establishment of a Wheat Control Board, which shall be a Limited Liability Company, charged with the purchase of imported wheat for re-sale to millers and the fixing of a minimum price to be paid by Saorstát millers for home-grown wheat sold to them for milling purposes</P>
    <P>(b)  for the prohibition of the importation of wheat by any person other than the Wheat Control Board and such persons as may be authorised by the Board;</P>
    <P>(c)  for the payment by the Board to Saorstát millers of such sums as may be necessary to make good the difference between the price paid by the millers for home-grown wheat and its market value, compared with the Pacific wheat, taking into account its higher moisture content;</P>
    <P>(d)  that the Minister for Finance be authorised to subscribe to the capital of the company, and to make good any losses incurred by the company in the administration of the scheme, out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas;</P>
    <P>(e)  that the importation of flour be permitted only under licence issued by the Wheat Control Board, and subject to an import duty; provided that there shall be no restrictions on flour imported for biscuit manufacture.&rdquo;&mdash;(Dr. Ryan).</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point I want to refer to with reference to what the Minister said about the rotation of crops.  In his speech he <Col N="365" /> says: &ldquo;I say that the farmer who sows wheat after another grain crop is ruining his land and knows nothing about his business.&rdquo;  In the majority report of the Economic Committee it is stated: &ldquo;The growing of wheat on lea land which it is possible to prepare for sowing a corn crop at a time when the state of the soil would not permit of working potato or root land is not attended with success, save in the case of land which has been under grass for one year only.&rdquo;  I would like the Minister to examine that question.  Wheat is grown on land that is under grass for one year.  The following year it will be under corn, and the next year under hayseed; the next year, according to him, wheat will grow very well on it.</P>
      <P>I think that bears out our contention that there is other land besides potato land and manured land fit to grow wheat, and his unsupported theory breaks down that wheat will not grow on other land than potato and manured land.  I have seen very good crops of wheat on lea stubble. They have been always successful if properly manured.  Also wheat will grow on lea land.</P>
      <P>Spring wheat will not, but winter wheat will if sown at the proper time.  If the Minister goes down the country I can show him several fields of lea land sown in November last year.  So I think his contention that wheat can be successful on no kind of land except manured land is not right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that we are coming to the end of a very long debate on this wheat question, which has been before us for the last three or four months.  Questions have arisen, and if I felt it incumbent on me to meet all the arguments put up against the growing of wheat in this country it would take another two or three months before the debate would be over.  If I had time to put one argument against another as to the growing of wheat, that is the arguments used by one Opposition speaker as against the arguments used by another, we would find that <Col N="366" /> practically all the arguments used would be neutralised.  It appears as if any speaker could get up against this wheat motion and use any argument that occurred to him, whether it was in direct opposition to some similar argument used or not.  It was all right as long as it was an argument that could possibly be put down as against the growing of wheat. There were certain currents going through all this debate which arose out of entire misrepresentation, and I would like to deal with some of these misrepresentations.  First, we were accused by the Minister for Agriculture of saying that wheat is the least exhausting of all crops.  I would like to find out for certain.  I think Deputy Brennan, of Roscommon, supported the Minister for Agriculture in that.  I would like to give you the exact words used in that matter of wheat being the least exhausting of all crops.  I am quoting from the Official Report, column 548, of my own speech on 30th October. I quoted the correspondent of some English paper&mdash;I forget which one it was&mdash;who had been to the Continent and saw wheat growing there.  He gave it as his opinion that wheat was not an exhausting crop, and I summed it up at the end by saying that we must leave it a disputed question whether it was an exhausting crop or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, in quoting me, said that he had learned from me that it was the least exhausting of all crops.  What I said was that that was a disputed question. Speakers against the motion went on from that and built their arguments on what the Minister for Agriculture had said with regard to wheat being the least exhausting of all crops.  The Minister said that he had learned from me that wheat cleans land more than any other crop.  What I said was that that may be the case in some parts of the country, but in the counties with which I am intimately connected, as far as agriculture is concerned&mdash; Wicklow and Wexford&mdash;I have seen no wheat patch more foul with weeds than a patch of oats or barley.  My <Col N="367" /> experience may be limited but I give it for what it is worth.  The Minister for Agriculture interpreted that as learning from me that it cleans ground more than any other crop. He said that he learned from me that it was an ideal nurse crop for grass.  I think that is clearly a point that can be discussed more than any other as to what we mean by a nurse crop.  In introducing the motion I said that it was considered by the farmers of Co. Wicklow as good a nurse crop as any other.  In interpreting that the Minister said that I had stated that it was an ideal nurse crop for grass.  The Minister also said that he had learned from me that the ideal way to sow wheat was after oats or barley. I do not know that I actually said that.  What I believe I said was that if we were to pay any attention to the witnesses called before us at the Economic Committee that view was not only contradicted but at least one county inspector said he had seen wheat grow two years in succession not only after oats and barley but grown on some lea land in counties Tipperary and Waterford.  The Minister for Agriculture interpreted that as if I had said that the ideal way to sow wheat was after oats and barley.  Another statement he made was that wheat suits a wider variety of soil than any other crop.  When discussing the point raised in the majority report I said that you must have land suitable for wheat.  I said that applies also to other crops.  You must have land suitable for the crop but certainly that argument could be brought forward with much more force against potatoes and barley rather than wheat.</P>
    <P>So many arguments have been raised against the growing of wheat that it would take an enormous amount of time to reply to them.  I only intend to refer to some of what I think were considered by the people who used them as reasonable arguments.  When speaking against this motion Deputy Heffernan argued that the growing of wheat did not necessarily give a large amount <Col N="368" /> of employment.  In order to prove his argument he proceeded to quote the minority report of the Economic Committee.  In column 1232 he went so far as to quote the following from that report: &ldquo;We do not claim that it would result in a great increase in the number of persons employed in agriculture.&rdquo;  That was a very telling argument against those of us who had signed the minority report but we asked Deputy Heffernan to proceed to read the context. He did not do so.</P>
    <P>I would like to take the opportunity now of reading the next sentence and to ask if it does not put an entirely different complexion on the views we expressed in the minority report.  The report said: &ldquo;We do not claim that it would result in a great increase in the number of persons employed in agriculture.&rdquo; The Deputy then stopped although there was no full stop.  You could excuse a person for reading one sentence and not reading another, but it is inexcusable for a man to stop in the middle of a sentence. &ldquo;Its main direct effect on employment would rather be to employ more fully the persons at present engaged in the industry and help to retain them on the land.&rdquo;  Any reasonable person will agree that it is necessary to do something to retain the people on the land, because there is considerable migration from it.</P>
    <P>Some other speakers used similar tactics against the motion, by reading part of a sentence from the minority report.  In column 1247 Deputy Brennan for instance was pointing out the inconsistency in our arguments. He said that in the minority report we pointed out the ill-effects of a tariff, while in the motion we advocated a tariff.  That was fairly well brought out during the debate, when it was pointed out to Deputy Brennan that we deprecated a tariff on wheat, but favoured a tariff on flour.  That is a matter evidently that did not occur to Deputy Brennan until it was pointed out to him.</P>
    <P>One of the most important arguments advanced against this motion <Col N="369" /> was with regard to the subsidy.  We have been asked by various speakers why we want a subsidy for the growing of wheat, and various arguments have been used against it. The major argument of the Minister for Agriculture against the motion was that the subsidy would have to be paid, and paid out of public funds.  The Minister did not agree that a subsidy should be paid for the growing of wheat.  I cannot see why there should be such objection, other things being favourable, to a subsidy being used for production of this sort.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall come to these things afterwards.  There is no objection from the Government Benches to subsidise unemployment to the amount of £335,000 per year, as we have it in the Estimates.  The motion asks that the growing of wheat should be subsidised.  The majority on the Economic Committee estimated that subsidy as something like £1,000,000 per year, under the most unfavourable conditions, namely if foreign wheat came down in price, and the farmers should refuse to grow wheat unless they got an exorbitant price.  We estimated the subsidy would not amount to more than a quarter of a million per year, provided foreign wheat remains at the price it was last year, and that the farmers would grow wheat at 30/- per barrel.  At any rate, the subsidy would be somewhere between a quarter of a million and one million per year.  That was agreed to by everybody on the Economic Committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot allow that to pass.  If anything was agreed, it was agreed that it would be impossible to say what subsidy would be required to give anything like half the acreage required, and when an <Col N="370" /> inspector was asked what would get the whole acreage he said &ldquo;the gun.&rdquo;  That was the only evidence given on the question.  It certainly was not agreed that anything like the whole acreage would be got for £1,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the most unfavourable circumstances here, the Majority Report put down 32/6 per barrel as the price at which farmers would grow wheat.  Taking it that foreign wheat would be reduced in price to 27/6 or 28/-, the total amount required would be £935,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Majority Report does not state anywhere that you can get anything like the whole area for 32/6.  You could not get the whole area for 40/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the majority did not believe that you could get the whole amount of wheat grown at any price.  At any rate, if it were not grown, there would be no subsidy. If it were grown, according to the Majority Report, it would cost £935,000 and, according to the Minority Report, it would cost a quarter of a million.  Leaving out the question as to whether farmers might refuse to grow wheat at any price, if it were grown, it would cost somewhere between a quarter of a million and £1,000,000.  For that subsidy, according to the figures supplied by the Department of Agriculture, on the labour costs&mdash;wages paid and everything else&mdash;we would have at least £2,000,000 distributed in wages.  I want to be clear on this, because some people do not seem to understand what is meant; whether it is to be paid to the labouring man or the working farmer does not matter, but £2,000,000 would be distributed in wages.  The £7,000,000, which includes this £2,000,000, which we are sending out at present for wheat and flour, would be kept at home and, as Deputy Derrig pointed out, it would be circulated within this country and give a very necessary fillip to industry of every sort. Against that, the Government are prepared to pay out £335,000 per year for unemployment.  We do not <Col N="371" /> say that it is wrong to give men what will keep them alive, or give them a bare existence, while they have no work to do.  But, would it not be better to consider subsidies of this sort for production, try to absorb some of those unemployed, and thus reduce the amount paid in unemployment benefit and increase the amount paid for production?  It may be argued that those who are drawing unemployment benefit would not be concerned in this, because agricultural labourers do not come under the unemployment scheme.  As against that, I may say that I have had at various times in the last three or four years men working for me at farm work who, at other times of the year, were drawing unemployment benefit, because they might get a few weeks' or months' work as builders' labourers, or working on roads, which would qualify them for unemployment benefit.  At any rate, there are certain men drawing unemployment benefit who are barely able to live, if they are able to live, on what they are getting, who would be very glad to get work of a productive nature such as this if the Government would only change their policy and subsidise production instead of unemployment.</P>
      <P>There are other figures which could be quoted to show that the Government have not the slightest hesitation about paying huge subsidies&mdash;for instance, in army pensions and other things.  Only last Wednesday, we had the Government forcing the House to pass a Vote of £3,000 to subsidise a few hotels and motor dealers in their business, while they refuse to subsidise a genuine and healthy industry, such as the growing of wheat.  The Minister for Agriculture has said now that if everything else was all right he would not be against the subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>He asked why should we subsidise wheat?  Why should we not subsidise a crop that would pay better than wheat?  He went on to say that practically every crop would <Col N="372" /> pay the farmer better; that oats, barley, potatoes, etc., were paying the farmer better than wheat, as was evidenced by the number of acres under these crops.  Again, taking the theoretical side of it, the figures supplied by the Department of Agriculture show that there is a bigger profit on the growing of wheat than from oats or barley as a cash crop. It is true that there is a bigger acreage under oats and barley.  But the circumstances of all these things must be taken into account.  Far the bigger proportion of oats grown is grown for consumption on the farm. A proportion of it, of course, is grown as a cash crop.  There may be various reasons for that.  Some farmers prefer to sow corn in the spring rather than in the autumn, and, therefore, oats is more suitable for them than wheat.  Some may have land more suitable for oats and wheat, and some may have other reasons.  There are various other reasons that could be given as to why they grow oats in preference to wheat.  The acreage of barley, however, has gone down.  Thirty or forty years ago it was very high when the brewing industry was at its height in this country, and when the farmers who grew barley were able to get a ready market for it.  It is possible&mdash;I do not know if there is anything in this argument&mdash;that with the growth of the brewing industry the farmers turned from wheat to barley, and now that the conditions are different they are turning from barley mostly to grass and not to tillage crops.  The figures supplied to us by the Department of Agriculture, obtained from the experience of a number of years in the growing of wheat, barley and oats prove that as a cash crop wheat is superior to oats or barley.  But one of the biggest difficulties about wheat, as a cash crop, is that it is practically impossible to get a market for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Deputy on these benches grew wheat last year as a cash crop.  I myself bought some of that wheat from him, and I know it was only in the last week that he succeded in selling the remainder of that <Col N="373" /> wheat at 25/- a barrel&mdash;that is 10/- per cwt.  Now, that Deputy had a yield of two tons of wheat per statute acre.  It was a remarkably good crop.  We do not say that that was anything like an average crop. But selling it even at 25/- per barrel, and selling the straw, he realised £111 7s. 6d. on four statute acres.  I say that is not an average crop, and the price was only 25/- a barrel.  The yield in his case was extraordinary, and we could not base our calculations upon that, but when Deputy Brennan tells us about a patch he sowed, and assures us that if we saw it we would never talk about wheat-growing again, are we not entitled to quote the instance of an extraordinarily good crop as against Deputy Brennan's failure, putting one against the other, and take the average crop again.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, in speaking against this motion, said he was not impressed by the argument that we should stop imports amounting to £7,000,000.  He said he would be more impressed by increased imports and exports provided you got increased production. No one is going to object to that argument as to increased production, and it is because we believe by growing our own wheat we would be making for increased production that we have put down this motion. We believe that it is possible to produce what we require.  It would require 860,000 acres of land but would not decrease any of our present production in any way.  No one will say our land is so well cared for and managed that it is quite incapable of producing another ounce.  It is capable of producing twice as much as it produces at present.  Our opponents say if that is so, produce more butter, eggs, bacon and beef, and send them to the British market.  We say it is safer, if you want more production, to produce for our own market.  We can control our own market.  We have power to deal with Customs and Excise as we think fit, and we can reserve the whole home market for our own wheat and flour.  But if we increase our exports of butter we have no <Col N="374" /> control, only open competition in the British market.  We do not know but that the people in New Zealand or in Denmark may at the same time decide to increase their exports of butter to the British market, and then there would be a fall in prices, and we would have to look for alternative markets where we might find the same conditions. If it was our own market we have nothing to fear.</P>
    <P>The only safe way, therefore, to increase production&mdash;you cannot get producers to produce unless they have a market&mdash;is to secure our home market and, therefore, if there is to be an increase in production it should be on the lines of some article that we produce for ourselves but which we are not producing at the present time.  We might say that the land is capable of carrying twice or three times the amount of livestock it is carrying at present.  There is no doubt that farms, in certain areas, if properly manured, are capable of carrying twice or three times as much stock.  But we never know when we may be told from the British side that there is foot-and-mouth disease, that they cannot take our cattle and, then, we will have to keep them until we get an alternative market or until Britain lets them go in again.  We may increase the production of bacon and pork, but then we may have an ultimatum from the British market to say that foot-and-mouth disease has been carried in in the packing, as they said to Holland, and we would have to shut down that particular trade.  The same would apply to any other exports. But if we were producing for our own home market we would be in the position then to say to the Argentine, or to Russia, or to anywhere else, &ldquo;We do not want any more from you; we can grow our own wheat.&rdquo;  They would have no redress against that.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in speaking about the distribution of the wheat areas, said that whatever experts in the Dáil might say wheat cannot be produced in the poorer counties.  I merely mention that in order to say that so far as I know there is no expert <Col N="375" /> in the Dáil who said that except on the authority of an expert who was trained under the Department of Agriculture.  Mr. Caffrey, who is now a lecturer in the National University, said that the new variety of Red Stettin greatly impressed, and, judging from its appearance, was very likely to solve the problem of winter wheat varieties best suited to our climate, soil and conditions.  He said, later on, &ldquo;Some millers have stated that this wheat is worth from five to six shillings per barrel more than ordinary wheats grown in Ireland.  The best sample of wheat grown in Ireland was grown last year, and some of the best lots came from Kerry and Clare.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that it would be better for us to devote our energies and our arguments towards inducing farmers in general to follow the example of the minority of farmers who are producing their own feeding stuffs, feeding them to their own stock, and are doing well as a result.  I agree that the farmers who are doing that are doing well, but it is because they can afford to do it that they are doing well.  The Minister says that the farmers who are not doing that at present should be induced to till more.  That is a thing we would welcome on this side.  The big majority of farmers are not doing that at present.  If proposals were introduced by the Minister to induce them to till more, to produce more of their own feeding stuffs, and feed them to the stock on their own farms.  I believe such proposals would meet with the unanimous approval of the House.</P>
    <P>On the question as to whether wheat is a more suitable crop to subsidise than barley, oats, or beet, the position is that we have not a great choice at the present time.  If we had every man in the country in employment, if we had men, say, working at the growing of potatoes, and that a subsidy were to take them away from that work to the growing of wheat, then, of course, we would have to try to find out which was the more profitable crop <Col N="376" /> for the country.  But, where you have men idle I think any work that you can provide for them, whether it be growing wheat, barley, oats or potatoes, is all to the good.  The price that was mentioned was criticised. We were told it would be impossible to get farmers to grow wheat for 30/- per barrel.  I remind the House of what I said when proposing this motion, that the Minister for Agriculture himself, in 1925, when the cost of farming was higher than it is at present, said that 30/- per barrel was quite sufficient and should induce farmers to grow wheat.  Why they should require more now is rather a puzzle, because the cost of farming in general is lower than it was then.  It is no part of our proposals that the price of home-grown wheat should be 30/- to the farmer.  That was the figure that was suggested as possibly sufficient to get the farmer to grow sufficient wheat.  The Wheat Control Board would be there to deal with the matter of prices.  That Board might not even start at 30/-.  They might start with 27/-, or if they did not think that sufficient, they might go to 28/-, to 30/- or to 32/-.  What I want to make clear is that it is no part of my motion that the price should be 30/-.  The price will be determined by the Wheat Control Board, and determined by experience and experiment.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education pointed out that the subsidy amounted to five shillings per acre. He asked if any sane man believed that farmers who refused to grow wheat at the present time would, if given another five shillings, grow it. I submit that is not a sound argument. The subsidy, according to our calculations, would cost the State five shillings per acre.  A Deputy on these benches sold wheat for 25/- per barrel.  That is 10/- per cwt.  He had two tons of wheat to the acre, that is sixteen barrels.  If that Deputy had got this subsidy he would have received £4 an acre for his wheat, but the cost to the State would only be 10/-.  Part of our scheme is to induce the millers to pay for Irish wheat the equivalent of <Col N="377" /> what they are paying for foreign wheat.  We want to compensate the millers for the extra moisture in home-grown wheat and for the cost of extracting it.  We say to the Irish millers, when you reduce the moisture in Irish wheat from 18 per cent. to 12 per cent., the latter figure being the percentage for foreign wheat, we will pay you the cost of extraction. The Irish wheat will then be as good an article to you as the foreign, and you will have to pay the same for it.  It was on that basis that our calculations were made.  In Deputy Brennan's case he would have got nothing because he had no wheat.  Provided that this motion is passed, and that a number of farmers who do not know anything about the growing of wheat were to start to do so and therefore did not grow it successfully, no subsidy would be paid to them.  It is only the farmers who grow wheat of good milling quality who will get the subsidy.  The State will bear no share of the loss in the case of wheat that is not of good quality.  In the course of the debate we were also told that we had made our calculations on a false basis because we had taken the price of foreign wheat at 31/3.  We were told that the price of foreign wheat had gone down a good deal since.  If anyone looks up figures relating to wheat prices he will see that it is absolutely ridiculous to take the price of wheat at any particular time and base your calculations on that. Our calculations were based on the price of foreign wheat over a period of a year.  To take the price of foreign wheat to-day and to make a calculation on that would be of no use whatever.  In the year 1929, from February to the 1st June, the price of foreign wheat fell by 8/6 per quarter, while from the 1st June to the middle of July it increased by 13/- per quarter.</P>
    <P>At the time the motion was introduced the Minister for Agriculture pointed out the terrible slump there was in the price of foreign wheat.  He accused us of being false prophets when we stated in our report that wheat would probably rise in price.  I do not know if the Minister <Col N="378" /> prophesied that foreign wheat was going to remain down.  I do not think he did.  At any rate it did not. I find in the &ldquo;Evening Herald&rdquo;&mdash;I do not know whether it is reliable or not&mdash;of last Wednesday the following dealing with the Canadian wheat supply.  It is dated from Winnipeg:</P>
    <P>Advices suggesting united action by the Canadian Wheat Pool and the Federal Farm Board of the United States with the object of ensuring the orderly marketing of all wheat from the North American Continent acted as a tonic on the grain exchange here to-day. Prices of export wheat increased by 1½ to 1¾ cents per bushel in spite of the light export demand.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say that there is an agreement in the North American continent to hold up the wheat supply until the price improves.  I believe the buyers in Britain and other places are not buying wheat as they say they have a sufficient supply on hands for three months, so that there is a sort of battle going on between the two.  If the Canadian wheat pool and the Federal Farm Board of the United States were to have a pool with Australia and Russia becomes the only agent of the wheat, if we have a combination of four or five of the largest sellers of wheat in the world, there is not much prospect that wheat is going to fall much lower than at present.  There would be little object in the wheat-growers of Canada, the United States, Australia and Russia organising for any other purpose than the getting of a better price for their wheat.  It is quite likely they will get a better price when they do organise. Deputy Hennessy made a very honest speech against the growing of wheat. He was the only Deputy who spoke against the growing of wheat who favoured grass.  In one of his arguments he said it is quite easy to see that grass seeds develop the first, second, and third year after wheat, in the strip in which the wheat is grown.  He says if you go to a field where wheat, oats and barley have been grown and you look at the meadow you will see where the wheat <Col N="379" /> has been grown.  Deputy Brennan said that if I went down to look at the place where his experiments were carried on I would not come back to the House and repeat my statement &mdash;that wheat is a good nurse crop for grass.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hennessy and Deputy Brennan may be right in their experience, but my experience is not exactly the same.  I experimented on my own farm last year at my own expense.  I sowed barley, oats, wheat and grass seeds, and I defy Deputy Hennessy or Deputy Brennan to come down and show me, except they are told by people with local knowledge, where the wheat was grown.  Why should people who saw Deputy Brennan's patch say they would never grow wheat again? Let them see my patch and they will change their minds, and they might be able to give a little advice to Deputy Brennan.  I had a note here of the Minister's contention that wheat ought not to be sown on lea except after one year's grass.  Deputy Allen has already dealt with that, and I do not want to refer to it again.  The Minister for Education when speaking here said that this proposal of ours was the biggest advance ever made in State control. I do not mind if it is personally.  I have no objection to that.  But I believe the State interfered very much more in their own proposals. For instance, the 1923 Land Act gives them power to take land and to keep it or to do what they like with it.  Taking a farm from a man, even though you are going to pay him for it, is a much more serious thing than compelling a miller to use Irish wheat as well as foreign wheat.</P>

      <P>Several other arguments have been used, but, as I have said already, as regards these one need only put one against the other and they will neutralise each other. A number of speakers said or implied that we were going to cut down the number of livestock, and cut down the exports of butter, eggs, bacon <Col N="380" /> and everything else as the result of getting land under wheat.  On the other hand, Deputy Heffernan said, &ldquo;To say that because one advocates a livestock policy one advocates a decrease of tillage is unsound.&rdquo;  He says that to advocate a livestock policy may not mean a decrease but an increase in tillage.  Surely, taking it vice versa, if you increase tillage you may also increase the number of livestock.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wolfe of Kildare said, there were many unemployed, and I agree with him.  Deputy Haslett said it was impossible to get labour to grow wheat in his part of the country, and that there was great competition amongst the farmers for labour.  If that is so and the farmers of Monaghan are agreeable to grow wheat they will find if they put small advertisements in some of the papers down south that they will have a big migration of labour there in a short time.  Deputy Wolfe also said it was very fallacious to compare our country with others.  The Deputy compared the year 1800 with the year 1929.  Surely it is as fallacious to compare a century ago with the present as to compare the present condition in Canada with Ireland? As a matter of fact the Minister does not agree with Deputy Wolfe. He said: &ldquo;There is no reason why the economic laws which operate in every country in the world should not operate here.&rdquo;  When the Minister was picking holes in our scheme he was quite prepared to say that the economic laws which operate in every country should operate here. Deputy Wolfe is at variance with that, but from a different point of view.</P>

      <P>In regard to what Deputy Ryan has said, what I meant to say was that the conditions under which wheat growing could be carried out in 1800 were different from to-day.  The machinery for doing it was entirely different, and it was easier and more convenient than would be possible to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I misrepresented the Deputy but I did not mean to do so.  I wanted to say that <Col N="381" /> it is as reasonable to compare one country with another as it is to make a comparison between 1800 and the present time.  Deputy Sheehy of Cork was worse.  He went back to Strongbow.  Deputies on the other side said that the subsidy was too low and no one would grow wheat for 30/-.  Others said that if you bring in such a scheme you will have wheat grown to the exclusion of barley and oats.  How can arguments like that be reconciled.  Deputy Bennett said that the surplus of wheat we would be exporting would destroy the whole scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was one little bit of humour in the debate.  Deputy Brennan, the Independent Deputy for Roscommon, said: &ldquo;I was still open to conviction, and I was rather hoping that Deputy Ryan would be able to convince me.&rdquo;  That is Deputy Brennan, the Independent Deputy who voted once out of 500 times against the Government, and that was on the question as to whether snipe should be shot after 15th August instead of after 1st September.  Deputy Bennett said said that he would vote for the motion if item (e) in this proposal were left out.  I think Deputy Bennett, if he had read and studied more carefully the motion down in my name, would agree that it would be better to have item (e) in the motion.  At the same time while giving a subsidy for wheat the Deputy would allow big imports of flour to come in.  He would allow importers to send in all the flour they like.  Certainly, if we were to agree with Deputy Bennett we would find that we would have to withdraw the main motion&mdash;we could not push it any further. Deputy Brennan finds it very hard to understand what we mean by the employment of 27,000 people. Deputy de Valera, speaking on this motion, said that the wages available as a result of it would be £1,999,000. &ldquo;which would provide employment equivalent to the full employment for 27,000 people.&rdquo;  Remember that the word &ldquo;equivalent&rdquo; is there.  We take it for granted <Col N="382" /> that there is a fundamental knowledge of English in this Assembly, whatever may be said about a knowledge of Irish, and if Deputy Brennan does not understand what is meant by &ldquo;equivalent&rdquo; we cannot help it.  Deputy Brennan and the Minister for Education were afraid that if this motion were passed the very thing we look for and hope for would happen&mdash;that small mills would spring up.  If such a thing were to occur, they said they would not be able to compete with the big, efficient foreign millers.  They quoted from the reports of the Tariff Commission on flour in support of their argument.  Do they imagine that big, efficient foreign millers in Liverpool are going to come over here, buy Irish wheat in order to comply with the regulations, and ship it over to Liverpool, mixing 15 per cent. or 20 per cent., or whatever it will be, of this Irish wheat with foreign wheat; make and swear affidavits, and all that sort of thing, setting forth that they have done everything properly; and then, having the wheat milled under those conditions, that they are going to bring back the flour under a high tariff to compete with the small millers here.  If they do all this sort of thing is it possible that the Wheat Control Board would allow them to do them?</P>
    <P>Deputy Heffernan said he did not believe in this motion.  He said that anything that was for the good of the community would benefit the individual. He said if the crop did not pay the individual it would not pay the community.  He said that the sum total of the value of a tariff to the individual was its value to the community.  If that argument were pursued to its logical end it would mean this: that, say, a farmer has one hundred acres of land, he works that land with one man to look after his cattle, and he finds, after paying the wages of that man and paying his rent and rates and other outgoings, that he has made a profit of £250.  If, on the other hand, on this farm he gives employment to five or six men in the tilling of the farm, and if at the end of the year he has <Col N="383" /> made a profit of only £245, then it would be found that in the latter case he is of less use to the community than in the former case.  It would mean that in the latter case he would not be as good a man as he was the previous year, and not as good to the community, even though he has given employment to five or six men.  It is to deal with such a case that we have proposed that this subsidy should be given.  I do not know why Deputy Heffernan or any other Deputy should object to a slight subsidy of this sort, when it would mean a large amount of employment. The Minister for Education said that we were approaching this question from the wrong end. We state that this country must be self-sufficient; therefore, we must produce our own food, therefore we must make the farmers grow wheat. He said that that was the wrong way to approach it.  He said that we should go to the farmers and persuade the farmers to grow more wheat.  Suppose the Minister went to the farmers before the introduction of the last Budget and said to them: &ldquo;Would you like to pay a farthing per pound duty on sugar?&rdquo; and if they said &ldquo;no,&rdquo; then, according to that reasoning, they would stop and they would not put on the farthing per lb. duty on sugar.  Surely, in these matters the first thing to look to is to find whether the thing is for the good of the country, and if the thing is for the good of the country as a whole, let each one bear his share of the burden.</P>
    <P>This is not a motion compelling the farmers to grow wheat.  There is no compulsion in this motion.  We propose to make it worth the farmer's while to grow wheat by giving him this subsidy.  Deputy Connolly started off with the usual Cumann na nGaedheal argument that the farmers know their own business best, and he said that I had no right to tell the farmers what they should do &mdash;to tell them to grow an acre of wheat or to do anything else.  In this motion, we are not compelling the farmers or lecturing the farmers in <Col N="384" /> any way.  This motion was brought in to give a subsidy to the farmers for growing wheat.  There is no compulsion at all.  We are using no force on the farmers in any way.  Deputy Connolly said he was in favour of extra tillage in the country and he said that every time he went out to a meeting he urged the farmers to grow more crops.  He said it was a most ludicrous thing for us to propose that the farmers be given a subsidy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is only to-day that I got a cutting from another English Newspaper, &ldquo;The Daily Express.&rdquo; That paper is advocating that England should do what, strange to say, we are advocating here in this motion,&mdash;that is, that the law should compel the millers of Great Britain <Col N="385" /> to incorporate a certain amount of English wheat in the production of their flour.  That paper says that in Germany fifty per cent. of German wheat is used in the making of their flour, and that in France 92 per cent. of French wheat is used by the millers there.  Now, the &ldquo;Daily Express&rdquo; is advocating that England should make similar laws in the matter of flour milling.  I have hope that if the &ldquo;Daily Express&rdquo; succeeds in this matter and if the English Government pass such legislation for their country that we may get some of the people on the other side to join us in our policy of promoting the growth of Irish wheat.</P>

      <P>I do not think it will have any influence on the Minister whatsoever but it might have some influence with the others.  Has the Minister for Agriculture or has the Department of Agriculture done anything really serious in order to try to get over those big objections that have been raised against this motion? For instance, one of the big objections against the motion was that the land on which wheat is grown is infested with weeds.  Has the Department carried out any experiments to show why it is that weeds do grow in some crops of wheat and not in other crops of wheat.  I know from my own experience, and every practical farmer here will agree with me, that you very often have in a turnip field one row of turnip drills perfectly clean and another row of drills full of weeds.  It has got something to do with a shower of rain&mdash; that is, there may be a shower of rain before the second row of drills was sown.  It takes years of experience to find out all these things.  Has the Department done anything to find out by some means what is the reason why weeds are met with in land where some crops of wheat are grown and why they are not met with in other crops of wheat?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it has not been passed on to the farmers as yet. Another thing that has been spoken about is the difficulty of preparing the land for grass seeds.  Has the Department done anything about that?  Has the Department told the farmers that if they want to grow grass seeds after wheat sown in October or November they must be careful to sow the wheat in a proper season&mdash;not to sow it when the ground is wet and sodden; otherwise it will be impossible to find cover for the grass seeds in April? There may be other things on which the Department might give instructions to the farmers.  Has the Department ever told the farmers anything about the condition in which they should have their ground if they wish to sow grass seeds in spring? Then, there is the question of the exhaustion of the soil.  Has the Department ever taken samples of the soil where wheat has been grown and found out what are the constituents of the soil removed in the growing of the wheat, and what it would cost the farmer to replace these constituents?  Then there is the climatic difficulty about winter sowing of wheat.  There is the very important matter of spring varieties of seed.  Canada has discovered varieties of seed for the northern climate in that country.  These varieties were not known some years ago.  They have been discovered by the carrying out of numberless experiments. Why do we not work and try to get spring varieties of wheat here?  Varieties that might suit our climate might be got in that way.  Our climate ought not to be as unsuitable for wheat-growing as the northern climate of Canada.  I do not know if anything has been done to find out by experiments the best methods as to the cultivation of wheat.  I refer to the policy of ploughing&mdash;whether land should be ploughed three or four weeks before the seed is sown, or whether it should be ploughed only one or two weeks before.  Again, nothing has been done to instruct the farmer as to whether the land in which the wheat is sown should be cultivated <Col N="387" /> very fine or very rough.  Some farmers say that the less the land is worked the better it is for wheat. Others are of opinion that the land should be worked very fine for wheat.  It is impossible for the individual farmer to decide which. Each farmer must take his chance on that.  A farmer finds out, perhaps, after an experience of thirty or forty years' farming, the truth of the matter.</P>
      <P>The Department, however, has not issued instructions or carried out the necessary experiments on this matter. They have not instructed the farmers what is the proper way of treating wheat land, whether it should be rolled or not or what care should be taken of it or whether the manure should be applied in the following spring.  Each farmer has to find out these things for himself.  If he is going to look for experience, it is natural that he will have to pay dearly for that experience.  The biggest arguments used against wheat growing in this country are that there are other factors outside and beside climatic conditions.  The Department is unable to change the climate but certainly they can do much to improve matters in other ways.  They could instruct the farmer as to the best time of sowing and this could be done by carrying out necessary experiments.  The same would apply as to the best kind of seed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="388" /> I do not want to deal at any greater length with this question.  It has been debated in this House for eight days altogether, and every possible argument that could be used against the growing of wheat was used against it.  Every idea that could be used against it was used against it.  Every possible argument has been used also in favour of it.  I do not know whether the case for it was put up as well as that.  In any case it was put up as well as we could, under the circumstances.  All I want to say is that we are only asking for a subsidy for the growing of wheat if grown.  The argument used on the other side is that wheat will not be grown.  Well if the wheat will not be grown then it will not cost the State anything.  We want the State to give a subsidy for wheat growing because we feel that there is need for more production in this country, especially where that production is for the home market. After all, the only sure market for this country is the home market.  I might, in concluding, quote a sentence from a speech of the leader of the Opposition in the Canadian Parliament, which I read some time ago. He said: &ldquo;Canadians must end in the economic slavery that came from being dependent on the people of another land for the very necessaries of life.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Bill was last before the House it was adjourned owing to the absence from the country of the Minister, because it was considered desirable that a statement should be made by him, having regard to the fact that he had some Departmental figures which he wished to examine.  I think Deputy O'Connell expressed the hope that the Minister would prepare a general Bill dealing with several matters in addition to the matters mentioned in this Bill.  I hope the Minister will be able to make some statement to the House now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>A reference has been made back to a previous Committee which dealt with the whole situation in regard to workmen's compensation.  As a result of figures that were published that Committee produced a new report.  That second report is being published, and it should be in the hands of Deputies <Col N="391" /> quite soon.  The report of the Committee has changed the proposals I had in the completed measure, and to a certain extent delayed its introduction. The Bill, however, is prepared as far as the Department is concerned, but it has not yet passed through the Parliamentary draftsman's office, and I cannot promise any date for its introduction.  There is a general Bill on the whole matter, and it will cover the ground much more fully.  I do not promise that the terms are exactly the same as those of Deputy Rice's Bill, and I cannot make any statement as to the date of its introduction, but it is coming.</P>

      <P>If the House is asked to give leave to withdraw the Bill that has been on the Order Paper for the last nine months, I think it <Col N="392" /> should have something more definite than the Minister's statement.  It is many years since the original Committee presented its report.  Apparently the Minister had the draft Bill in his office ever since, and it is now going to be changed on the second report.  Is the second Bill going to be as long in his office as the first one was?</P>

      <P>In a conversation regarding this Bill I said I was willing to wait over until after Deputy Thrift had dealt with his Bill. Deputy Thrift wishes to take his Bill on Wednesday, and I would prefer that the House should adjourn now and take my Bill in its turn after Deputy Thrift's Bill.  If, however, there is any feeling that we should go on now, I am prepared to do so.</P>
