    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether the Departmental Committee which he set up some years ago with the object of effecting economies in administration has completed its labours, and, if not, whether he will state what is the cause of the delay, how many meetings have been held during the last six months, and when he expects that this Committee will issue its report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Committee on Economy in Government Expenditure has not yet completed its labours.  There has been no avoidable delay in the proceedings of the Committee, but, as indicated in the reply to a previous question by the Deputy on the subject, the Committee's task has been one of considerable magnitude.  Fifteen meetings have been held during the last six months.  I am not in a position to say when the Committee is likely to furnish its report.  As stated to the House on more than one occasion, I have in the past been considerably helped by the Committee with its suggestions, and the adoption of these suggestions has naturally deprived that body of a good deal of <Col N="630" /> the material that would normally be incorporated in its report.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether the Tariff Commission have yet held a final public sitting on the application made on behalf of the coach building industry for a customs duty on imported coach bodies, and whether having regard to the continued importation of such and the consequent threatened closing of coach building firms in the Saorstát he will take steps to expedite the issue of the final report.</P>

      <P>The final public sitting of the Tariff Commission in connection with the application to which the Deputy refers has been held.  At this sitting the applicants concluded their case and the Commissioners are now proceeding with the preparation of their report, which will be completed as expeditiously as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. R. Briscoe Mr. R. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if when fixing the fee of one shilling per 100 feet for the censoring of films the undertaking was given by his Department to the Film Renters' Association to the effect that the Film Censor's Department was to be self-supporting out of such fees, and that any surplus would be surrendered to the Film Renters' Association for division pro rata to the film renters from whom such fees were collected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney) James Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>No undertaking was given by my Department to the effect that the Film Censor's Office was to be self-supporting and that any surplus would be surrendered to the Film Renters' Association.  The position is that Section 11 of the Censorship of Films Act, 1923, provides that the fees to be charged under the Act shall be arranged from time to time so as to produce as nearly as may be an annual sum sufficient to discharge the salaries and other expenses incidental to the working of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the fees now charged produce about twice as much as is required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>No, nothing like twice as much.  Last year there was a surplus of £169.  The Deputy will also understand that very heavy expenses are now being incurred by the Films Board because an apparatus to deal with &ldquo;talkies&rdquo; has to be put in, and it is quite possible that the existing fees will have to be raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the year previous to last year there was a surplus of about £1,400?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not a surplus.  There was an accumulated surplus.  In 1924-5 there was a very large surplus, and then the rent was reduced.  From that time onwards the surpluses have not been so large.  The Deputy is correct in stating that the accumulated surpluses from the beginning had <Col N="634" /> reached close on the sum he mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>If at any time the surplus shows signs of increasing, would the Minister reconsider the point of the film renters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, if it became obvious that the sums charged were more than necessary they would have to be cut down, but the Deputy, I am sure, will agree that it is necessary to have a certain little sum laid aside for contingencies and to replace anything that might go wrong in the apparatus or that kind of thing.  Wear and tear and all that must be taken into account.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the almost complete disbandment of orchestras attached to cinemas in Dublin as the result of the vitaphone and the use of &ldquo;canned&rdquo; music; if he is prepared, in the interests of the cultivation of music and the relief of unemployment amongst musicians, to review the licences of all cinemas which have dispensed with the services of their orchestras, and, if necessary, to effect those objects, whether he is prepared to introduce proposals for legislation into the Dáil.</P>

      <P>An appeal was decided in this case on the 8th March, 1930.  It was determined that the claimant was not entitled to a pension under the Blind Persons Act, 1920, as it was not clear on the evidence submitted that the claimant was blind within the meaning of the Act.  The evidence included a medical certificate dated 9th December, 1929, stating that the degree of vision possessed by the claimant with the assistance of glasses was 6/18th.  This is in excess of the standard which would permit of the allowance of a pension.  A certificate was not received from any other doctor in connection with the appeal.  Having determined the appeal, I have now no further functions in relation to the case.</P>

There will be but a small number remaining to be heard on the 17th April, but they will include a number <Col N="645" /> of cases in which counsel will undoubtedly appear, and a considerable time will be occupied.

In every normal country an attempt is made by the chief parties to arrive at some sort of a common understanding of differences.  There is a good example of that to be had from the Naval Conference sitting in London.  Discussions over different matters there led to a private conference between the members.  I do not suggest that any arrangement of that sort would be possible in this country, but at least in public we should try to understand each other's point of view, in order to be able to get the best possible advantages for the nation out of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to deal with this Estimate in a small or a higgling way or as a captious critic, but rather as one who would look at the Estimate and agree to give the Government the benefit of the doubt; even to suggest that from their point of view, judging by their activities, they have done as much as could be expected of them.  One must deal with the matter largely from the point of view of a question of policy and not of detail.  One must deal with it, not from the point of whether we should have one consul here or whether there is too much expenditure on minor details, but from the point as to whether the Government is doing the best it can.  I have no doubt there will be a fundamental difference in the points of view expressed here. We happen to be among the nations &mdash;at least fifty per cent. of the nations in Europe&mdash;that want a revision of Treaties, and it does not matter whether it is the Versailles Treaty, the Treaty of Trianon or the Anglo-Irish Treaty.  We, the Fianna Fáil Party, want a revision of our Treaty, and there is nothing very violent or subversive in that attitude of mind.  We are representatives of the people, and we are taking part in the proceedings in the Dáil in so far as it represents the people, and we want to use it to the best advantage for the achievement of complete freedom for the country.  It is the normal thing in Europe that a <Col N="648" /> nation should move towards securing a revision of Treaties wherever a revision is considered necessary.  It is really here lies the difference between the two parties.  The Government does not take that point of view.  They accept things as they are.  They accept the Treaty as the basis beyond which they cannot go. Our attitude is clearly different to that, and it becomes our duty in this debate to see that our opinion is clearly expressed&mdash;and that we do not agree with the Government in the pursuit of their policy.</P>
    <P>In the discussion on this question last year, when the matter of partition was raised by Deputy O'Kelly, the answer was put forward by Deputy O'Connell that when France lost Alsace-Lorraine the loss of Alsace-Lorraine did not destroy the sovereignty of the French nation. The Minister for External Affairs agreed with that point of view.  Then he moved from that and said that the only criticism that had been made upon the Estimate had been criticism of minor details, that there had been no statement of the case from the point of view of larger policy.  We disagree with that example about France, because it does not complete the picture.  To complete the picture, one would have to suppose that France had been so beaten by Germany in 1870 that not only had it partitioned France to the extent of taking over Alsace-Lorraine, but that also it had imposed upon France the suzerainty of the German Kaiser; and, together with that, that it had provided that in the carrying out of external affairs the credentials of French foreign representatives and the exequaturs of consuls would have to be signed by the Kaiser.</P>

      <P>I am just pursuing the analogy.  Would any sensible person, looking at the matter from outside, say that under those circumstances France had all the attributes of a sovereign independent State?  Again, in relation to the negotiation of treaties, there is a distinction implied in the Report of the Imperial Conference of 1926.  It is there laid down first of all that, just as in matters of defence, so in matters of diplomatic relations, the main functions must rest where they are&mdash; that is, with the British Government.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;We went on to examine the possibility of applying the principles underlying the Treaty resolution of the 1923 Conference to matters arising in the conduct of foreign affairs generally.

      <P>&ldquo;We felt that the governing consideration underlying all discussions of this problem must be that neither Great Britain nor the Dominions could be committed to the acceptance of active obligations except with the definite assent of their own Governments.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is to say, the British Government can take the initiative in agreeing to a treaty, and then get the assent of the Dominions, but I do not see anywhere that any one of the Dominions has the power to take the initiative in making a treaty.

I think it is only right that at every step in this procedure we should emphasise our own point of view in order that the nation may get the best out of it, from the point of view of pro gress towards our independence. The Minister must appreciate that it is of immense assistance to him, in making any effort he wants to make to find in this Dáil a party which represents a very large proportion of the people, and to find in the country a large number of people who continue to demand the sovereign independence of this country. Instead of taking up an attitude which is not in the best temper, he should rather welcome and encourage that attitude of mind.</P>

      <P>I do not want to score points.  I will leave that question over for the time being.  I should like to know, however, if the 1929 Report will in any way affect the credentials to be issued in future. One may say that these are only matters of detail, but it all depends on how one approaches the details. If one approaches them merely from the point of view of being satisfied with the framework of the Treaty as the final aim, it is difficult to take up the attitude of approaching these details in order to get rid of them one by one, in order that finally the sovereignty of the Dáil, in so far as it represents the people, may be brought to harmonise and to be coincident with international sovereignty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are at a phase in international affairs at present.  These phases alternate.  At one period, as is pointed out by Mahan, who was formerly a great authority on sea-power, you have a phase of war, followed by a phase in which each country tries to dominate the whole situation by means of tact, by means <Col N="652" /> of diplomacy, by means of treaties, and, as a colleague says beside me, by means of bluff.  That, again, alternates with preparation for other wars.  Each nation during this phase tries to get the best it can out of the situation.  It tries to get the greatest amount of security out of the situation.  Thus, normally, nations which have the attributes of sovereign independence try to get alliance with other countries which are strong and which will keep them secure.  We see that going on every day at present in the Naval Conference, where France is trying, by alliance, to get the greatest amount of security against her opponents. Likewise, we should look about and see where we can get the greatest strength, so that when times of war come again we shall be in a position of security and safety.</P>
    <P>That is why I feel that alliance with countries like the Dominions, which are very scattered, which are very far away, and which have very little really effective power in time of crisis, cannot give us the same strength as would be given us if we were in a position to enter into treaties on our own initiative, treaties which would protect us and secure our freedom against the only country which ever threatened it&mdash; Great Britain; treaties with such powers as America or France, which would be much closer to us and could afford us much more strength. That is in the natural course of diplomacy, but it is only thought to be something in the nature of rainbow-chasing, because we will not think in terms of the historic Irish nation. In his speech last year the Minister showed that he was quite capable of taking a certain point of view in regard to the historic attitude.  He referred to Owen Roe O'Neill and to the historic efforts towards independence. He showed, at least, that he was aware that that was the historic demand.  There is no reason, therefore, why reasonable Irishmen should not take up the attitude that is most in consonance with the historic one.  We should not look merely within the confines of an Empire which, to say the best of it, <Col N="653" /> is the product of a culture different to ours and which has a different set of traditions.  Would anybody suggest that Norway, Sweden, Denmark or Holland would gain anything by coming into the British Commonwealth of Nations?  The <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of the suggestion is contained in Bernard Shaw's play &ldquo;The Applecart,&rdquo; where, on the suggestion of an Irishman, America is supposed to come inside the circle of the British Empire.  It has only to be stated to see at once the difference between a sovereign independent State and the status of one of the sister nations within the dominions of the Empire.  If anybody, looking back on history, would say that from the point of view of expediency, from the point of view of prudence, it was a wise thing for the Irish people at any stage to have agreed to allow British interference in this country he need only look at the next chapter of Irish history to see the deplorable effects of that policy.  We are entitled to argue from our past history in order to prove that.  Therefore, I conclude by saying that the most prudent and most expedient thing for Irish statesmen to do is to use every effort to get out of this country, north and south, any kind of interference from outside and to establish complete sovereign independence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. T. Sheehy Mr. T. Sheehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Sheehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to remind the House that we are at the parting of the ways.  We have either to uphold the Treaty in all its clauses or to follow Deputy O'Kelly, who told us the other day that we were only a miserable spot on the Atlantic, that we had no status, no hold one way or the other in the world with our friends, and that the safest policy for this nation was to remain isolated and cut away from the world.  That is the policy that was put forward some days ago by Deputy O'Kelly, who would rather have us go back to the Stone Age than to assert the independence and freedom which we have under the Treaty.  I certainly think that there will be very few who will vote for the cutting off of our relations with the Holy See, or with that <Col N="654" /> great Republic of the West which has sent an Ambassador here, knowing well that when they were fighting for liberty a century ago this old nation of ours sent its sons to shed their blood under the star-spangled banner and under the leadership of George Washington, this nation which sent its sons to fight on the heights of Fontenoy to avenge the wrongs done to this country.  According to the programme of the Opposition, we are to turn no more from the ashes, not even to protect that glorious band of missionaries from the Free State who are teaching and spreading the Gospel around the Equator, in darkest Africa, in the jungles of India, those holy priests, sons of St. Patrick, apostles following his example in the plains of China, away in Japan, around the Southern Seas and beneath the Southern Cross.</P>
      <P>In all these countries do they require the countenance of their own great nation behind them?  I appeal to the Dáil to pass this Vote in its entirety.  It is nonsense to say that we have no status as a nation.  We have our representative at the League of Nations, and there he will stay until the last trumpet sounds, showing that, so far as this nation is concerned, the nation which the Opposition are trying to belittle before the world is advancing steadily in influence and power, and is respected from one end of the globe to the other for the manner in which it took up the responsibility of nationhood cast upon it nine years ago.  It is an example to other nations as to how they should grapple this great project, and how the work of Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith has been taken up by a gallant band of young Irishmen, the Executive Council, who, at the imminent risk of their lives, rallied round the cradle of the infant State.</P>
      <P>I was astonished at the meeting of the Dáil on Thursday to find that any Deputy with a spark of patriotism could forget that these young Irishmen stood with their lives in their hands to protect the heritage won for us by Collins and Griffith, and the brave young men of 1916.</P>

      <P>There are a few questions I want to put to the Minister.  He will probably recollect that on the 28th March, 1928, I drew his attention to a Bill passed by the Six-County Parliament, the Unemployment Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 1928.  I would like to point out that Section 7 of that Bill lays down that applicants for unemployment insurance benefit must have been resident in the United Kingdom for a period of three years immediately preceding the date of application for benefit.  The Minister, in reply, told me that the proposal of the Six-County Government appeared to be inconsistent with the International Covenants regarding reciprocal arrangements in respect of unemployment insurance.  I would like to know whether the Minister brought the matter up at Geneva, and, if so, what was the result.  Would he also say what, if any, negotiations took place either at the Imperial or any other conference in regard to the Lough Foyle Fisheries?  Would he also tell us what is the position in regard to reciprocal arrangements as to unemployment insurance between Great Britain and this country?  These are three questions which I trust the Minister will answer in his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be general agreement, I think, in relation to this Estimate that we are dealing with the most unpopular Department of the State.  Its unpopularity is not confined to any section of the people, neither to the rich nor to the <Col N="656" /> poor, neither to the educated nor the uneducated, neither to the opponents of the Government nor to its followers.  All over the country there is nothing but scorn for the very existence of this Department. People tell you that the country is far too poor to be indulging in window-dressing of this kind, that we have not sufficient interests abroad to justify the spending of money on foreign representatives, and that the only purpose of the Department is to spend money in ways which are not the most useful nor the most necessary to the State.  When you point out that other small countries spend a great deal more than this country you are met with the remark, in the case of whatever country you are speaking about, that that was Denmark's affair, Belgium's affair or Holland's affair, and that in any case these countries can speak for the whole of their people, whereas we can only speak for a limited section. You are told, also, that so far as the influence of these foreign representatives in international politics is concerned, the only influences that count are armaments and money, and that as we have practically no armaments and very little money, our influence must necessarily be very small.  That unpopularity has not decreased in recent times and, in my opinion, unless economic conditions improve no Government that may be in power will be able to keep the Department in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is very likely that there will be in the near future a big demand for closing down the Department and to stop the expense that has been incurred.  We on this side of the House would not altogether welcome that development, and it seems to me that the only possibility of getting the Department at all popular in the country is if it could be shown that it may have a certain influence in bringing partition to an end.  If it could be shown that our diplomatic representatives abroad have any influence with regard to that question, that they can interest the British Government, that <Col N="657" /> they can so impress the British Government with its responsibility in the matter, or make it an international question generally, so that the re-uniting of the country would be accomplished, then I believe that the people would accept the Department as a useful Department, because nobody needs to be told that the one thing that is dear to the hearts of the people is the possibility of a reunion between North and South.</P>
    <P>In connection with the partition question, I think the Minister might tell us in what way the facts of that position are being presented to other countries.  It may seem a rather unnecessary question to ask.  It may seem that there can be no difference of opinion as to how the facts can be presented.  It may seem that it is a matter of history which is so recent that it can be only described in one way, that there is no possibility of a difference of opinion as to who is responsible for partition, for bringing it about and maintaining it.  But the present Minister for Defence, speaking on the Estimate for External Affairs in November, 1928, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not think it would be good propaganda for a country that has struggled so long as we have for self-determination to say that while we approve of self-determination for our own country, we do not approve of it for the Six Counties.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder if that extraordinary statement would be subscribed to by the present Minister?  Are the facts of the partition question being presented in that way by our representatives abroad when they speak on that question?  If so, I suggest, in relation to that part of their duties, anyhow, they are doing a lot more harm than good.  Yet the author of that statement was Minister for External Affairs for some years, and I presume those who acted under him at the time were instructed to represent to foreign nations that the awful crime of partition was the act of the people themselves; that no fault was found with it on the part <Col N="658" /> of the Free State or any other part of the country.  If that is the case it suggests an extraordinary state of things.  It does look as if the Minister, in order to get a reputation for being in favour of the principle of self-determination, was prepared to misrepresent the facts with regard to the partition of Ireland. Assuredly that would not be a good bargain.  Another remark of the same Minister would seem, in my opinion, to suggest that the Government attached very little importance to the fact that the country is partitioned.  &ldquo;I do not understand,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what is to be gained by saying that partition effectively deprived this country of the advantage of independence.&rdquo; That statement looks particularly light-hearted with regard to the most important problem of the country. Whatever may be thought of the form of independence we possess, assuredly it is not open to the Minister to say that partition has not effectively deprived the country of the advantages of independence. A statement that the support of two armies, two police forces, two Governments, two Governors-General and a Customs border-line of about 200 miles does not effectively deprive the country of the advantage of independence, can only come from a man who lives in a world of dreams and who has no appreciation of the national dissatisfaction on the subject.</P>
    <P>Another question arises in the same connection.  Every day there are reports in the Press as to the hard way in which the minority in the Six Counties is being treated. Only last Saturday it was reported that Mr. J.S. Stewart, one of the Nationalist members in the Northern Parliament, said at Dungannon: &ldquo;There is nothing staring us in the face but the policy of extermination of our people pursued by the Northern Government.&rdquo;  Even allowing for exaggeration, it must be the case, I think, that the Nationalists in the Six Counties are having a very uncomfortable time, that life is being made very hard for them, that they <Col N="659" /> are being driven out of that territory as fast as they can be got out of it.  Are we to conclude that the Government here have no power, even though they are on the most friendly relations with Great Britain, even though they are never tired of insisting that everything the country requires can be gained by peaceful methods, that diplomatically they have no right to represent to Great Britain that our people in the Six Counties must be protected, that they must be given a reasonable chance to live there, and that we require equality for them? It must be remembered that when the Treaty was being discussed in Great Britain in 1922 promises were made that England would lend all her influence towards uniting the North and South of Ireland.</P>
    <P>One of the signatories to the Treaty, I think, made the statement &mdash;&ldquo;in return for a United Empire, we undertake to help Sinn Fein leaders towards a united Ireland.&rdquo;  I know that the following statement was made by one of the signatories to the Treaty:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If Ulster chooses to join with her fellow-countrymen in the Government of Ireland, we are sure that this would be a great advantage to the general interests of the British Empire as a whole, to the interests of all Ireland, to the special interests of Ulster.  This opinion we feel bound to proclaim, and we are fully entitled to make sure that our legislation and our policy contain nothing that shall be a barrier to such an ultimate consummation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And he later on said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not believe myself that if Irish Republicans have consented to swear allegiance to the British Crown and Empire in the terms which are set forth, I do not believe they have done so out of fear of a renewal of warfare, but it is in the hope that by so doing they will render possible that unity of North and South of their country for which more than <Col N="660" /> anything else in the whole of this settlement they care.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Well, it looks as if the British leaders at that time, anyhow, appreciated that the union between North and South was something for which they had some responsibility, and if these promises are worth anything, I think we might be told whether the Government of Great Britain is being reminded of them.  I know that in regard to diplomacy it is very difficult for those responsible to discuss such questions in a Parliament, but I do say again with regard to this whole Department that if it could be shown that our representatives in other countries can help towards re-uniting Ireland, either by their influence with the British Government or their influence in international affairs, if they are making that question a live issue and can show that they are helping towards the achievement of unity, then I think the Department would be saved a lot of the unpopularity that, so far as I can see, is rapidly growing with regard to it.</P>
    <P>It is one thing, however, to ask for information; it is another thing to get it.  Judging from previous experience, I do not expect to get very much information or to get any reply to my queries.  I expect there will be a reference, however, to my inferior intelligence as if everybody in the House had not, long since, taken that for granted.  I expect there will be more of these heartrending efforts at Churchillian smartness, the Minister apparently forgetting that Churchill has the advantage of centuries of special breeding and tradition.  The Minister attaches altogether too much importance to sneers and jeers as part of his duties.  Every sensible man knows that jeers and sneers are merely the fig leaf of the upstart.  I think it is a pity that a Department which could be so useful to the people, which could confer such great benefits on the country, both internally and externally, should be in the hands of a Minister whose chief characteristics are his obtrusive vanity and shallowness of <Col N="661" /> intellect, whose vulgar methods of debate are more suited for a pothouse than a Parliament, and whose low, ethical standards are a discredit to the Dáil.  So long as these circumstances prevail, his Department can only be a laughing stock and a humiliation, and no one who values the good name of the country should vote 5/- for it.</P>

      <P>Before this Vote is put there are a few questions I would like the Minister to clear up.  In the first place, with regard to Deputy Little's reference to the analogy I made with France last year, I think Deputy Little will remember that he objected on that occasion to this country being referred to as &ldquo;Ireland.&rdquo;  I think it was a question of name that was in dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, I was not present at that debate. I was down in Sligo-Leitrim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Then it must have been someone else on those benches. I remember on that occasion I made an analogy that even though the provinces had been torn from France we still spoke of the country as &ldquo;France.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Esmonde charged the Labour Party with being responsible for removing the Department of Propaganda from the External Affairs Vote.  They were to some extent responsible for it, but the reasons put forward at the time was that this Vote, under the heading of External Affairs, was being used for internal propaganda rather than for external propaganda.  It was on these grounds that they objected. Possibly, because there were good reasons for that objection, the objection was upheld.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had some considerable sympathy with the Deputies who raised the point as to the reports&mdash;or, rather, to the lack of reports&mdash;from this Department, and I would like the Minister when replying to tell us whether in fact any reports have been received from diplomatic representatives abroad on political, social or economic questions that his Department <Col N="662" /> would consider worthy of publication. No such reports have been made available to any great extent in any case, and I think that some of the unpopularity that Deputy Moore talks about and which I do not agree exists to the degree he says it does, would be removed if we had a greater knowledge of the work which representatives abroad are engaged in.  I think that we hear altogether too little of their activities abroad.  The general public do not get sufficient information as to what is being done by them.  I thought we might have some information from the Minister on one matter&mdash;that is, the delay in the appointment of diplomatic representatives or extern Ministers from France and Germany.  Our Ministers have been appointed there for some months now and there is no definite information yet as to when the German Ministers and French Ministers will be appointed here.  I would like to know definitely if it is the intention of these countries to appoint Ministers Plenipotentiary in the same way as the Vatican Government and the American Government have appointed Ministers here.  In that connection, I understand that in other countries it is usual to publish the correspondence that takes place between the respective Governments with regard to the exchange of diplomatic representatives.  Will the Minister say if it is the intention to publish that correspondence with the British and Vatican Governments and also with Germany and France?</P>
    <P>There is one other important question that I think was raised here during the debate.  It would be well to have it cleared up.  Reference was made to the presence at the Naval Conference of a representative of the Saorstát Government.  I think it would be advisable if the Minister would explain what exactly his purpose is, and why he is there.  Information as to the object of the presence of our representative in London at that Naval Conference should be given by the Minister on an occasion of this kind.  I personally am not objecting to his presence <Col N="663" /> there, but I believe that it would be advisable that the Minister should explain fully and clearly the reasons for his presence.</P>
    <P>There is one other important matter that I would like to get information on.  I believe that when the Saorstát Minister was appointed to Washington some years ago, he got a letter of introduction, and the letter was published afterwards, from the British Ambassador, which said that the appointment in no way departed from the principle of the diplomatic unity of the British Empire.  I would like to know if, when our Ministers were appointed to other countries, France and Germany, any such statement was made by the British Ambassador; whether it was necessary to make it, and why it should be considered necessary to make a statement of that kind.</P>
    <P>These are some points I hope the Minister will clear up when he is replying to this discussion.  In so far as the main Vote is concerned, it is one of the Votes that we have, on these benches, always supported.  We have criticised, and will continue to criticise its administration, but on the question as to whether or not there should be a Vote of this kind, we never had any doubt.  We have none now, and that is the reason why, if I get satisfactory answers to the questions I have put, I am prepared to vote for the Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKilroy" hpid="Mr. Kilroy Mr. Kilroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know if there is any possibility of anything being done for migratory workers.  The constituency that I represent suffers very largely from that problem.  A number of them go across to England and Scotland, and very many of them work at other employment than agricultural work.  They come under the Unemployment Insurance Act and require to have cards stamped.  A lot of money is paid into the British Exchequer in that way.  I would like to know if there is any possibility of the Minister arriving at an arrangement whereby those people could get their unemployment insurance <Col N="664" /> restored to them, so that they may be able to draw unemployment benefits while in Ireland.  Most of them come home about Christmas and are unemployed for some months in the winter season.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very much struck by the attitude Deputy Little adopted on this Vote, for the first time, this year.  I only hope that he was not present when his colleague, Deputy Lemass, was speaking, because the difference in tone between the two would certainly lead to disagreement between the two outside. If people had discussed this Vote in the spirit in which Deputy Little discussed it, drawing attention to points where they believed things were wrong, and seeking to get information, and asking what steps were being taken to improve matters, it would be well.  Instead of that we get simply the back-street type of conversation that Deputy Lemass indulged in about people banqueting, getting places at dinners and discussions with colleagues at functions.  That is the real type of back-street conversation&mdash;very far removed from the subject Deputy Little dealt with.  Deputy Little had a difficulty about one point that was discussed in great detail last year. On the 5th June, 1929, Deputy de Valera raised this question as to the position with regard to exequaturs to foreign consuls.  The discussion that took place last year is given in columns 871 and 872 of the Official Report.  There I clearly pointed out that, in accordance with the 1926 Imperial Conference Report, for the future the only signature by way of counter-signature that would appear on documents in regard to consuls would be that of the Minister for External Affairs in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister what exactly is the significance of the counter-signature?  I take it there was the signature of the King and then the counter-signature of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right. There was a point made that there <Col N="665" /> was a British Minister's signature. There is no such thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I gathered it was the King's signature, and from our general point of view we objected to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Little did not develop that point with regard to the question of credentials being signed by the King.  Credentials or exequaturs to foreign Consuls are signed by the King on the sole advice of Ministers here.  In that matter, so far as it affects this country, no defect has been discovered. If it were, however, discovered that there was any objection to our nominee or a reluctance to accept the people put up by us, then undoubtedly the whole co-equal fabric of the Commonwealth would be shattered.  On page 25 of the Imperial Conference Report of 1926 we have a statement of the general conduct of foreign policy.  The very words quoted mark a stage in the development of our relations with the Commonwealth.  I will read one portion:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It was frankly recognised that in this sphere, as in the sphere of defence, the major share of responsibility rests now, and must for some time continue to rest, with his Majesty's Government in Great Britain.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then it goes on:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Nevertheless, practically all the Dominions are engaged to some extent, and some to a considerable extent, in the conduct of foreign relations, particularly those with foreign countries on their borders.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole tone of the document, not merely those words I have read and emphasised, indicates that there was a tide in these affairs, and that we simply marked the position as we found it at that particular period.  I stressed to the Deputy &ldquo;must for some time continue to rest&rdquo; in order to emphasise the transitory nature of these provisions.  It is quite clear that, coming suddenly into this sphere of operations and engaging in the task of sending representatives <Col N="666" /> abroad, we cannot cover with representatives of our own all the places where nationals of ours are gathered together in any numbers. We could not, therefore, have representatives to act as a diplomatic channel for conversations between the Government of this country and the Government of every other country, and, therefore, we did recognise a special relationship with the associated States of the Commonwealth and agreed that we would use British Consuls abroad.  But if a British Consul ever interferes with regard to an Irish national, he does it only in the particular instance in which he is requested to do so by this Government. That may last for some time.</P>
    <P>Similarly with the question of defence.  The position is as marked down, and for some time will be so, on account of the annexe to the Treaty, which has not yet been cleared up definitely.  If the Deputy thinks the phrases imply any control by a foreign Government&mdash;I am stressing the word &ldquo;Government&rdquo; as opposed to the King&mdash;over what this Government wants to do, then I would like him to pursue his inquiries still further and bring forward, as I asked, all his suspicions and elevate them for the purpose of argument to the region of certainty so that we may have them examined. Where it is a matter of the King there is interference only at the request of, and on the advice of, Ministers here.  I think that answers the points that the Deputy raised. There are others, but I think they are all founded more or less on that same principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I put it to the Minister&mdash;it is not a question of suspicion but of clearing up a point and getting further information&mdash; could the Free State enter into a Treaty with the United States independent of the British Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I might answer &ldquo;certainly&rdquo; to that.  But let us understand the words &ldquo;independent of.&rdquo; We have a note here, &ldquo;Procedure in Relation to Treaties.&rdquo; on page 20 of the 1926 Report which states: <Col N="667" />&ldquo;It was agreed in 1923 that any of the Governments of the Empire contemplating the negotiation of a Treaty should give due consideration to its possible effect upon other Governments and should take steps to inform Governments likely to be interested of its intention.&rdquo;  The Deputy earlier used the word &ldquo;initiate.&rdquo;  We can initiate a discussion with any country we like with regard to a Treaty.  If the words &ldquo;independent of&rdquo; mean that we should not consult, in the sense that we should not inform, certain people of our intention to enter into Treaty negotiations with another nation, then the words &ldquo;independent of&rdquo; are not properly used.  We have agreed that we would inform, but agreement to inform does not carry with it any right of other Governments to object, or enter amendments or to distort the whole value of the proposed Treaty.  That is completely out of the question.  Even as it stands, it is an agreement from which at a future Imperial Conference any Government, if it thinks fit, can withdraw.  That was the outstanding point which the Deputy spoke of.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell and Deputy Lemass raised the question of the Free State representative at the Naval Conference.  Again the attitude of Deputy O'Connell is in striking contrast to the attitude of Deputy Lemass in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I really think the Minister will force me the next time I am speaking on the subject to make quite a different type of speech if he is going to use me as a stick to beat other members of the Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The contrast I have been attempting to make is between Deputy O'Connell and Deputy Lemass.  Deputy Little is out of it this time.  Deputy O'Connell asked simply what was the purpose.  What did Deputy Lemass do?  He referred to the newspaper report of the people attending the Five Power Naval Conference and immediately had his argument shattered by an <Col N="668" /> ordinary interjection of &ldquo;Who called it that?&rdquo; He tried to elevate some American humorist's report as to some remarks which Professor Smiddy made into a serious argument, and asked &ldquo;What policy is Professor Smiddy following; from whom is he taking instructions?&rdquo; He went on to say that &ldquo;At this meeting at Buckingham Palace his Majesty the King talked about our navy and its great traditions, and the Free State's voice was heard clearly and audibly in the assemblies of the world, through Professor Smiddy, thanking his Gracious Majesty for his gracious words.&rdquo; That is Deputy Lemass's attempt at an impartial review of what happened even on the opening day of the Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not call it an ex-parte statement to take two lines from a report and quote them; to take the foolish comment of an American Pressman of how people spoke, not what they said; to get from nowhere the phrase &ldquo;Five Power Conference,&rdquo; which has no authority for its use, and then to try and insinuate from that that our representative there was, as the Deputy afterwards said, a hostage in British hands, trailing along at their heels and saying whatever they liked.  Professor Smiddy at the opening meeting said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;As the representative of a small country which is one of the State's members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and is, as well, united by the closest bonds of blood and friendship with the great American Republic.  I need hardly say how whole-heartedly <Col N="669" /> my Government desire to see a successful issue to this Conference. Without armaments ourselves, we believe in the fundamental good-will of all Governments finally to bestow peace on their peoples.  Such an achievement is an urgent necessity for the material and spiritual progress of mankind.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He ended by saying this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That will be the strong motive governing the work of all the delegates to this Conference, and it is the most earnest wish of the Government of the Irish Free State that it will lead them along the road towards the abolition of the crime of war.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A good pronouncement and a fair record of what Professor Smiddy said, not an attempt to distort his words, not a dishonest use of what Professor Smiddy did say. Professor Smiddy made that announcement on instructions received from here.  He attends as the representative of this State and this State only.  Deputy Lemass thinks his presence there will be taken as an admission that the Free State occupies in relation to Great Britain the position that any subordinate legislature occupies in relation to any superior legislature.  The extraordinary fact of that Conference is that there are certain Governments who are definitely known to be in an inferior position to the Government of Great Britain, and they are not represented. They are the very ones kept away from the Conference. The people who are there are those clearly not in a subordinate position. Professor Smiddy has a place at the Conference.  We saw to it that he should have a place at the Conference for the reasons stated in his opening speech, because we believe we have an interest in disarmament, and particularly in the limitation of navies.  We would like to see that brought about.  We believe that this country has extreme interest in all the things that Deputy Lemass derided&mdash;the humanising of warfare, the abolition of submarines, or if not that, their limitation, and the cutting <Col N="670" /> down of armaments everywhere.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass also wanted to know what was the Government's attitude to Privy Council appeals. He felt that the matter had been recently obscured by a certain amount of haziness.  He proceeded on the basis of what he called certain deductions. He deduced that we are climbing down.  Where is there any phrase used by any member of the Government which shows any change of attitude in regard to the Privy Council.  No phrase was quoted from any of them&mdash;no newspaper account even.  The Deputy cannot give any.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  I say that the fact that members of the Government are stressing the purely accidental objections to the Privy Council seems to indicate that they are no longer agitating for its abolition, but for an amendment of its constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to get a quotation from any member of the Government in which the incidentals were stressed without at the same time there being remarks as to the Government's attitude clearly towards the Privy Council.  People may have stressed additional arguments, but the whole basis of the claim is that the Privy Council should not exist in relation to this State.  We have always said that; there has been no going back.  No attempt that Deputy Lemass has made, by simply giving a series of deduction from speeches to which he does not even give a reference, can get away from the main fact that authoritative statements have been made in this House, and there will be no going back on these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass is also anxious about the Federation of British Industries and the Imperial Trades Conference.  A document was referred to as if it were a binding document.  It might interest the Dáil to know that the document is a statement sent round by the Federation of British Industries, a report made by the Federation to the British Preparatory Committee for the Imperial Conference, and not sent to <Col N="671" /> us officially.  Even if one is to go into detail, what does it set out?  It sets out a certain number of principles. One is: &ldquo;That the most urgent necessity exists for this country to take all possible steps to increase trade with the Dominions for the following reasons&rdquo;.... (2)  &ldquo;That in considering the problems of Inter-Imperial trade, it is essential to take into account the economic desires of the Dominions.&rdquo; In the first sub-head under that the Federation suggests: &ldquo;That it is essential that the United Kingdom should realise that the Dominions are determined to possess as full an economic life as possible, and themselves develop manufacturing industries.&rdquo;  They recommend in the end for the consideration of the next Imperial Conference the following suggestions: &ldquo;(a)  That steps should be taken to &lsquo;rationalise&rsquo; as far as possible Empire industrial production&rdquo;; and in the paragraph under that it again refers not merely to the desire but the expressed intention and the practice of the Dominions to manufacture on as big a scale as possible.  The document is a harmless one.  It is quite an ordinary document for the Federation of British Industries to put up to a British Committee.  It is introduced into the debate as if it was one of the Conference documents which was going to come forward for decision.  The Deputy's summing up of the whole thing was that we should go in for live stock production, and leave industry to Great Britain, and he wanted to know is that our attitude.  It is a question which should not be put, it is so clearly not our attitude.  If that were our attitude, why were tariffs put on industries here?  Has the Deputy had any indication recently that there is any regret about the tariffs put on?  Will the Deputy give a quotation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>Not largely for revenue.  If the Deputy will get the account of the tariffed industries from 1924, even he could not arrive at the conclusion that they were put on for revenue purposes.  It is quite clear that they were not put on for revenue.  At the time they were put on, in connection with the one which was not supposed to have its full effect at once&mdash;the boot tariff&mdash;there was a remission of taxation made equivalent to the revenue likely to be received from the tax in the early years&mdash;a very definite remission of tax revenue to counterbalance it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see the point, but we will argue that out on a tariff debate.  There were industries tariffed in this country, and our tariff policy cannot be obscured by the casual introduction into this debate of a document setting out the tariff policy of any federation of British industries.  But Deputy Lemass will always rely on any document which proceeds from England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that the Deputy is afraid that the Imperial Conference will develop into an Empire Parliament. His view is that it should rather be kept for the purpose of consultation.  I spoke at length on that point on the Conference Report of 1929, and pointed out that the mere fact that we brought the Report here for confirmation showed that we did not want to have any idea of control associated with the Imperial Conference.  There is no <Col N="673" /> intention of allowing that Conference to develop into anything in the nature of a Parliament, and there is no evidence that should lead anybody, except one who is dishonestly representing the matter, to that conclusion.</P>
    <P>The Deputy again referred to the Conference proceeding on the codification of international law, particularly in two matters, nationality and territorial waters.  He committed himself to the choice remark: that he did not say the Minister's policy was wrong, but that it should be known.  In this he changes from his ordinary practice, which is to say, of our policy on anything, first, that it is wrong; and, second, to inquire what it is.  In this he said he could only rely on the Press, and that the Press had proved unreliable. We will see for the future whether the Deputy will refrain from relying on the unreliable Press.  As far as the Codification of International Law Conference is concerned, there are two or three subjects before it.  As to the instructions that the Free State delegates will receive, it would take too much time to give them in detail.  The Deputy, at any rate, again has to distort and give a wrong setting to the whole Conference by inquiring whether the Free State is supporting the traditional British attitude at the Conference or opposing it.  There is no British traditional attitude that I know of in contrast to the traditional Continental attitude.  If the Deputy will put a question as to the Free State supporting the Continental attitude at the Conference or of opposing it, even then I would not answer yes or no.  I would say our delegates have instructions aimed at certain objectives, but they have to use discretion to get the best results possible out of the Conference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

      <P>Therefore there is no case for it.  As to the case of migratory labourers who might get work at an insurable occupation. Deputy Lemass has complained because we are not just paying benefit in these cases.  This diplomatist, who is always so caustic about anything that anybody else may do in negotiations with a foreign State, suggests that pending the completion of other, and possibly better, arrangements we should give our whole case away by simply saying that we are going to pay the necessary money.  No matter whether we get any repayment from the British out of the contributions that go <Col N="675" /> into their fund&mdash;whether we get that or not we will pay £56,000.  He asked a question as to the net cost of this proposal, and I replied that it would require about £35,000.  The proposal made by the Deputy on the 26th March would cost to this country about £56,000.  That is a very rough estimate.  Nobody could state with certainty what it would be, because it will depend upon the period for which the people are employed on the other side, and in other circumstances, such as the number of those who go across.  The estimate that we make is £56,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>The costs to the Unemployment Insurance Fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what this country will have to pay if migratory labourers are to go across, get stamps to their credit and come back, bringing no contributions with them.  We pay £56,000 out of a fund built up in contributions from the State here, from the employers here and from the employees here.  We are to pay it all as a free gift to migratory labourers who go across to the other side to get work and can recover, not merely every penny of what is taken from their wages and what their employers pay, but can get the State contribution in addition, as long as they remain in Great Britain.  The only hardship is when they come back here.  Let us look at it in another way.  They go across for work.  Supposing we could get a situation that no money would be deducted from their wages while on the other side; that they would get full wages&mdash;that was a suggestion which was made at one time&mdash;what is the difference between that situation and what holds now?  That the migratory labourer who goes to England will get one penny per day more than he gets at present for the period of his work over there.  The hardship inflicted on these people would be represented by the difference between a penny per day more or, alternatively, by the fact that when they come home they cannot get unemployment insurance benefit paid arising out <Col N="676" /> of work done in England.  I am not going to accept into the insurance code this very bad principle that we should pay people who have not made any contribution to the fund. The fund is an insurance fund.  It is a fund built up in the way that any insurance fund is built up.  It is not a dole.  There has never been any dole in this country except for a very short period one bad winter. It is an insurance proposition; and there is no other proposition anywhere comparable to this that money should be paid out to people who do not pay premiums.  I wonder would any Irish insurance company take on that system with regard to any of their business&mdash;paying out where they have got no premiums?</P>

They go to England and get work, and as long as they stay in England they draw not merely their own 7d., the employers' contribution and the contribution of the British Government, but something more over and above that.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a proper suggestion, and a position that we fought for&mdash;that was the position more or less that was brought about in 1923-24.  We got contributions. We got something amounting to the value of the contributions transferred <Col N="677" /> over here, but the British will not have that now.  They would lose at the moment about £33,000 on a rough calculation.  We cannot pretend to be precise in this.  I think it would be a loss to their fund of about £33,000, and that they are not disposed to give.  We are prepared to enter into that type of agreement with Northern Ireland that I will not have with Great Britain for this reason, that the people who come to our territory from Northern Ireland, and the people who go from our territory to Northern Ireland are roughly about the same in numbers, so that the two funds are, roughly, at the moment gaining a certain amount at the expense of certain contributors.  We want to make an arrangement whereby the people who come to our territory from work in Northern Ireland would be paid by us.  But it is a different position with regard to Great Britain.  Our numbers are very big there, and the numbers that come over here from England are very small.  This proposition should not be put forward as one to be met out of the Insurance Fund.  Let it be known as a dole.  Certain people get work outside this country and lose a penny a day in their wages. They decide to come home rather than secure their benefit by remaining in England.  In such circumstances, you propose to give them a present from State Funds of over £56,000.  Let this whole matter be discussed on its merits, but let it not be discussed under the guise of unemployment insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy raised the question of the Northern Ireland legislation, and Deputy Cassidy also raised it. This has been taken up several times.  It has been taken up at Geneva, and has been taken up by correspondence and meetings with the Northern Ireland representatives. It has been gone into by delegates of the Labour Party in the greatest detail.  They were delegated to meet representatives of my Department on the matter.  Those representatives definitely declared that of the six or seven alternatives <Col N="678" /> that were offered by my Department to the Northern Ministry, any one of them would have given a fair and equitable basis for agreement.  None was accepted.  After that, certain legislation was introduced, and the matter of that legislation was raised at Geneva, but not in the foolish way that Deputy Lemass would have raised it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass wanted to know what is going to be done now and when I asked if he was pretending to quote me in saying that the Northern Government's Act was contrary to international agreement he evaded the question.  I think his line is that there has been a breach of an international agreement because he went on to say that if I did not take up that attitude I was doing what this Government always does, wait to see the other side of the case before deciding our own attitude.  That is a pretty good line to go on.  We do not want to appear foolish by bringing fatuous cases before a tribunal that has to decide impartially.  We especially refrained from saying that it is a breach of the international agreement.  I said that it breaks the spirit of the international agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That it appeared to be inconsistent.  I am forced to disclose the strength and weakness of the case here because Deputy Lemass has some view that something has been given away.  Deputy Cassidy referred to sub-section 5 of the Northern Ireland Unemployment Insurance Act.  But he did not refer to sub-section 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is &ldquo;except as may be otherwise prescribed by regulations.&rdquo;  That is what saves this Act from being a breach of the international agreement.  Supposing that phrase was not there, the only breach is this: There is an international <Col N="679" /> agreement providing for agreements being made with regard to reciprocal benefits.  If that phrase were not there that Act would have blocked the possibility of an arrangement being made, but as long as that clause is there, &ldquo;except as may be otherwise prescribed by regulations,&rdquo; it leaves a loophole.</P>

The law is here that except regulations are issued certain things can happen.  But if regulations are not issued certain things cannot happen.  We have complained of this.  We said it was a breach of the spirit of the agreement, but we are not going to appear ridiculous by saying it is a breach of the international agreement when it is not a breach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said that something approaching a complaint had been made at Geneva. They were on the lines that the spirit of the agreement was not being kept.  We recognise that there was no breach of the agreement.  We got our Delegates to refrain from using any language of that type, and that is the reason why we do not use it here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy stated that on the 28th of June of last year I mentioned here that the matter of reciprocal arrangements with Northern Ireland was almost the subject of complaint by representatives of the Free State at Geneva.  And so it was.  The matter was brought to the notice of the two Governments and they said it would be looked into.  As long as that was the condition of affairs we could bring these people to book before any international court on the <Col N="681" /> grounds that there had been a breach of agreement.  The Deputy, in the course of his speech, said that no doubt I would point out that the Northern Government's increased benefits are paid in consequence of the fact that the Northern Government is subsidised from Britain.  As an effort at diplomacy that is certainly well worthy of the Deputy.  I would look upon it as a perfectly tactless suggestion, and certainly it would not be very helpful in any endeavour to bring about the reciprocal arrangements over which some Deputies are so anxious.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass, and also Deputy Cassidy, are anxious about Lough Foyle.  Early in the year Deputy Lemass asked me if any formal steps had been taken by me to have the dispute which had arisen over the Foyle Fisheries examined in a definite manner with a view to a settlement; if so, to state the nature of the steps taken, &ldquo;and, if not, why not?&rdquo; I replied that the examination of the matters at issue in the Lough Foyle Fisheries dispute was still in progress. I answered, using as far as possible the Deputy's own words and having in mind the form of the Deputy's sentence.  I understood the Deputy to mean, when he talked of steps being taken to have the dispute examined in a definite manner, not an examination in the Department, because we had already had examination of it completed years ago, but examination as between the two Governments. It was that examination to which I referred, and I may say now that that examination is still going on. When he asked me some days ago if I had taken any steps to open up formal discussions with the British, he misunderstood my previous reply, because I thought his question meant an examination as between the two Governments.  There was no necessity for what the Deputy said in the course of his speech: &ldquo;I want the Minister to tell us whether his Government has, in fact, done anything except discuss the issue at banquets....&rdquo;  Again, in a statement like that, the Deputy has got down to his own level.</P>

      <P>They are not concluded in the sense that the conclu sions arrived at have not yet been fully drawn up and signed.  The basis of agreement has been under discussion in a Department of this Government for four months past. The broad lines of the agreement were reached a year ago, and details were settled in the autumn of 1929.  The Deputy was querying as to the Tariff Truce Conference at Geneva, the failure of which, he said, was brought about by the Free State delegates.  I do not know whether the Deputy made that reference by way of compliment or otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said certainly left the Deputy somewhat clearer.  In his opening speech he threw out certain suggestions.  From the arguments he put forward one would gather that we were going to abolish tariffs or help to abolish tariffs.  I do not know whether the Deputy had the same opinion when I made my statement.  We did not go there to break up the Conference. One does not go to a Conference of that type for that purpose.  In that case the better course would be for one to stay away.  We wanted to get our point of view made clear, and we knew that many other countries had the same point of view as ourselves about that proposition.  It was a proposal which had advantages for a great many countries, but disadvantages for certain undeveloped countries.  The Deputy asked, &ldquo;Have the Free State delegates signed that convention or not?&rdquo; We always felt that whatever convention was prepared, would be full of provisos and reservations. What we thought was likely to happen did actually happen.  The convention has got a small number of signatures, and is full of provisos and reservations.  One thing the Deputy can be quite clear about is that we have not signed.</P>
      <P>There was another treaty about which the Deputy vaguely heard, but had no information.  An agreement has been concluded guaranteeing payment for any damage that might be suffered by French nationals here.  The Deputy asked me how much we were likely to pay in consequence of that agreement. We pay nothing.</P>

In its principles its effects may be small, but it is a convention under which we pay nothing and, in return, we get <Col N="684" /> certain damage inflicted on some of our nationals paid for by another Government.

The Deputy went on to speak of commercial treaties with Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Poland, Spain, and the United States of America, and he mentioned that proposals for the opening of negotiations with a view to concluding treaties had been made as between the Irish Free State and Greece, and the Irish Free State and Turkey. The Deputy's comments were: &ldquo;The Minister has now told us that treaties have been concluded with Germany and Portugal.  Will the Minister tell us when it is proposed to submit these treaties to the Dáil for ratification, or will he give us any indication as to what their general terms are?&rdquo; The Deputy is always anxious for information, and he is very anxious to know about the treaty between the Irish Free State and Germany and Portugal.  The Deputy cannot have read the Orders of the Day of some months ago, because the Portuguese Treaty has been published in all its detail.  Apparently, the Deputy does not know that.

      <P>Before the House takes a decision, saying that expense should be incurred in drawing up a list of treaties for the information of Deputies, it ought to be shown that Deputies are anxious to have these.  The only complaint I have heard so far is from Deputy Lemass.  He says that he cannot get certain things.  Previously he queried certain reports from the League of Nations.  He was told that they had been furnished, and one would have thought that he would not fall into that trap again. Now, however, he queries the Portuguese Treaty which was published in November last. How can one assume that the Deputy is anxious to know anything about that Treaty?  He should pay attention to his Order Paper.  Even the Press, upon which he relies so much, stated that in fact a treaty had been concluded but that its terms were not known.</P>

      <P>The Order Paper is a thing that you get and then you forget all about it.  Let us have a little practical common sense.  When you get an Order Paper you remember its contents for a week but then forget about it.

      <P>If Deputy Little adopted that line of argument today, if he wanted to know about treaties and referred to an old statement of mine made a year ago, when I said that treaties were about to be completed or that negotiations were in progress for the completion of treaties with other countries, and asked what was the result, I could easily have given it.</P>

      <P>My point is that one wants to be prepared in advance.  If there were some short report issued beforehand, Deputies would then have an index to the papers on the table in the Library, and could go in a business-like way to examine them, and the Minister would not be in the painful position of having to lose control of his best manners.</P>

The Deputy went on to refer to the French Treaty, and again had recourse to Press reports, and stated that negotiations had fallen through.</P>

      <P>He quoted from the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; to the effect that France and Saorstát Eireann had failed to reach an agreement for a commercial treaty. He quoted a great deal more to the same effect.  But in November, 1929, I was asked a Parliamentary question whether negotiations had been proceeding between the Saorstát and France for the conclusion of a commercial treaty, and whether they had broken down.  The reply was that negotiations were proceeding with a view to the conclusion of a commercial treaty regulating the trade relations of the two countries. The Deputy, however, preferred a Press cutting of the 16/9/'29 to my answer on the 20th November, 1929.</P>

The newspapers gave him some material for controversy.  A Dáil reply is no good for controversy. Neither, apparently, are facts any good for controversy.</P>

      <P>Why should the Deputy be annoyed if negotiations for a treaty are alleged to have <Col N="688" /> broken down, if goods going to France from this country are getting most-favoured nation treatment? That is the situation.  Why should the Deputy go back two months behind that statement to get some newspaper comment to the effect that negotiations for a treaty had broken down?  The Deputy was also sarcastic because we concluded a modus vivendi with Turkey, and he asked us what crisis arose to cause that agreement to be made. The Deputy does not realise how close to the mark he was in making that statement.  I can assure him that there was a crisis in which two manufacturing firms of considerable importance to this country told us regarding their trade with Turkey, that certain manufacturing processes now carried on in this country were going to be moved out of the country if we did not conclude, or were not able to conclude, that modus vivendi.  That was the crisis that existed.  The volume of our exports to Turkey and of our imports from that country may not be very big, but it was sufficient to move two manufacturers, one in particular, to say that it would be the last straw for their trade if we did not conclude that agreement, and that it would mean the clearing out of the country of certain manufactures of these firms.  We preserved those firms in this country and we kept many employees at work by means of that modus vivendi.  The Deputy knew nothing about the facts, and did not care to inquire about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also commented on the fact that a report had appeared in the Press that we succeeded in negotiating a Treaty with Spain and that the late Spanish Cabinet had approved of it.  That is not so.  There has been an attempt to negotiate a Treaty with Spain.  A document has been drawn up about which there is considerable agreement.  It has been with the Spanish Government for some months.  If there has been any delay&mdash;I do not say that there has&mdash; it certainly has not been here.  I can answer the Deputy's question similarly <Col N="689" /> in regard to the conclusion of other treaties.  There will be a treaty with Germany coming forward, but I cannot state the date.  Negotiations are very far forward between ourselves and Italy in regard to a treaty. The Polish one is only beginning, and that with the United States of America was postponed owing to the new tariff regulations which the United States Government brought in.  It is quite possible that a <i>modus vivendi</i> with Greece has been concluded at this moment.  The Deputy's comments about the Department's delay in negotiating treaties and about its not negotiating them inside five years are the sort of comments that can proceed from a Deputy who does not take the trouble to inquire into facts.  The Deputy does not appreciate the facts of the situation and has no consideration for the interests involved. Sometimes they require a speedy conclusion to a matter that has been proceeding in a leisurely way, and sometimes the country concerned requires the leisurely consideration of a treaty proposed to it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde made a suggestion in regard to the order of officers abroad.  There is some substance in what he says&mdash;namely, that we might list our foreign representatives in a particular order.  We will give attention to that matter before the next Estimates are presented to the House.  The suggestion that one of our Ministers for Berlin or Paris should be accredited also to Brussels is under consideration. It is not intended to close the office in Brussels entirely.  The suggestion made by the Deputy appears to be the most workable under the circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also raised a point as to the application for a seat on the Council of the League, and suggested that we should further consider the matter before making up our mind to run in opposition to Australia.  It may please the Deputy to know that the most recent advice we have is that Australia has no intention of running as a candidate this year, and in fact intends to support our candidature.  There is thus <Col N="690" /> no conflict between us.  As to the Deputy's point that a statement should be made concerning the progress of the Naval Conference with a view to showing that we are vitally interested and that we are not responsible for any delay there might be, I should say that that is a matter that may arise later.  While the Conference is in a particularly delicate stage I think that it would be unwise to have any debate upon that matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Law asked a question as to other Conventions which are likely to be brought forward.  The Deputy mentioned a certain number which I have listed to bring before the House.  One relates to the treatment of prisoners of war, and the other to the conditions of the wounded and sick among armies in the field.  There are two protocols dealing with statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice.  One simply changes the statute and the other facilitates the adherence of the United States to that statute.  There are two League Conventions, one mentioned by the Deputy and one for the prohibition of the use of asphyxiating gases.  There is also the Slavery Convention, which will be brought before the House.  In addition, there is one in regard to Economic Statistics.  That will appear some time after Easter, and I hope to bring forward four others in addition to those mentioned by the Deputy.  One relates to obscene publications, one to opium traffic, another to counterfeit currency, and there are others about which we have not yet made up our mind.</P>

Complaints have been made concerning the treatment of Free State emigrants to the United States at Cobh by the United States authorities.  I have been informed that the medical examination is of a particularly degrading kind.  Whether that is correct or not I do not know.  I would like to know whether the Minister has made, or is prepared to make, inquiries in that regard, as there appears to be considerable indignation amongst a certain section of the community.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Eireann approves of the following Conventions, copies of which were laid on the Table of the Dáil on the 5th day of March, 1930, namely:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  concerning the marking of the weight on heavy packages transported by vessels;</P>
      <P>(b)  concerning the protection against accidents of workers employed in loading and unloading ships;</P>
      <P>and recommends the Executive Council to take the appropriate steps for their ratification.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Eireann approves of the following Convention, a copy of which was laid on the Table of the Dáil on the 5th day of March, 1930, concerning the application of the weekly rest in industrial undertakings, and recommends the Executive Council to take the appropriate steps for its ratification.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Eireann approves of the following Convention, a copy of which was laid on the Table of the Dáil on the 5th day of March, 1930, concerning equality of treatment for national and foreign workers as regards workmen's compensation for accidents, and recommends the Executives Council to take the appropriate steps for its ratification.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Eireann approves of the following Convention, a copy of which was laid on the Table of the Dáil on the 5th day of March, 1930, concerning the creation of minimum wage-fixing machinery, and recommends the Executive Council to take the appropriate steps for its ratification.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The details of these Conventions have been given in the Stationery Office publication presented to the Oireachtas.  I do not think it is necessary to go into any great detail on these Conventions.  The first group are concerned with maritime matters generally.  The titles of the Conventions themselves pretty definitely indicate the precise object of each Convention.  There are just about two points in connection with these that might be noted.  In the <Col N="695" /> case of the first the indemnity with regard to unemployment is only in the case of loss or foundering of a ship and according to Article 2.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This indemnity shall be paid for the days during which the seaman remains in fact unemployed at the same rate as the wages payable under the contract, but the total indemnity payable under this Convention to any one seaman may be limited to two months' wages.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then there is a proviso with regard to the remedies that seamen have for recovering these indemnities. This Convention in Article 9 is said to be one which may be denounced after the expiration of five years from the date on which it first comes into force with regard to the particular country, and when Conventions have been denounced at the end of five years, that denunciation takes effect a year later; so approving of the ratification of this binds this State to it for a minimum period of six years.</P>
    <P>The second is one which settled the minimum age for the employment of young people, persons under 18 years of age, in certain occupations&mdash;employment on vessels as trimmers or stokers.  There are certain subsidiary regulations proposed, allowing, in exceptional circumstances, that people of 18 may be employed where no others can be got.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In that case it shall be necessary to engage two young persons in place of the trimmer or stoker required.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Two persons must then be employed instead of one.  This Convention can only be denounced at the end of ten years and denunciation takes effect a year later; so that if signed this holds for eleven years.</P>
    <P>The third one, as the title shows, concerns the compulsory medical examination of children and young persons employed at sea, but not referring specifically to the matters dealt with in the second convention under discussion, that is, as trimmers <Col N="696" /> or stokers.  This simply provides in the case of those employing them that a medical examination must be made when young people are being employed on board ship, and the medical certificate must be given and renewed at certain stated periods.  This Convention also if ratified holds for ten years and thereafter for a year.</P>
    <P>The fourth Convention concerns the simplification of the inspection of emigrants on board ship.  It is much looser in its terms than any of the others because it simply states that a scheme shall be drawn up, but certain things are left for purposes to be defined by the competent authority in each country.  This is simply to ensure that in the business of carrying emigrants there must be definite regulations laid down and adhered to.  Again it is a Convention which could be denounced at the expiration of ten years.</P>
    <P>The next one is much the most detailed of any we have before the House this time, and the general effect of it may be seen without going into the details.  It is enforcing on people who are engaging seamen the obligation to have the articles reduced to writing.  The articles of agreement reduced to writing must include provisions relating to all the details set out in Article 6 of this Convention.  Again this is purely in the interests of the seafaring classes, to see that they will know the conditions under which they will go to sea and to see that they will be enabled at the time to enforce the conditions under which they have signed.  This is also under Article 21 a ten-year Convention and may be denounced at the end of a ten-year period.</P>
    <P>The last of them concerns the repatriation of seamen.  Articles 3 and 4 are the important Articles in this. It simply comes to this, that any seaman who is landed during the terms of his engagement or on its expiration shall be entitled to be taken back to his own country or to the port at which he was engaged, and provisions are made with regard to <Col N="697" /> penalties.  This also is a ten-year Convention.</P>
    <P>With regard to the first group of six Conventions, the situation in this country with regard to the law is a little bit obscure, but an amending code has long been promised with regard to merchant shipping, and that is definitely reaching its final stages.  Under the code that will be brought forward all these points are being met, so we are moving a little bit in advance of the legislation. It simply is because we know that the code that is likely to be brought before the House, not this session but certainly before the year ends, will ensure in relation to seamen all the necessary legislation to give effect to these Conventions that the Conventions are now being brought forward.  Of all the Conventions that have been put forward by the International Labour Office these are the ones that commanded most respect from the countries generally.  When I say that, it has to be taken with limitation to the countries that are obviously interested in seamen and shipping.  There has really been established an International Court for dealing with international matters here set out.  Deputies will have no difficulty in accepting the recommendations now brought forward or the legislation that will within a year be brought forward to enforce them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T.J. O'Connell Mr. T.J. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>We are pleased to see the Minister bringing forward these Conventions for ratification. Our complaint in the past has been the delay that sometimes occurs in bringing forward Conventions that are adopted by the International Labour Office.  The Minister made a reference to the publication by the Stationery Office of the text of the Conventions.  I would like to point out that the publication in this particular form is rather misleading, because anybody who would take this up and read the title of it would think that this in fact contained all the Conventions.  You could not blame a person for taking this up and assuming that it contained <Col N="698" /> all the Conventions that were adopted by the International Labour Office.  This contains the Conventions that it is now proposed to ratify.  I think something should have been stated to that effect.  The Minister knows that there are very important Conventions adopted which are not yet brought forward for ratification and which are not included in this publication.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Conventions that are being adopted here, I have nothing to say, but I would like to get some information from the Minister as to what are his intentions in reference to some of the other Conventions which are not being brought forward for ratification and which have been adopted for a good many years.  There are two or three Conventions that workers in this country are particularly interested in.  There is the Hours Convention of 1919.  There were certain objections with regard to that.  I think the main difficulty was the refusal of the Conservative Government in Britain to adopt it.  I understand that the Labour Government in Britain are now proposing to adopt it, and that it is only the exigency of Parliamentary time that prevents them from doing so.  I would like to know what the intentions of the Minister are.  I do not see that there can be any great difficulty now about adopting it.  It would make no radical change in this country, because the principle of the 48 hours' week is very generally adopted in this country already, and it would not make any material difference in so far as industrial activity is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter that I think the Minister should have no hesitation in bringing before the Dáil for ratification&mdash;that is the Convention with regard to night work in bakeries adopted in 1925. In practice we have no night work in bakeries in the Saorstát. There is general agreement among workers and employers in regard to that issue.  One of our own delegates from the Saorstát, Professor O'Rahilly, was largely instrumental <Col N="699" /> in having this Convention adopted. I think there is no reason why it should not be brought forward for ratification.  There has been objection that because there is night baking in Northern Ireland bread would be brought in across the Border if the Convention were adopted.  But in practice at the present time there is no night baking.</P>
    <P>There is the White Lead Convention and a few others.  There is insurance of agricultural workers.  I would like to know from the Minister what his intentions are with regard to these.  I am glad to see this number now brought forward for ratification.  I think it should be a general principle that when Conventions of this kind are adopted by the International Labour Office they should be brought before the Dáil for ratification at as early a date as possible.  The general intention of these Conventions is that legislation with regard to industrial matters and workers generally should be brought to a definite level in all the countries of the world.  In countries like our own a good many of them are already in operation.  We should be anxious to set a good example to other countries and to have a reasonable standard of industrial conditions adopted.</P>

      <P>I agree that this document might have been produced in another form.  One might conclude from the title &ldquo;Conventions adopted&rdquo; that it included further Conventions.  That is not the case. It might be better if it were &ldquo;certain Conventions,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Conventions adopted by the Conference and now about to be proposed for ratification&rdquo; or something like that. At any rate, it is quite clear to the House that it is by no means an attempt to mislead.  It is simply an inadvertence.  If it is in order to discuss these Conventions that are not being ratified, I could go into seven or eight.</P>

      <P>I can simply say that I am moving to ratify eleven. We have already ratified about ten. There are eight outstanding, and we do not propose at present to move in these eight.  There are about three in connection with compulsory insurance necessitated by medical benefit.  We have not that system at present and we do not propose to introduce it and therefore cannot bring in the Convention.  As to night baking, we are leaving it over for consideration, as there is the question of the single-man bakery. In fact there is no night baking here.  We had left that over as certain investigations are not concluded. As to the Hours Convention, we certainly are not going to move ahead of industrial countries who are our competitors in a certain way and who have not ratified.  We cannot put ourselves in a worse position in so far as there is the remote possibility of any enlargement of that Hours Convention.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Eireann approves of the following Conventions, copies of which were laid on the Table of the Dáil on the 5th day of March, 1930, namely:&mdash;</P>

      <P>(b)  concerning the protection against accidents of workers employed in loading and unloading ships;</P>
      <P>and recommends the Executive Council to take the appropriate steps for their ratification.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These Conventions are pretty accurately described by the title and I do not intend to go into the details of them, especially in regard to the second, as to which there is a considerable amount of detail given in the Convention itself.  As to the carrying out of these, the gist of the Conventions can actually be said to be in force in the country.  There may be legislation required on small points, but in the main we believe that the full effect of the Conventions can be got by certain changes which we propose to make in statutory orders that will mainly cover the second.  On these points, I have been to a certain extent in consultation with people who would be most definitely concerned and do not find any disagreement as to the effect of the two Conventions or the change that the statutory orders require. Again, even though it be ahead of the changes or orders, I am asking <Col N="702" /> the Dáil to agree to the acceptance of these two.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister give any explanation as to what it is proposed to do as to (b)  &ldquo;Concerning the protection against accidents of workers employed in loading and unloading ships.&rdquo;  The position as far as dock labourers is concerned is very uncertain.  In some small towns men are given the job of procuring a gang of workers to load or unload a boat.  They are called stevedores, but are not really stevedores.  When it comes to the question of a man meeting with an accident and having to sue them for compensation, they are men of straw. I have in mind a case in Wexford where a man took an action against a supposed stevedore and was unable to get any compensation.  I am wondering if the adoption of this Convention will make the position any clearer and if it will safeguard the position of workers to any greater extent than in the past.  To my mind, the person who employs a man of that kind, who is not a stevedore in the accepted sense, should be held liable for compensation in case of accident to a workman, and I should like to have the Minister's view as to the exact position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that the point which the Deputy refers to is going to be covered.  The second Convention of the two we are discussing deals with various ways of protecting against accident the workers employed in the loading or unloading of ships.  If the Deputy will go through the various articles, he will see that they mainly refer to the places where these people would be employed, such as approaches to docks, wharves, or premises, having to be guarded.  There will be certain Harbour Commissioners who will be responsible there.  Similarly, when one gets to Article 3&mdash;a ship lying alongside&mdash;the means of access must be guarded in particular ways. The onus may rest either on the master of the ship or on whomsoever is in charge of the dock or wharf.  In nearly every case under these Articles, although not so stated in the <Col N="703" /> terms of the Convention, there stands out somebody as definitely being responsible for having places made safe.  I do not think the special point the Deputy is at, of people calling themselves stevedores and getting gangs of men, is really covered by this.  The Deputy raises the question as to who is responsible.  I do not think that is met by this at all.  The only ground I can give, and it is a sufficient ground for the purpose of the Convention, is that I can issue new regulations under the Factory and Workshops Act which will bring about the conditions I want to ensure.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Convention provides that there should be a period of rest of at least <Col N="704" /> 24 consecutive hours in every period of seven days.  At one time we were rather reluctant to ratify this Convention, because we were not quite clear as to the situation here.  But we put queries to the International Labour Office explaining the situation where we found there was variation that to our mind seemed to be in a slight degree a breach of the Convention, and their position is that the practice here is quite in line with what the Convention involves.  There is one thing that we possibly lack. There is no general provision which would lay down suitable penalties for non-compliance, but we can get that attended to if necessary.  The practice is in accordance with the Convention.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;In sub-section (1), immediately after the word &lsquo;districts,&rsquo; line 3, to insert the words &lsquo;of the several coastal urban districts.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to provide for the inclusion of what are described in the definition section as the &ldquo;coastal urban districts&rdquo; in the City of Dublin. That inclusion, we believe, is a natural and inevitable consequence of the contiguity of these districts to the city and of the community of interests of the inhabitants both of these districts and of the city.  The interests of those who live in the coastal urban districts and of those who live in the city are in no way in conflict and are in every way in accord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no geographical, social or economic reason for the establishment of the proposed borough.  It is a redundant and unnecessary project and, since it will involve a duplication of services, staff officers, employees, salaries and miscellaneous expenses of all kinds, we believe it will be costly and inefficient in operation.  I am sure that 80 per cent. of the inhabitants and residents of the coastal districts are <Col N="709" /> dependent economically upon the City of Dublin.  I am sure that 65 per cent. of the adult inhabitants of the townships spend the greater part of their lives in the city.  Yet if the coastal borough be established these people to whom the prosperity and progress and sound administration of the City of Dublin are as important as they are, say, to the dwellers in Merrion Square of Marlborough Street or any district now included in the city, will have absolutely no voice or influence in city affairs.</P>
    <P>Therefore, because a sound administration of the City of Dublin in which they earn their bread is of more importance to the inhabitants of Blackrock and Dun Laoghaire than the social prestige and local influences which would accrue to the select few in those townships if the borough be established, we hold that the onus of justifying the proposition to establish a borough rests upon those who have been responsible for the section and not upon those of us who are asking that the natural thing should be done and that those townships should not be divorced for ever from the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I submit that the proposal to establish the proposed borough will mean the duplication of officers and the duplication of services.  If the coastal borough is to be established naturally there is going to be a mayor, and a mayor, I am sure, under the existing dispensation will require a salary.  He will have official quarters and a special staff for himself and every one of these things is going to impose an appreciable but unnecessary charge upon the residents of the proposed borough. On the other hand, if we do not have to have the borough we do not want the mayor and we do not have to pay for the mayor.  I believe so far as civic pride is concerned the inhabitants of Blackrock and Dun Laoghaire would be as well served by the Lord Mayor of the City of Dublin as by a mayor in the proposed borough.  There is no historic reason for establishing the borough of Dun Laoghaire except that George IV. landed there.  There is <Col N="710" /> no other reason why there should be any separation of administration for Dun Laoghaire as distinct from the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Again, if we are going to have a separate borough we also want a separate Manager at a separate salary.  In that case I am sure that if the theory underlying the Local Appointments Commission works out in practice, the fact that Dublin is able to offer greater opportunities and because it has greater resources, the matter will work out in such a way that we shall have an inferior administration in Dun Laoghaire as compared with the City of Dublin. The Manager of Dun Laoghaire will be inferior in ability to the Manager of the City of Dublin.  Therefore, this separate borough is necessarily going to have a less experienced and a less skilled administration than would be given to the area if it had been included in the City of Dublin. What I have said about the Manager extends to every other department of local administration.  The engineering staff will not be as competent and as skilled as in Dublin&mdash; that is, if the theory underlying the Local Appointments Commission works out in practice.  The engineering and the medical staff and the staff administration generally in a separate borough are all going to be inferior to the staff which would administer the same services if the borough were included in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>What are these services that have to be administered by the two separate staffs?  There is first of all the public health service, the administration of tuberculosis, home assistance and relief service, mental hospitals, maternity, child welfare, housing, waterworks, sewerage, road construction, cleansing and lighting, reformatory schools, industrial schools, and a host of minor activities and so on.  But taking all that list, is there any particular feature in relation to the administration of the public health services or mental hospitals or child welfare or drainage peculiar only to the coastal districts which would make it necessary and render it essential that there <Col N="711" /> should be a separate administrative authority for each of these services for the little area, the little township with, I think, not more than 30,000 people, which is to be constituted a separate administrative authority under the Bill?  Is it not quite clear that every one of these services could be much better and more economically administered by the Corporation of the City of Dublin than by a Corporation of the proposed borough?</P>
    <P>If there is any reason whatever for setting up a separate authority for administering these services in the case of the proposed borough of Dun Laoghaire, then that reason applies, as I said on the Second Reading of this Bill, with equal force to the townships of Pembroke and Rathmines.  It applies with even greater force to them, because the communities of Rathmines and Pembroke are much more important, much larger, much more highly developed, and much wealthier than Blackrock and Dun Laoghaire.  If there is any reason for excepting Dun Laoghaire and Blackrock from the City of Dublin, then it applies with much greater force to Pembroke and Rathmines.  It can be argued with much greater force and effect to exclude Pembroke and Rathmines from the city than to exclude Dun Laoghaire.  It could be applied with even greater effect to the exclusion of the district of Clontarf, which has been already included, and which the Minister, thank goodness, does not propose to exclude in this Bill.  The very same reason which compelled the Minister to include Pembroke and Rathmines should compel him, if he is logical and practical, and if he considers the matter in the light of common sense, to include Blackrock and Dun Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>It will be noticed, I am sure, by most of the Deputies who have taken an interest in this question that a memorandum was recently published in the newspapers, it appeared in the &ldquo;Dublin Chronicle&rdquo; for 29th March, and the propositions made therein.  That memorandum is not perhaps remarkable for its proposals. <Col N="712" /> It is an attempt, I believe, to meet the criticism advanced largely from these benches with regard to the proposal to exclude the coastal districts from the City of Dublin, and to set up eventually a northern borough.  The remarkable thing about it is that the men who have signed it were the strongest protagonists for the proposed coastal borough.  They were its most enthusiastic advocates.  Yet, when they came to consider it, what was the conclusion that they came to and endorsed with their signatures? First of all, that there should be what is called a Conjoint Service Board to assume financial and administrative responsibility for the common services of water supply, sewerage and housing in the whole area from Killiney to Malahide, and from the North Wall to Chapelizod.  That was the recommendation which these men, having seriously considered the implications of the Minister's proposal, were compelled to make against their prejudices, against their prepossessions and against their own previous and publicly-declared opinions.  Many of them who have signed that are members and representative of the councils of the urban districts of Dun Laoghaire, Blackrock and Dalkey.  And they came to the conclusion that so far as the major problems with which the local authorities have to deal, the Minister's proposal to set up a separate borough was wholly impracticable, and was altogether untenable. That was the conclusion to which they were driven.</P>
    <P>If you are going to set up a conjoint service board&mdash;I do not know whether the Minister is prepared to accept a proposal or not&mdash;to deal with questions of common concern such as water supply, housing and sewerage, what is there outside the ordinary public health administration to be left for the corporation of the proposed borough to do except, possibly, to discharge the functions which might be more properly discharged and undertaken by a local amusements committee?  When you have dealt with the water supply, the sewerage and the housing, surely <Col N="713" /> you have dealt with the major functions, duties and obligations of the local authorities?  The case for having a common authority for dealing with those services in the areas which we have under consideration is unanswerable.  If you can make a case for dealing with those services, what case can you make for the exclusion of public health services? Supposing an epidemic were to break out in the City of Dublin, would it not be absolutely essential that there should be a uniform administration of the public health precautions and regulations which would be taken and enforced in order to deal with that calamity?  Can anybody in the House imagine that if there were an epidemic of any disease in the City of Dublin that with the hundreds of vehicles&mdash;trains, buses, trams, motor cars, and even way-farers&mdash;which pass every day between the city and the townships, it could possibly be confined to the city alone and that the people in the townships would not have to deal with it good, bad or indifferent? Can you imagine a million germs, when they come to the artificial boundary between the City of Dublin and the borough of Dun Laoghaire, saying to each other: &ldquo;Oh, this is the holy ground of Dun Laoghaire.  General Mulcahy has established it with a separate mayor and a separate manager.  We must get off and go back to the City of Dublin?&rdquo; If such a state of affairs were to occur in the City of Dublin &mdash;Providence forfend that it should &mdash;would there not be an immediate outery for one common authority in control of the public health services taking the necessary co-ordinate steps in the City of Dublin and in the borough of Dun Laoghaire to safeguard the citizens from the ravages of the disease?  If you can make a case for a common authority in regard to sewerage, housing and the water supply that same case can be made for a common authority to administer public health services over the whole area.</P>

      <P>I am arguing that there should be a common authority, that the coastal districts should be included in the city.  I am putting forward the argument that even those who were enthusiastic advocates of the establishment of the proposed coastal borough have now been compelled to admit that there should be one common authority for the administration of housing, water supply and sewerage schemes, and as a corollary to that they must also accept the proposition that there should be a common authority for the administration of the public health services.  That is the proposition that I am submitting to the House.</P>

      <P>I am dealing only with the proposal to establish a coastal borough.  I am arguing that the proposed area for the coastal borough should be included in the city and I am not at the moment concerned with Malahide or Killiney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another reason why the coastal borough should not be established, another reason in the interests of the inhabitants of the townships.  These districts are capable of great development.  I am sure that at least a quarter of a million pounds could be well spent in developing them.  If this sum were to be borrowed at 5 per cent. and the loan were made repayable over a period of twenty years, the annual charge for interest and sinking fund would be about £20,000.  The rateable value of the proposed borough would be £167,000 and therefore to raise £20,000 would require a rate of 2/4¾ in the £.  If the proposed borough were not established, but the districts were included in the <Col N="715" /> city, the rateable valuation of the City of Dublin, with the districts of Pembroke, Rathmines and the coastal districts included, would be about £1,731,000.  In order to raise the sum of £20,000 it would be necessary to strike a rate of only 2¾d.  The ratio of the two figures, 2/4¾ and 2¾d., is in the relation of ten to one.  That is the measure of the advantage that the people of the coastal districts would derive from inclusion in the city.</P>
    <P>I feel I am in duty bound to move this amendment because it is in the interests of the people whom I represent that they should be included in the city.  I am urging it from their point of view only, but I am perfectly certain that it will be no less an advantage to the people of the city themselves.  I am perfectly certain that the benefits in their case would be no less substantial, that they would be in a position to see that these coastal districts were developed and that they would be developed in a way which I think would provide what has been described by Deputy Lemass as the natural air lungs for the people of the crowded districts of the city.  If Dun Laoghaire and Blackrock be not brought into the city I believe the development of these districts will not proceed on the right lines. I believe they will be developed in such a way as to preclude almost the undesirable dwellers in the slums and crowded districts in Dublin, as they appear to some of the aristocrats in Dun Laoghaire and Blackrock, from enjoying the amenities of these places which are theirs by right.  If the townships exist and are able to maintain themselves and if they are apparently more prosperous and more pleasant places to live in than the slums of Dublin, it is because the people of the slums have made it possible for Dun Laoghaire and Blackrock to exist. One of the reasons why I am a particularly earnest advocate of the inclusion of these districts in the city is to establish the claim of the workers in Dublin to enjoy the <Col N="716" /> amenities of Blackrock and Dun Laoghaire as of right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">

      <P>On the Second Reading debate on this Bill I pointed out that in my opinion one of the blots of the proposed measure was this coastal borough.  I agree very largely with the arguments that have been advanced by Deputy MacEntee.  When we come to consider the problem in detail we are forced to the conclusion that there are a number of services which should be common services in this particular area.  No one will doubt for a moment that the water supply is a common service for that area.  No one will doubt that the electric lighting system under the Shannon Scheme as now worked is a common service all over that area.  Anybody who has had experience at all in connection with fire brigades will agree that the present system, which is a localised system, is entirely adverse to modern conditions.  We have in the area which I have had the privilege of representing for a number of years, a fire brigade system.  We can call upon, I think, something like seven to ten men in the event of a fire in that particular area. Assume for a moment that a fire were to break out in the premises of the Royal Dublin Society and that we sent out our small local equipment with seven to ten men.  Would anybody argue that they could deal effectively with a fire in premises of that magnitude?  Let us try to get clear of party problems in discussing a measure of this kind.  What we want is that a service like the fire brigade should be centralised so that in the event of an emergency, our city can call upon a fire brigade and equipment sufficient to cope with any situation that arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephByrne" hpid="Mr. J.J. Byrne Mr. J.J. Byrne">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>That fire brigade cannot be called to Pembroke without certain formalities.  There is one fire brigade in Pembroke which considers itself quite capable of dealing with any fire in Pembroke, but others of us might hold a different opinion. <Col N="717" /> Another service that should be centralised&mdash;I have argued this point on a number of occasions&mdash;is road administration.  Take the present position between Dublin and Dun Laoghaire.  At present you pass through four different towns with four different equipments for road administration.  I think the more we see of modern road maintenance the more we must agree as to the necessity for centralising such services. The only service of any importance that would be left if we agreed to these services being centralised is public health.  If I know anything at all of the views held by those who have considered this problem, I think the general view is that that should be a centralised service.</P>
      <P>If this service should be a common service and a centralised service, what have you left for this local authority you are setting up to-day? If you set it up it will find something to do.  It will have a staff, as well as expenses, but it will have no real authority.  Why set it up?  I would like to see some argument or some reason put forward in the first place as to why it is not desirable to centralise these services, because that is the pivot.  If these services can be centralised and can be more efficiently administered by centralisation, then that will settle the problem of the coastal borough, because I do not think that those who are in favour of the coastal borough will agree that, if these services are taken away and centralised, the coastal borough is necessary.  Really the problem hangs around the question whether these services should be centralised.  From experience I have no doubt whatever that these services should be centralised, and if so there is no necessity whatever for setting up a coastal borough to administer what is left.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with a great deal of what Deputy Good has stated, but yet I find a difficulty in accepting his final conclusion.  I admit right off that whatever arguments are to be brought forward for the inclusion of Rathmines and Pembroke within the city apply very <Col N="718" /> strongly also to making a further advance along the coast to include Blackrock and other areas.  I admit straight off the desirability of having the centralisation that Deputy Good has been speaking about and in having whatever co-operation is possible in the administration of these districts.  Yet I feel that if we were to contemplate at the moment making the vast change which would follow from absorbing Rathmines and Pembroke and also absorbing Booterstown, Blackrock, Dun Laoghaire and Killiney, we should run a very serious risk of setting up an unwieldy whole which we should not be able to manage satisfactorily at the present moment.  Personally, I would much rather consider making a change of that kind in a series of steps than trying to make it in one step with results which it would be difficult to estimate beforehand.  I think there would be very considerable risk if we were to take that step at once; we might endanger the final success of the scheme which would ensue if we were to go about it gradually.  I am not satisfied with the Bill as it stands because it does not envisage co-operation at all.</P>
      <P>It sets up on the one hand a city and on the other side a coastal borough, and it seems to do everything to prevent co-operation, to set them in isolation, and put one against the other.  It is possible to alter that and to aim at the result which we all desire, to aim at it by steps which we would be able to take gradually.  It could be made certain that each such step would be the best that could be taken at the time.  I think the plan outlined in the Bill as it stands is expensive, and is unnecessarily tending to lead to separation between what is called the coastal borough and the city.  The Bill provides for an extension of the borough boundary in so far as that extension shall not touch the city, but it carefully seeks to prevent any kind of amalgamation or co-operation between the city and this coastal borough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope it will be possible by amending the Bill to prevent that isolation and do something which will lead <Col N="719" /> definitely towards co-operation, and also at the moment establish such centralisation in joint services as is possible.  Take for instance the fire brigade.  There should be no difficulty about that.  We should take such steps as are possible at the moment and certain to be successful in regard to co-operation.  We should consider laying down in the Act that, as time progresses, further consideration shall be given to what further steps can be taken for extending that joint sort of service, or extending the boundaries of the city or amalgamating further districts with the city or the borough, or even the borough with the city.  Much of my objection to the Bill as it stands would be removed if there were definitely laid down in the Bill some provisions which would secure that that kind of consideration shall be given to the problem at fixed intervals, that the problem shall be reviewed so as to see what further steps towards the ultimate goal should be taken from time to time.  I think that it ought to be possible to amend the Bill so as to get rid of certain objections which were present to the minds of Deputy MacEntee, Deputy Good, and to myself.</P>
    <P>Further, I think that the administration set up for the coastal borough is unnecessarily extravagant.  I think if it is a step forward, that we should, as we do in the Bill, amalgamate smaller districts along the coast into one.  That is a step which is as far as I would care to go at the time.  I think we are loading that amalgamation with unnecessary expense when we talk of setting up a Mayor and Alderman.  I think that that expense is unnecessary, and I think that amalgamation could be done without it.  I think we would be setting up a further bar to the amalgamation of the borough and the city which we hope to see taking place some day.  If we set up a Mayor and Alderman in that district we are creating a kind of inertia against further change which would be quite difficult to overcome. I do not think that it is either necessary <Col N="720" /> or advisable to reject the coastal borough idea altogether, but I think it is necessary and advisable that it should be considered in the Bill merely as a step necessarily leading to further change in the future, and that the Bill itself should foreshadow the way in which that change should be made, and should be considered as a temporary step towards the larger result which we would be aiming at.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise very heartily with that feeling which Deputy MacEntee has, namely, that if you are going to have control of a large area around Dublin, it should be control by a body directly over that area, and responsible for the whole work in it.  I have greater sympathy, if it be possible to have sympathy, with the idea which Deputies put up when they say: &ldquo;We are not going to be responsible for arguing that.  It is someone else's responsibility to argue it, and we will not be responsible.&rdquo;  I would much prefer a system whereby you had a city, a coastal borough and an area on the north governed by a council.  The proof, if proof were needed, that under present circumstances you cannot suddenly get satisfactory administration of a local government kind over a large area like that, is enshrined in the report of the Greater Dublin Commission which, taking a large area like that, divided a certain section and said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Let that be the coastal borough and let the representatives on the council who come from that area be responsible for certain petty services in that area, and let the people elected in Rathmines and Pembroke act as an advisory body in regard to certain petty services in their area.&rdquo;  On top of that they had to change the basis of representation in the matter of numbers in respect of the city and these areas outside so that a particular population which gave you one representative in the old city would give two representatives if it was a population outside.  The advisory committee dealing with petty services, and the change of basis of representation, <Col N="721" /> all point to the difficulty of taking a large area and, from the local government point of view by associating the council with expert machinery, carry out the government, development and administration of that area in accordance with the wishes and general interests of the people.</P>
    <P>The Greater Dublin Commission gave up the idea of doing that for a large area without bringing in all kinds of weaknesses in the matter of responsibility and representation. When I approached the consideration of this matter I said that I wanted a large area that would make it sure that you had city interests dominating the whole development that was going to take place around Dublin Bay.  Bearing that in mind, I took the green line in the Greater Dublin Commission Report as a basis, more or less, for the purpose of considering the situation. I was driven to this conclusion that, although the Commission said that County Dublin should remain, it was quite clear that it could not remain when you leave a county with 85 per cent. of its original area to work out its local government problems of development and administration, with 29 per cent. of its original resources, and with 30 per cent. of its people; that with the type of area that County Dublin is you could not possibly expect the county to do that, and that if you were leaving the county to do that you would have to get such a contribution from the city to relieve the burden that was being thrown on the coúnty as would constitute a burden on the city that the city could not be reasonably expected to sustain.  It was because of that that I and the Department turned to the consideration of the problem that brings us to what we have here before us now.</P>
    <P>As far as development is concerned, I hope I made it clear in speaking on this on the Second Reading that the powers for the extension of the city and Howth urban district, for the extension of the coastal borough area in an uncostly <Col N="722" /> way, whether by inquiry and a provisional order ratified by the Oireachtas here, were put there in order to make the bodies that are operating around Dublin Bay organic, to give them full powers of growth and for the purpose of growing in an organic way into the city that Deputies are dreaming about.  If anything can be done in the Bill to make that more clear, Deputies will understand that on any of these inquiries that are being held the city can be represented.  It is intended that the city can be represented and its objections will be heard.  If there is anything that can improve the proposals in the Bill from that particular point of view, to make it clear what the intention is in the development that is offered, if urban development goes on there in such a way that the city here considers that the city should be extended either to take in an additional rural area or the growing urban areas around it, that the city interests are going to dominate that situation, such interests of the city must be favourably considered&mdash;if that can be made clearer in the Bill, that certainly may be made clearer.</P>
    <P>As far as the objection taken to the mayor and the alderman and the borough is concerned, the position is that you have two codes, the code for boroughs and the code for urban districts.  The old code for boroughs gives us the more satisfactory code of law to operate into a system by which, having a corporation, you carry out the work of the corporation by means of a council and a manager, apart from the fact that the three local bodies came together in 1924, compounded their own differences and agreed to a scheme of reorganisation into a borough as the type of organisation most satisfactory from the point of view of running an area there with a council and a manager.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee, as I said, says it is our responsibility.  He argued that the necessary detail should show that the borough should be a separate borough rather than that it is his responsibility to argue the case <Col N="723" /> for bringing in the borough. Deputy MacEntee, in a subsequent amendment, suggested that the number of fifteen elected persons from the borough area is not a sufficient number to look after the interests of the borough and to supervise its administration.  His amendment suggests that it would require twenty-five persons, locally elected, to look after the interests of the borough and to supervise the administration, but he nevertheless thinks that the interests of the borough and its administration can be centralised in the city and directed from the City Hall, and he argued in a most astounding way, because there is one particular position in the heart of the city here to which the Local Appointments Commissioners can appoint a City Manager, that that is the only person worth having as an employee of any public body to direct the proper carrying on of their business.  I do want the Deputy to take upon himself the responsibility of arguing that four representatives&mdash;because if you take a council here of thirty-five such as Deputy Peadar Doyle suggests for the city as proposed in this Bill and take them as the basis of representation and add from the borough to the council a number of representatives based on population in the same way or, if you like, base it on valuation, the borough would not get four representatives to go into a council of thirty-nine and to look after the general administration. You are supposed to carry on the general work of local government in an area running down along the coast of 4,182 acres, an area half the size of the present City of Dublin and extending over a distance of under five miles.  You are supposed to carry on the proper supervision and look after the proper provision and administration of the services there with four representatives of the area sitting in the City Hall with thirty-five other persons, I submit, more interested in the development and administration of the city than they are in the administration and <Col N="724" /> development of the borough.  So that, from my point of view, we are, in the changes we are bringing about here, taking the present city, which has an area of 8,357 acres, and we are adding to that city Rathmines and Pembroke, two urban districts of about 3,300 acres, but as much a part of the old City of Dublin as Fitzwilliam Square, Inchicore and the Merrion Square area are.  We are joining in these urban areas, but as well as that we are adding to the old city of 8,300 acres 5,300 acres taken in from the rural areas around and we are setting up in that city a new system of local government by a manager associated with a council. We are asked at a time in which we are enlarging the city by 5,000 odd acres from the rural districts alone to add to that an area stretching over five miles of sea coast and bringing in an area nine and a quarter miles away from the centre of the city from which it is to be administered. We are told that centralisation of water services, fire brigade services and road services would make for economy.  I do not accept that.  I consider that the centralisation of public health services would come before the provision of water, the provision of roads and of fire brigade services in those areas generally.</P>
    <P>From my point of view the main things that require attention in the regions of Dun Laoghaire, Blackrock, Dalkey and Killiney at the present moment are housing, and certain aspects of public health. Water is centralised in the proposals that we are making that Rathmines and Dublin be brought together.  The coastal borough gets its supply of water delivered at certain taps and it is charged at a certain price by the city for it.  I do not know what more satisfactory arrangement to provide water for the coastal borough there could be.</P>
    <P>As far as lighting is concerned it goes out of the picture now.  There is no reason why the coastal borough should be brought into the city simply because the coastal borough and the city are getting their light from the Shannon.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="725" /> There is as little reason why the coastal borough should be brought into the city because it is getting its water from Roundwood.  As far as the fire brigade is concerned when the two areas, side by side, are run by Managers there is no reason why an arrangement could not be come to that the fire brigade organisation in each place should co-operate.  As regards economies that could be brought about by the centralisation of road services, I do not think that the economies that could be brought about, if economies could be brought about, would warrant taking that scattered area that up to the present has been governed by four urban district councils, putting it into the city with very little representation and having its problems of housing and health dealt with from long range.  The proposal to have this coastal borough, this city and a county council dealing with the affairs of the City and County of Dublin, I put to the House, is the most satisfactory arrangement that we could make at the present moment.  The imagination of Deputies has been stretched in this particular matter I think as a result of the area outlined in the Greater Dublin Commission Report, but I suggest that the area that is included inside the green line marked on the map of the Greater Dublin Commission is an area sketched for regional planning purposes.  We ought not to allow ourselves in matters of local government to be dragged away from the main problem of carrying out the proper administration of a local area in the interests of the people of that area by the bigger conception of regional development and regional planning. We see in Britain where regional planning has included something like 78 areas.  I spoke to a rather disheartened engineer who was an adviser to a British regional planning committee made up of representatives from 78 local bodies.  I have said that the matter of town planning has been given a considerable amount of consideration in the <Col N="726" /> Department.  I have said that by the autumn I will be prepared to introduce legislation dealing with town planning.</P>
    <P>When I come to deal with town-planning we can take the City and County of Dublin and we can consider the problems that arise from the town-planning side of the City and County of Dublin, but let us not begin to think in terms of town-planning when we ought to be thinking in terms of areas for local administration pure and simple.  If with the machinery set up for town-planning purposes we see that further extensions or further amalgamations are necessary, then steps can be taken to bring these about.  But when we talk of economy and all that kind of thing in connection with roads, whatever requires to be done for roads, to my mind at the present moment, is here in the City of Dublin.  The main roads leading to the city are all right.  It is when you get into the city you have trouble, and it is the city that will have to pay for whatever changes take place there.  Your town-planning is going to be on a scale for roads, sewerage, drainage and water systems.  That is the backbone of any of your proposals for town-planning. Everything else comes down to that skeleton&mdash;housing and development of any other kind.  Do not let us drag the town-planning conception across what we are proposing here.  I said that housing and certain aspects of public life are the things that I feel are the most urgent in the coastal borough. If the housing required in that particular area is going to be discussed and decided from the standpoint of a Council sitting in the City Hall then the housing interests of the coastal borough are going to be prejudiced.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Because you want the touch between your Council representing directly the people that are concerned in the matter and your machine to examine the situation properly and to decide and take action.  If from the point of view <Col N="727" /> of housing the borough came into the city, instead of having five years of work before us, we would have five years of talk and argument, five years of calling for reports and plans and all that kind of thing.  The housing problem of the coastal borough is a thing that has to be faced and more or less settled within the next five or ten years, and it can most satisfactorily be done locally. From the public health point of view the public health authorities in the City of Dublin have enough of a problem to deal with in their city. The County of Dublin has not yet a county medical officer of health. The County of Dublin without the coastal borough could easily argue that with their reduced functions, their reduced finance and power generally, they could not afford the machinery of a county medical officer of health.  One county medical officer of health for Dublin County will deal with the coastal borough and the county.  He could give us in a practical way that supervision over general public health matters in the coastal borough that is necessary.  But the machinery of the city would have to be extended by additional offices and all that kind of thing to deal with coastal borough public health problems from the city.  The expenditure could more satisfactorily be shouldered and the work could more satisfactorily be done from the county side.  If you take away the coastal borough from the county you will not get the satisfactory health services in the county that we would be enabled to have by having a county medical officer of health dealing with the county and the coastal borough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Roads are one aspect of public health&mdash;the cleaning of the smaller and back streets and all that.  The centralisation of road control is not going to give you the supervision of and the cleaning of the smaller and back streets that, in my opinion, are necessary from the public health point of view.  Our proposals extend the city very considerably.  As I say, to a city of over 8,000 acres at present <Col N="728" /> we are giving 5,000 acres of an area which is at present in rural districts, We are taking in two urban districts&mdash; Rathmines and Pembroke &mdash;and setting up a new machinery, and if we bring in the coastal borough we are going to have the interests of the coastal borough neglected and, to a certain extent, the city neglected, because we are going to have calls from the coastal townships to do their particular work, and we are going to throw on the managerial system a load that ought not to be thrown on it at once. I fear that the results of extending the city so much before the managerial system has had time to set in the city will be such, from the point of view of effective administration, as will prejudice the system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are entitled to ask the Minister why he has made such a departure from the Greater Dublin Commission Report. Certainly, the argument he has brought forward is not very convincing. I agree with the views put forward by Deputy Good and Deputy MacEntee, because I believe that what we are advocating is what the Minister or his predecessor advocated when the 1925 Bill was going through the House.  We are asking for nothing more than that Bill provided, in so far as county councils in various parts of the country are concerned.  I agree with Deputy Good and Deputy MacEntee when they say that services such as roads, water and sewerage ought to be common services in so far as the whole coastal borough and the Borough of Dublin are concerned. The Minister has specially mentioned the question of housing.  He is of opinion that housing could be dealt with better by the coastal borough that will be set up.  I do not agree with that point of view, because I believe that if you have the County Borough of Dublin extended to Blackrock and Dun Laoghaire the credit of the council will be higher than the credit of the council which the Minister proposes to set up for the areas of Blackrock and Dun <Col N="729" /> Laoghaire.  Credit, in so far as housing is concerned, means a great deal. Until twelve months ago, when the Minister extended the Local Loans Fund to the building of houses, it was a very difficult matter to get money for housing.  One never knows when the Minister will go back to the old position, and it will then be very difficult for local authorities to procure money for housing.</P>
      <P>If Dun Laoghaire and Blackrock were a borough by themselves, their credit would be very short as regards securing money for housing. To my mind, their interests, so far as housing is concerned, would be better served by having them part of the City of Dublin.  As to public health matters, in my opinion the public health of the citizens of the proposed new borough would be far better looked after if they were under the jurisdiction of the Dublin City Council.  Those of us who are members of corporations and councils down the country know how difficult it is to secure accommodation in a Dublin hospital for any of the deserving poor who require a major operation.  In my opinion, Dun Laoghaire and Blackrock would be in almost the same position as the council of a provincial town.  Their wants in this connection would be more speedily dealt with if they were under the jurisdiction of the new City Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My interpretation of the arguments put forward by the Minister is that they are a condemnation of the new managerial system, because he points out that there are things that would not be done if the people in Dun Laoghaire and Blackrock were to come under the jurisdiction of the new Dublin Council.  He talked about back streets, lanes and places of that kind not being properly attended to and cleansed. One would think, from all the compliments paid by the Minister to the managerial system proposed to be set up by this Bill, that none of these things could happen.  One is surprised at the Minister using such an argument.  He also reminded us that County Dublin has not yet appointed a county medical officer and <Col N="730" /> one is entitled to ask why it was not done under the 1925 Act.</P>

      <P>The Minister says it is not good policy to have roads centralised. I think everything that has been done during the past seven or eight years is opposed to the Minister's argument.  As Deputy Good points out, where you have two councils operating, as there will be, it is ridiculous for both councils to have to provide a set of machinery for the upkeep of the roads.  With Deputy Good and Deputy MacEntee, I believe that if we are to have roads properly kept it will be absolutely necessary that we should have Dun Laoghaire and Blackrock brought under the City Council.  As Deputy Thrift pointed out, if we set up a new council it will be an argument against further change.  I could quite understand the position if the Minister were prepared to leave Dun Laoghaire and Blackrock as they are at present, allow things to develop, and give powers to the new Dublin Council to bring in Dun Laoghaire and Blackrock afterwards, when we had arrived at a certain stage in the development of the new borough.  But, I cannot understand him setting up something that we had not heretofore in this area.  It will impede progress, and I believe that eventually a move will have to be made to secure that Dun Laoghaire and Blackrock, especially Dun Laoghaire, which is almost entirely coastal, will be brought in. If we were even to do what I suggest now, and leave them as they are at <Col N="731" /> present, it would save Parliamentary time in future, apart from all the confusion which may be created.  I have no doubt that confusion will be created in the very near future, and I ask the Minister to consider the position in the light of the arguments put forward.  Like Deputy Good, I think that this matter ought to be discussed in a non-Party manner.  Those of us who do not live in Dublin are proud of the city, and would like to see it a model city. I believe that the matter should be considered by every Deputy apart from party, and that all of us should do our best for the capital city of the country.</P>

      <P>Although the arguments advanced by the Minister against the proposal to include the coastal borough in the city differ somewhat from those advanced by Deputy Thrift, it seems to me that they arise from the same misunderstanding of the circumstances.  The Minister told us that it was inadvisable and impracticable to devise a satisfactory system of local government for a suddenly enlarged area. Deputy Thrift talked of the inadvisability of taking the entire step of extending the city to the area proposed by the Greater Dublin Commission all at once.  Both the Minister and Deputy Thrift appear to be under the impression that the area proposed to be embodied in the coastal borough is of very large dimensions in relation to the city which it is proposed to establish under the Bill.  In fact, the step which Deputy MacEntee is asking the House to take is a very small and almost negligible one in relation to the actual move which the Bill asks the Dáil to sanction.  The area of the four townships which it is proposed to include in the coastal borough, although larger than the existing area of either Rathmines or Pembroke, is, nevertheless, inhabited by a much smaller number of people, and its valuation is considerably less than either of the existing urban districts which the Bill proposes to include in the city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A couple of thousand less than Rathmines and about four thousand more than Pembroke.  The population of the proposed coastal borough is less than one-half of the population of the two townships which the Bill proposes should be included in the city.  Similarly, its valuation is less than one-half of the valuation of the two townships which it is proposed to include in the city.  That fact should be taken into account when we hear the Minister arguing that it is inadvisable suddenly to extend the area of the city to a much greater extent than he proposes.  The actual extension of the area involved by the adoption of Deputy MacEntee's amendment would be comparatively small in proportion to the extension of the city area which the Minister proposes. That fact must also be taken into account when Deputy Thrift's argument is being considered, that we should only proceed to the enlargement of the city step by step. The actual step which the Minister is taking is very much greater than the final step which we are asking the Dáil to take in order to secure the inclusion in the city of the entire area proposed to be included in the jurisdiction of the Greater Dublin Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has been described here by Deputy Good and Deputy Corish and, in the Shelbourne Hotel by the Minister, as a non-Party measure. Presumably that means that the Government Whips will not be applied, and if the Dáil decides to pass the amendment favouring the inclusion of the coastal borough no crisis will result necessitating the resignation of the Government.  Deputies, therefore, <Col N="733" /> can come to the consideration of this question on its merits.  I have no doubt that any Deputy who considers the question on its merits will be forced by the very strong case which can be made out for the inclusion of the coastal borough in the city to vote for the amendment.</P>
    <P>In the course of this discussion, and in the course of the debate on the Second Reading, there was considerable dispute as to the party on whom the burden of proof rested in relation to the question of the inclusion of the coastal borough.  We contended, and in my opinion rightly contended, that those who proposed to exclude those areas from the city should prove that a definite advantage would be conferred on the ratepayers of the city and the coastal borough area in consequence of that exclusion.  The Minister took up the attitude then, and he takes up the attitude now, that the onus is upon us to prove that advantage will be conferred by the inclusion of these areas.  In other words, he contends that the position should be that the coastal borough will be established unless a very strong case can be made against it.  Without necessarily going very deeply into the question as to whether the onus of proof is on him or on us, I say that there should be an assumption that the City of Dublin should extend around the whole of Dublin Bay and that there should not be any tendency to take as the proper situation the situation that existed before this Dáil was established.  If, however, we want merely to have advanced here solid arguments in support of the contention that the inclusion of the coastal borough area in the city would favour the ratepayers, we can get them in the last place where I think Deputies will turn to look for them, and that is the speech delivered by the Minister for Local Government on the Second Reading.  He set out then, as reported in Column 930 of the Official Debates, fourteen reasons advanced by the Dublin Corporation in the year 1879 for the inclusion of the Rathmines and Pembroke areas in the City.  The <Col N="734" /> Minister adverted to these reasons in support of the proposal to include those areas in the Dublin City provided for in the Bill.  Every single one of these arguments can be advanced with equal force for the inclusion of the coastal townships in the City of Dublin as well.  It would take a long time to read them, but I will ask Deputies who are anxious to study this question carefully to read these arguments, not in relation to the townships of Rathmines and Pembroke, but in relation to the coastal townships and they will be struck, I think, by the force with which they apply in that case.  The Minister relied upon them to justify the inclusion of Rathmines and Pembroke.  I think that we can also rely upon them to justify the inclusion of the coastal townships.</P>
    <P>I want, however, to confine myself to the reasons which the Minister has advanced against the amendment. The principal reason appears to be that, if the four coastal townships are taken from the county council, the county council administration will be made extremely difficult, if not impossible, and a burden will be thrown upon the people which would be very much increased in comparison with the existing burdens. That appears to be one of the Minister's main arguments.  It seems to me that the coastal borough is being established very largely because the Minister wants to keep the county council in existence.  It is pointed out that we will leave under the administration of the county council 85 per cent. of its present area, 29 per cent. of its resources, and 30 per cent. of its people.  He implied, although he did not definitely state it, that it would not be possible for the county council's administration to be carried on if that should happen.  The Minister should inform the Dáil whether or not 30 per cent. of the existing population of the county does not, in fact, represent a greater number of people than those actually included in many existing counties in which county council administration is carried on most successfully.</P>
    <P>As far as I am aware, the number <Col N="735" /> of the population which would be left in the county council area, after the coastal townships had been taken out of it, would exceed the population of quite a number of the smaller counties of Ireland.  The same applies also to the rateable valuation. It is undoubtedly desirable that there should be a county medical officer of health for the County Dublin. I cannot see why the appointment of a county medical officer of health will be impossible if the coastal townships are included in city.  Is that a serious argument?  It surely is not suggested by the Minister that the difficulty created by that reduction in the county council area and administration is insurmountable if it can be proved that there are substantial advantages to be gained by the city by the inclusion of the coastal borough areas. The Minister also argued that the coastal borough is a separate place from the city in its whole outlook at the present moment.  I dispute that entirely.  I contend that there is no separate outlook whatever amongst the residents of the coastal townships.  They regard themselves as citizens of Dublin.  Their interests are bound up with the City of Dublin.  They find their pleasure and in many cases their livelihood within the city.  When they travel throughout Ireland and abroad they represent themselves as citizens of Dublin.  It is not correct, and I do not think the Minister was serious in advancing as an argument that there is a separate outlook existing in the proposed borough area as distinct from the outlook of the city. He argued that neither in relation to water supply, roads, nor drainage, etc., could any case be made for a united service.  We can examine that later.  I suggest that unless it can be shown that there will be a decided disadvantage suffered by the citizens of the proposed coastal borough, then the balance of the argument is in favour of their inclusion in the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient for the Minister to say that no advantages will be <Col N="736" /> gained.  He should, I think, definitely prove that disadvantages will result from inclusion.  He has not attempted to do so.  He gave another reason at the meeting of the Central Branch of Cumann na nGaedheal held in the Shelbourne Hotel, where he replied to the criticisms advanced here on the Second Reading debate, which I noticed he has not repeated to-night.  He said that when they had the four coastal districts linked up and acting under a system of local government they would be better able to see whether they should be part of the city or not. It appears that he is proposing to set up this borough, not because he is certain it is the best thing to do, but in order to have a good look at it after it is set up before making up his mind to see whether it should be destroyed.  That argument, though not relied on to-night, is quite as sensible as some of the arguments upon which he did rely and with which I now propose to deal.  He told us that in relation to housing, administration from the City Hall in Dublin was likely to prove much less efficient than administration by a special local council established to look after local interests.  The argument is one which I am sure will increase the enthusiasm of the citizens of Pembroke and Rathmines for the Bill. Surely if it is not possible for the administration from the City Hall in Dublin to deal effectively with housing in Blackrock it is equally impossible for that administration to deal effectively with housing in Rathgar.</P>
    <P>The whole argument is, however, a criticism of the managerial system. Surely the air of Dun Laoghaire is not so much better than the air in Dublin that the Manager with an office situated in Cork Hill is necessarily less efficient than a manager with his office situated in Dun Laoghaire Town Hall.  Apparently the Minister seems to think that that is the case.  Everything that can be done by a coastal borough council for the improvement of housing conditions in the coastal borough area <Col N="737" /> could be done also by the City Council and a lot more, because the City Council would have not merely greater financial resources at its disposal, but also greater resources in technical skill and machinery for dealing with matters of that kind. The Minister's contention that there would not be proper touch between the people concerned and the council is, in my opinion, not worth serious consideration.  Surely there would be just as much direct touch between the representatives of Dun Laoghaire at the City Council as there would be between the representatives of Dun Laoghaire at the Dun Laoghaire Council.</P>
    <P>The Minister, however, utterly destroyed the whole case which he had himself advanced for the establishment of the managerial system when he said that if the responsibility for dealing with housing in Dun Laoghaire were put on the City Council, it would result in five years' talk and argument before anything would be done.  If the managerial system is going to result in five years' talk and argument in the City Council of Dublin, then the Minister should mend his hand even at this late stage, withdraw the Bill and save the ratepayers from that fate.  The Minister did not tell us why the problem of dealing properly with housing in Dun Laoghaire was not going to result in five years' talk in the Dun Laoghaire Council.  The systems to be established in both cases are identical.  If the problem of housing in Dun Laoghaire is going to have such disastrous results in Dublin, if the coastal borough is included in Dublin, why is it not going to have equally disastrous results under the separate administration by the coastal borough?  I believe when the Minister was advancing that argument he must have felt that it was groundless, but he thought, perhaps, that it might read well and that it would serve as some justification to the citizens of Dun Laoghaire for depriving them of the manifest advantages which amalgamation with the City of Dublin would give them.</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of services <Col N="738" /> in respect of which it can be shown that substantial advantages would come to the ratepayers of both areas from amalgamation.  I do not think that it is necessary that we should show that these advantages would come.  I think the onus is on the Minister to show that disadvantages would come.  I nevertheless think that the advantages are so substantial that the case for the separation of the two areas falls to the ground.  We hear a lot about rationalisation these days.  What we are asking the Dáil to do is to rationalise the local government services in Dublin. Surely there must be economy as a result of the placing of important public services under a unified control in the Dublin City area.  The roads were referred to.  The Minister seems to think that if there were unified control the roads and the back streets would not be kept clean. I do not know how the Minister arrived at that conclusion.  It seems to be another criticism of the managerial system.  I am not at all sure that the Commissioner system has resulted in the cleansing of the back streets.</P>
    <P>Judging by the complaints I receive in that connection, the back streets are not clean at the moment. I believe they are just as much likely to be clean if there is unified control of the cleansing services in Dublin as there is if the coastal borough is established.  The argument is one that does not need to be taken seriously.  There is, further, a possible saving on the cleansing of the streets as a result of the fact that there would not necessarily be dual control.</P>
    <P>I am sure that if the City Council were considering the renewal of the contract with the firm now engaged in the city areas for the proposed Greater Dublin area, they would be able to effect it at a lower cost than the aggregate cost of the two contracts&mdash;one for the city area and one for the coastal borough area. The same thing applies to the question of road construction.  There is a possibility of a saving in relation to the managerial cost and to the <Col N="739" /> supply of equipment.  In relation to practically every main service it can be shown that substantial economy will result or substantial advantages will be gained by amalgamation.</P>
    <P>The question of main drainage has been mentioned.  It has been pointed out that there are at the moment two drainage systems, and that some form of dual control will be necessary; therefore, I do suggest that we consider this question of drainage from a point of view other than the cost.  It cannot be seriously contended by any party that the citizens of Dublin have no interest in the fact that the drainage from Malahide is being discharged into the sea in a manner likely to imperil the Velvet Strand at Portmarnock.  It may be argued that that concerns Malahide only, and that if they make a saving of a few pence in the rates it is a matter that concerns them only.  But the Velvet Strand is a place that is likely to be destroyed as a seaside resort as one of the great attractions to the poorer classes of the citizens of Dublin.  It would pay the Dublin Council to incur the cost of improving the drainage service at Malahide if, as a result, the Velvet Strand was saved as a health resort for the poorer people of the Dublin slums.</P>
    <P>The same also applies to the coastal borough area.  The sewage from the coastal borough area is being discharged untreated into Dublin Bay in a manner likely to result in disimprovement of this place as a seaside resort.  It would pay the people of Dublin to bear the cost of a system of drainage in the coastal borough if as a result the attractiveness of Merrion, Blackrock and Dun Laoghaire for the poor people of the slums was increased, giving facilities for bathing, and so on, in these places. In that particular connection there is a very real community of interest between the residents of Dublin and the residents of the coastal borough.</P>
    <P>The Minister seemed to argue that no difficulty was likely to arise in the matter of a water supply.  There is an arrangement at present by <Col N="740" /> which the coastal townships buy their water from the City of Dublin.  That surely is an argument in favour of amalgamation.  It cannot be advanced as an argument in favour of establishing two distinct areas. Merely because some modus vivendi has been effected is no reason why the obvious advantages of unification should be lost.  I am not sure how far the existing water supply of the city is adequate.  We have contracted to supply water to areas outside the coastal borough.  We have contracted to supply water to Bray. Last year, when there was a shortage, we were unable to carry out the contract, and the citizens of Bray had to go without Vartry water for some time.  That would seem to suggest that it would be in the interests of the residents of the coastal borough area that they should have more direct control over the water supply than they have at present. They have no control at present except that they get an amount of water which they require at a price fixed by the Dublin Council.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the matter mentioned by Deputy Good in respect to the fire-fighting services.  It is surely obvious that this service could be, if not cheapened, at least increased in efficiency if there was unified control over the whole area. I am inclined to agree with Deputy Good that the existing fire-fighting apparatus in the township of Pembroke is inadequate to deal with possible contingencies that might arise.  I do not know what formalities would have to be completed before they could get the assistance of the Dublin fire brigade.  Would it be necessary under the present circumstances for the Pembroke Council to meet and pass a resolution deciding to ask for the brigade, or would it be necessary for the Dublin Council to meet and pass a resolution deciding that the fire brigade should go?  The formalities may not be as foolish as that, but it has happened in the past that damage to property resulted from the fact that these barriers existed in the City of Dublin between administrative areas.  As far as I know, <Col N="741" /> there is no fire-fighting apparatus at all in certain of these coastal townships and the provision of such apparatus would be one of the first duties of the coastal borough&mdash;or at least the provision of more adequate apparatus than they will take over from the existing townships.  That expense would be saved if the coastal townships could be secured the services of the existing apparatus in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of other services in respect of which I think it can be shown that unified control will result either in a saving or in increased efficiency.  I mentioned a number of services during the Second Reading debate and I asked the Minister to show how their efficiency could be increased by dual control.  The President, in the course of his speech on that occasion, pointed out that these services would not be exercised by the borough council at all, but would remain to the county council in respect of the borough council area.  I do not think that was an answer to my question. What I asked was how the effectiveness of these services in the city, including in the term &ldquo;city&rdquo; the coastal borough area, will be increased by dual control whether that control is exercised by the city council on the one side and the borough council on the other, or by the city council as against the county council.  The mere fact that the services will be administered by the county council will not increase their efficiency beyond the point that could be attained if there was unified control over the whole area.</P>
    <P>It is, however, clear that there is no argument, in relation to any of these services, in favour of the establishment of a coastal borough. The only arguments advanced in favour of it are the two relied on by the Minister in his speech this evening. First, that it is unwise to extend the area of the city to too great an extent at once, and, secondly, that the inclusion of the coastal borough in the city would so interfere with administration that it would be almost impossible to carry <Col N="742" /> on.  I think I have shown that in relation to these arguments the Minister's case is untenable.  The extra step which the amendment asks us to take is negligible in comparison with that which the Minister asks us to take.  The area which it is proposed to take is less than half the population and valuation of the combined areas of Rathmines and Pembroke.  The population which will be left under the administration of the county council is, in fact, greater than that in many areas in regard to which county council administration has proved effective.  The same applies to the valuation of the area left under the control of the county council.</P>

      <P>I do not know.  I think the figures of the existing valuation are £919,000.  The rateable valuation of the following counties is lower than Dublin even after Pembroke, Rathmines, Rathgar, Dalkey and Killiney, are excluded, namely, Carlow, Cavan, Clare, Donegal, Kerry, Kildare, Kilkenny, Leix, Leitrim, Longford, Louth, Mayo, Monaghan, Offaly, Roscommon, Sligo, Tipperary (North Riding), Waterford, Westmeath, Wexford, Wicklow.  The area in respect of the rateable valuation of Dublin County Council, even after the coastal borough has been included in the city, will remain one of the largest in Ireland.  I do not think that there is any force in the Minister's contention that the needs of the residents in the coastal areas will get any better consideration from the coastal borough council than they will get from the city council.  I believe that the city council would be just as anxious to develop these areas and make them attractive parts of the city as the coastal borough council <Col N="743" /> could possibly be.  As Deputy MacEntee pointed out, the persons who initiated the campaign for the establishment of a coastal borough have since modified their opinions to the extent that they want a conjoint board set up to deal with the main services of water supply, sewerage and housing.  If these main services are to be handed over to a conjoint board no reason remains for the establishment of a borough council at all.  The Minister said, in justification of the proposal to establish a borough, as distinct from an urban council, that the former administration would be superior but he did not give any arguments to justify that contention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out, the population of the proposed coastal borough will be substantially less than the existing population of Rathmines and Rathgar, yet the urban council administration proved effective in that district.  If the Minister is set on the plan of amalgamating the four coastal townships into one area and of excluding it from the city, I think he should listen to the suggestion that instead of exalting that unit into a borough status he should leave it as an urban district, because that would make it possible to consider the question of amalgamation in the near future, or at whatever time it became obvious, in the opinion of the citizens, that amalgamation should take place.  I ask him to consider the suggestion of Deputy Corish that if he is determined that these areas should not be included in the city, they should be left as they are.  They have managed to pull along fairly well up to the present and, if they are left as they are, there will be no insuperable barrier to extension.  If the coastal borough is set up, it will become a definite impediment to the extension of the city southward.  The Minister is, I am sure, aware that those who have been advocating the establishment of a coastal borough are already agitating for increased powers and for an extension of the boundaries so as to include certain parts of the county.  That agitation will grow <Col N="744" /> and the borough powers will be strengthened so that it will be almost impossible to bring control of the whole area under the city council.</P>
    <P>I said on Second Reading, and I still believe, that the main reason that the Government decided on the establishment of a coastal borough was political.  I think that they did not take into consideration, or give their main consideration to, the welfare of the ratepayers of the areas as such.  I believe that they were influenced by the fact that an agitation for the establishment of a coastal borough existed in the area and they were anxious to placate and get support for their Party from those people.  I believe that Dun Laoghaire Harbour, where most distinguished foreign visitors arrive, was also taken into consideration by them when they decided to crown this arrangement with a mayor. What is the necessity for a mayor? What case has been made in support of the proposal to establish a mayor in the coastal borough?  If there must be a council for that area let it be definitely subordinate to the city council and let it be presided over by a chairman, like Rathmines and Pembroke.  Why it is to be given the dignity of having a mayor I do not know, unless the Government knew that the chances were that the mayor would be an individual holding the same political outlook as themselves and would, therefore, be fit to associate with them when they are standing on Dun Laoghaire Pier receiving distinguished visitors.  If the Minister gave, for including these proposals in the Bill, good political reasons, as I have advanced, I could, as I suggest, understand it.  He could get them passed, no doubt, by the usual majority here.  He has, however, decided to base his case upon the argument that the establishment of a coastal borough is to the advantage of the ratepayers.  That argument, as I think, has been proved by every speaker against him to be groundless. The welfare of the ratepayers of the coastal borough and of those of the City of Dublin will best be served by amalgamating the two <Col N="745" /> areas.  As this is a non-Party measure, and as Deputies are free to vote in accordance with their convictions, I hope that these areas will be amalgamated and I ask the House therefore to pass this amendment.</P>

      <P>Do I understand that the President said that this cannot be a non-party measure in which every Deputy would be entitled to vote according to his personal wishes?  Can we have an assurance from the Minister himself that he will so consider it?  It would alter the whole atmosphere of the discussion on the Bill.  Having asked for that assurance from these benches, surely the House should not expect the request to be treated with contempt. Are we going to get this assurance that this will be regarded as a non-Party measure on which every Deputy will be entitled to express his convictions in the Division Lobby without the pressure of the Party Whips?  I am amazed that we have not received that assurance which has been asked for.</P>

      <P>I was rather puzzled in the course of the speech of Deputy Lemass as to what he was driving at until he came to the end of his speech.  Then I was satisfied that Deputy Lemass sees nothing either in this House or outside it except through political spectacles. He sees this measure through political spectacles.  He can form no judgment on this matter or any other matter except by viewing it through political spectacles.  It is quite in accordance with that particular frame of mind that we should be invited to give expression to the view as to whether or not this is to be a Party measure, having had the strongest Party speech on it and having had every other possible indication from the far side of the House that the Party opposite were looking at this measure in a Party manner.</P>

The Government had never approached the situation in that way but they had some difficulty in dealing with questions like that in the Dáil where they were up against people who were not discussing the matter on its merits.&rdquo;&ldquo;There was no intention on the part of the Government to deal with it as a Party measure.&rdquo;  That means on non-Party lines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that there is any difference between that and what I was saying. I was just pointing out that Deputies opposite always invite the whole House to look at a measure in a non-Party way, every member of the Party having made up his mind or having been told to make up his mind to vote in a particular way. Reading Deputy Lemass's speeches during the week-end I was convinced that he never approaches any subject except on the one basis&mdash; viewing it through political spectacles. He amused himself during the week-end denouncing everybody. He reminds me of the Pharise who, as I told a Dublin audience a short time ago, was referred to by Swift as on no occasion feeling so holy as when he is making an open confession of the Publican's sins.  Now this is Deputy Lemass's idea of a non-political discussion.  I was wondering what he was driving at when he referred to unified control and efficiency.  Unify control and you are going to have efficiency! I was rather puzzled at another part of his speech, and his references to the new City of Dublin, and at the statement that when Dun Laoghaire, Blackrock and Killiney are all added to the new city, the new representatives on the Corporation will be as much interested in housing in Blackrock, Killiney or Dun <Col N="747" /> Laoghaire as they are in housing in the City of Dublin.  I was a representative on the Dublin Corporation for quite a number of years.  The Deputy had not that advantage.  He came here as a juvenile.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>When I went into the Corporation in 1909 the previous extension of the city boundaries had been in operation for something like nine years and there was considerable agitation in the Corporation then.  The agitation was in respect of certain undertakings that had arisen out of the extension of the boundaries in 1900.  One of these matters was that Clontarf was to get the advantage of the main drainage system which they had not got up to that time.  Another was that the sloblands were to be laid out as a park and that had not been done up to that time.  Speaking from recollection I should state there was no extension of housing in Glasnevin, Clontarf or Drumcondra up to that time.  There was quite a considerable number of houses, however, built in Inchicore where the sites were very cheap. To say that by amalgamating Dun Laoghaire, Blackrock and Killiney with the new city, the two or three members returned from each area in Dublin are going effectively to deal with the housing problems in these areas, is asking us to believe a good deal.  Certainly it would surprise me if they could not do this work locally much more efficiently if they were so minded, and do it more effectively by concentrating their energies entirely on problems which in many aspects differ greatly from those of the City of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy went on to compare certain services, excluding all the time from his observations what the effect of this proposal would be&mdash; whether if he were a member of the Dublin Corporation, he would recommend the Corporation, supposing this Bill were never introduced, to promote a Bill with a view to extending <Col N="748" /> the boundary out as far as Dalkey, or whether he would be prepared to pay the price in which that particular extension might possibly involve the city.  His solution, of course, is a different one.  There are several counties with smaller valuations, but they are not counties whose valuation is to be cut into two and which are expected to continue the services for the remaining districts.  I wonder did the Deputy bother making up what is likely to be the cost of the existing services on the county after this revision of the valuation?  The present cost of the services it seems is £470,000, of which £120,000 comes from Government sources.  A sum of something like £350,000 is levied in rates.  A considerable portion of that comes off here.  I observe there is no amendment from the Deputy or from anybody else in connection with Section 17, which seeks to arrange for any financial adjustments that are necessary. I wonder did the Deputy concern himself with the fact that he was handing over from one body to another the services already administered by a pre-existing body and that by unifying these bodies he is going to increase the costs by adding something else?  He did not consider that point.</P>

      <P>Urban services and county services.  He is going to unify the two. He is going to take two existing transactions and put them into one but as to the cost that will be entailed with the transfer that takes place from the county council to the city, who is going to pay that? Very lightly we talk about the fire brigade.  Reference is made to the Pembroke fire brigade not, perhaps, being equal to its present job.  I do not know what is to be said on that. The statement was made that there is to be more efficient service.  Is the more efficient service likely to result without extra cost?  Deputy Lemass's simple answer to that is to unify and get efficiency.  With unification everything is to be less costly.  You <Col N="749" /> are going to have better services and lower prices.  Is it likely?</P>

      <P>The new name for the Party opposite will be the £30,000,000 Budget Party, if they do all these things.  In the same way you can do everything in the City of Dublin if you spend more money, and to spend more money, more money will have to be levied in rates.  The fact of the matter is Deputies have not considered in this question what is involved under Section 17 to the rates in the city. Bear in mind there would possibly be an addition from one penny to a shilling in the £ extra, or if I do not say extra, that would have to be paid to the county by reason of this loss of valuable property, and I do not know whether or not members of the Corporation would be anxious to extend the boundaries.  Deputies say in relation to the Fire Brigade that they would have more service. Yes, but someone would have to pay for it.  They cannot have more water.  They are getting in a supply in good order and condition, no matter how many people are drinking it.  The electric light mentioned by Deputy Good would be there.  No one is going to interfere with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy spoke of sewerage.  I do not know whether he had in mind the Rathmines and Rathgar sewerage or the Blackrock and Dun Laoghaire sewerage, but they are three separate systems.  In one case certainly it would be a great advantage <Col N="750" /> to connect up the Rathmines and Rathgar sewerage with the city, but it is going to cost money.  It costs money in two ways.  First, with regard to the connection &mdash; I do not know how much that will cost &mdash; and secondly with regard to the pumping. When it comes down to the outfall works it has got to be pumped.  More accommodation is necessary, storage, and so on; the Deputy brushes all that aside.  Unification, greater efficiency at a lesser cost&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all brushed lightly aside by Deputy Lemass, talking about unification, more efficiency, less cost and not bothering his head to go into any one of the three problems.  It is the worst statement on any subject that I have heard from the Deputy, and as I said the whole fault in the speech was in the finish; having failed to go into the cost, floundering along hopelessly and muddling into deeper water all the time, he asked: &ldquo;What is the meaning of it?&mdash;it is political.&rdquo;  I have a document in my hand, dated 1924, the Dun Laoghaire, Blackrock and Dalkey Borough Bill, introduced here in the Oireachtas.  That is their own proposal.  In considering what was the best thing to be done in connection with the Report of the Commission, we decided that any further extension of what was embodied in the Bill would not be in the best interests of the ratepayers and the citizens of Dublin and bearing in mind that those other districts were not going to be brought in, we gave <Col N="752" /> attention and car to their proposal to form a coastal borough.  It is their own wish.  All the things that are condemned, or most of them, are what were asked for by these people who were prepared to back their proposal with their money.  A Bill was introduced here, and we have the allegation that this was a political Bill by a Deputy who was probably a Minister for Defence outside in another Government at the time we were bringing it in.</P>

      <P>Party Whips.  I hope the Deputy will persuade the Whip opposite to take them off, but whether he takes them off or not, I know the way his Party will vote. When we are invited to discuss anything on a non-Party basis here it is always on the assumption that the other party are not doing it.  As I said, this amendment is likely to add very considerably to the cost by reason of the changes which will not result in greater efficiency. It is an unbalanced proposal.  It is not a proposal which would in my view pass a meeting of the representatives of the Dublin Corporation if they were sitting, knowing all the circumstances of the case, and it is introduced in the words of the Deputy as a full-blooded political manoeuvre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>After listening to the speech of the President and bearing in mind the speech of the Minister for Local Government when he was introducing this measure, the one thing that is borne in upon me is the appalling animus which the President and the members of the Executive Council seem to bear towards the innocent inhabitants of the urban districts of Blackrock, <Col N="753" /> Dun Laoghaire, Dalkey, Killiney and Ballybrack.  The whole burden of their speeches has been that these people are not going to be permitted to live in healthy surroundings, to be provided with proper sewerage, drainage, and water supply at the expense of the inhabitants of the City of Dublin.  The proposal which the House is now considering has just been characterised by the President as an unbalanced one.  Let us consider some of the factors in the Bill and determine for ourselves whether the proposal which we have advanced or the proposal for which the President and the Minister for Local Government have made themselves responsible is likely to create the greater want of balance.  Let us consider the rateable valuations of the areas concerned.  The rateable combined valuation of the townships of Pembroke and Rathmines is £337,000; the rateable valuation of the coastal urban districts is £167,000; the rateable valuation of the City of Dublin, I think, is £1,335,000.  If the Minister adds to that an area having a rateable valuation of £337,000 he creates an area having a valuation of £1,670,000. That, according to the President, does not become an unbalanced proposition.  The whole still retains its symmetry and balance.  In the eyes of the President to add to that an area having a valuation just one-tenth of the whole, increasing the valuation from £1,670,000 to £1,830,000 overturns the whole structure. It becomes top-heavy and unbalanced. That is the sort of argument the House is asked to consider. That is the proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I say if the City of Dublin can sustain an addition of £337,000 in rateable value and still remain a balanced proposition a further addition of £167,000 is not going to create an unbalanced area or is not an unbalanced proposition <Col N="754" /> to present.  Consider the argument from the other point of view, from the point of view of effect upon the County of Dublin.  At the present moment Dublin County has a rateable valuation of £919,453.  If we include Pembroke and Rathmines in the city as is proposed in the Bill it immediately reduces that valuation to £582,000.  If you do what we are asking you to do, to include the coastal urban districts, the rateable value will be further reduced but it will be reduced much less in proportion than by the proposal which the President submits to you.  After excluding Blackrock, Dún Laoghaire.  Killiney, Ballybrack and Dalkey as well as Rathmines and Pembroke, the new valuation will be £414,000.  If you are justified in reducing the rateable value of the county of Dublin from £919,000 to something like £582,000 there is no valid argument, all other things being equal, and the balance of the argument being in favour of having a unified urbanised area under the control of the one authority and embracing all those communities who live side by side, which are dependent upon each other, and one of which&mdash;Blackrock and Dún Laoghaire&mdash;is economically entirely dependent on the City of Dublin, why, because you are going to reduce the rateable value of the County of Dublin from £582,000 to £414,000, you should go against commonsense and exclude Blackrock and Dún Laoghaire from the new city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Supposing you do include Blackrock and Dún Laoghaire in the city and, therefore, take them out of the county, what is going to be the position of the county in relation to the other counties of Ireland? The County of Dublin with the areas of Dún Laoghaire and Blackrock and Killiney and Dalkey included in the city and excluded from the county will still have a greater rateable valuation than any other county in Ireland with the exceptions of Cork and Galway. It will have a greater rateable valuation than Cavan.  Carlow, Clare, Kildare, Donegal, Kerry, Kilkenny. <Col N="755" /> Leix, Leitrim, Limerick, Longford, Louth, Mayo, Meath, Monaghan, Offaly, Roscommon, Sligo, Tipperary North Riding, Tipperary South Riding, Waterford, Westmeath, Wexford, and Wicklow.</P>
    <P>Consider it again from the point of view of the population or, first, from the point of view of the revenue to be derived from the rates. At the present moment, I think, the total revenue derived from the rates or by contributions from the urban districts in lieu of rates to the County Dublin is something like £456,518.  That was the amount derived from the rates for 1927-28.  If we include Pembroke and Rathmines in the city, the revenue from rates or from contributions in lieu of rates to the County of Dublin will be £378,983.  If you include, in addition to Pembroke and Rathmines, the coastal urban district in the city, the residual revenue of the County Dublin will be £344,639. The Minister comes to the House and asks you to accept a proposition which is going to reduce the rateable revenues of the County of Dublin from £456,000 to £378,000 and then he asks you to reject a proposition which has, as I said, commonsense and argument to support it.  He asks you to reject that proposition upon the grounds that it is unbalanced, though if you reduce the rateable revenue of the County of Dublin by £150,000 the proposition is a valid one and does not create a want of balance in the eyes of the President. When you ask him to go a little further with a proposition that has every reasonable argument to support it he asks you to reject it on the ground that if you agree to a further reduction of revenue of £32,000, still leaving the County of Dublin with a revenue from rates or contributions in lieu of rates of £344,000&mdash;a revenue that would be higher than that of any of the counties of Carlow, Cavan, Clare, Donegal, Kerry, Kildare, Kilkenny, Leix, Leitrim, Limerick, Longford, Louth, Mayo, Meath, Monaghan, Offaly, Roscommon, Sligo, Tipperary North Riding, Tipperary South Riding, <Col N="756" /> Waterford, Westmeath, Wexford and Wicklow&mdash;it is an unbalanced proposal.  The inclusion of the coastal urban districts would still leave the County of Dublin with a greater revenue from rates than any other county in Ireland, with the exception of two&mdash;Cork and Galway. Yet our proposition is described as &ldquo;unbalanced.&rdquo;  Our proposition would put the County of Dublin in the same &ldquo;unbalanced&rdquo; position as twenty-five of the twenty-seven administrative county areas in the Free State.</P>
    <P>Again, consider the question from the point of view of population.  The present population of the County of Dublin is 188,000.  The Minister comes before you with a proposition which is going to reduce that population to 115,000.  Our proposition would, admittedly, reduce that further and would leave the County of Dublin with a population of 80,000. The Minister is asking you to deprive the County of Dublin of 73,000 &mdash;almost 40 per cent. of its population&mdash;and he asks you to jib at the idea of accepting a proposition which would reduce that population a little further and leave it 80,000. That would still leave County Dublin with a greater population than counties Carlow, Kildare, Kilkenny, Leix, Longford, Louth, Offaly, Meath, Wicklow, Waterford City, Leitrim, Sligo, Monaghan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am afraid the Deputy is not correct in his figures. The present population of the county is 188,961.  The proposed population, according to this Bill, is 104,649.  If the Deputy's proposal were carried, the population of the county would be 64,570.</P>

      <P>The figures I have quoted may be subject to correction because of the fact that I was unable to get the figures for the added rural areas.  At any rate, the figures do not affect the validity of the argument I am putting up&mdash;that our proposition is a balanced one, that it is a natural one, and that if it is accepted the County of Dublin will not become such an uneconomic administrative area as the Minister <Col N="757" /> endeavoured to convince the House it would be.  Even if the inclusion of the coastal urban districts in the city were to involve a reorganisation of the county administration, what would be the effect of that upon the inhabitants of the county, who are the people with whom I am concerned for the moment?  The Minister himself said that if these areas were included in the County of Dublin the consequent administrative changes in the county would be such that the county rate in North County Dublin would be reduced by 2/6 in the £ and the South County Dublin rate would be reduced by 1/- in the £.  As well as that, he said that instead of having, as we have at present, three county councils administering the area of Counties Dublin, Meath and Wicklow, we would be able to dispense with one of these three and would only require two of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned, and the Deputies who sit for County Dublin are concerned, at the present moment, with the effect on our own constituents.  But I believe that if the amalgamation which the Minister mentioned were to take place it would involve no increase in the rates of Meath or Wicklow.  You would have a larger and richer area going into Meath, and with a larger population you would have such economies in the administration of the joint areas that you would be able to reduce the rates in Meath as well as in North County Dublin.  At any rate, the Minister's own admission is that if this proposal were accepted by the Dáil there would be a reduction in the rates in North County Dublin of 2/6 in the £, and in South County Dublin of 1/- in the £.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I only rose to deal with the arguments advanced by the President.  I think everything which the Minister has said has been fully and completely answered by Deputy Lemass. We are not looking at this matter <Col N="758" /> through Party spectacles.  If we were regarding it as a Party question, Deputy Good and I would probably look at it from different ends of the telescope.  From a Party point of view, I do not think we have a single thing in common.  But we have this in common &mdash; we both represent the people of County Dublin.  When you find that Deputy Good's views and my views coincide, as they do, on a matter like this, you may be perfectly certain that neither of us approaches the question from a Party standpoint.  This amendment has not been put down from the point of view of party.  It has been put down after careful and detailed consideration of the case. We cannot see a single reason, as I have stressed time and again, why Pembroke and Rathmines should be included and why Blackrock, Dalkey and Dun Laoghaire should be excepted.  These communities conflict in no way.  They are wholly in concord with one another, and therefore, they ought to be administered by one authority.  The Minister said that if Dun Laoghaire and Blackrock were included in the city, their local interests would not be safeguarded or secured.  I think that is a very weak argument, to say the least.  If there is any validity in the Minister's argument, then the central principle of the Minister's Bill&mdash;the principle of city managership&mdash;stands condemned.  According to the Minister's theory, we are to have an effective City Manager, who is going to do his duty to the citizens as a whole, and who is not going to be swayed, as corporations were formerly swayed, by mere class or party interests.  That City Manager, if he does his duty as laid down in this Bill, will see that the development of Blackrock and Dun Laoghaire will proceed step by step with the development of every other area under his control.  He will see that the interests of the citizens of Blackrock and Dun Laoghaire will not be neglected or placed second to the interests of the citizens of any other part of the city.  If Blackrock and Dun Laoghaire require housing &mdash;and they do require housing&mdash;I <Col N="759" /> am perfectly certain, if the City Manager carries out his duties in the spirit which this House hopes he will, the interests of these areas as regards housing will not be neglected in any way.</P>
    <P>A point was made about area.  It appeared to me that the Minister, by making that point, failed altogether to consider the general tendency in civic development at the present moment.  Look at the millions of money that Dublin has spent in endeavouring to reduce the density of its population in certain areas.  The whole tendency of modern communities is to spread themselves over the greatest possible area, in order to reduce the evils which have followed upon overcrowding.  In fact, the proposition I would put up is this&mdash; that the bigger the area the better the city and the healthier the population.  The argument the Minister has advanced for keeping these districts outside the city is the very argument that, if he considered at all the health of the general body of the citizens, he would advance for bringing these areas in.  They are not densely populated but the City of Dublin is densely populated, and the natural tendency of the city should be to develop along that seaboard and not to develop to any greater extent inland than it is developing at present &mdash; not to develop disproportionately inland &mdash; as it will be compelled to do if the Minister's proposals are carried.  If those proposals are carried, a barrier will be set to the development in the direction of Dun Laoghaire and Blackrock and the city will be compelled to develop inland.</P>
    <P>The point was also made that I have an amendment down dealing with the size of the Corporation of Dun Laoghaire and Blackrock, and that because I suggest that it would be beneficial to the new borough to have a larger council than the Minister proposes, I have admitted that Blackrock and Dun Laoghaire require a separate civic authority.  I have made no such admission.  That has no relation whatsoever to the <Col N="760" /> proposal to include Blackrock and Dun Laoghaire in the city.  It is only put down there to minimise the effect of the Minister's obstinacy in refusing to accept the proposal to include Blackrock and Dalkey in the city.  If Blackrock and Dalkey are to be included in the city, I am perfectly certain an arrangement can be made to ensure that they get reasonable representation on the city corporation. If Blackrock and Dun Laoghaire would not get reasonable representation on the corporation, if included in the city, what is to be said about Pembroke and Rathmines? They are being brought in and there is no plea that they are not going to get reasonable representation or that their views will not be listened to in civic affairs.  The fact of the matter is that if the Minister's theory of city managership is sound, the size of the representation matters very little; it is the quality of it that will count; because if the citizens of Blackrock and Dun Laoghaire return men who are fit to be their representatives, fit to advance their point of view in the council, then the well-directed and well-founded criticism of these members of the corporation will ensure that the City Manager will do his duty to those districts.  Therefore, I emphasise that if the Minister's own theory about city managership and its effectiveness is sound and well founded, there is nothing in the argument that if you bring in Blackrock and Dun Laoghaire you will not be able to give them that representation in the corporation which will ensure that the interests of these districts will be looked after.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I was anxious, when I spoke a short time ago on this Bill, to lift it out of the atmosphere of Party politics.  I must say that I am sadly disappointed that the President and the Minister have not given some assistance in that direction. I think this is a Bill in dealing with which we might all co-operate in the interests of the capital of our country.  I am still hopeful that the President and the Minister may see their way to co-operate in that direction.  I listened with interest as one always does to the President, but I could not help asking myself as the President concluded, what is the object of this Bill.  If we are not to get greater efficiency and economy from amalgamation what is the object of the Bill?  One would rather gather from the arguments of the President, particularly in the two instances he gave us, that we might get greater efficiency, but certainly we do not get greater economy under this proposal.  I ask if we are not going to get economy under this proposal what good is it going to confer upon the city?  I am not quite sure we are going to get greater efficiency.  There is a view held, and I think rightly so, in Rathmines and Pembroke that there is as great efficiency there at the moment as there is likely to come under the new administration.  If you are not going to give greater efficiency and economy what is the use of the Bill?  The President told us, and I was rather surprised to hear it from him, that in the matter of housing we were likely to get better results by reason of the local representation that the coastal borough would have and the concentrated consideration that would be given to this problem by the local authority, that is, the new coastal borough.  My experience in these matters is that under a large centralised Department, such as we would expect to see in the City of Dublin controlling the larger area you would get in that Department the knowledge and experience and the information about housing, and <Col N="762" /> views on housing that it would be impossible to get from any small localised authority.  Would that experience and knowledge when placed at the service of the coastal borough not be an advantage to the coastal borough and to the city, because we would then have the problem looked upon as a whole problem and the coastal borough as portion of that problem instead of looking at it through isolated units at the present?  From that aspect&mdash; and I agree with other Deputies that housing is one of the most important problems we have to deal with&mdash;I am satisfied that under a unified system better consideration would be given to housing than is given to it at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President said: &ldquo;If you are going to have a centralised fire brigade that is going to cost more money.&rdquo;  I do not think the President was serious there.  The President knows that the fire brigades under these authorities are isolated units.  What we want under a centralised department is that should an emergency arise all these units will be brought together to deal with the difficulty.  You cannot do that at the moment.  That can be done without any additional expense whatever, and in that way you would get greater efficiency.  I was much interested in what Deputy Thrift said, because as we know, Deputy Thrift gives a great deal of thought to any problem upon which he expresses an opinion in this House.  But Deputy Thrift's fear about this Bill was quite a fair and reasonable one.  He said he was quite in favour of centralising, but he said let us do it in steps.  With that view I am in accord.  That is the attitude we have adopted on several occasions, and in regard to several Bills in this House.  Let us take the Shannon Scheme.  The Shannon Board absorbs various areas as it is prepared to administrate in those areas, and it only takes over those areas when it is prepared to deal with them.  Let us apply the same principle to this Bill. Give the Minister power to absorb <Col N="763" /> those areas when he feels his Department is competent to deal with them, so as not to clog the machinery.  I agree with Deputy Thrift if you throw all these local authorities on a Government Department at the moment, you will clog the machinery.  You must do it in steps.  Deputies will remember that when we were dealing with the raising of the school age under the School Attendance Bill some years ago, we came to the conclusion that we would clog the existing administration of the schools if we were to throw the additional pupils into them.  What did we do?  We gave the Minister authority; we approved of the principle, and said: &ldquo;As soon as you find your administration is capable of dealing with these additional units you should have power to take them in.&rdquo;  What I want done with this Bill is that when we have an opportunity of dealing with the problem as a whole, to view it from the larger standpoint, to try to visualise if we can what extension will be necessary within the next twenty years, and to provide for that.  Let that provision be made so that it can be adopted in stages.  What I object to in connection with this Bill is that instead of dealing with it from that point of view we deal with it from a narrow and small-minded point of view.</P>
    <P>I urge upon the Minister that from the view of centralisation of services this is a matter that is bound to come up.  The majority of the different services that will be administered by the coastal borough are services which in the next twenty years are bound to be centralised in the city.  If we are going to get as a whole more efficient services from centralisation in the centre of the city what is the advantage of setting up this coastal borough? Once you set up all these authorities there is the greatest difficulty in getting rid of them.  They become vested interests and become a difficult problem.  It is easier to solve in the first instance than if you set up these authorities and have to get <Col N="764" /> rid of them eventually.  I urge upon the Minister unless he sees clearly the necessity for setting up this authority that it is highly undesirable it should be set up.  I would also urge that in connection with this whole problem, not only as regards this particular coastal borough but possibly extensions on the other side of the city, that we should try to visualise these extensions, and make provision for them in this Bill, and let this development arise out of this Bill as the particular areas develop.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be prepared to put a clause into the Bill that would require an examination in five years' time to meet Deputy Good's point about the extension for a number of years&mdash;a clause that would require a quinquennial inquiry into the situation as regards what amalgamations or extensions of the control over an enlarged area of common services was dictated by the facts brought out at that particular inquiry.  I would be prepared to do that or earlier if between sets of the five-yearly periods any particular set of circumstances arose and that either the Council of the city or the council of the borough make application for that.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee talked of the uncertain things tending to unbalance local bodies such as excessive wealth.  A local body is not a kind of thing that excessive money would unbalance.  Lack of money would do it.  While excessive money would not do it excessive space over which to travel would do it.  That is the main reason why we do not propose to bring in the coastal borough.  It is all very well to say: &ldquo;To add a little coastal borough with its £171,000 valuation into the city is only doing a very little thing in addition to what we are doing.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>If by a little melting process this four miles of coastal borough slipped round the circumference of the city, so as to form the connection here that Rathmines and Pembroke have, then I would bring it in.  But you are asking to bring in an area which is half the present area of the city.  It is an urban area requiring urban services as distinct from the position of the rural areas we are bringing in at present.  With a density of 8.9 you cannot bestraddle and give sufficient urban services to a population that is not dense enough.  So I am absolutely out against taking in the coastal borough at the present moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="766" /> On the point that these urban districts ought not to be brought into the borough at the present moment, but that they should be taken in gradually, according as machinery here in Dublin is capable, or that it was thought desirable to do so, there are economies and efficiency and things that require to be done in the administration of these four urban districts now that can be done if they are amalgamated and if a suitable managerial system is set up there.  I do not think the urban districts that have waited since 1924, because this matter was under general consideration then, should be asked to wait even for five years before setting up machinery that is going to be of material improvement to the situation.</P>

      <P>There is a case for amalgamation now much stronger than any case that could be made once the coastal borough is set up. I think the case made here and that has induced the Minister to offer this particular proposal is one based on the advantage of amalgamating the existing coastal townships into the city, and not a case for the amalgamating of the new coastal borough after it has been established.  As Deputy Good said, the process of forming a coastal borough and subsequently amalgamating it with the city, will be very much more costly than the process of absorbing the existing townships under this Bill into the city.  There will have been established in the meantime not merely specialised staffs for dealing with the problems of the townships, but there will be brought into existence <Col N="768" /> duplicate machinery necessary for the working of street eleaning, road repairing, and matters of that kind.  I think the case made here by Deputy Good and others is one for the amalgamation of these areas with the city now, or, at any rate, leaving the coastal townships as they are until the majority can be persuaded that amalgamation is desirable. The case is one against the setting up of the coastal borough, and thus erecting a barrier in the path of future progress.  I think the Minister's proposal side-steps the case in favour of the amendment.  It does not meet it at all.  It merely appears to offer a concession which is not real.</P>

      <P>No, I think it is better they should be amalgamated.  If the proposal was against the setting up of a coastal borough I would still argue in favour of the inclusion of the coastal townships in the city. Possibly Deputy Good would not. We must recognise that the Bill proposes to set up a coastal borough. The Minister's proposal does not deal with the dangers and objections to that proposal which, in fact, makes it more dangerous and objectionable than originally.  I would ask the Minister, therefore, seriously to consider the advisability of <Col N="769" /> standing down from the position he has taken up.  It may be a difficult thing but the interests of a very large number of citizens are at stake.  There is, in fact, only an artificial demand for this coastal borough.</P>
      <P>I think the majority of the citizens of the capital would prefer that it should not be established, and I think the majority of the citizens of the coastal borough are not convinced that they would gain by its establishment.  There was an artificial agitation at one time that it should be set up.  The Minister, no doubt, was influenced by that.  I think now, after he has heard the Deputies of all Parties representing that area speaking against the proposal, he should have the moral courage to withdraw the proposal no matter how much he might favour it himself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's suggestion has introduced a new element into this&mdash;whether it is better and more economical to proceed immediately with the amalgamation or to do it within five years time.  The way I look on it is if you do not make two bites of the cherry, if you put the townships into the city now, you will be able to make greater reductions in the staff than you could afterwards if you simply set up a coastal borough now.  The setting up of the coastal borough does not necessarily imply that the staffs are going to be dismissed, because the Minister in another section of the Bill proposes to bring in 5,000 acres of a semi-urbanised area which will require development and which in its development will require the employment of engineers and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would seem to me that the practical thing to do now would be to bring in the townships and use the redundant staff, instead of dismissing them or having to pension them, in the development of the semi-urbanised areas which you are going to bring in.  That would be better than having to employ new engineers <Col N="770" /> later to do that work which you will have to do some time, if you leave the townships out now and bring in the added areas.  That will possibly mean that you will have only to pension one or two senior officials, and pension them according to their present responsibility and rate of pay.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if you bring in the coastal borough you will not be able to dispense with your junior staff.  They are going to have increased salaries because you are going to add considerably to their responsibilities, and when the question of amalgamation comes along at a later stage one of the factors that is going to act adversely on the amalgamation will be the fact that you are going then to have considerable responsibility to assume in the way of pensions for redundant officials with wider responsibilities than they have now.  Therefore it would seem to me that the logical deduction from the Minister's own argument would be to anticipate that five years and make the amalgamation now if it is to be made at all.  The Minister admits that within five years this question of amalgamation will have to be considered, and the right thing I submit would be to do it now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me there is not a very great deal of difference between the opinion expressed by Deputy Good just now and that which I expressed earlier. In fact from the opinions expressed on both sides of the House I cannot help thinking that if Deputies sat around a table they would arrive at a conclusion pretty quickly on this matter.  Deputy Good's proposal seems to be that you should bring all the areas under one title right away, or that you should leave the districts that would go under the coastal borough under their own administration separately until such time as the Minister thinks the circumstances and the position would justify their inclusion within the city.  But the idea that I outlined, <Col N="771" /> and which I think the Minister to a certain extent supported, was that the name should be put in the first instance and the development and unification should come later when inquiry shows that a proper stage had been reached for that unification to take place.  There is very little difference between those two propositions.</P>
      <P>I suggest to Deputy MacEntee that he should withdraw his amendment at the present stage and that he should seek a conference in order to get those two propositions put into proper shape in a new amendment which would lead ultimately to what I am glad to say all of us are trying to get in quite a non-Party way.  We want to get the best out of this Bill, without considering the interests of one political Party or another.  We have got an important matter before us and we should try between us to see what is the best solution.  Deputy Good agrees with me that if you take Deputy MacEntee's amendment as it stands it will wreck the whole thing by clogging the wheels.  That would be a serious matter.  The subject requires very careful consideration and we should see in what way we can work this amendment so as to secure a really desirable result, namely, to bring about the amalgamation in stages.</P>

      <P>No, but I say the suggestion of Deputy Thrift can lead us nowhere if we are going to decide that the borough should come into the city.  I think the Deputy will agree with that.  From what both Deputy Thrift and I have said here, what we are going to discuss as far as I can see must be something other than that the borough shall come directly into the city.  I do not think it would help us in any way to call a number of different things by one name.  That would not help us at all.  I would certainly like to dispose of this idea&mdash;whether or not the House wants the coastal borough to come into the city now.  If the House decides on that, then we can see where we are likely to go.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I must enter a protest against that suggestion.  Deputy Thrift understands the position. If the House does not decide whether the borough should or should not come into the city now I do not know what we can discuss.  I offered to Deputy Thrift a quinquennial examination of the situation.  I have stated that I saw reasons why the four urban districts should be allowed to come together into the borough now.  The one thing I see in Deputy Thrift's suggestion is that, accepting that the four urban districts are not coming now into the city, he wants to discuss whether they should be left as separate urban districts so that in any of the examinations that would take place, or in circumstances that might make it appear that Blackrock alone ought to come into the city, there would not be a difficulty that would prevent that; or if circumstances showed that Blackrock or Dun Laoghaire should come in and Dalkey and Killiney should not come in, that there would not be anything to prevent that.  That is the only point I see in <Col N="774" /> Deputy Thrift's suggestion.  Until we know whether the House is going to make the decision that these four urban districts are not going to come into the city now, we cannot go much further with that suggestion. I do not know whether it would be in order, having decided on the present amendment to Section 2, for us to discuss on Section 3 that particular aspect.  It might be possible to give further consideration to the matter before we commit ourselves entirely to the principle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Deputy to give this matter very careful consideration.  If the amendment is withdrawn now, unless it is intended to wreck the Bill it cannot be re-introduced for the simple reason that the Bill is constructed on the basis that there is to be a borough.  The consequences arising out of the passing of the Deputy's amendment would affect about 100 new amendments.  In fact, the Bill would have to be withdrawn, and I am sure the Deputy will realise that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as this <Col N="775" /> measure is concerned, that is so.  It is obvious that the passage of this amendment would affect the four different parts of the Bill, certainly three parts of it.  It would affect two parts so much that it would not matter whether it affected the third part or not.  I am sure that Deputy MacEntee realises that we could not go on with anything else except the two points which arise as matters of principle&mdash;the Manager and the franchise.  You could not go on with anything else to-night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see eye to eye with that point of view at all. To me it appears that the major principle in the Bill is the reconstitution of the Dublin Corporation and the enlargement of the boundary of the city, and the question of the establishment of the coastal borough, except it is a particular fad of the Minister's, is a comparatively minor matter.  If the Minister was prepared to consider Deputy Thrift's suggestion there would be no obstacle to deleting, by agreement, Section 3 and the consequential sections to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not say that it is the official view, but it is my view that if this amendment were to be passed the proper thing for the House to do would be to deal with the Corporation, as to whatever alterations might be considered necessary in its representation, and the Manager, leave it there and let the Corporation promote a Private Bill to carry out the extension of the boundary, having got practically a Second Reading from the House in favour of that.  The financial complications resulting from a reduction of the valuation of the county from £940,000 to approximately £400,000 is something that you cannot have settled in a House like this.  It is too big a proposition.  The county and the city should be heard in regard to a matter of such importance. Whatever possibilities there are for accommodation between them, they ought to be the subject of negotiations between the two parties, but <Col N="776" /> not here.  I suggest if the House passes the Deputy's amendment that that is the course that ought to be adopted in fairness to the county council, to the present corporation in the city, and in fairness to Rathmines, Pembroke, Dalkey and the other places.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understand the President aright, his position is the same as that of Deputy Thrift's&mdash; that for the moment he is wedded to the suggestion in the Bill that the boundaries be only extended to <Col N="777" /> take in Rathmines and Pembroke on the southern side, but that he is not wedded for the moment entirely to the setting up of a borough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, betrothed and not wedded.  That is Deputy Thrift's position.  If the President would agree with the proposition that the immediate setting up of the borough would be dropped we would be prepared to withdraw Deputy MacEntee's amendment.</P>
      <P>We are as anxious about this matter as Deputy Good who, if I may say so with all respect, made one of the most effective speeches which I have heard for a long time in this House on this section.  We are not out to gain any Party advantage out of this Bill.  We are anxious, as, I think is every Deputy who either lives here or who is interested in the city, to promote the welfare of Dublin.  I know that the President has its interests at heart too and, knowing that, I am rather astonished that he takes the view on this matter that he does.  In the past I think he always stood for a big Dublin, a Dublin of which we could be proud.  As it is.  Dublin is no mean city but it could have been much bigger and greater in the past were it not for political affairs over which we had no control.  We have, however, control now and can make Dublin what it ought to be, a great city of a great nation.  To my mind we are putting one obstacle in the way of making that city what it ought to be by setting up this borough.  The President is a man who&mdash;without disrespect to anybody else&mdash;is probably the guide in this matter so far as the Local Government Department is concerned, and in my opinion if he reconsiders the matter and takes the view of a Dublin citizen, having the real interest and welfare of the city at heart, he will waive the suggestion that this borough should be set up now by the passing of the next section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this amendment is defeated there will probably be no chance of <Col N="778" /> bringing it on again, and the next section will come along, setting up that borough, and thus we will be putting an obstacle, which does not exist at present, in our way.  We do not want it, and if it does not suit the city council after examination to take in the additional areas of Dun Laoghaire, Blackrock and other districts this year or next year we do not want to force them.  We do not want the borough set up because we believe that it would be an obstacle in the way, as there would be vested interests created which would fight hard to prevent absorption in the future.  I believe that the President is anxious to see the city a worthy capital of the country, and I appeal to him not to set up this obstacle but to leave the matter open.  Even though there might be some slight temporary advantage gained by the citizens under that head I think we should put it aside and give the new city council an opportunity of taking those areas in, one by one or two by two, if in their wisdom if, having taken counsel with the new bodies that will be added to them, they think it wise to do so. I think I have a large section of the House with me in urging the President to take that course.</P>

      <P>We must clear out of our way the amendment to put the four urban districts into the city.  Then, in regard to Section 3, I would make this case in favour of unifying the four urban districts. Blackrock rates for the coming year are higher than those in the city. Blackrock and Dun Laoghaire have a joint drainage system which, in spite of what is generally said, is satisfactory.  It is discharged outside near the pier on the outgoing tide.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the way it is going.  Dalkey drains on the foreshore and that drainage could be linked up to Dun Laoghaire and Blackrock.  You want that done under a joint body.  I am not satisfied with the way in which Dalkey urban affairs are being administered. <Col N="779" /> I do not want to go into the manner in which those affairs are being dealt with at present, but the position is most unsatisfactory.  If we are going to hang on for a certain number of years, leaving Blackrock in the position that for one reason or another its rates are higher than those of the city, leaving Dalkey in the position in which, owing to want of joint control, it cannot link up its drainage with the other districts and in which you have complaints about the fore-shore, and also if Dalkey is perhaps to be run by a Commissioner, you will have a situation in the four urban districts which I do not think could be very well justified.  I would argue on Section 3 that that general state of affairs needs to be pulled together. You need a unified mind working over the area and you need the manager system operating there to bring about improvements.  That is the case I would make on Section 3 to bring about the amalgamation of these areas, but let us deal with Deputy MacEntee's amendment once and for all and them let us discuss anything we like on Section 3.</P>

      <P>The real difficulty we are in is that if at this particular Committee Stage Deputy MacEntee's amendment were withdrawn, it could be brought in again on next Stage, and we would then begin, as we began this evening, and have it all over again, unless there is agreement in the interval.  If the amendment were withdrawn and Section 3 were discussed and if it stood in its present form, you could not propose an amendment at this Stage putting the coastal borough into the city, because if we decided to leave Section 3 as it is, we would have decided that there would be a separate coastal borough.  If there <Col N="781" /> is withdrawal of the amendment it might be proposed again.</P>

      <P>My suggestion is as follows: that we dispose of Deputy MacEntee's amendment, and subject to the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle on the matter of order, I am prepared not to commit the House to the principle of amalgamating the four urban districts under Section 3.  I am further prepared to go on with such consideration of the Bill as is not involved in a decision one way or another on that point, and either at some other part of the Committee Stage&mdash;or again, subject to the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle&mdash;on the Report Stage decide the principle of Section 3 one way or another in accordance with whatever agreement may be arrived at at any conference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>My attitude in the matter is that I am willing to meet the Minister half way, but I am not prepared to allow him to walk over me as he suggests.  If the Minister does not move Section 3 now, on the understanding that the conference which Deputy Thrift suggests should take place, I am prepared to withdraw the amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think the Minister is taking an unfair advantage now.  There has been a very reasonable suggestion which we have met in a reasonable way.  We think that the status quo should be maintained and that we should have the right to withdraw the amendment now and to introduce it again for further discussion.  Supposing Deputy Thrift, in the course of the discussion at the conference, was converted to my point of view, is he going to be prevented from supporting it by his vote in the House?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be, but the President has not succeeded in converting Deputy Thrift or Deputy Good to his point of view yet.  It is because he despairs of that that he is anxious to have this amendment disposed of in such a way that it would not come before the House again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I explained to the Deputy that as long as the Deputy's amendment remains, the Bill is in danger of destruction. His amendment will have to be defeated. I propose to defeat it to-night and if it is so defeated, not to take a decision on Section 3 but to leave it over for further consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to point out that I do not think that Deputy MacEntee realises the necessity for coming to a decision on that point as to whether the districts covered by the coastal borough are to be brought into the city now or not.  It would be satisfactory if he withdrew his amendment and it would be clearly understood that that was a decision that these areas were not to be brought at the present moment into the city. If that can only be arrived at by a division that division must be taken now.  I thought Deputy MacEntee's attitude was to let that decision betaken and then take up the position as to what is to be done with these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore the proposal only stands in the event of Deputy MacEntee's amendment being defeated.  Surely the President <Col N="783" /> does not expect us to vote for its defeat?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one other point.  If this amendment is disposed of and the Minister, as he states, is going to be in a position to argue on the lines that the Blackrock rates are so high, that the administration of Dalkey is unsatisfactory, and you have decided you are not going to bring these districts into the city now, what is left? Are you going to allow Blackrock, with its uneconomic administration, Dalkey with its unsatisfactory administration and Dun Laoghaire, to continue to exist as separate entities?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>They are.  In view of the dilemma into which the House is going to be put by the Minister once my amendment is out of the way, the House ought to be able to retain liberty of action in the matter and be able to come to Section 3 with an entirely unprejudiced mind. The House should compel the Minister to permit the amendment to be withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>

      <P>We must either put this amendment from the Chair and have a decision on it or Deputy MacEntee must agree that the area of the city will not be made any greater than it is by Section 2 by any further amendment.  The <Col N="784" /> withdrawal of the amendment, however, would have the same effect if the Deputy were to say that he would not again propose the amendment so as to put these four coastal boroughs into Section 2.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>I move amendment 17:</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 14, to delete the words &ldquo;thirty-five&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;forty-five.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>After a discussion with a number of my colleagues who were interested in this, they succeeded in getting me to reduce the figure to forty-five.  I wanted the number to be sixty.  After a great deal of discussion, they insisted that forty-five would be an adequate number to get representation for all classes that should be represented on the council &mdash;a council which will include so many diversified interests.  I realise, having had some little experience of the old municipal council of Dublin, which had a membership of eighty, that that number was too large if you like.  My own personal belief is that a council consisting of sixty members would certainly be required to give adequate representation to all the interests involved.  When you take in the added areas of Pembroke and Rathmines the council will be representing a population of almost 400,000 people.  With a population of that size, and taking into account the diversity of interests that are to be found amongst the people in a capital city like Dublin and the various types of mind that will be clamouring for expression, I think it is a moderate request to ask that 45 members should form the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you take, say, two or three big organisations, organisations that deal with purely civic problems and in which politics only enter in a minor way, you will have in these a clash of interests and points of view demanding expression that a number such as 35 will not provide adequate representation for on the council.  A city with a population of 400,000 people may be said to be a large city.  Under the new arrangement proposed in this Bill, if it goes through, the administration of the <Col N="794" /> city will be in the hands largely of officials.  The matter of appointment to the various offices, great or small, will be matters of administration and will be outside the purview of the council.  Questions of legislation will be within the power of the new council, and when questions of legislation are being discussed the wider the number of points of view that can find expression inside the council the better the result will be, within certain limits.</P>
    <P>The limit suggested in the amended form by the Minister would not, I am quite satisfied, be sufficient.  Personally, I would rather have 60, so that minor interests might be able to elect a representative to the council, as such a representative might prove a most valuable member.  It is extraordinary sometimes where one gets wisdom from&mdash;&ldquo;out of the mouth of babes&rdquo; as the old proverb says&mdash;and in my experience of public bodies very small and insignificant interests produced men who were of the utmost value in the corporation.  Having in view that experience, I urge upon the House the necessity for enlarging the council to the suggested number&mdash;45.  I think the city would benefit by that, and I am of opinion that we will not get adequate representation for the classes who are entitled to representation in a body in which such important interests are at stake as in the council of the capital of Ireland if we restrict the number to 35.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in complete agreement with every word that Deputy O'Kelly has said.  I would be glad if the Minister would see his way to accept the number suggested&mdash;45. If the Minister is of opinion that he cannot go the whole way to meet Deputy O'Kelly's amendment, I think the least he might do is to strike a happy medium and accept the number I have suggested and place the size of the council at 40.  The old corporation, as Deputy O'Kelly pointed out, numbered 80, and the new council, if the Minister accepts my amendment, will be only half the <Col N="795" /> size of the original body.  The Minister ought to bear in mind the argument Deputy O'Kelly has put before the House, that in a city numbering almost 400,000 inhabitants, with great diversity of interests, every possible care should be taken, as far as humanly possible, to give the various kinds of interests representation on the council.  I completely agree with Deputy O'Kelly when he says that if only 35 are elected on the council that diversity of interest will not be represented.  Moreover, one has to remember that if such a small council as 35 is set up, and if that council is to function with any effect in the carrying out of municipal affairs, there would have to be a very regular attendance of those 35 members if the business of the city is to be properly conducted.  In this House we have paid representatives, and Whips of the Parties know the difficulties they are faced with in keeping the different units of their Parties in attendance in the House.  What will that difficulty be in the Council of Dublin, where there is no such stimulus as the Whips to have members present to carry out the business?  In my opinion the minimum number that could possibly carry on the business of the council would be 40.  I do not know if the Minister would go the whole way to meet Deputy O'Kelly.  If he would I would be more grateful to him than if he accepted the number 40.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No doubt the small committees functioning in the new council will make for greater expedition and despatch in municipal affairs, but for adequate discussion of municipal affairs 35 is an insufficient membership, considering the number of problems they will have to deal with &mdash;problems of policy and finance and many other matters that will from time to time arise.  If we send only a small number of representatives to the new council we will be burking reasonable discussion, and we will not be discussing the affairs of the city in the way they are entitled to be discussed.  I would also ask the Minister to bear in mind that two <Col N="796" /> areas which are being taken in, Rathmines and Pembroke, have succeeded in getting a particularly good type of councillors to represent them.  If you enlarge the number of the new council you will be encouraging that particularly good type of councillors to come in, and you will be giving scope for the activities and experience of those members, which I have not the slightest doubt will not alone be in the interests of Dublin proper, but also in the interests of Rathmines and Pembroke when they come in under the Bill.  I have no wish to have unnecessary discussion of ordinary municipal affairs, but I suggest to the Minister that with a population of almost 400,000 in the city to send in only 35 members to the council will not serve the interests of the city in the same way as if he accepted Deputy O'Kelly's amendment or the amendment in my name.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister to adhere to the number 35. That figure was put down after considerable thought over the matter. We felt that there are arguments in favour of a small council, but that the Minister had gone too much in that direction when he fixed the number at 25.  I think 35, which is now the number in the Bill, is reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have advanced from 25 to 35.  I think that 35 is a reasonable number to conduct the business of the council properly.  I think if Deputies look around and imagine 35 seats filled they will realise that it is a sufficient number to act on the council.  In the new circumstances, in respect of such committees as the council desires to set up for technical education or libraries they are given power to appoint persons not necessarily members of the council, but persons interested in the matters for which the committees are especially required, <Col N="797" /> that is persons with special experience, interests and training, the type of persons who would not go in for ordinary municipal affairs, and who would not face the electorate and incur the expense that necessarily arises in connection with that.</P>
      <P>I am not impressed by the argument that there are various types of minds clamouring for expression and that they ought to find their way into the council.  Some of these people might be doing fretwork or painting pictures for the Royal Hibernian Academy or something like that.  What we want are elected representatives of the people who will go into the council for the purpose of discussing the business matters that arise there.  A council of thirty-five should be sufficiently representative of the city to have the city's voice clearly heard.  If there are minor notes, they will be heard as part of public opinion and, heard as part of public opinion, they will react on members of the council. People who are not represented in the council are not deprived of the power of arguing out their point merely by that fact.  Public opinion exercises a considerable amount of weight with the members of a council carrying on the business of a city.  The members of a council cannot, in fact, carry on the business of the council satisfactorily or properly except they are in touch with general public opinion.  I suggest that a council of thirty-five is ample for our purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal of the Minister that the council should be one of thirty-five members is more reasonable than the proposal contained in the Bill originally but I submit it is less reasonable than the proposal that the council should consist of forty-five members.  The Minister asked us to imagine thirty-five persons sitting in the benches here in this chamber.  I think it has been the experience of all of us that discussions here on any questions of <Col N="798" /> importance are always much better when the actual attendance of Deputies is larger than it is, say, at the present moment.  There is an argument in favour of setting up a council of forty-five that has nothing whatever to do with the number of voters each member would represent. I refer to the atmosphere that would be created in the council chamber when matters relating to municipal policy would be under discussion.  The theory that a small council is best applies only to executive committees, of which this council will not be one.  This council will be a legislative body.  It will be discussing matters of policy only and it should be sufficiently large to give a proper air of importance to its deliberations, as well as to ensure that all interests of sufficient importance will be represented.  A council of thirty-five implies only thirty elected members.  I am rather surprised that the Labour Party should favour the smaller council in this case because the section of the community most likely to be deprived of representation in consequence of the reduction in the number of the council will be the section for whom the Labour Party claims to speak.  I think it worked out in that way in the city of Cork. The candidates there who claimed to represent the business interests got a very much larger proportion of the seats than the candidates who stood in the labour interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A council of forty-five in the proposed new City of Dublin means one member of the Muncipal Council to every 9,000 of the population&mdash;I merely quote round figures.  I do not think that that basis of representation is unreasonable.  The original proposal of the Minister contained in the Bill made the representation on the Municipal Council correspond with the representation of the city in the Dáil.  That is improved upon, I admit, by accepting the proposal to make the council thirty-five, but still I think that the fact that there should be a much wider basis of representation in local government than in national government <Col N="799" /> would justify a further extension of the size of the council to forty-five.  There are interests in the city concerned in the results of municipal administration which should be represented on the Municipal Council, but which may not be represented if there are only thirty elected members.  There are limits, no doubt, to the size of the council. I do not think personally that forty-five is too small.  I think it represents just the right balance between the necessity for getting a proper representation of all views and the undesirability of having a loquacious body discussing matters of policy. The loquacity of a body increases in proportion to its numbers.</P>
    <P>There are other considerations which must be taken into account.  I think it has been the experience of most people that intrigue and corruption are much more likely to develop in small councils than in large councils.  The importance of the individual increases as the size of the council diminishes, and individuals are likely to be influenced by personal consideration.  On the larger councils, it is groups and parties that exercise control, and groups and parties are less likely to be influenced by corrupt methods than are individuals.  That point should be taken into account.  Personally, I do not see that there will be much room for corruption in the new Municipal Council, with the limited powers which the Minister proposes to give it.  At the same time, it is desirable that group policies should operate rather than individual views.  There are certain principles which should determine the size of any legislative body, whether that body be a national body, like this Dáil, or a municipal body or county council.  It is not correct, as the Minister appears to think, that the size of a council should vary in direct proportion to the volume of its revenue.  Other considerations must be taken into account.  I do not think any Deputy would hold that if this Dáil consisted <Col N="800" /> of thirty-five members its business would be done in any better manner than it is done at present. Possibly it is too large at present, but at the same time, if we were to reduce its membership to thirty-five, we would merely have a committee. We would have much more scrappy discussions than at present on important matters of policy.  Possibly, details of administration might be attended to in a better way, but important matters of policy and the ideas and ideals that influence administration would be considered in a much more scrappy way, if they were considered at all.</P>
    <P>The Government's original proposal of twenty-five members was obviously only a bargaining proposal. They have proved themselves to be bad bargainers by advancing too soon.  I wonder if we could get them to advance further?  The number suggested by Deputy O'Kelly is not a bargaining proposal.  It was the figure arrived at after definite consideration by this Party.  Views were expressed in favour of a smaller number and views were expressed in favour of a larger number.  Finally, we arrived at the conclusion that forty-five would be a reasonable number for the council, that it would secure proper representation for all interests and, at the same time, preserve an atmosphere which would ensure that matters of policy would be properly discussed when the council was in session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the amendment providing for thirty-five members which appears in the names of Deputy O'Connell and myself.  Past experience of a council of eighty suggested to me that thirty-five would be about the proper number for this council. Under the council of eighty, a considerable amount of business was carried on by various committees.  I take it that, under the scheme of city managership, a lot of this administrative work, which was formerly performed by committees, will <Col N="801" /> be discharged by the City Manager. As a result, it will not be necessary to have a very large council.  I think, with Deputy O'Connell, that thirty-five <Col N="802" /> members is quite a reasonable number.</P>
