      <P>Before the President moves the motion appearing in his name on the Order Paper, might I ask why it is that the Old Age Pensions Bill, about which there has been a good deal of discussion in the last week or so, does not appear on the Order Paper to-day? It had been on the Order Paper up to to-day.  I notice that it does not now appear.  Perhaps the Ceann Comhairle can give some explanation.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no notice of this question.  I do not know why a Bill should appear in the Order Paper having passed its Second Reading when no further order has been made about it.</P>

      <P>An order was made for the Second Reading of this Bill, but no further order was made, and until the order for Second Reading was discharged, I take it the Bill should appear on the Order Paper. My recollection is that Bills do appear on the order paper until an order for their discharge is made.  I did not notice that the Old Age Pensions Bill was not on the Order Paper until a few minutes ago. Otherwise I would have given notice to the Ceann Comhairle that I intended to raise this.</P>

      <P>The Bill was read a Second Time and no order was made for its committal. Under the Standing Orders, therefore, it does not appear on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Ceann Comhairle hold that a Bill that has got a Second Reading can disappear by some strange back-door method without any order for its disappearance? The Bill got an order for a Second Reading by a majority of the House.  Are we to take it that the Ceann Comhairle holds that a Bill like that can automatically disappear from the Order Paper without any further reference to the House as to its life or death?  Is that the position?</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee is raising another point.  He is wholly inaccurate as to what happened in regard to the Local Government (Dublin) Bill.  That Bill was read a second time, and an order was then made by the House for its committal <Col N="471" /> on a particular date.  Subsequently the date was changed.  That is what happened.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it customary for the Chair to act in regard to the appearance of a Bill on the Order Paper, as it has done in this particular case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Old Age Pensions Bill received a Second Reading.  A statement was made from the Chair to the effect that the Bill required a Money Resolution before it could be committed.  I have not the exact words before me, but that was the effect of them.  Therefore, no order was made for the committal of the Bill.  Until a Money Resolution had been introduced the Bill could not go into Committee, because the sections impose a charge and could not be considered in Committee. The Bill, therefore, does not appear on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask what was the procedure in regard to the Moneylenders Bill which received a Second Reading and in connection with which a Money Resolution had to be introduced before it was committed? That Bill, if my recollection is correct, appeared on the Order Paper for a number of days before the necessary Money Resolution was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out that I understand there is no time fixed <Col N="472" /> as to when a Money Resolution should be introduced after a Bill has got a Second Reading.  That being so, I submit that there is still time to introduce a Money Resolution.  Consequently, until some definite decision has been taken I think the Bill should appear on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no time limit with regard to the introduction of a Money Resolution except the life of a particular Dáil. A Money Resolution could be introduced at any time to enable the Old Age Pensions Bill to go into Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>That being so, should not the Bill still appear on the Order Paper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it then your ruling or explanation as to why this Bill does not appear on the Order Paper that the Government did not introduce that Money Resolution?  If not, what is the explanation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">

      <P>Has this procedure been adopted in any other case heretofore?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This, I think, is the first case in which a Bill having received a Second Reading a Money Resolution has been refused where a Money Resolution was necessary. The position about the Old Age Pensions Bill is that it has been read a second time.  Further proceedings in connection with it may be taken in the House, but they are dependent upon the introduction of an enabling Money Resolution, which Resolution would be in order at any time if introduced by an Executive Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the Deputies who, by their votes last <Col N="473" /> night re-elected Deputy Cosgrave, killed the Bill and automatically removed it from the Order Paper?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  They did not kill the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Bill received a Second Reading and further proceedings may be taken in the House.  I have indicated what these further proceedings must be.  There is no reason for keeping the Bill on the Order Paper, because there has been no order made regarding it.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a point of order either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Did you, or did you not, state in the House that the Resolution had been refused?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I want this point cleared up: is the Bill alive or is it dead?  If a Money Resolution is introduced at any time, can the Bill go into Committee without necessarily having to go through another Second Reading debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle was under the impression that he had made it perfectly clear that that was so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="474" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I put the point is this, because it is likely or possible that if certain Deputies opposite live up to their promises the Government may be again defeated when Deputy Anthony's motion dealing with the flour milling industry comes on.  In that case another Government might be prepared to introduce the necessary Money Resolution. I take it, if that were so, that the Bill would automatically go into Committee without any further delay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing to keep the Bill from going into Committee except the moving of the necessary Money Resolution, and that could be moved by an Executive Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have your ruling that the Bill is still a live issue.  The Bill is still alive, but, as the Ceann Comhairle has admitted, this is the first time that a case of this kind has arisen.  Therefore, we are making precedents here so far as the Order Paper is concerned, and I just want to have it definite and clear what the exact position is with regard to that Bill. The decision of the Ceann Comhairle who, I take it, is in charge of the Order Paper with regard to Bills, is that Bills that have appeared regularly on the Order Paper can disappear off the Order Paper without any order being made for their discharge.  I take it that is the decision of the Ceann Comhairle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle has a great objection to having his rulings paraphrased.  The Ceann Comhairle did not say that this Bill was a live issue.  He said that the Bill was alive to this extent: that if a Money Resolution were introduced the clauses of the Bill could be considered in Committee according to order of the House. The disappearance of the Bill off the Order Paper does not mean that the Bill has been withdrawn which is a different thing.  In connection with the Second Reading of the Criminal Law Amendment Bill, moved by Deputy Little, the motion for the <Col N="475" /> Second Reading of that Bill was withdrawn and the Bill was ordered to be withdrawn.  That Bill is in the position of not being alive.  The Old Age Pensions Bill has had a Second Reading and it was withdrawn from the Order Paper, because no further order was made about it.  That does not mean that the Bill is dead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>You said that one of the Bills for which I was responsible was not alive now.  I take it that does not imply that it cannot be reintroduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in this particular point&mdash;that I think the procedure adopted in regard to the Old Age Pensions Bill is different from the procedure adopted in the case of the Moneylenders Bill introduced by Deputy Little.  One continued on the Order Paper although the Money Resolution in regard to it had not been introduced in the House.  I think the Old Age Pensions Bill was exactly in that position, that it received a Second Reading but that no Money Resolution had been introduced.  Therefore, I would like if the Ceann Comhairle would explain to me the principle that guided his action in the matter of the Old Age Pensions Bill&mdash;why he differentiated in the action he took in regard to that Bill and the Moneylenders Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy explain the difference in the action which was taken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference is that the Moneylenders Bill continued to appear on the Order Paper for a number of days after the Second Reading though no Money Resolution had been introduced.  This Bill has not been permitted to appear on the Order Paper at the session next following.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Moneylenders Bill received a Second Reading by agreement and, as well as I recollect, the making of the <Col N="476" /> order for the Committee Stage was postponed to enable the Minister for Finance to take certain steps.  As a matter of fact, the Bill was sent to Committee without any tax Resolution being introduced into the House, owing to the fact that the Minister for Finance and Deputy Little came to another arrangement which the Ceann Comhairle considered satisfactory. In this case, the Bill received a Second Reading and no order was made for Committee.  In the absence of a Money Resolution no order can be made for Committee, but an order could now be made for Committee if the Resolution were forthcoming.  As a practical point, there is no reason why the Bill should appear on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The circumstances were exactly similar in regard to the Old Age Pensions Bill.  When the President and the Minister for Finance were asked if they were prepared to introduce the necessary Money Resolution, the President asked time to consider that point and said he would give his decision tomorrow. He gave his decision the following day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the Moneylenders Bill it would have been possible to introduce a motion to refer the Bill to Committee. Certain sections of the Bill could not be considered in Committee and the other sections could. The Old Age Pensions Bill is in a different position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House is in a very peculiar position in view of the fact that no indication has been given by the President as to what the policy of the new Executive is going to be.  Yesterday we expected to receive some indication, either from the proposer or the seconder of the motion for the election of the President, as to what his policy would be.  Naturally to-day, when the President announced his Executive for election by the House, we expected some indication of the policy which is to be pursued by that Executive, but no such indication has been given to us.  Are we to take it that it is now the policy of the President and the Executive which he proposes to have elected that the Old Age Pensions Bill will be shelved? Are we to take it that that Executive is not going to submit this Bill to the country?  Are we to take it that no attempt is to be made, by way of instituting a Referendum or by some other method, to take the view of the country on that matter? When the Referendum was under discussion here before, we had it stated by Deputy Tierney and others that it was a relic of the Stone Age. Since that, a leader who is, I think, amongst the friends of the Party opposite&mdash;Mr. Baldwin&mdash;stated in England that he proposed to have a Referendum on a certain question in England, or, at any rate, to submit it for the views of the people there.</P>

      <P>It is very wooden, and so far as the people opposite are concerned, anyway, it is <Col N="479" /> not what the people think, but what the Executive that is now proposed think is good for the people or bad for them, in the interests of the Party opposite.  If the President is satisfied that he represents the views of the majority of the people, then a splendid opportunity is presented to him to submit the Bill to the country for the people's views on it.  We have no indication of policy from the President, and no indication of policy from those on the opposite benches who spoke on the motion yesterday, except in so far as Deputy Hogan, I think, approved of the policy of the Minister for Justice in establishing law and order, and in so far as Deputy Mulcahy stated that their policy was to keep the country's feet on solid financial ground. These were the only two items of policy of which any indication was given.  There was criticism of the policy of this Party, but that course. I believe, is always the practice in the case of people who have no definite policy themselves.</P>
      <P>We would like to know, and the country is entitled to know, if a Bill is brought in here during the life of the Executive which it is now proposed to elect, to provide pensions for Ministers, if the Executive will support that Bill, considering that they think the country is in such a very impoverished condition that it cannot afford to give any assistance to the poor and needy such as it was proposed to provide for the old age pensioners in the Bill which was before the House last week.  Is it the policy of the proposed Executive to provide large gratuities for able-bodied men retiring from the Army? Is it their policy to continue paying big pensions to able-bodied men, while saying at the same time that there is not a halfpenny to give to the poor and needy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Supposing that a mutiny takes place in the Free State Army, is the policy of the proposed Executive to be to buy off that mutiny again by providing jobs, large gratuities and pensions for the people who are responsible? That has been the policy. <Col N="480" /> Is that policy to continue, if any trouble arises in the Army, in dealing with the people who are responsible by buying them off with big gratuities, jobs and pensions?  Is the country not entitled to know that? That has been the policy of the people opposite.  Is it to continue to be their policy?</P>
    <P>Deputies on this side of the House referred yesterday to an article which appeared in the &ldquo;Star&rdquo; which indicated a certain viewpoint, expressed either by somebody in the Government or by an adherent of the Government.  No definite denial has been given with regard to that statement.  That paper is regarded, and rightly so, I believe, as the official organ of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  Are not the people entitled to know whether the idea expressed in that article represents the temperament, the mind and the viewpoint of the people opposite? Are the proposed Executive able to answer definitely and to say that that is their policy?  They cannot have it both ways.  It either is their policy to allow the Army to carry on in this way, to be in the position of dictating to the people in certain circumstances and eventualities, or it is not.  If the people opposite are not afraid to answer they have an opportunity of doing so now.  That article is clearly an incentive to the Army under certain circumstances to take up a certain attitude which will not be in accord with the views of the majority of the people.  That is a matter on which this House should be in no doubt, and there should be no difficulty in explaining or in clearly defining what the position is.  No attempt has been made so far to deal with it, but it is hoped that before this debate concludes and before the Executive is elected the matter will be clearly defined and clearly explained, and that the people will be able to understand what the position of the Army is in certain circumstances with regard to a Government elected by a majority of the people of the Twenty-six Counties.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the Department that has been controlled by <Col N="481" /> Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney.  Yesterday Deputy Hogan referred to the fact that the late Minister for Justice has established law and order. I suppose it depends on people's appreciation as to what law and order exactly mean.  If the law and order to which Deputy Hogan referred is the law and order we have experienced, for the last three or four years particularly, then I am afraid that it is not the law and order that people are accustomed to appreciate and understand.  Practically not a week has passed in which questions have not been raised here as to the activities of members of the Guards in arresting people, raiding houses, and assaulting people throughout the whole Twenty-six Counties.  We have always been told by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney in answer that in connection with those raids and activities, assaults and illegal arrests the Guards were acting on well-founded suspicion, and that they were doing these things in their efforts to suppress crime and to prevent people who are out for assassination and for the subversion of the State from doing these things.  We have always been told that when these things were done the Guards were acting on well-founded suspicion and good information.  One of the usual answers, I think, when these questions were raised in this House was: &ldquo;It is well known that the persons responsible for these things are engaged in anti-State activities and incitements to assassination.&rdquo; We have been refused information as to the grounds of suspicion; we are supposed to accept the ex-Minister's word for it that these suspicions were well founded, that the information that had come to him was reliable, and particularly that he was acting in a constitutional and normal legal way in having those raids, arrests and so on made throughout the country.</P>
    <P>A case arose and was debated in this House from time to time with regard to certain activities in Co. Clare, where a Mr. Ryan was assaulted and beaten.  Attempts have been made by various public bodies <Col N="482" /> to have a public inquiry into that matter, and an inquiry was demanded in this House on debates on the adjournment.  The Minister then declined to have that inquiry.  Affidavits were made by responsible people testifying to what had been done and to the activities of which complaint was made in this House.  These affidavits were brought to the notice of the then Minister, but no action whatever in the way of having a public inquiry was taken by him.  Of course it was obvious to everybody who wished to see it impartially that the Minister then was afraid, as I believe he would be afraid to-day, to let the light of publicity in on the acts and activities of those irregular forces in County Clare.  A case was raised from Galway, and the Minister stated that inquiries were held in all such cases. I know a case in County Mayo where no inquiry was held, although all the facts were brought to the notice of the Department of Justice.</P>

      <P>I will have something to say later about that.  In the case I referred to in Mayo the facts were brought to the notice of the Department of Justice and no inquiry, secret or public, was held. Of that I am well aware, and I challenge Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney to deny that.  Allegations of rather serious assaults were made.  It was a case where a number of people were arrested &mdash; Republicans of course&mdash;presumably on suspicion of being involved or engaged in a hold-up of a mail car in which a sum of between fifty and one hundred pounds was taken at the point of the revolver.  In that case, as in every other case where any crime is committed, the Guards proceeded to raid and arrest Republicans in the <Col N="483" /> area indiscriminately, never looking amongst the members or ex-members of their own force.  In the case I refer to, people were taken out of their beds and kept a day&mdash;some of them for forty-eight hours&mdash;in cells in Ballina barracks, and the Guards scoured the whole area, which, according to their evidence in court, contained 99 per cent.  Republicans, but they never thought where they might likely find the criminal, who was an ex-member of the Guards. He was afterwards convicted and got five years' penal servitude.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, through the Guards' efforts.  Perhaps it was rather too patent at the time for them to avoid arresting him, but they left him there a considerable time, at any rate, before they bothered about him.  It was a fortnight or three weeks afterwards when they did so, although all the Republican houses in the area had been raided before that and Republicans thrown into prison indiscriminately.  I hope the Guards will hear something more about it. Here in Dublin raids have been carried out indiscriminately.  People have been taken from their work, and many have lost their positions owing to continued raiding and arrests.  When these matters were raised in this House we had the usual stereotyped reply from the Minister informing us that the Guards were acting on suspicion, that they had good grounds and well-founded information; of course, so well-founded that the Minister could never disclose one iota or atom of it to this House.  The House was supposed to take his word; the House was supposed to take him as a paragon of truth; it dare not question the Minister when he stated that the Guards were acting on well-founded information.  The House dare not challenge him and say that these arrests were illegal.  These cases have been taken into court since.  In some of the cases, as Deputy <Col N="484" /> Fitzgerald-Kenney is aware, the Judge directed the jury that the only matter with which they had to deal was the question of damages. If he had the information that he tried to put it across this House he had, would he not have put it before the jury in these cases?  Was the Minister telling the truth when he stated that the information was well-founded as to suspicion?  The people of the country can judge if there was any foundation for these suspicions.  If the Minister could produce any evidence based on these suspicions, would it not have been produced before the Judge and jury before whom these people were tried?  One would assume that the Department of Justice, at any rate, would not act illegally.  Has it not been established that they have acted illegally?  Has it not been established that these people were acting under the then Minister for Justice, were encouraged by him, patted on the back as it were, and urged on to continue this illegal, unjustified and unfounded policy of wholesale arrests and imprisonment of Republicans?  Was the Minister, if he had not time to attend to the matter himself, not able to get a first year law student to advise him whether he was acting legally or illegally?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>It is established now, at any rate, beyond any doubt, and I think the Minister will not dispute it, that he acted illegally, and that the people who acted under him acted illegally, in arresting those people.  He will also, I think, have to admit that he had no grounds for arresting these people, that he had no suspicions which were well-founded, that the suspicions that existed in the distorted imagination of those people were suspicions that were encouraged and pushed forward by the attitude of the then Minister for Justice, and by their <Col N="485" /> own inclination or disposition to punish Republicans in the City of Dublin.  But those people are getting redress.  Many more cases are to follow, I believe.  What I want to know and what this House is entitled to know is, who is going to pay for the policy that has been adopted in those cases by the Department of Justice? If those people acted illegally, surely to goodness it is not going to be asked that the taxpayers of the country who, we all know, have been overtaxed, and who, we were told last week, could not be asked to budget for a penny, should pay for the ignorance or the prejudiced, blind policy of the Department of Justice. Those men who arrested innocent people, who flung innocent men into jail and deprived them of their positions in this city, were themselves criminals, because, surely, there cannot be any more clear definition of a criminal than a man who, without any justification, goes and takes the body of another, flings him into prison, and keeps him there without any right or justification whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before this House elects this Executive, let it be made clear, at any rate, whether it is the policy of that Executive, as portrayed and displayed by the late Minister for Justice, to pursue that same policy in the future; as to whether its definition of law and order is one law for one section of the community and an other law for another, because that is the policy that is being pursued; whether its definition of law and order is that one section of the community can act illegally.  It will not recognise the laws which the Executive established itself.  It will be the first to break them.  Are they going to break the laws or keep the laws made by them?  Even if your bitterness and prejudices and one-sided outlook with regard to a certain section of the community are such, are you going to make and continue to make yourselves, to the cost of the taxpayers of the country, the laughing-stock of the world by not being able to interpret laws made by yourselves or adapted?  Are you going to continue to come into this House, <Col N="486" /> and when questions are asked with regard to arrests carried out in the country, to simply say that you are acting legally; you are acting on good information.  But when you go to the test of your information you cannot prove it.  You were put to the test.  Why, then, does a responsible Minister get up in this House and try to put across an untruth, for it is nothing else, to try and represent to the country a state of affairs and a state of conditions that do not exist?</P>
    <P>That is what has happened.  As I have said before if the Minister were able to support it he would have supported it in the one place he had an opportunity of doing so.  He has often said, &ldquo;Go to the courts.&rdquo;  We have gone to the courts and many more cases will occur in the courts, but who is going to pay for the ignorance of that Department or for the want of proper supervision or control of that Department, or who is going to pay for the blind, prejudiced policy and bitterness against a certain section of the community which will come very heavily if it is to fall on the taxpayer?  Will the President state whether, in connection with those people who are being sued and decreed in the courts, and there are many other similar cases coming on in various parts of the country as well as in Dublin&mdash; the taxpayers of this country are going to be responsible and pay the cost of defending those people who are acting illegally and who are under his Department?  Are they going to be put in the position that when an action is brought they will have the assistance of the State in an effort to try to help those criminals and assist them out of the illegalities in which they find themselves? Is that the policy of the Department of Justice?</P>
    <P>I would also like to know in view of the fact that those decrees have been made and in view of the stated policy in this House for so long by the Department of Justice&mdash;this policy of encouraging the C.I.D. and others to pursue recklessly, indiscriminately and without any well-founded <Col N="487" /> suspicion or evidence, this section of the people, and in view of what has happened, and in view of the fact that the Minister has broadcasted his encouragement to them to commit those illegalities&mdash;has he, since those decrees have been made, sent out any circulars or instructions to the C.I.D. or the Guards that they must be more careful not to break the law in future?  I believe he has not.  I believe that if elected he will pursue the same policy of heaping illegality upon illegality and will pursue his prejudiced, blind, bitter, bad policy of arresting people upon imagination without any suspicion.  But there is an opportunity provided in the motion now before the House for this House to remedy that.  The President has got a chance and the House has got a chance it ought to be glad to avail of if it is going to save the taxpayers from a considerable burden when money is so hard-found, and when the Executive says their coffers are so very low that they cannot afford to give any increased assistance to the old age pensioners. The House has the opportunity now of remodelling, reconstructing and changing the whole policy and that of the Department of Justice in particular.</P>
    <P>Let the House remember if it is going to elect Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney to the position of Minister for Justice that then they are going to have the same illegalities, the same reckless arresting, the same acting on grounds on which no sound suspicion could be based, the policy of what they call law and order.  It reminds one of the phrase &ldquo;How many crimes are committed in thy name?&rdquo; The Minister, during the time he has been in office at any rate, has been responsible for more breaches of law and order than any member of that Executive could be responsible for.  He has encouraged crime amongst the Guards; he has encouraged illegality among the Guards, and has in every way done what will eventually result in subverting and rendering dangerous in <Col N="488" /> this country a large section of that force.</P>
    <P>It is a dangerous thing to start encouraging illegalities.  It is a bad example that nobody should create; at any rate, a Minister of the State should not be responsible for illegalities. The ignorance or the prejudice of his Department in acting illegally is going to be responsible for a very increased burden on the tax-payers.  Everything that has happened is largely due in the first instance to the encouragement given by the Department of Justice, and for these reasons and for no other reasons I think the Executive proposed by the President should be rejected by the House.</P>

      <P>The President has certainly presented us with a very nice bouquet this evening.  If you were to pick from the whole of the Cumann na nGaedheal ranks throughout the country I do not think you could find a group of men of whom the country are more heartily sick than the group he has put forth here to-day for nomination as Ministers. If this Dáil are going to elect Ministers to do something for the country they should find some other group. If we are going to make any progress in this country the people will soon have to return some group of men who will elect a President and Ministers who will put the people's interests and the interest of Ireland above the interests of the British and the pro-Britishers here in this country.  We saw in the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; this morning that for two and a half years the Independents have kept Mr. Cosgrave's Government in office.  During seven years the interests for which the Independent members stand in the Dáil have been the social and economic mainstay of the present administration. It winds up by saying that every man has his price, and if the Independents do not get their price the Government will have to go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly up till now the Independents have got their <Col N="489" /> price.  The price they got was the throwing over of the national traditions by men who started a war here to oust the British.  The people of this country who are not so bombastic as Mr. Blythe&mdash;the majority of the people of this country who fought during the Black and Tan war did not go about shouting before the war started that the road to freedom was a sword-track through the ranks of their enemies&mdash; the people of this country only want their rights.  They do not want war.  We did not start the war with the British.  It was the British started it, but when it did come on some of the men who created the position here when the war started got out.  Mr. Blythe was very loud in his blood-and-thunder talk before the war about sword-tracks through the ranks of his enemies to freedom, but when the war started he was a place-loving citizen.  He was against the shooting of policemen.  It was a case of: &ldquo;Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter.&rdquo;  He was very fond of their daughters and pleaded as to why they should get off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we wanted a bad lawyer to fight a bad case.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenny would be a good selection. But what this country is in need of, as Deputy Ruttledge pointed out, is somebody in the Ministry of Justice who will act legally or act according to the rules which he has laid down. We do not object to the Ministers acting according to the rules which they have laid down.  What we object to is their hypocrisy.  They say one thing and act another.  President Cosgrave talked around the country about the ten fundamental conditions.  One of them is an efficient police force, and in order to manage an efficient police force he puts in charge of the Department of Justice a bad lawyer like the Minister for Justice.  In order to recall to the minds of the Deputies the type of answer that the Minister for Justice gave us regarding some of his illegalities I will read you a question that Deputy Kerlin put to the Minister and the answer.  Deputy Kerlin asked the Minister for Justice <Col N="490" /> whether he was aware that in the case of a Garda prosecution in Dublin on or about August 27th. 1929, against a Mr. William Murray for riding a motor bicycle without tax or licence, the evidence of a detective officer was recommended by the presiding judge to be sent to the Garda authorities for investigation; whether a court of enquiry was instituted to consider the case; what were the exact charges preferred against the detective officer concerned; what were the findings of the court, and what action was taken by the Garda authorities as the result of such findings.</P>
    <P>The Minister replied that an inquiry was held, that he was found guilty of neglect of duty in failing to report promptly any evidence which he could give for the defendant, and that he made false and misleading statements in a written report to a superior officer as to his movements on the occasion in question. The Minister then said that the imposition of punishment was postponed for six months, pending consideration of reports in the meantime of his conduct in the uniform branch to which he was transferred. That reply was on 12th March.  The prosecution took place on 27th August.  I ask the Minister to say if this Guard, who was found guilty of making a false and misleading statement in a written report to a superior officer, was still on the active list of the Guards.  He said he was.  That is a nice proposition.</P>

      <P>I do not want to read all the blath-flum of the Minister. I have stated to the House the salient facts in the Minister's answer.  The fact is that the Minister admitted here in the Dáil that six months after an officer was found <Col N="491" /> guilty of making false and misleading statements to a superior officer he was still in the Civic Guard Force.</P>

      <P>That is the type of man the Minister wants the people to think are going to carry out law and order in this country.  They will do one thing, and that is carry out the orders of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  They have their price just like the Independents, and we can always get, unfortunately, in this or in any other country, half-starved men to do dirty work for money.  The poor devils who are in the Civic Guards will do the Minister's dirty work because there is no alternative for them.  The men who are in the Civic Guards, or in any other Department of State, if given an opportunity to do honest and decent work and get a fair return, would do it if they were given a proper lead.  What is wrong with this country is that the young men are being led and conscripted by economic circumstances, created by the Ministers, to do England's dirty work and the dirty work of their tools here, the Government. That is the situation.  One would like to go through all the Ministers, but I am not going through them.  If we wanted a bad lawyer we would get Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney. If we were wanting a lecturer on public morality we would send for Deputy Fitzgerald. Deputy Fitzgerald has been treating us here to lectures from all sorts of religious publications for a long time.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald is a real, modern saint.  He talks about public morality and civic virtue, and a lot of modern stuff.  One would be inclined to call him a latter-day saint.  But if we wanted a proper Minister for Defence I think we <Col N="492" /> would get somebody else.  Here recently in the Dáil it was found that the Minister did not know what the cost of the Army was.  He was £200,000 out in his estimate as to the cost of the Army.  I think that this country, in the economic state in which it is, should have as Ministers, and in particular as Minister for a Department that is costing this country £1,600,000 a year, a man who is able to estimate much nearer than £200,000 what his Department would cost.  The Minister was out £200,000 in his statement regarding the cost of the Army.  That certainly is not good enough.  But when you consider the number of people who would be kept in fair comfort on that £200,000 if it were devoted to that purpose, the matter becomes important.</P>
      <P>The President said that if the Old Age Pensions Bill went through, it would cost between £200,000 and £300,000.  The Government made a great deal of talk about a sum of £200,000 in relation to old age pensions. They said it could never be got.  The Ministers were up in arms against it.  It was going to ruin the country.  The Minister for Defence did not think much about it when he did not know within £200,000 what the Army was costing.  He is surely a nice type of man to put in charge of any Department.  If we are going to do anything in this country we have got to get men in charge of Government Departments who will run these Departments in the interests of the ordinary people of this country, and not in the interests of a section of the people who are pro-British in their outlook.  We do not object to these people holding these views.  They are entitled to hold them and to express them openly.  But we object to Ministers holding one set of views and giving expression to them in public, but holding another set of views behind the scenes.  We object to their going to the people and saying: &ldquo;We are going to act in your interests.&rdquo; and then come back here and make back-door arrangements with the Independents.</P>

      <P>I regard this as the second act in the greatest political drama that has been so far staged by the Cosgrave Ministry.  The first act was certainly played to the satisfaction of the audience last night, and, to a certain extent, to the satisfaction of the members on these benches.  I say it was played to our satisfaction, because the division last night has succeeded in separating the sheep from the lambs.  Deputy Duggan will in future be assured that the sheep who used to trespass on neighbouring properties in the past will respond to the crack of his whip in future without any doubt whatsoever.  I hope that the new party which was formed as a result of the last division last night will find a new name which the majority of the people will understand.  I know that Deputy de Valera, who was looking at the first act from Minneapolis, has disapproved of the attitude of some of his own actors. That is very satisfactory to me and to the members of this Party.</P>

      <P>In relation to the motion on the Order Paper, the members of the Labour Party strongly object to the re-election of the present Ministry, particularly to the Minister for Finance, who is mainly responsible for the so-called political crisis which has led up to the discussion which is now taking place.  It <Col N="494" /> is the action of the Minister for Finance in refusing to provide the necessary money for the implementation of Deputy Ward's Bill that has led up to the resignation of the Cosgrave Government.  I would like to ask Deputy Blythe, or rather the President, who, I presume, will reply for the Deputies he is now proposing, whether he is not satisfied that some case has been made for an alteration of the existing regulations in reference to the administration of the Old Age Pensions Act?</P>
      <P>Does President Cosgrave admit that a fair and reasonable case was made for some alteration of the existing pension laws and, if so, will he or Deputy Blythe, who is now proposed for re-election, state to this House in what respect, if any, they propose to amend the existing pension laws?  Deputy Blythe has on several occasions in the past challenged the authority of this House in so far as he has ignored the majority views of the House as expressed upon certain matters, and he has certainly on several occasions challenged the authority of one of the chief officers of this House.  One of the chief officers of this House, the Comptroller and Auditor-General, is responsible for accounting to this House for all the moneys voted by the House in connection with the various public services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Public Accounts Committee appointed by this House, which apparently is not thought very much of by the Minister for Finance, although he has the controlling majority on that Committee, has had occasion to bring under the notice of the House for the past three or four years, certain matters in which they thought that the Ministry had out-stepped its duties and its authority. I refer in the first place to the action of the Minister for Finance in refusing to recognise the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor-General and the Public Accounts Committee in reference to the moneys expended under the Military Service Pensions Act.  Much more serious still is his recent action in <Col N="495" /> ignoring on two or three occasions the definite recommendations of that Committee in regard to excessive expenditure under certain sub-heads of the Army Estimates.  In the Appropriation Accounts recently circulated to Deputies and dealing with the accounts for 1928-29 the following paragraph is found under the signature of the Comptroller and Auditor-General in connection with Vote 64 for the Army, sub-head A (2), Gratuities:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The expenditure under this sub-head amounted to £228,403 15s. 2d. being £216,403 15s. 2d. in excess of the amount provided in the Estimate.  The excess expenditure was met through the savings on other sub-heads.  In view of the comments of the Public Accounts Committee in their report of the accounts for the years 1926-27 and 1927-28 I have considered it necessary to call attention to the extensive use of virement in this sub-head.</P>
    <P>The Public Accounts Committee unanimously agreed with the previous recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor-General in regard to this particular aspect of Government expenditure.  In their Report dealing with the Appropriation Accounts for 1927-28 the Committee commented as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The amount provided in the Army Estimates for gratuities to officers on retirement was £5,000 in each of the years 1926-27 and 1927-28.  The amounts actually expended were £47,515 and £43,759, respectively, and the excess expenditure was met by the exercise of virement in each year.  The Committee is of opinion that the payment of such large sums without the sanction of the Dáil at any stage is not satisfactory, and in view of the Minister's statement that &ldquo;virement in the normal course will not be exercised in respect of expenditure incurred or proposed to be incurred in any way which seriously differs from <Col N="496" /> details presented to the Dáil,&rdquo; it hopes that in future cases of this kind, especially where the expenditure arises from a change of policy, as the case quoted would seem to indicate, supplementary estimates will be introduced.</P>
    <P>Now, the Minister has deliberately ignored the last recommendation of the Committee and exceeded the expenditure in the Vote for 1928-29 by such a large amount as £216,403.  Are Deputies, regardless of Party, prepared to allow the Minister for Finance to ignore the wishes of a Committee set up by the House, and to ignore the deliberate instructions and recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor-General?  If Deputy Blythe is prepared to continue that attitude of opposition to the properly-appointed officer and the properly-appointed Committee of the House, I say he is not a fit man to hold the position of Minister for Finance.  That is one of the principal reasons why we on these benches consider the Deputy is unfit for the position proposed for him by the President.  We would like to hear from the President what he has to say in regard to these very important matters.  We have been told, both in the House and through the country since Deputy Ward's Bill was introduced, that there is no money to meet it.  The President resigned and gave as his reason for refusing to put the Bill into operation that he had not the necessary money.  Ministers appointed here have no authority to expend any moneys not properly provided for in the Estimates.  Every Deputy who stands for the good government of the country would like to know what the President has to say regarding the attitude of the proposed Minister for Finance in connection with these important matters which affect every taxpayer in the country.</P>

      <P>Some time ago the leader-writer of the &ldquo;Star&rdquo; said that the policy of the Labour Party was founded on the principle that they must not vote too often with either Fianna Fáil or Cumann na <Col N="497" /> nGaedheal.  No doubt, that explains why Deputy Davin, before proceeding to attack Cumann na nGaedheal a few moments ago, had to balance the account by making a few preliminary remarks about Deputy de Valera.  That form of attack was to be expected from Deputy Davin because he is one of the five Labour Deputies who are to be placed in a privileged position in consequence of a decision of the Executive of a British Trade Union arrived at some time ago.</P>

      <P>We have been asked to adopt the motion moved by the <Col N="498" /> President to the effect that certain Deputies mentioned therein should be nominated to form the Executive Council of Saorstát Eireann.  I cannot understand how President Cosgrave, having been afforded this God-given opportunity of getting rid of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, could make up his mind to put forward this proposal for his re-nomination. If there is any Minister whose failure as an administrator is outstanding, that Minister is Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney.  Not merely has he not succeeded in instilling a sense of discipline in the forces under his control, but he has repeatedly in the Dáil and outside deliberately encouraged indiscipline.  Many examples of that can be offered.</P>
      <P>I might content myself with quoting one case to which I made an attempt to refer some time ago.  I have in mind an occurrence at Newport. I am now free to refer to it, because the legal proceedings that arose out of it terminated within the last fortnight with a final decision against the Guards involved.  On Christmas Eve the Guards of Newport, having decided that the situation there was so terribly dull that it was unendurable, proceeded to organise an attack on the barracks. Having, as the evidence produced in the court showed, proceeded to get nicely intoxicated, they embarked upon a tour around the streets firing shots.  On the strength of the shots they proclaimed loudly that the barracks was being attacked.  They then rushed into the houses of every well-known supporter of Fianna Fáil and assaulted them.  I am glad to say that these supporters have succeeded in recovering damages.</P>

      <P>The position is this: that the people concerned, having taken an action against the Civic Guards and won it in the Circuit Courts, had to bear the costs of an appeal to the High Court.  A retrial was ordered, and the case was taken back to the Circuit Court, and those who were assaulted won it. The case was then brought to the High Court, and they won again. Now, the Guards, financed by the State, are going to go further.  We have often been asked why it is that persons assaulted by the Guards do not take their cases into court.  That is a very sufficient answer.  A person assaulted by the Guards would have to be a millionaire in order to win his case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that the Minister for Justice has failed completely to instil a sense of discipline in a certain section of the force under his charge.  Not merely has he failed to instil that sense of discipline, but he has deliberately encouraged a sense of indiscipline. He has proved himself absolutely incompetent, no matter from what aspect you view his administration. Not merely has he failed to instil a sense of discipline, but he has failed to create efficiency.  I said yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that in practically every major crime which has occurred in this country since the Minister was appointed, the Guards have failed to bring anyone to justice.  Undoubtedly, they are very efficient in arresting small boys for throwing snowballs or playing handball in the streets.  We hear frequently of their efficiency in hunting down distillers of poteen, and persons engaged in other illegal activities of that kind, but when it comes to crime of a big nature, particularly crime with a political tinge, the Guards prove themselves always to be hopelessly inefficient.  The only action that they could see fit to take has been declared by Judges and juries to be illegal.  That action <Col N="501" /> has been repeatedly defended by the Minister in this House.</P>
      <P>Before the Dáil passes the motion which the President moved, asking for the reappointment of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney as the Minister for Justice, it should have an assurance that these illegal activities for which he has been responsible are going to cease.  Deputy O'Connell yesterday referred to the fact that this is not a normal country.  In any normal country a Minister for Justice who was responsible for the formulation of a policy of that kind, a policy which was declared to be illegal by the Courts of the land, would have been asked to resign by the President.  He certainly would not have been allowed to continue in office.  Here, not merely have we such a Minister for Justice allowed to continue in office, but when the President was afforded an opportunity of putting him painlessly out of the Cabinet he refused to take it. From the point of view of discipline, of efficiency, of mere legality, the Minister has been unable to control the police force in the country.  For that reason, and for that reason alone, this motion should be rejected.</P>
      <P>There are, however, other reasons why it should be rejected.  The Minister for Agriculture had a lot to say yesterday to which I would like to refer to-day, at least in part.  Before going on to that there is one sentence in his speech which concerns me personally and to which I would like to draw attention, because it gives me an opportunity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It merely arises in this way.  I want to give the House some personal proof that the proposed Minister for Defence has some martial knowledge.  I know he has. The Minister for Agriculture yesterday questioned whether or not I participated in the Rising of 1916.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking of it at the moment.  I want to tell the Minister that the first time I met or saw the Minister for Defence was in the Post Office in 1916.  I was quite a young fellow then.  I came down from the roof where I had been for two days.  I was exceedingly hungry, and I was ordered to the cook-house for a meal.  I was provided with a mug of tea and half a loaf of bread. I was about to wire into it when a man with an Oxford accent said: &ldquo;That is too much for one man.&rdquo; He took the half loaf of bread and cut it in two.  As I say, that was the first time I ever saw the Minister for Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the Minister's speech yesterday is headed &ldquo;Flogging a Dead Horse.&rdquo; The Minister, of course, is an advocate of flogging.  He has a mediaeval mind.  In fact the whole Executive Council, I think, advocate flogging.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, flogging human beings.  They introduced a law to legalise the flogging of human beings.  Will that continue to be the policy of the Executive Council? The Minister for Agriculture has been called &ldquo;the flogging Minister&rdquo; and the President has been called &ldquo;flogging Bill.&rdquo;  Are we to have this mediaeval policy continued in operation?  If so, will the President tell us why he proposes to stop at flogging?  Why not introduce the thumb-screw, the rack, and the pitch cap?  If the Minister for Agriculture lived a hundred and fifty years ago I believe that he would have been a member of the Yeos and would have made the use of the pitch-cap his favourite argument. There is another personal point to which I would like to refer.  The Minister for Agriculture referred to three leaders of Fianna Fáil.  I say <Col N="503" /> that there is only one leader, and that is Deputy de Valera, and he is the leader because he is the best man in the Party.  I must say that never in my experience have I met any man with a clearer vision or a sounder judgment than Deputy de Valera, and the day on which the Minister for Agriculture is fit to blacken his boots that day he will be entitled to be treated with respect here.  Deputy de Valera is leader because, as Deputy O'Kelly said yesterday, he is the outstanding man of his generation.  I am not the leader, and I am not the deputy-leader, because I am not fit to be while these men are in the Party.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister sit down?  We are discussing a motion that the House should assent to the nomination by the President of certain Deputies to hold certain Ministries.  This is a peculiarly democratic procedure, not having any parallel in any Parliament of which we have knowledge. It is open, it seems to me, to very grave abuse, but if it is intended that this debate should proceed on a basis of discussion of the personal character of these Deputies, and any other people in the House, then the debate, I think, should not proceed on those lines.  In any event, these particular Deputies were assented to by the House in October, 1927, and I think the debate now should be confined to the discussion of their political operations since that date. Charge and counter-charge on personal questions will not lead us to any decision on the matter with any credit to ourselves.</P>

      <P>The Minister told us that he had no national record.  That is an argument against his election. Reference was made to what happened <Col N="505" /> in 1916.  In 1916 Deputy Cosgrave was fighting for the freedom of this country.  I do not know what happened to him, but he got such a shock on that occasion he has not been the same man since.  While he was fighting, the Minister for Agriculture was slinking around the streets of Loughrea denouncing the looters who had broken the Imperial peace.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass has accepted the ruling just now that we are confined to a discussion of the operations of the Deputies named in the motion since October, 1927, but in the next sentence he goes back to 1916.  The Minister for Agriculture says that he wants proof.  That is precisely what we cannot have in this House when allegations are made.  This debate cannot be diverted into an attempt to prove that the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Lemass, or someone else, took a particular line of conduct, or stated a particular thing, in 1916, or at a later date.  The Minister's denial should be accepted and we should proceed to political questions.</P>

I say that it is untrue; that there is no truth whatever in it.

I said that I approved of no robberies, but I said that there were circumstances in which I would not consider them to be robberies.  I asked for a definition from the cross-examining counsel of his interpretation. He gave his interpretation of bank robberies and I said that I would not accept his interpretation in all circumstances.  I said that in the circumstances which obtained on a particular occasion, when two Governments were striving for supremacy, that an officer on one side, who was armed with authority from his Executive, was entitled to take the money from the banks on the opposite side and that during the Volunteer days the people who have put Mr. Hogan and people like him into power, gave orders to raid post offices.  I distinctly said that.  I believed&mdash;I said I was not positive&mdash;that some banks, like the Northern Bank, were included. I also said that I took part in raids which I was ordered to take part in.  I did not say that I ever got cash.  As a matter of fact the raids I took part in were on telephone exchanges which are just the same as post offices.  It is money's worth.  I said that, believing it to be true.

      <P>As far as the Chair is concerned, it is absolutely impossible in this House to prove the exact facts of any statement, particularly about a person. In other words, we are not here in the position of judge and <Col N="509" /> jury and cannot perform the functions of a judge and jury.  I think it is a good rule when a Deputy's personal conduct is impugned that his own version of what he said or did should be accepted.  In this particular instance, I should prefer that no personal statements were made. Either we must have a withdrawal all round, or we must leave the thing now, having heard the accusation against the Minister for Agriculture, his own statement of what he did or said; the accusation against Deputy Boland, and his own statement of what he said on a particular occasion. But I cannot accept the Minister's suggestion that we should have proof by calling witnesses, either Deputies from Galway or anywhere else.</P>

This kind of proposal has no parallel in any Parliament, and it is open to the most extraordinary abuses.  You could discuss the matter for ever in all kinds of ways.

      <P>One point that I want to bring to the notice of the House is that England never attempted to produce proof that she is legally entitled to the payment of the annuities. It is the policy of the Government, in a disputed legal matter involving £3,000,000 per year, to give the benefit of the doubt to England. Surely it should be their policy to hold the money here until the liability has been proved.  It has not been proved.  On the strength of a legal quibble the Government is trying to defend its attitude.  The loss of the money is a very serious loss to us, and we urge that the Irish people should be given the benefit of the doubt.</P>

      <P>The Deputy does not understand the question and I cannot possibly explain it to him now. Recently international conferences have been meeting to consider the amount which Germany was required to pay under the Treaty of Versailles in reparations to the Allies.  These international conferences of experts decided that Germany was being asked to pay more than she could afford to pay, and that, consequently, there was unemployment and depression in that country.  Under the so-called financial settlement which the Minister for Finance negotiated, and which the Government approved, the Irish Free State is paying to Great Britain an annual sum which bears a higher proportion to our total State revenue than the amount that Germany is paying to the Allies in reparation for the World War.</P>

The statements that we get occasionally from the Minister for Agriculture and his colleagues that Fianna Fáil are urging the repudiation of debts or the embezzlement of money that is not ours are obviously only begging the question.  If there is a debt we will meet it; if there is a liability we will honour it.  But until that debt has been proved we propose to give the Irish people the benefit of the doubt.  We cannot embezzle money that is already ours; we cannot repudiate a debt that does not exist.</P>

He quoted an article by me <Col N="516" /> advocating the imposition of tariffs for the development of Irish industries. He tried to distort it into an advocacy of Empire free trade.  I never mentioned the word &ldquo;Empire&rdquo; in the whole article.  That is the irresponsible individual whom this House is asked to appoint to the important office of Minister for Agriculture.

      <P>The administration of the Minister for Agriculture for the past eight years has been marked by continuous decline in agricultural production.  He has only been a member of the Executive Council since 1927, and therefore is only responsible for its decisions since then.  Before that he was recognised as irresponsible. But since he first did acquire the position of Minister for Agriculture there has been a decline in tillage, a decline in live-stock, and a decline in every form of agricultural production, with the exception, I think, of sheep.  The number of cattle in the country is less than it was in 1922; the number of dairy cows is less; the acreage under every crop in 1929 was substantially less than in 1922.  The greatest Minister for Agriculture in the world! If any other country had a Minister to produce similar results, there would have been a famine long ago.  The only reason there has not been a famine here is because this advocate of Empire free trade has been able to arrange that we could purchase Canadian wheat instead of growing our own.  He, of course, calls that free trade.  It is only free at this end.  As the Minister knows, the Canadian wheat pool has not sold any of the 1929 crop to us yet, as we were not prepared to pay the price.</P>

      <P>I may point out to the President that there is a very strong rumour in circulation to the effect that certain of the leading articles in the President's newspaper are either contributed or inspired by the Minister for Finance.  If it is not correct that the Minister for Finance wrote the article entitled, &ldquo;The Army,&rdquo; which appeared in the issue before last, I think that fact should be definitely stated.  The attention given to that particular article and the uneasiness which was caused by it, were inspired by the fact that the current belief was that the author was the Minister for Finance.  Was he or was he not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Then we cannot get a definite denial.  We find that there is a split in the Cabinet already.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In the old Cabinet, which is to be reconstituted as a new Cabinet.  The Minister for Finance holds that the Army is superior to the Dáil, and entitled to force its will on the Dáil, if ever it differs from the policy of the Executive which the Dáil elects.  The Minister for Agriculture stands for democracy par excellence.  He is going to defend the Dáil against the Army, when the Minister for Finance leads out his cohorts against the Fianna Fáil Government.  We <Col N="519" /> thank him for the offer of an alliance. I hardly think we will need it.  I am inclined to think that the Army would refuse to follow the Minister for Finance.  I do honestly think that in matters of this kind we will find a much greater volume of common sense in the rank and file of the Army than we will find in the Army Council or the Executive Council.</P>
      <P>I do think, therefore, that the President should prevent irresponsible Ministers writing newspaper articles of that kind.  I think that the Dáil should express its disapproval of these militant contributions, reminiscent of the old style, from the Minister for Finance by rejecting this particular motion.  We have seen that the Government which it is proposed to re-appoint has practically failed to achieve anything in any sphere of its activities.  The Minister for Finance, when he is not embarking upon these incursions into journalism, is merely marking time and doing nothing, either to ease the burden of taxation by effecting administrative economies or by embarking upon any project for the improvement of the financial conditions of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked him some time ago if his Government was satisfied with the working of the Currency Act, or if they proposed to accept the recommendation, made by the official from the Department of Finance who was a member of the Banking Commission, that the whole question should be reconsidered at the conclusion of five years.  It is just five years since the Banking Commission reported. The Minister said that it was not their intention, yet anyhow, to reconsider the findings of the Bankers' Commission on banking.  The Minister for Defence sits idle and permits one of his colleagues to undermine the discipline of the Army.  The Minister for Agriculture has produced nothing but decay, as I have said, in every sphere of agricultural activity.  The outstanding achievement of the Minister for Local Government <Col N="520" /> and Public Health since last elected has been the reduction of housing grants, following the publication of the figures ascertained in 1926 relating to the needs for housing. In any case, the individual who was responsible for devising the monstrous provisions of the Local Government (Dublin) Bill should not be in any Executive.  As to the Minister for Education I have nothing to say.  Nobody takes him seriously.</P>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs happens also to be the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I think that if the President wants to continue the Department of External Affairs that, at least, he ought to secure some person to fill that important position other than the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I am convinced that the work of the Department of Industry and Commerce has been seriously prejudiced by the fact that the Minister has been gadding around international conferences in Europe instead of attending to the work to be done in that Department.  With 50,000 unemployed here, with 25,000 emigrants, and with our industries declining when they are not being bought out by foreign financial interests, the Minister for Industry and Commerce is more concerned with the question of naval parity between France and Italy than he is in the matter of bringing about an improvement in the situation in this country.  The Minister for Justice I have already referred to.  He has failed to instil discipline or to produce efficiency in the Guards.  He has failed even to induce them to act legally.  He is certainly the worst of all.  If for no other reason, if every other person nominated in the motion was an archangel, while it includes Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, then, I submit, the House should not approve of the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentRice" hpid="Mr. Rice Mr. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the motion moved by the President.  In doing so I should like to refer to some observations made by Deputy Lemass to-day and last night.  You, sir, pointed out that the debate <Col N="521" /> should be self-contained, but Deputy Lemass has repeated in a more emphatic form to-day the statement that he made last night.  Deputy Lemass, in answer to questions put by the Minister for Agriculture and the President, said that they had the unanimous opinion of counsel on the question of the land annuities.  I must assume, of course, that Deputy Lemass would not make a deliberate misstatement to the House, and I must assume, therefore, that Deputy Lemass is not aware of the facts. The Deputy gave a modest description of himself as not being a leader or anything like that in the Fianna Fáil Party.  From the statements made by the Deputy, I must assume that he is not in the confidence of the Fianna Fáil Party at all.  What I am now going to state to the House is a matter of common knowledge.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass, Deputy de Valera and other members of the Fianna Fáil Party have gone around the country making statements.  I say they have deliberately misled the people of this country on this question of land annuities, and all the legal advice that they have about them.  Deputy Lemass has stated again and again at public meetings that they have the unanimous opinion of their lawyers on this question. Deputy de Valera stated the same thing in this House on at least one occasion.  That has been repeated at meeting after meeting in the country.  I make this charge against the Party opposite, that they are deliberately misleading the farmers and the people of this country on this matter.  I see Deputy Lemass smiling.  He will not smile so much after I have dealt with this a little further.</P>

      <P>He will probably squirm as much as he did yesterday when the Minister for Agriculture was dealing with him.  In May last Deputy de Valera in this House read a list of the questions that were put to gentlemen whom he described as eminent lawyers.  Of course, they were questions that no solicitor <Col N="522" /> would put to any counsel.  They were questions framed deliberately to elicit certain information and a certain answer.  The most extraordinary thing about this case which was submitted to these counsel was that, unlike every other case that I or any other barrister ever saw submitted to counsel, the general advice of counsel on the question was not asked.  That was deliberately omitted, of course, because the general advice would have been to this effect, that there was no foundation for the case being made on the question of land annuities by Fianna Fáil.  The questions were framed up for the purpose of getting the answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no,&rdquo; and no other kind of answer, on the specific question submitted.  They were, if I may use the expression, framed up questions to get &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no,&rdquo; and to get no further information.  Deputy Ruttledge, who, I am sure, is a competent solicitor, omitted the final and most important question that every solicitor puts to counsel when he wants to get advice.</P>

      <P>Certainly not.  I say that certain questions were put to counsel named in this House and outside to which obvious answers &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;no&rdquo; were given.  I do say that they were not asked the questions which would have elicited their opinion on the real matter at issue. I do say deliberately&mdash;I am sorry that Deputy Ruttledge is not in the House at the moment, but his friends opposite will have an opportunity of <Col N="523" /> consulting him&mdash;that the party opposite have in their possession, and have deliberately concealed from this House and from the country, the opinion of an extremely eminent member of the legal profession.

      <P>I do not want to make invidious comparisons between one member of the profession and another, but I will say that the member of the profession whose opinion Deputies opposite have, as to the effect that their case for the annuities is nonsense, is not merely a more eminent member of the profession than the barristers who are quoted as having given their opinions to Fianna Fáil but is an even more eminent member of the profession than myself&mdash;I knew that would tickle Deputy Lemass&mdash;and a much more eminent member than any of the persons whose names have been quoted in this House, and quoted by Deputy Lemass, as having given an opinion on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all I know about it.  I have seen the opinions, and the mystery, I think, exists in the imagination of the Deputy.  I want to refer to the Department of Justice.  Somebody says that we are all at it.  It is very necessary, because it goes to the root of the matter.  It is very important that a respect for law exist among the people of the country and that the Minister for Justice should try to inculcate a spirit of respect for the law.  He frequently speaks here of civic spirit and of getting the proper regard for law and order, but it is my opinion that there is no Deputy in this House who is less likely to get that respect for law and order in the country than Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney. He has been asked time after time to hold enquiries into the conduct of a section of the Guards called the C.I.D., and he has refused to do so.  He has been asked by the public bodies in Clare to have such an enquiry, but he will not have it. I wonder why.  Time after time matters were brought up here, and his reply was: &ldquo;Well, the man got an epileptic fit and he was not beaten,&rdquo; though medical evidence proved that the man never suffered from anything like that.  There is a kicking cow in Clare about which cow ballads have been written all over Connacht and in part of Munster. <Col N="529" /> He has become famous for his kicking cows.  That is not the spirit that the Minister for Justice should show if he wants to have regard for law and order.  He challenges us to know if we want law and order and if we want the law enforced.  I say that if he has a case against anybody he should get that person tried before a court and if he is found guilty he should be sentenced according to the law, but do not get men to persecute political opponents, people whom they suspect, often without reason, of having arms, to drive them out of employment and make it impossible for them to live in this country, for that is what is being done.  Some of these people have gone to the courts, have got four definite verdicts against the C.I.D., and damages have been awarded.  Other cases will come on, possibly with similar results, and I want to know what action the Deputy is going to take if he is appointed Minister, or if the President can tell us whether that campaign is to be continued, whether the same spirit is to actuate the Ministry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ruttledge briefly referred to the Gilmore case, and I am sorry that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney is not here, because I wanted to refer to it in more detail.  In the lower court the case was so strong against the Guards that it was sent to the Circuit Court.  In the Circuit Court a counsel was appointed by the State to represent Gilmore against the C.I.D.  That counsel did not address the jury at the opening or at the closing of the case.  Why?  Was he not properly briefed?  The C.I.D. had two senior and one junior counsel to represent them.  Were they paid by the State?  If they were paid by the State, what was the reason?  Why was Gilmore given only one junior counsel&mdash;I am not animadverting against him personally&mdash;but why did he not address the jury at the opening or at the closing of the case?  Was he not properly briefed?  Did the State solicitor interview the witnesses and question them, or does the prospective Minister for Justice not think <Col N="530" /> it is the duty of the State to protect the citizen and to see justice done, not at all costs to acquit the C.I.D., as if it did not matter to the ordinary citizen?  That is a case on which I would like to have some more information, because the dice were loaded against Gilmore.  What chance had he before a jury with two senior counsel and a junior counsel for the C.I.D., who were the defendants in the case, and one junior counsel for Gilmore&mdash;a counsel who did not, as I say, address the jury at the opening or at the closing of the case, and who was not, I submit, properly briefed?  Would the Deputy also tell us why the counsel whom Gilmore had in the lower court were not retained in the higher court?  That is the usual practice, and it is the ordinary practice in England.  Why was it not followed here?  That was but one sample of the spirit, and naturally the Guards and the C.I.D. take their cue from the Minister.  He sets the headline for them, and they must necessarily follow.  Everybody in this House knows that there is a certain section of the C.I.D., who vented political animosity against a certain section of their countrymen whom they are sent to persecute now.  It was proposed in the Dáil once that a section of them who were prominent and who were bitter enemies of some of us in the civil war should be given other employment, and that people who had no connection with either side in the civil was should be put on such political work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan (Clare) Mr. Hogan (Clare)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Clare): I notice that Deputy Patrick McGilligan is nominated as Minister for Industry and Commerce, and it is quite meet that we should get some expression as to what is to be the policy of that Minister on the very important matters that confront the country at the moment regarding industry and commerce. It is very important that we should know what he proposes to do, and whether he proposes rather to create more unemployment than to give employment, as one would expect in connection with some of the measures he proposes to introduce. It has been hinted that there is an intention to carry out full development of the Shannon Power Scheme. What is the Deputy's policy regarding the people who will be thrown out of employment by the full development of that scheme?  If we are to take it that he will continue the policy that he has carried out up to the present in that connection, we will get some idea of what he proposes to do if he develops it in full and throws other people out of employment. I am in full sympathy with the partial and full development of the Shannon Scheme in so far as it helps the nation, and it is helping the nation at the moment. There can be no question about it that it is a scheme that deserves support and that has proved fruitful for the welfare of the country.  But when we consider that in various places people are unemployed because of its operations, we are entitled to ask the Deputy if he is going to throw other people out of employment <Col N="532" /> without compensation if he goes on with the full development. I have in mind some forty or fifty people in Killaloe who are unemployed owing to the development of the Shannon Scheme.  I have in mind the fact that I brought a deputation of these people to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I have in mind the fact that the case was stated in full to him, and I have in mind the fact that, not alone these people themselves, but their fathers and forefathers, earned their living by a certain occupation on the Shannon. Not alone has the Minister refused compensation, but he has told me that he will not make an investigation on the spot in order to find out whether these people are entitled to compensation or not.  He has definitely and deliberately turned down their application, and if we are to have a full development of the Shannon Scheme, we are entitled to know whether this is going to happen to the same people who follow this occupation on the Shannon.</P>
      <P>The fishing on the Shannon is entirely disorganised.  I have been told, and I believe it is true, that from Ardnacrusha to the source of the Shannon, only four salmon were caught as the fishing is thoroughly disorganised.  I pass over his callous indifference to unemployment.  The Deputy seems to have no policy and no intention of formulating a policy on the distress consequent on the unemployment that exists.  There is no use endeavouring to try to induce him to formulate a policy.  He is callous and indifferent on that matter, and I do not think, on that account, that Deputy Patrick McGilligan is a fit and proper person to be nominated for the position of Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the matter of local government I notice that Risteard Ua Maolchatha is being nominated as Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  I think no more unsuitable person could be nominated for that position, no person with less knowledge of local government administration, <Col N="533" /> and if there is any position in which it is necessary to have a background of administrative knowledge, it is in local government. If there is one person in the Executive Council who would be fit for that position, and capable of doing something in it, it is the President. As for the rest, not one of them has any knowledge or any administrative background in local government.  Certainly, Risteard Ua Maolchatha has no knowledge of the administration of local government. His only policy seems to be to concentrate, to draw everything to Dublin, to control it from there, and to centralise everything.  That seems to be his entire policy, and thereby to create unemployment by the dismissal of officials from employment they held in the various activities of local government.</P>
    <P>I would like to know if the Deputy has a housing policy.  What does he propose to do towards providing houses for the thousands of people who at present need houses?  No doubt the President can tell me that thousands of houses have been built within the last five or six years as a result of the Government policy; no doubt he will tell us that thousands of necessary houses were erected because of the Government policy.  But have houses been erected for the people who were in need of houses?  If he came down the lanes and byways in any town he would see the people housed in wretched hovels that they should not be in.  Can anyone go round his own town and say that within the last five or six years there has been any appreciable diminution in the hardship caused by the wretched housing conditions?  The money that has been expended by the Government in housing in nine cases out of ten has gone astray; it has gone to the speculative builder who erected houses for sale at a high price or for letting at a high rent.  It has not provided houses for the poor people at present living in wretched hovels. In order to examine that closer one has to examine the situation in each town or district.  I have here a report from the medical officer of <Col N="534" /> health for the town in which I live &mdash;Ennis.  I know the town pretty well.  I have often gone around it, because I have canvassed it fairly extensively when looking for votes, like everyone else in public life. Here is what the medical officer of health reports regarding the position of housing in Ennis urban district: &ldquo;The number of houses in that district which are not, and cannot be made, fit for human habitation is two hundred.&rdquo;  No doubt, houses have been built in that town, and no doubt also there has been no rule made in connection with the erection of these houses to enable people to come out of the back lanes and slums and live in these houses.  That money will continue to go astray until the Government takes up the problem and enables the public authorities to build houses for these people.  The way the money is going now is not relieving the slum problem or the housing shortage.</P>
    <P>Coming to my friend the Minister for Justice, I would not like to leave the motion without having a word to say about him, or he might take it ill of me.  I want to put the position to him in quite a different fashion from that which was put from the Fianna Fáil Benches.  The Minister was good enough at one time to suggest that I would not look like a fish out of water on the Fianna Fáil Benches.  I want to say to the Minister that the way I want to put the position regarding the ill-treatment of citizens by the C.I.D.&mdash;the Criminal Investigation Department, or whatever is the proper name&mdash;is quite different from the way in which it was put from the Fianna Fáil Benches.  I want to rehabilitate these men in the confidence of the citizens.  I want citizens to be able to say: &ldquo;Well, we have trust in these men.&rdquo;  I want the citizens to be able to say: &ldquo;Well, you have been charged with certain things, you have been charged with beating someone, taking him into a field and beating him black and blue.  But the Minister for Justice ordered an impartial investigation into the matter which has disproved these <Col N="535" /> statements, and we can trust you because no real evidence has been brought against you.&rdquo;  I suggest that the Minister does not charge even Clare with an epidemic of perjury. I have affidavits which were made by responsible people who are prepared to repeat what is in them on oath.  Yet, the Minister has not ordered an inquiry into them.  They are matters of some importance.  I have underlined a few statements in them&mdash;I will not give the Guards' names, I am particularly careful about that&mdash;and I will tell the Minister that I do not want to make any political capital out of this charge against the Guards.  As a matter of fact, it may cause me to lose some support.  There are personal friends of mine in the Guards boys I would trust in any circumstances; men that I do not believe would be guilty of any despicable, mean or cowardly conduct.</P>
    <P>As for the men in uniform whom I meet in Clare and in the streets of Ennis, I know nothing bad of them. I know that they are carrying out very difficult duties with a minimum of inconvenience to the citizens.  I have nothing to say to them in any event.  But when a public representative gets affidavits of this kind to the extent of perhaps a score, and when these affidavits are submitted to public bodies, and that these public bodies through the mouthpieces of the representatives that come from the areas concerned say that these affidavits are worthy of consideration and investigation, when public representatives get these documents, and come to the Minister and privately and publicly suggest that an inquiry should be held, the Minister flouts the demand by saying there is no case.  He said on the last occasion that I raised the matter that the persons named in my question were known to be engaged in a conspiracy to overthrow the State by arms.  If they are known to be engaged in a conspiracy to overthrow the State by arms, there was a very definite and proper course for the Minister to take, and I suggest that he should take that <Col N="536" /> course.  If I come to the Minister in a fortnight's time and put down a question asking him why A, B and C, who are known to the Minister to be engaged in a criminal conspiracy to overthrow the State by arms are not arrested, what answer will he give me?  He says they are known to be engaged in the overthrow of the State.  If I put down their names and ask him why they are not arrested what answer will he give?</P>

This House is a collection of the representatives of the people and each Deputy in this House is within his right and is entitled to speak and to be heard as any other Deputy.  To suggest that I refused to be bracketed with Deputy Cooney is not a statement of the facts.</P>

For some reason or other that matter was not raised, and on the following evening the Minister for Justice proceeded to answer me on a case which I had not made.

      <P>The Deputy's facts are right, but the question which the Deputy put before to me and which the Deputy put again within the last two minutes is precisely the question which Deputy Cooney put the other night, and which was answered in the Deputy's presence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not objecting to that, but the Minister for Justice elect has stated that I declined to be bracketed with Deputy Cooney on the matter.  I declined to be bracketed with no Deputy, not even with the Minister for Justice elect. I am quite prepared to act with any Deputy, but I refuse to have a case answered by any Minister which I did not make.  I am not beholden to Deputy Cooney to make my case any more than I am beholden to the Minister for Justice elect.  I make my own case, and when I make it let the Minister for Justice elect in fact answer it.  Let there be no confusion. I did not refuse to be bracketed with any Deputy.  Let that not be done in the future.  When I read a few extracts from the affidavit, I am sure that any independent-minded Deputies, even those Deputies sitting behind the Minister elect, will agree that they are matters for investigation.  It says here: .... &ldquo;Then searched my sister's room, and abused her, and pushed her about in an attempt to seize her private letters.&rdquo;  Does the Minister for Justice elect think that it is right for any members of a police force to pull a girl about and try and seize a girl's private letters?  It goes on: &ldquo;I'll do whatever I like within the four walls of this house....  The police party got on their bicycles and forced me by threats and pushes <Col N="538" /> to travel at the same pace.  When I refused I was pushed along, struck in the back, and the bicycles of the police were run against me....  I was taken from the cell to the orderly room, there placed on my back on a table by C.I.D. man So-and-so&mdash;got up on his knees on my stomach, placing his thumbs in my throat and pressing them into it. until I was on the verge of suffocation. I tried to free myself as best I could.  I was then taken to the back yard, and there my arms were severely twisted....  I was again taken out and placed on the table, and Guard So-and-So repeated the assault committed before, this time being helped by Guard So-and-So, who held down my legs to prevent me escaping from the other Guard.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have refrained from mentioning the Guards' names, but I suggest to the Minister for Justice elect that if he wants the ordinary citizens to have confidence in these men he ought, in justice to these men themselves, have an inquiry ordered, and he ought to have that inquiry ordered immediately, and made as full and impartial as possible.  I am not approaching it by assuming that these men are guilty in advance, but if the citizens are to have any confidence in them they must be rehabilitated in the confidence of the citizens by an inquiry.</P>

      <P>In asking the Dáil to assent to the President's nomination of his Cabinet, I should like to point out to both the Dáil and the country that the task which that Cabinet has been asked to take up is no light task, and is a task for which very little thanks have been given in the past, or are likely to be given in the future.  We are asking men to-day to continue to devote the best years of their lives to the service of this country, of continue to devote to the public welfare, and to the well-being of the Irish nation, years of youth and years of vigour which they might well, if they were different men, be glad to devote to their own well-being and their own advancement.  We are asking the men whom the President is calling <Col N="539" /> on to assist him in the task of governing this country&mdash;and I would like the House and the country to remember this fact&mdash;still to take their lives in their hands, because it is, perhaps, the salient fact about the political position of this country at present that we have not yet arrived at the period in our history when the lives of Irishmen, acting as the spokesmen of the majority of the Irish people, are safe in this country.  The President and his colleagues are taking on again to-day a task in the execution of which they will be called upon daily to risk their lives.</P>

      <P>The people whom we are putting into office by this vote would be carrying their lives in their hands day by day.  We have listened to the attacks made on the President and the Executive Council.  I would like the House and the country to bear that fact in mind.  They are going into office because it is the will of the majority of this House and of the majority of the representatives of the people, and because it is the will of the people that they should go into office.  They are being asked not alone by this House, but by the vast majority of the citizens of this country, to take up again the task that they have performed so successfully for the last seven and a half years.  They are being asked because it seems abundantly clear to the Dáil that there is not likely to exist, for many days to come, any alternative Government to the Government of Deputy Cosgrave and his Cabinet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We heard a great deal from Deputy Lemass last night and from other speakers in this House about the prevalence of poverty in this country, about squalor, starvation and so on.  It is easy for any citizen who is not blinded by political prejudice, <Col N="540" /> who has not his brain distorted and disordered by political propaganda, who is grown-up enough to look back for fifteen years and look at the changes that have taken place up and down the country during the past seven or eight years of these fifteen years, to realise for himself the difference that the freedom of this country has already made to realise the progress that has been made, in spite of every difficulty and every obstacle, during these years in making Ireland an Irish and a prosperous nation.  I thought I heard a voice murmuring something about the Six Counties.  That is the kind of talk we have to listen to in this House from one day to another. There is not one Deputy in this House who can afford to throw stones at the Government on the question of the Six Counties.  There is not one Deputy who can produce any policy or any shadow or adumbration of policy by which anything more can be done to unite the Six Counties with the rest of Ireland than is being done by the Government at the present moment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass talked last night about squalor, about how we had only to go around the country to realise the depth of the squalor and poverty to which it has sunk.  I could not help thinking when listening to Deputy Aiken that Deputy Lemass must have drawn upon his experience of his own Party, because the mind displayed by the speech of Deputy Aiken could only be described as a squalid mind, as a slum mind, the mind of a child distorted and perverted by some kind of misfortune. He is incapable of looking at any question straight, and incapable of taking a generous or a decent point of view about any political matter.</P>

If the support was to be similar to the Deputy's attacks on the Government, I would much sooner that the Government would do without it, not only his attacks on the Government, but his utterances in general.  The Labour Party is constantly lecturing the other Parties in this House because we, according to the Labour Party, are keeping the Treaty issue alive in this country, because we are going back to 1921 and 1922.  I notice that there is a certain amount of coyness on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party in recent weeks to go back to 1922.  Apparently the word has gone forth from their leader that we are going to go back to 1014 for the future.</P>

      <P>I would like to make this one statement.  I think it is not fair that Deputy Dr. Ryan and other members of his Party should be allowed to get up and make accusations against me about 1916 without my being permitted to say where I was in 1916, if necessary. I do not think there is any reason why I should give any explanation to Deputy Dr. Ryan or anyone else.  But I was at home on my holidays in 1916 for the reason that the people who made the rebellion did not think me sufficiently important to tell me that there was going to be a rebellion.  I could say a few things about the Deputy's leader and what he was doing in 1916 that might astonish him.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out to the Labour Party and to the country generally that this controversy on the Treaty about which so much complaint has arisen, and has justly arisen, is not being kept alive by the Government Party.  We do not wish to continue debating about the rights and wrongs of the Treaty for one day longer than is necessary.  It is not we who are anxious to go back, it is not we who want to rake up the past.  Aided by Government organisation, we have spent the last seven and a half years in trying to build up the future.  They are the only Party in this country who can claim any real progressive work towards the future of this country. While every other Party in the country was trying to eat away the foundations upon which the future could be built the Government Party are the only Party that can claim to have done anything towards that future.  No other Party can throw stones at them for the work they have done.  They can, at least, show some claim for work done on behalf of the country.</P>

I have repeated several times in the country and I want to repeat it here again that it is not now and it is not within the next ten years even that the country will realise the immense work that has been done here by President Cosgrave and his Government during the last eight years.  It is not this generation but future generations that will turn back to honour and to thank the men who stood with President Cosgrave in the breach in this country during these years, some of which were terrible years.  I have said several times that in days to come historians will relate that under President Cosgrave the Irish people enjoyed the best Government that this country has seen for many hundreds of years.  I know that Deputy Lemass and his Party have scoffed at me for saying that, and the Labour Party, who are always prepared to give a better Government than any other Party, are prepared to scoff at that.  But I maintain the Government that this country has been enjoying for the last seven and a half years is far and away a better Government than any Government this country has seen for many hundreds of years.</P>

We would be down in our graves before we ever saw him taking any part in the work of building up this country.

      <P>I would like to make an appeal in the name of the country to Deputies generally.  I appeal to them to agree to let these issues drop.

      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>We ought all be prepared to agree in this country that, having won a certain political status, we will use that status to the best advantage for the country; that, having got an opportunity and nobody can deny that we have got it&mdash;to make this nation again a progressive Irish nation, we will use that opportunity, and that such criticism as we may utter will be confined to seeing that the opportunities which we have got are better used.  Let us be prepared to agree that instead of quarrelling about the basis on which we are working we will get together and determine that we will all use that basis in an effort to advance instead of going backwards, and instead of trying to dig up every piece of miserable propaganda that we can think of we will turn over a new leaf, get back to honest politics in this country, and cease squabbling about such things as land annuities.  Then we will not have these faked statistics that we have had from Fianna Fail; we will not have the carefully cooked and drawn-up figures trying to prove a certain political thesis. We will all agree that we have a certain measure of self-government and that we can use it to make progress. It is not fair to the nation, <Col N="547" /> instead of using that measure of self-government in order to make progress, to spend our time here squabbling about that measure and trying to minimise what has been done.</P>
      <P>There is nothing more demoralising about the present position than the type of political propaganda which seems to have become the recognised and regular thing in this country during recent years.  Nothing is too fantastic to put into a political paper or sheet.  No invention is too wild so long as you think you can blacken your opponent. You cannot go too far to search out some kind of miserable make-believe, street-corner argument to throw at your opponents.  You cannot descend too low, like Deputy Aiken did this afternoon. There is nothing too mean or miserable for you to think of so long as you think that some mud will stick somewhere.  As one citizen, it is my belief that it is about time we began to examine our own consciences about that kind of political propaganda.  It is about time that we began to realise that the country does not want that kind of political propaganda.  The country wants a rest as far as that kind of mud-slinging is concerned.  The country expects from politicians sound political work.  Instead of spending our days in the Dáil, as we have been for weeks past, discussing pure rubbish to a very large extent, we ought to settle down, if we are capable of doing it, and make some effort for the betterment of the country.  If we are not able to do that, then we should make place for others who are better able.</P>

      <P>Sometimes when I hear the legal profession attacked, I wince.  I have a great regard for that profession as a whole and when I heard Deputy Rice here to-day committing breaches of professional etiquette, I felt as if I would have to hang my head in shame as a person in any way associated with the law at all.  In his speech Deputy Rice suggested that there were six <Col N="548" /> lawyers of eminence and respectability, experts who could be relied upon by the layman, men who were prepared to tell the truth, and when they were called upon to give an opinion they became parties, according to the Deputy, to the answering of certain questions in such a way that they gave a dishonest opinion, that they gave an opinion contrary to the law, that they indulged in a view that no judge would tolerate&mdash; in short, that they misled the public as to what the law is.</P>

What I say is that the lawyers would have to be parties to a political trick and they would be dishonest to their own profession if they were to have done what Deputy Rice suggested they did.  Does he imagine that they were simply handed so many questions and asked to fill in their answers?  Does he think there were no conferences concerning these cases and going into the full law on the matter?  It was for the purpose of crystallising these opinions that the answers were put to certain questions.</P>

      <P>Another thing I want to say is that it is a strange bird that fouls its own nest, and that is what Deputy Rice did in this House as regards his own profession to-day. He suggested that a certain mysterious lawyer had committed a breach of confidence in handing over his opinion, paid for in the ordinary way as between lawyer and client, to a third party who is an opponent. That is the case, or else Deputy Rice does not tell the truth in this House. I will leave it at that.  I am sorry the Minister for Justice is not here because I want to deal with certain cases that have occurred.  The first case that I want to deal with is not <Col N="549" /> a political case at all.  It is a case simply of a very foolish blunder in the administration of justice, one which should not go without criticism in this House because it throws a considerable amount of disrepute upon the conduct of the Department of Justice and the Courts of Justice. I refer to the case at Stradbally and the mishandling of that case.</P>

      <P>Well, I withdraw the statement if you think it has any implication on the action that is going on.  I am anxious that the law, in ordinary neutral matters, should be properly conducted.  I have here a case that I want to bring before the House.  I had almost given up hope of ever getting a satisfactory answer <Col N="550" /> from the Minister in reference to wrong conduct on the part of the Guards in different parts.  I have a letter here from Mr. Patrick Healy, who was raided by the police on Tuesday evening, the 25th February, 1930, at 5 p.m.  He was raided by two Civic Guards, accompanied by a plain-clothes detective, who arrived at his home at Ballycurrane in a motor-car.  He writes:&mdash;</P>
      <P>I was myself absent from the house at the time.  The sergeant from Clashmore was the first to enter the house.  He said to my father, &ldquo;I must search your house.&rdquo;  My father replied, &ldquo;You may.&rdquo;  Before producing any sort of warrant this sergeant and the Guard rushed into my room and proceeded to search.  Meanwhile the detective in the kitchen produced some form of warrant, and read same in the presence of the household.  Not one of the family understood one word, as he mumbled the whole thing from start to finish, and when asked to explain what he had just read he ignored the question and proceeded with the search.  The only clue they gave was when the sergeant asked my father to account for my movements on Saturday night, 22nd.  A raid took place on that night in a lock-up shop in Grange, three miles from my home, and amongst the articles taken was a pair of boots the property of the sergeant in Ardmore.  Supposing they were in quest of stolen goods, I am sure they did not expect to find same in my private correspondence or in my pocket.  They first searched my bedroom, threw the whole bedding on to the floor, ransacked every press, closet and drawer in the room, and carefully persued all my private letters, as well as books, newspapers, and several periodicals&mdash;that is, &ldquo;The Nation, &ldquo;An Phoblacht&rdquo; and &ldquo;Honesty,&rdquo; which I read regularly.</P>
      <P>They were looking for a pair of boots in &ldquo;Honesty&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Nation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>.... They did the same ransacking in three other bedrooms, <Col N="551" /> the parlour and kitchen, and left the whole place in a terrible state.</P>
    <P>Is that the way to carry out a raid? Is that the way in which policemen should do their duty in a country? Supposing that someone in that house had committed the robbery?  Supposing somebody had, is that any excuse for rushing into the house, as they did, just as if they were dealing with armed robbers?  He read the document in such a way that no one in the house knew what was in it.  This is a case in which there is at least evidence to show that it was because he was a supporter of the Fianna Fáil movement that he was being victimised.  But supposing there was not any political aspect to it, supposing the case was as black as possible from the point of view of the individual, was that the way in which the Guards should carry out their duty?  I suggest that this is not the work of the Guards themselves.  The people at the top are responsible for it.  The Minister does not seem to be able to keep his wooden-headed Mussolini under control.  Everything must be done by violence and terrorism.</P>
    <P>There are so many cases that it is really impossible to deal with them all.  Deputy Hogan, from Clare, has already mentioned some cases where there were some twenty persons raided, arrested, and searched without any colourable excuse for doing so.  They were treated in a manner in which no human being should be treated, even if they were murderers instead of being honourable citizens and supporters of the Republican movement.  This is not the way in which to get respect for the Constitution. &ldquo;Constitution&rdquo; is a word that is greatly abused.  I wish we could get some short word substituted for it.  But this is not the way in which to get human beings to live in a small island like Ireland in conditions of civilisation and of agreement of some kind or another&mdash;to live in peace and self-respect.</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice is more responsible for the continuance of a feeling of bitterness amongst Irishmen <Col N="552" /> than any other Department in the State.  It is even worse than Deputy Tierney's speech, though I was very glad to hear Deputy Tierney make a resolution in public that he is never going to refer to the civil war again.  While we do not propose to refer to the civil war, there is a certain insidious attempt being made to get the big guns of morality and theology on the side of the Minister for Defence.  The Minister for Defence is more interested in theological defence than he is in the defence forces of the country.  I suppose his attitude is ruled by the fact that there is now a representative of the Pope in Ireland, and he wants to put us in a wrong position by quoting Leo XIII against us.</P>
    <P>Now, it just happens that Leo the Thirteenth affords perhaps the best explanation of our attitude towards the Free State, because his attitude in the Vatican as a voluntary prisoner as a protest against the Italian Government, which he did not regard as the legitimate Government of the Papal States, is very analogous to our position.  While we submit to conditions as they are and do not propose to change them by armed force, at the same time we hold, as the Pope did in connection with the Papal States, that the Free State is not the legitimate Government. Just as the case of the conduct of the Popes from the time of Pius the Ninth ended finally in a Treaty of agreement, so we may hope, by keeping our end up in regard to what we believe to be the legitimate authority, to get a final treaty which will be satisfactory from our point of view.  It is not fair for the Minister for Defence to quote small pieces out of the Encyclical of Leo the Thirteenth when I could quote long passages, if anyone would take the trouble to read them, which would be a splendid defence of our case and of the case of any country struggling for freedom. I do not want to say more except that I hope that the House will seriously consider the matter before voting and declare that, at least, in the case of the Minister for Justice <Col N="553" /> a change should be made before the present Cabinet is appointed.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to intervene in the discussion, because I believe that other opportunities will present themselves when we are discussing the Estimates, and also because of the fact that I believe that we have occupied sufficient time already in discussing this motion.  I was, however, provoked into becoming vocal by the rather disturbing speech of Deputy Tierney.  Deputy Tierney has apparently cultivated a habit in this House of delivering himself of very disturbing speeches.  On the one hand, he proclaims his wonderful solicitude for bringing about normality in this country, but at the same time he takes every opportunity, quite unintentionally perhaps, of making disturbing speeches, as disturbing as any made by the most bellicose member of Fianna Fáil.  We have had an exhibition of it to-night. Deputy Tierney got us back&mdash;not so far back, I admit, as Clontarf or Brian Boru&mdash;to 1916, 1922 and 1923, and exhorted us at the end of his speech to forget all about 1916, 1922 and 1923.  Surely we have left the nursery behind us, and we might just as well leave behind us also the period of 1916 and 1922&mdash;at any rate the Civil War period.  There is a rather restless author behind my back, and he will, I am sure, have an opportunity later on of making a speech which, I trust, will be as well put together as some of the recent <Col N="556" /> literature, the authorship of which I very much doubt.  At any rate, I would like to know how Deputy Tierney justifies the blood-curdling picture which he envisaged for us a few moments ago, in which he told us that the Ministers who would take office would carry their lives in their hands.  I say that nobody in this House or outside it, believes a word of that.</P>

One cannot reconcile a period of prosperity with a period of civil war, or with a period in which Ministers have to go about the country with their lives in their hands and revolvers in their pockets.</P>

We all regret that very much, and nobody has condemned it as much as I have. I will condemn conduct such as that as long as I live, and I am not afraid to do it either in public or in private. We had these disturbing speeches coming from both sides of the House. So long as you have this kind of recrimination, a ripping up of old sores of this description, so long will you have the necessity for some Party in this House which is dissociated altogether from these tragic events to take up the reins of office in this country and bring some kind of normality into the lives of the people.  I have grave doubt about the suggestion that Ministers' lives are in danger, and I very much regret the speech made by Deputy Tierney.  I gave him credit for more sense and a better sense of perspective than he has indicated in his speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="557" /> Earlier in the discussion Deputy Fahy spoke about a vendetta conducted against certain people in the country by the Civic Guards or policemen not in uniform, C.I.D. men and others.  I want to submit that there are also Civic Guards in the country, and members of the C.I.D. too, against whom a vendetta is conducted.  Let us approach this question quite calmly and fearlessly. Let us put ourselves in the position of any of those men who entered the service of the police force at a time when the country was in a bad state, and who, because of their activities in maintaining law and order, have incurred the hostility of certain persons.  Is there not a vendetta conducted against these men?  It is not because they are in uniform that a vendetta should be conducted against them.  As Sir Roger De Coverley said, a good deal can be said on both sides.</P>
    <P>I could advance many reasons why some of the Ministers should not be elected.  I could, for instance, speak about the Department administered by Deputy Mulcahy and show, notwithstanding his proclamations and possibly the proclamations of the President also, that a great deal remains to be done in the way of housing. I could take my own constituency in the City of Cork where no houses have been built for the poor man, none at all within the limit of the means of the ordinary working class man in the city.  A certain number of houses have been erected and some are in course of erection, some on the purchase system and others rented at a rent that the ordinary working man cannot afford to pay.  That is the case, and no sophistry of the Minister for Local Government or the President can get over that fact.  I will have something to say at a later stage in reference to other Departments.  I certainly could not let the statement made by Deputy Tierney in the Dáil pass unchallenged.  When Deputy Tierney speaks about cross-road speeches made by the Deputies sitting opposite, he should not forget that he was a sinner himself in that direction.

      <P>Professor Tierney stated, dealing with the question of unemployment that it was not a question of unemployment.  The trouble was&mdash;I do not like to use the word, but I suppose this is the product of our latest culture in the University&mdash;the &ldquo;lousers,&rdquo; meaning the unemployed, would not work. That is an emanation of the professorial mind.  I leave it to Deputy Dr. Hennessy to say whether that is the thing the University stands for or whether that is the kind of product that it will turn out in the future.  We have had some evidence already of what it turned out in the past, but I do hope that it will not turn out any professors with that particular mentality in future.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Anthony has stated, we shall have an opportunity of discussing the various Departments when the Estimates come before us.  I would not have intervened in this debate were it not for certain remarks which were made by Deputy Davin.  I am, I think, the senior member of the House, who has been working on the Public Accounts Committee.  Deputy Davin presided for one year with great success and with a great sense of fairness over <Col N="559" /> the deliberations of that Committee, but I regret to say that in the course of the debate Deputy Davin referred to a report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General which has not yet been submitted to the Public Accounts Committee, as for as I understand. I understand that he referred to the report for the year ending 31st March, 1929, which has not yet been submitted to the Public Accounts Committee.  I, as one member of the House who served on that Committee, would like to object to that, and to say that it is not right that such reports should be discussed in the House before they are fully investigated by the Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shaw</NameTxt>
      <P>I have much pleasure in supporting the re-election of the Ministers nominated by the President. I should like to take this opportunity of suggesting that the Government got a complete vote of confidence in this House yesterday, and that, in view of the unique opportunity provided by the fact that we have the lowest bank rate for the past seven years, they ought now to consider the advisability of tackling on a more extensive scale housing and other reproductive schemes.  I know they were severely handicapped during the past year owing to the fact that we had a 7½ per cent. bank rate, and I think the Minister for Finance is deserving of the highest possible congratulation for having refrained during that period from floating a loan.  We have now a 3½ per cent. bank rate in England, with the prospect of an immediate reduction to 3 per cent., and probably before next June a 2½ per cent. rate.  I, therefore, say that this is the acceptable time, owing to the fact that we are able to procure money at half the previous rate, which will allow houses to be built so that they can be let at an economic rent.  I certainly think that if the House devoted more time to matters of that kind, rather than to the balderdash we have been listening to for hours and hours during the past month, they would be better occupied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say that if the Fianna Fáil Party think that their slanderous and venomous attacks on the Civic Guards are improving their position in the country they are under a very wrong impression. The Guards enjoy the confidence of the vast majority of the people and of all decent people.  I have stated here before, and I repeat, that the Civic Guards are and always will be a living tribute to the memory of the late Minister for Justice, who was responsible for their establishment. The venomous attacks made on the <Col N="561" /> Civic Guards come very badly from any Deputies.  The Minister for Justice has a very difficult job in maintaining law and order, and it is an extraordinary thing to hear Deputies championing a person who was caught walking through Dublin with a live land mine and calling that person a patriot.  I am not surprised at the bad humour that the Fianna Fáil Party are in to-day because they were made such a show of yesterday. Not alone was Deputy de Valera an &ldquo;also ran,&rdquo; but the fact that he was beaten by 39 votes shows what was thought of him by the people here who have an opportunity of seeing and hearing him. I am sure Deputy O'Kelly must have been astonished and disappointed at the huge majority that trooped into the lobby to vote against Deputy de Valera.  I should like to know what Deputy de Valera thought and what the people in America thought.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that a large percentage of the speeches this afternoon have dealt to a very great extent with personalities, with the result that the motion before the House has become somewhat obscured. The motion is &ldquo;That the Dáil assents to the nomination of the following Deputies as Ministers, to be members of the Executive Council, and in charge of the Departments named hereunder.&rdquo;  I observe that each of the outgoing Ministers has been re-nominated, which means, in effect, that the House is asked to dot the i's and cross the t's and acquiesce in everything that these Departments have done since the last election.  I <Col N="562" /> do not think there are any Deputies, irrespective of the Parties to which they belong, who would acquiesce in all that has been done by the various Departments.</P>
      <P>Let us take, for instance, the question which gave rise to the political crisis, that of old age pensions.  The House has been asked to endorse, on the one hand, the action of the Minister for Finance in refusing to give effect to a decision arrived at by a majority in this House.  A majority of Deputies came to the conclusion that better terms should be given to the old age pensioners.  The Minister for Finance, whose duty it should have been to introduce a money resolution to give effect to the will of the majority of Deputies, refused to do so.  Still, we are asked to re-elect that Minister and to acquiesce in that policy and agree to let old age pensioners go as far as he is concerned.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shaw referred to the question of housing.  I was very glad to hear him and other Deputies refer to this question, because the working classes cannot see eye to eye with the housing policy put forward by the Minister for Local Government. Under the 1925 Housing Act it was possible for a comparatively wealthy person in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, or elsewhere, who was able to put up £500 or £600, to obtain a free grant of £100 from the Government to help him to build a house.  In addition to that, he was able to obtain a further free grant up to £75 to assist him in the building of the house.  The result is that as far as the comparatively wealthy classes are concerned we find that quite a number of houses have been built.  It would be very interesting if we knew how many of these houses have motor garages attached to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us compare, on the other hand, the manner in which the Local Government Department, acting through the Minister, have treated the working classes.  The British Government during their régime in this country were responsible for doing one good thing, and that was for creating within the Twenty-Six Counties over 44,000 agricultural workers' cottages.  Those cottages <Col N="563" /> are let to labourers at a rent which their meagre purses can afford.  At the same time, although there are over 44,000 cottages in the Free State, there is, and has been for quite a long time, a necessity for the erection of more cottages all over the country.  I submit that while the Minister for Local Government is prepared to give a comparatively wealthy person, who has £500 or £600, a sum of £100 under the 1925 Act, it should be the policy of the Minister to give to boards of health for every agricultural worker's cottage they put up a free grant of £100 as well as a long-term loan. That is not being done.  Consequently, we on these benches think that the Local Government Department have not done their duty as far as the agricultural workers' cottages are concerned.</P>
    <P>Another Ministry that the House is asked to acquiesce in is that of Lands and Fisheries.  It has been pointed out on numerous occasions that we believe that that Ministry has not done its duty in endeavouring to develop the fisheries and to put the fishing industry on a firm and solid basis, and in endeavouring to try and improve the economic position of the fishermen.  We also believe that that same Ministry is not endeavouring to carry out the policy as enunciated in the White Paper, in connection with the Gaeltacht Commission in reference to rural industries.  Many times when I looked into what this Department has done, or was endeavouring to do, I came to the conclusion that apparently the policy of the Department was to retard in many cases rural industries instead of endeavouring to improve them.  These are a few reasons as to why we do not acquiesce in the policy carried out for some time past by the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Lands and Fisheries, and that could all be elaborated to a very great extent.  For these reasons that I have advanced and many other reasons that could be advanced I believe <Col N="564" /> it is the duty of Deputies not to acquiesce in the policy as carried out by these Departments whose Ministers we are called upon to re-elect to-night.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody regrets more than I do that unpleasantness has crept into this debate both to-day and yesterday.  If any Deputies in the House think that the Fianna Fáil Party had the intention, or the design, of introducing that unpleasantness they are making a mistake. It was our desire that this whole discussion should be carried on on a plane worthy of the subject.  Once it starts it is almost impossible to end it, and I think that those who took advantage of renewing the general campaign of slander against Deputy de Valera which has been going on in the Press of this country for the past eight years have only themselves to blame.  If they think that the effect of that campaign is to weaken Deputy de Valera in the position he holds on this side of the House and in the affection and esteem of his followers they are mistaken. Far from weaning away any support from him, they will only serve to enshrine him more firmly in our hearts.</P>
      <P>We heard a number of statements made about Deputy de Valera.  I want to refer to them on account of the fact that on repeated occasions references, like the reference by Deputy Rice to Deputy Little, and the reference by Deputy McGilligan to Deputy Moore, and by other Ministers to Deputy Aiken, that they were persons of mean intelligence, persons without experience, and all that kind of thing are, in my opinion, bad for this House.  If people opposite, who have the experience of Government, and who claim that they are the only party fit and willing and able to carry on that Government, would turn their attention to controlling the utterances of some of the most prominent members of their party, we would all find it so much more easy and pleasurable to sit here and listen to speeches made in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="565" /> The Minister for Defence, whose nomination is before us with other nominations this afternoon, said yesterday, in spite of the fact that Deputy Fahy, who is recognised as one of the most moderate members of this Party, and who said this evening that he did not take any part in the civil war, made a categorical denial of the interpretation that the Minister for Defence sought to put upon his statement when he said it was a palliative of murder, still the Minister for Defence persisted in that statement.  He then went on to say that Deputy de Valera was carrying on in America very dubious methods in connection with the raising of money for his paper.  I found fault with the President of the Executive Council before for dragging that question of a daily paper &mdash;a business enterprise which has no connection with the business of this House and could be more fitly discussed outside if it is to be discussed at all&mdash;and for referring to that matter.  I can only assume that the lead the President gave on that occasion was primarily responsible for his colleague's lapse in referring to Deputy de Valera's dubious methods.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence said that if Deputy de Valera did in this country what he was doing in America he would presumably be open to an action under the law of the land.  He made that statement, as other statements were made about Deputy de Valera, intending to injure him in his personal character and his honour, knowing that Deputy de Valera was not here to answer him and that no member of this Party, at such short notice, could get up the facts of the situation to controvert what the Minister had said.  If controversy like that is to be indulged in no member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party has any right to object and the Press has no right to object if the whole question of the Treaty and that sort of thing is going to be discussed ad infinitum.  So long as you have these personal attacks upon the character and reputation of members of a Party who have come in here I believe at any rate, and I frequently <Col N="566" /> said so, to do their best to co-operate in carrying out a policy for the general benefit of the country and the general advancement of its interests, so long as that kind of campaign is carried on, co-operation will become very difficult and almost impossible.</P>
    <P>It may be that one of the reasons that Ministers fall back upon that kind of argument is that they have no policy to put before the Dáil. The fact that the President, in proposing for renomination the members of his Cabinet to-day made no statement whatever with regard to his future policy would go to bear out my contention.  As far as I can see there is no legislation before this Dáil out of the large number of Bills that have been promised in connection with agriculture, town tenants, fisheries and various other questions, except the Greater Dublin Bill.  It is very significant that we have had no reference made in the whole course of the debate by any representative of the Government Party or by the President or by Ministers who now seek office as to the measures of legislation that they are going to put before the country.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Press was filled up with the usual argument about a bread and butter policy.  Deputy MacEntee has said, and I am prepared to endorse what he has said, that we are prepared to face the future in the same spirit I hope as other members of other Parties in this House.  But if on that question of bread and butter any futile discussion is going to be raised we are going to say in answer to that &ldquo;go down the country, ask the traders and shopkeepers and farmers and labourers, where is the bread and butter that they were promised at every election whenever a political crisis arose since 1922&rdquo; and they will tell you that they have not got it.</P>
    <P>[<i>An Ceann Comhairle resumed the Chair.</i>]</P>
    <P>It is very significant that we hear a great deal about bread and butter when the Government is in any crisis, but as soon as the crisis is over we hear nothing about it, but <Col N="567" /> only the campaign about the defeatist policy of Fianna Fáil and their anxiety to belittle the institutions in this country, and so on.  If there is anything that is belittling these institutions it is the campaign that is being carried on of vilification in this House and elsewhere. That ought to be got rid of if we want people to look up to this House, to pay attention and follow the argument that takes place in it, and to believe we are all as serious as we would have one another believe. Deputy Shaw says that the Fianna Fáil Party are in a very bad humour because they have been defeated. The Deputy is under a misapprehension. The Fianna Fáil Party are in much better humour than they have been at any time since they came into this House.  From Deputy Shaw, who was absent from the division on the Old Age Pensions Bill, it comes with singular inappropriateness that he should lecture us now as to what our feelings may be after yesterday's performance. The Deputy could not be found when the voting was to be recorded on the Old Age Pensions Bill. He was, by some miraculous dispensation of Providence, absent, but he was not absent yesterday.  He turned up to put President Cosgrave back into office and to give him a majority which would try to make the country believe that he is quite safe for a few years more.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shaw and the Irish Press are quite right to call attention to the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party to the institutions of this State.  As far as I am concerned, I have taken no part in the discussions in this House on either the Army or the Civic Guard.  I want to say that the speeches of Deputy Ruttledge and of Deputy Fahy&mdash;I do not know so much about other speeches that were made, because I did not hear them&mdash;referred to definite incidents that took place down the country.  The general demand of the Fianna Fáil Party in this matter is, I submit, a very moderate one.  The refusal to agree <Col N="568" /> to our request is doing far more harm to the Civic Guard force than the result of any inquiry, even if we admit that there are persons in that force as bad as the worst of those that have been described.  If the Minister for Justice really wants to reassure the country in this matter, I think he would be well advised to have an inquiry and to finish up the whole question.  Let us definitely get to the bottom of this matter.  Let us, on both sides of the House, have the feeling that the Civic Guard force is above suspicion.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Civic Guards are a body of men who are carrying out their duty well and are giving general satisfaction.  I agree with Deputy Shaw that they are popular in the country.  There are individuals, however, attached to the force, and I say, as I have said before, that these men have not a sense of responsibility. I have personal experience of that matter.  I am not going to quote instances, but I simply say that a case has been made and that no effort has been made to answer it. There is no use in coming along with the argument that we are trying to besmirch the whole Civic Guard or that we are antagonistic to them.  We are no such thing.  We have definite charges made.  We have the individuals who made them.  We have court cases and we have the support of public bodies throughout the country.  All we ask for is an impartial inquiry into these matters.  Now if there is a desire at all to have what is called constitutional government or to recognise that this Party represents the opinion of the people who sent us here, I submit that if the Minister for Justice is faithful to his responsibility and takes a serious view of his office, he is certainly bound, in common decency and fair play, to examine this whole question.</P>
    <P>We are told that the Executive is going to take up office with the assistance of the Independents.  We are told by the organ of the Independents that a decisive factor in the control of the government of the country is this Independent group. It is quite patent, and no denial of it has been made from the Government <Col N="569" /> Benches, that negotiations are going on between the Party opposite and the persons styled the Independent group by which, for the next two years, if the negotiations are successful, the Party in office will be under the thumb, the control and influence of what is called the Independent group.  The members of that group are quite right to try and get their pound of flesh.  They are quite right, as the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; says, to hold the country to ransom, to drive a hard bargain and to see that they get a full return for the debt that is due to them for the support they have given the Government during the past number of years.  But the country will be very anxious to know what is the quid pro quo in this case.</P>
    <P>What is it proposed the Cumann na nGaedheal Party shall give to the Independents in return for their renewed allegiance and for the promise of their further support?  We read that one of the things that the Independents will look for, and that it will be their duty to force upon the Government an acceptance of, will be the promotion of the special interests of that minority, and respecting the sentiments and traditions which are very dear to it.  Does that mean that the members of that Party who, on a celebrated occasion in this House found themselves in a minority of fifteen against the combined vote of the other Parties on the vital issue of the Irish language, are going to be in the position in this House where they can dictate a policy of retrogression in carrying the Irish language not alone through the schools, but through the offices of the public Departments, the public bodies and general institutions of the country into universal and general use until it becomes the spoken and common language of the people?  Does it mean that the national sentiments which Deputy Seán T. O'Kelly rightly stressed in his address yesterday, which the founders of this State and the signatories to the Treaty have held and declared it was their purpose and object to carry out, are going to be scrapped in order that the Cumann <Col N="570" /> na nGaedheal Party may secure the support of this minority?</P>
    <P>We are told that every man has his price, and the Independents may become cynical if they are not paid their price.  The one refreshing thing about all this discussion, the one thing that must rejoice the Independents and their supporters, is that while this campaign of slander and vilification has been going on in this House, and which is giving so much joy to the English Press, they are a calm, detached, uncynical and philosophical Party which can wait quietly until the time comes to strike, and then when it sees the occasion arise to drive a bargain, it will drive a bargain.  Let the Government Party put their cards upon the table and state whether they are going to stand by the national aspirations of the men who accepted the Treaty as a stepping-stone to freedom, as a foundation to work out the full national aspirations of this people, or are they going to go back as they have gone back on minor issues&mdash;for instance, on the City of Dublin Bill and on the Poor Relief Bill&mdash;at the behest and at the dictation of this minority?  Are they going to force the whole national position backward by giving in now to the dictation that the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; proposes to impose upon them?</P>

      <P>I did not intend to take part in this debate only that Deputy Derrig seems to attribute all sorts of sinister intentions to the Independents.  I think he said that negotiations were proceeding between the Government Party and the Independent group.  That is not correct.  As far as I know there are no negotiations proceeding between the Independents and the Government Party.  I think it would be impossible for the President to select an Executive which would be pleasing to everyone.  At the same time.  I am sure he has done his best to select the most suitable Deputies for the different positions.  There are one or two things I would like to criticise, if I may.  One affects the President.  Some time ago there was a Commission on the supposed <Col N="571" /> grievances of ex-Servicemen.  The Report of that Commission suggested that certain things might be done. The President, perhaps from lack of time, or otherwise, has not given the Report that consideration to which it was entitled.  There is one other matter&mdash;I am not sure what Minister is concerned with it&mdash;and that is the Report on the Control of Motor Traffic which was issued on 1st September, 1928.  Time and time again we have been promised legislation to deal with motor traffic, but it has been put off, and accidents have been multiplying in the meanwhile.  The Government have spent a great deal of time on other measures, such as the protection of wild birds, and I think they might also try and do something to protect human beings as well.</P>

      <P>The President, who the other day deliberately flouted the will of this House, now starts coming back into office with the old campaigners. Deputy Derrig has asked the price paid to the Independents. I do not think there is any occasion to put that question.  We had it demonstrated here to us on other few occasions who are the real rulers in this Dáil.  It was clearly demonstrated on one occasion by the Minister for Local Government when he introduced an amendment, spoke in favour of it for twenty minutes, but when the Independents said &ldquo;No&rdquo; he walked into the Lobby followed by the Cumann na nGaedheal Party and voted against his own amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was anxious last night to appeal to the President that in view of the condition of affairs in the TwentySix Counties he would, at least, put his cards on the table and tell us exactly what he is giving this Independent group.  Of course, we can realise from the manner in which he has carried on here in the last few years what price he is paying those gentlemen.  We have no doubts as to the position of the Farmers' Party.  They have remained absolutely dumb during the past two days.  Not a word has been heard <Col N="572" /> from them about de-rating or the present position of farmers.  They are quite willing to let the farmers carry on in hunger, starvation and misery so long as one of their number occupies a decent post at the price of the votes of the other five.  That is the position of affairs with regard to them, and they make no secret of it.  They came in here and voted against the vesting of holdings, the retention of land annuities, and against everything which would be of any benefit to the farming community.</P>
    <P>I think the price paid to the Independents is very clear, and if the President even to-night has the pluck to cast them aside and tell them openly here that no longer is he going to be not the head of the Government but the tail of the Freemason party in this country then we would be prepared to do something with him.  A few days ago a couple of them broke away.  They did not get their price, of course, but they have got it now.  I am not going to go back to 1922.  I do not consider that the late Minister for Local Government should be re-elected.  I think he is absolutely incapable of filling that position.  He has proved that he has no knowledge whatever of the present position of the ratepayers who have to foot the bill. His attitude here, and the replies he gives to questions here, is nothing but the attitude of a dictator throughout.  Some time ago I had occasion to raise some questions in this House on combined purchasing, and the Minister proved that he knew nothing about it, or that he did not wish to reply to the queries put.  I pointed out that under the Combined Purchasing Act the present Department is more corrupt than it was even under the worst rural district council in Ireland nine or ten years ago.  I repeat that statement to-day, and even more cause can be shown.</P>
    <P>I pointed out that where a local body ordered 2,000 yards of material from a contractor from whom they were compelled to order it under the combined purchasing scheme, a portion <Col N="573" /> of the material was sent up to the Trade Department to test.  Eight or nine months passed without a reply being received, and the material had to be taken into stock and used without knowledge as to whether it was up to sample or not. On another occasion, when the material was not up to sample, one of the officials of the Trade Department went down to the local body, saying: &ldquo;We know the material is shoddy and not up to sample, but take it all the same.&rdquo;  You have the position where a body of contractors can turn around and tender for material of a certain quality, and can then supply material which is not up to that standard, or anything near it, and it is accepted on the instruction of the Department to the local bodies.  On a former occasion I gave examples of the state of affairs that prevailed from 1927 to 1929.  There has been a new development since.  Some two months ago the South Cork Board of Public Assistance sent a sample to the Trade Department.  A short time afterwards they got a query down asking for the name of the contractor who supplied the material.  In other words: &ldquo;We want to know whether we have got palm-oil from this contractor or not, or whether the stuff is so bad that he should give a little more.&rdquo;  That is a position of affairs which I think can no longer be tolerated.  Was there any reason why the Department, or the Minister for Local Government, should look for the name of a specific contractor in regard to the sample which was sent up?  I gave instance after instance here in November last of the manner in which the Trade Department has been working.  Here is a statement which is a fair example of the rest:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This complaint of Messrs. Usher &amp; Co. is a legitimate one. Payment is held up because only a part delivery of the goods has been approved and taken into stock. One delivery each of Grey Drugget and Bengal Stripe still awaits decision under test.  One sample of these materials was sent on March 7th.  Another was asked for and sent on May 1st.  No decision <Col N="574" /> has yet been received from the Trade Department.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a sample of the manner in which the Minister's Department is conducted.  After seven or eight months no reply has been received from the Department, which is waiting quietly until the material is taken into stock and used.  In another case the storekeeper states: &ldquo;The handling of samples of clothing material for test continues to be hopelessly inefficient.  We are now awaiting reports on samples sent forward May 1st&mdash;two samples (second lot), June 5th&mdash;six samples,&rdquo; and no report received until July 10th.  As I said, there has been a new development. The Department now looks for the name of the contractor before they decide whether material is up to sample or not.  Could there be anything more ridiculous?  The Minister has shown on several occasions during the past two years that he has no idea whatsoever of the capacity of the ratepayers to pay. On one occasion when a doctor was appointed to a local hospital at a salary of £70 a year, the Minister insisted that the appointment should be made by the Appointments Commission and that the salary should be not £70 but £250.  I do not know how the Minister can justify that squandering of public funds while at the same time he cannot find any money for the old age pensioners. His old age pension department is being conducted much on the same lines as the C.I.D. force.  When an old age pensioner applies for a pension the forces are sent out immediately, enquiries are made to find out whether he earned 2/- a week from some farmer in the district during the past twelve months or two years.  If he did, that is followed up by a visit to the farmer to find out whether he got his board, whether he got an ounce of tobacco, if he had a little house, and to find out whether the hens were laying and how many eggs fourteen hens laid in four years.  There is a squandering on the one hand and false economy on the other, and that is an indication of the work of the Department during the past two <Col N="575" /> years.  Deputy Mulcahy has given himself over soul and body to the motor owners, who now absolutely dictate the roads policy of the Department. Farmers in the Co. Cork have roads over which they cannot drive a horse.  The Minister made a statement here a short time ago which I found myself compelled to contradict and in which further information proves there is no truth whatsoever.  He said that it was stated at a meeting of the Cork County Council that the farmers were enjoying a reduction of 50 per cent. in their travelling costs owing to the fine roads that they had in Cork.</P>
    <P>According to the Public Bodies Order I think an audit of accounts is supposed to be carried out every twelve months by the Minister's Department. I would like to know in how many public bodies this audit has been carried out during the past four years.  I know that in the case of the Cork County Council, which is a rather important body, there was an audit a short time ago covering two and a half years.  The last year's audit is due since last September.  Of course, the Minister knows that he will get through all right with the votes of the Independents.  Those business men who stand for looking after the business interests of the community will walk solemnly into the lobby and will vote for that kind of thing.  I do not know if any of these business men are contractors under this Department or not, but it is time that somebody was put at the head of the Department who would act in a straight manner and would put an end to the condition of affairs that is going on at present.  It is worse and more corrupt than the old rural district councils, and they, I believe, were bad enough for anything.</P>
    <P>Statements were made about the Minister for Justice here to-day.  I do not want to say anything more about him.  I think there has been quite enough said about him.  The Minister for Justice has proved an absolute travesty of justice; as a matter of fact, his appearance here as <Col N="576" /> Minister for Justice has been enough to shock this Assembly and anybody who sees this Assembly.  I do not like to say anything more about it, but I had hoped that the President would not have put that gentleman on the Front Bench again.  But unfortunately I see his name on the Order Paper to-day.  If the President would take one bit of advice from me it would be that he should move that gentleman from the Front Bench, or else close down the bar.  A question was raised on the adjournment three weeks ago, and when I saw that Minister there I left the room rather than be insulted by having him reply to it.  The President should take his Front Bench to the Dominican Fathers and have them given the pledge.</P>
    <P>We have also the Minister for External Affairs.  The manner in which public money is being squandered in that Department is a scandal under this travesty of freedom.  In order to show that we are free and independent, we spend £59,820 a year on that Department.  We have gentlemen circusing around foreign countries. I do not know what they are doing there, and I think the House does not either.  Before that Minister is re-elected, I think we should hear something from the President or from somebody responsible as to what these men are doing for the money.  They are being paid £59,000 odd out of the public purse by a Government which states definitely that it has no money to spend on the old age pensioners, whose Ministers are being re-elected to-night after turning down a deliberate vote of the Dáil.  They are going to climb back into office devoid of honour, devoid of all decency, for if they had either honour or decency they would do one of two things; they would either put the Bill that has passed its Second Reading into operation and find the money for it, or they would get out and let somebody else find it.  They are prepared to do neither.  They are getting back to-night devoid of honour and of decency, but some day they will go to the country and very short work <Col N="577" /> will be made of them.  I can promise them one thing, that the Freemason vote will not hold them in office always, that there are not enough Freemasons in this country to keep them in office.  We are having Ministers elected to-night who have declared definitely that they are going to do nothing what soever for the next twelve months in the way of de-rating agricultural land. The Minister for Finance stated here within the past three weeks that he will do nothing, that there will be no reduction whatsoever in rates this year.  He is going to do nothing towards finding finances for de-rating, and I hope that the farmer Deputies of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party will remember that.  I know that the other farmers there are not going to remember it.  They had their price and they got it, and it does not matter to them whether the farmers of the country are hungry or not, or what position they are in.  They do not care.  But I appeal to the farmer Deputies in the Cumann na nGaedheal ranks to see that the Minister for Finance is not returned to office in view of the statement that he has made about de-rating.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy who comes from a rural constituency knows that the farmers in that constituency cannot carry on in the present condition of affairs.  They know very well that there is a limit to it just as well as I do.  Still they are going to trot around here and remain dumb in the House while this debate is going on, and trot round like lambs after the Minister for Finance, who says he is not going to find one farthing for de-rating this year.  I do not know what position the people have got into.  Apparently they are prepared to put up with anything.  Can the representatives of rural constituencies trot around here after electing the Minister for Finance and say: &ldquo;We have put him back all right, although he told us he is going to do nothing for de-rating of land this year&rdquo;?  The Minister for Finance made a speech on 24th May last in which he pointed out that he would have to find finances for de-rating. <Col N="578" /> We are now approaching a new Budget in which we will have the statement that no money can be found for de-rating.  That is the gentleman who can afford to throw £3,000 to the motor races, but who can find no money to finance the farmers so as to put them in, at least, the same position as those with whom they have to compete in the markets.  I suppose that position will have to be put up with until these gentlemen are before their constituents who, I hope, will deal property with them.  I hope there is enough public spirit left in the country to deal with them.  At one time I hoped there was enough public spirit left in those on the benches opposite to deal with them.  Apparently there is not; apparently the benches opposite have been whipped to heel, but no matter what smoke screen may be thrown by those on the opposite benches, about 1922, about 1914, or even 1014, when they come back to bedrock they must examine the present economic position of this country.</P>
    <P>We heard a great deal from Deputy Tierney to-night about the great work that the Government has done.  When the Deputy was asked to point out that work he could not point to a single item.  The Minister for Finance made one allusion to that in his Budget speech last year when he stated that they had gone into debt to the extent of £20,000,000 since 1923.  That is £20,000,000 expended in keeping up this affair here and in keeping all the Departments, envoys-extraordinary and ambassadors abroad.  In order to keep keeping these gentlemen going he borrowed £20,000,000.  That is the position of affairs.  If that condition is to continue much longer it needs no financial expert to see what the result will be.  Not one single industry that the Minister can point to has been started since 1923.  Such industries as were there are broken up.  The £20,000,000 has not gone in starting industries, but has gone over to John Bull.  Every two years we have a new loan of £10,000,000 being borrowed, while we hand over five and a quarter millions of money <Col N="579" /> to John Bull.  That is the financial position of this country at present; that is the great work which Deputy Tierney says the Government has done.  I regret that by some means or other the Party opposite are not going to the country now.  Even if they are re-elected I hope their period of office will be very short, until we get them to the country and let it judge them.  I have no fear of what the result will be.  I do not think that anybody sitting on the Front Bench will be re-elected.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to delay this prolonged debate.  I do not think I would have intervened except for the statement made by Deputy Davin, that the Minister for Finance had acted in defiance of the Public Accounts Committee and the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  As a member of the Public Accounts Committee that is a statement I cannot listen to in silence.  There may have been at times little differences between the Comptroller and Auditor-General's Department and the Department of Finance, and perhaps at times little differences between the Public Accounts Committee and the Department of Finance, but so far as I know there has never been any defiant attitude on the part of the Minister for Finance with regard to the Comptroller and Auditor-General or the Public Accounts Committee. Deputy Davin was, of course, within his right in quoting what Deputy Esmonde said a few moments ago, that he should not have quoted the Public Accounts Report and the Appropriation Accounts for 1928-29.  The particular item that he raised of £216,000, and in which he says the Minister defiantly acted in opposition to the Public Accounts Committee and the Comptroller and Auditor-General, is an item providing for gratuities to resigned officers, and it arose mainly because the Ministry decided to put into practice the promises of economy that they had made on previous occasions, and because there was an abnormal reduction in the Army services of that year that <Col N="580" /> could not possibly, perhaps, have been foreseen when the Estimates were prepared.  This expenditure of £216,000 in allowances is met in the same account by savings in other departments consequent on the reduction in the Army forces that I mentioned.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to go into a discourse on the subject.  I am merely alluding to the matter because of the accusations that Deputy Davin thought fit to make against the Minister for Finance that he had acted in defiance of the expressed declaration of the Public Accounts Committee and the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  I do not know how Deputy Davin arrived at that conclusion.  I cannot find any paragraph in either the Public Accounts Report or in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General accusing the Minister of this attitude.  I shall not prolong the debate further. I thought it right as a member of the Public Accounts Committee that I should intervene.</P>
      <P>The administrative capacities of the Deputies nominated by the President are well known to this House, and I do not think that any Deputy will have any difficulty in making up his mind as to whether they should be entrusted for a further period to administer their different offices.</P>

      <P>There is a very beautiful Chinese proverb which I personally appreciate very much and which I would commend to the consideration of the House.  It is to walk slowly passing a lame man.  It is rather in that spirit than the spirit in which one would deal with a masculine organisation that I approach the consideration of the present Ministry.  The position rather seems to be that of a housekeeper who, having thrown out the withered <Col N="581" /> flowers of the vases, and having gone around the whole of her garden, comes back and sticks the withered flowers back into the vases again.  It is extraordinary to say that the President, having the opportunity to review the quality of his team, and having looked abroad amongst the something like 65 members whom he has on his benches, and the 15 who own him, that he has not been able to find any even good second-class material with which to replace these outworn and decayed goods.  I would have thought that, say, Deputy Daly would have leaped to his mind as a possible Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>Deputy Daly, for instance, in preparing a budget, would undoubtedly do justice to that trade which, in the words of his colleague, Deputy Sheehy, has put a necklace of glory around the world of Guinness's stout and Jameson's whiskey. He would undoubtedly have done justice to the poor child that he told us so pathetically of on another occasion. I do not see why the President, when looking around through his team, should have ignored talents so outstanding.  Why has the President ignored the future Lord Chancellor? What has Deputy J. J. Byrne done to deserve this, that in a team made up of Deputies Lynch, Fitzgerald-Kenney, O'Sullivan, Hogan, McGilligan, Mulcahy, Fitzgerald and Blythe that he is to be accused of being unfit to replace any of them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to Deputy Osmond Grattan Esmonde, if we were picking film stars of course there would be no question, but surely his wide knowledge and deep study of foreign affairs and the amazing eloquence he borrows from an intermediate progenitor should find some recognition, some place in this extraordinary collection of intellectual and Ministerial rubbish.  Let us have a look mentally along that Bench for a moment.  It is a lot better now when <Col N="582" /> it is empty but, envisage for a moment its disgraceful and discreditable fullness.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fionán Lynch, Exhibit No. I, Minister for Fisheries.  Is there any single member in this House who has any personal knowledge which would enable him to say that one single penny of the finances of the Ministry of Fisheries under the administration of Deputy Fionán Lynch has been effective to the conditions of livelihood of deep-sea fishermen on the Irish coast?  Somebody in the House ought to have that knowledge.  If something like forty or fifty thousand pounds have been spent by a seventeen hundred pounds a year man all these years on fisheries, somebody ought to be able to point to some place in Ireland in which some deep-sea fishing industry has prospered as a result of that expenditure. I personally do not know of any. One thing I will say for the credit of Deputy Fionán Lynch, Minister for Fisheries, is that if he does not know anything about his Department and does not do anything in his Department, at least he never pretends to do anything in his Department. All I have ever heard from him is that a scheme is in preparation. If our function is to find a half dozen really good schemes that are guaranteed never to hatch out under any conditions whatever, there would be something to be said for Deputy Fionán Lynch but there is nothing to be said for Deputy Fionán Lynch, for the Ministry of which he was a part or for the Government which appointed him or the Party which has robbed this country by allowing him, a dud, to preside over a dud department all this time. Nothing whatever to be said for Deputy Fionán Lynch as Minister for Fisheries, nothing to be said for the Government who appointed him, and nothing to be said for the Party which has exploited the country by allowing that Department which might in the possession of somebody with knowledge, industry and brains have delivered some goods to the people in return for the money which has been wasted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="583" /> Exhibit NO. 2&mdash;Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, the Minister for Justice.  Of the largest sins and iniquities of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney I do not propose to speak at any considerable length.  I am of opinion that he has been the deliberate inciter to crime for the benefit of his Party and the tool of his Department from the time he took office to the present day.  The fact that he is a heaven-sent Minister for Justice, judged by the function which he was required to perform and is still required to perform by the Ministry to which he belongs, is no reason whatever why this House should insult the country which sends us here by leaving him longer in that position.  The Minister for Justice has, as one of his functions, the supervision of the administration of the licensing laws.  I am not going to deny that actual knowledge of the condition, places and people at and by whom liquor is sold is outside the knowledge of the Minister for Justice, but if that was the only qualification that was required surely the man whom I have previously mentioned as a possible occupant of the position of foreign affairs, Deputy Osmond Grattan Esmonde, possesses those qualifications also, and possibly even in a higher degree.  I want you to conceive anything funnier than the Minister for Justice rebuking a drunken constable.  I want you to conceive anything more ludicrous, any pretence more shamefully dishonest than the attempt of the Minister for Justice to insist upon any decent administration of the licensing laws.  The Minister for Justice has the supervision of the administration of the licensing laws in the Leinster House bar.</P>

Is that a man fit to be Minister for Justice?  Is that a man who is entitled <Col N="585" /> to hold up the standard for the whole of those who are concerned with the administration of justice in this country?  Is the man whom the courts of this country have told that the people whom his officers have taken into custody illegally are entitled to destroy Government property deliberately and openly in order to call attention to the conduct of the Minister for Justice and his minions&mdash;is that the kind of man who should be Minister for Justice in this House?</P>
      <P>Exhibit No. 1, the Minister for Fisheries with a wasteful, extravagant, idle Department wasting the public money.  Exhibit No. 2, the Minister for Justice with a Department which he does not control, but a Department which, under his name, is deliberately inciting to violence, to crime and to illegality in this country those who ought to be the guardians of the law; the man who is deliberately using his Department for a Party purpose to savage, to bedevil into uproar and disorder the men who differ from him in politics in order that he may steal a little advantage of the pretended strong man.

I think he could be substituted either inefficiently or efficiently by practically any backbencher on the Cumann na nGaedheal side.  You would not notice if he were not there.  All I know of his record of an outstanding character is that he issued for the use of school-children a book in a language possibly he did not understand, which had to be withdrawn, which would not pass the censorship of the Minister for Justice.

    <P>The Minister for Local Government, the one unteachable man in the House, the man who borrowed from the great brains of the founder of the Cork Rotary Club a new and splendid conception of the dignity of local government in Ireland, described, <Col N="586" /> when introduced upon the more intimate and familiar stage of the City of Dublin by the great, strong man, Deputy J.J. Byrne, as the machinery for the setting up of a collection of marionettes.  That is his contribution to local government. And with a year of experience of its utter futility and sterility that unteachable man has the effroutery to offer it in its Dublin version to this House What would this House do on a free vote with the Minister for Local Government and his Bill? What would his own Cabinet do with the Minister for Local Government and his Dublin Bill on a free vote? A pinch-beck, painted, cardboard Massolini, incapable of learning through any experience but the experience which is coming to him and his colleagues soon of being thrown into outer darkness with the thought how little of importance he is when he fails to have behind him the fifteen Deputies with which Cumann na nGaedheal is linked in an alliance of contempt.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that in dealing with that fifteen we are dealing with strong men keeping their own castle.  You are dealing with two organisations which are mutually, openly and publicly in contempt of one another, but which have to hang together in their sin lest they hang separately.  The fifteen are in the position of men all dressed up and nowhere else to go to, eating cold mutton and mashed potatoes in ball dress and all their diamonds.  Nobody wants them but those who have got them, and they do not want what they have got.  But these two bedfellows have to lie quietly together because the bed is not large enough to hold either of them if they are active.</P>

      <P>Yes, since I have been asked about it, on that occasion a solid national block of 110 faced 15 who were hostile to the national principles involved in that vote.  And that same fifteen alone, and everyone of that same fifteen form the majority by virtue of which President Cosgrave nominates his Ministry to-night.  Yes, we did not vote with Deputy Blythe on that occasion, and we will vote with him again, and they know that on every occasion on which those fifteen dare to stand up and yowl they can count upon fifty-six or fifty-seven, or whatever may be our total strength here, to say to that fifteen that while on the road to national advancement we would rather they would go with us, at the same time we, with them, through them or over them, will go forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now come to Exhibit No. 5, this bold, unbiddable child, this playboy of the western world, this man who&mdash; and within the period in which he has acted as Minister, we are entitled to review his conduct&mdash;is, by a court and a jury of his own fellow-countrymen, certified to be a slanderer.  He is certified by a jury to be a slanderer, this Minister using the authority and the prestige of his office to slander an ordinary individual, and because he is that type of man he is properly in position in a Ministry in which he is Exhibit No. 5.  He would be a disgrace to any Ministry which would not be a disgrace to any portion of this country. A good, loyal Cabinet comrade; a really nice person to sit with on the benches; a man who publicly exhibited <Col N="588" /> in this House the Minister for Defence as a fraud; a man who sat here and heard the Minister for Defence describe as an army the thing for which this country is paying nearly two millions a year, and, having heard him describe it in detail, got up and said that it was all damn nonsense, that it was not an army, it was no damn good as an army, that it could not survive a minute as an army, and that it was nothing but an armed adjunct of the C.I.D.</P>
    <P>Exhibit No. 5 is put in the same Cabinet with Exhibit No. 7, Deputy Desmond Fitzgerald, the Minister for Defence.  Here you have upon those benches two men paid out of public funds, one of them administering a Department which costs this country, roughly speaking, six times the amount of the old age pension money that the Government could not find, and you have a fellow colleague, another Minister sitting by him, telling him he does not even know the name or function of the thing which his Department administers.  Whether they exeunt collectively or whether they exist individually, the sooner the duds go the better.  At least until they do go they ought to agree not to accuse each other in front of this House either of deliberate lying or of privative ignorance of the things which they ought to know. Either one or the other of these men should go out.  Deputy Hogan or Deputy Desmond Fitzgerald should not be in the same Cabinet.  I think neither of them should be in any Cabinet.  One thing is perfectly certain, and that is that the two of them ought not to be in the same Cabinet.</P>
    <P>Now, let us come back again to Exhibit No. 5, this strident Mussolini, the man whom I once did believe was the greatest, if not the only asset, of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, the man whom to-day I believe to be the greatest asset of the Opposition.  This good young man, in a moment of enthusiasm, went down to Cork and told us that the purpose of his Department was to increase the price of agricultural produce.  After he had watched the <Col N="589" /> effect of some of his own activities on the price of agricultural produce he went down to Cork again and said that he could not, and nothing could, increase the price of agricultural produce; that the only way to do it was to decrease the cost of production.  He is not, like Deputy Mulcahy, unteachable.  He learns at a very great cost, at a great expense of reputation and at expense to the population bearing the cost in this country; but he does learn.  He is in the same Ministry as Deputy Ernest Blythe, who provides out of the funds of this country in the relief of agricultural rates and in other directions something like two millions of money.  Deputy Ernest Blythe knows, unless he is as privatively ignorant as Deputy Fitzgerald or Deputy Hogan, what is going on in the Department of Deputy Hogan from the point of view of using all the money which he gives him.  He sees large schemes of improvement of one kind or another. He provides the money for them.</P>
    <P>What does Deputy Blythe say about Deputy Hogan?  After Deputy Hogan has spent all the money that Deputy Blythe's torturers have by various means extracted from the community, Deputy Blythe goes up to Monaghan and says that the land can support no more people.  After all the money has been spent by Deputy Hogan, in spite of all the activities of the whole Department of Agriculture and the greatest Minister for Agriculture in the universe, notwithstanding all the activities of this bold, unbiddable child, the land is bankrupt from the point of view of its primal function.  It can support no more people.  Was there ever a more blasting indictment offered by one Minister to another than that single sentence?  What are you spending all the money on, the money that is being spent by the Minister for Agriculture, if, as the result of the whole of it.  Deputy Blythe knows what he is talking about when he says that the land under the administration of Deputy Patrick Hogan, of Clare.  I mean Galway&mdash;it would be a very different <Col N="590" /> proposition under the administration of Deputy Patrick Hogan, of Clare&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If Deputy Ernest Blythe is telling the truth, then the sooner Deputy Hogan, of Galway, goes to join Deputy Finian Lynch, Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Mulcahy the better.</P>
      <P>Exhibit No. 7, Deputy McGilligan. Deputy McGilligan is one of the best debaters whom it has been my privilege to meet.  Deputy McGilligan has what I call a leader writer's brain.  You have to know a good deal about the subject with which Deputy McGilligan is dealing in order to know that Deputy McGilligan does not know anything; in other words, that he has got up his case well from the books.  What are the actual achievements of Deputy McGilligan?  Mind, Deputy McGilligan is probably the only man in this bunch of whom one could say that he has something approaching a good second-class brain.  He is the best of the bunch from that point of view.  What are the actual accomplishments of Deputy McGilligan as Minister for Industry and Commerce? Just think.  You have had seven or eight years' experience. What are the actual accomplishments of Deputy McGilligan?</P>

      <P>Right.  We will come to the Shannon scheme.  Let us start with sugar beet.  What does this House think of the business ability of anyone who was connected with the finances of the sugar beet scheme? Is there any man in this House who would like to take responsibility for putting over a spoof of that kind on the country again?  Is there any single <Col N="591" /> man in this House who would like to make that bargain and say that he was responsible?  Mind, Deputy McGilligan, no doubt, was working through his Department.  He was dealing with his officials.  He was working on information, but, after all, Minister for Industry and Commerce even in a Cumann na nGaedheal Government is not expected to be purely a figure-head. He ought to be able to connote and co-ordinate.  He ought to be some judge of men.  He ought to be able to understand a financial proposition. This is the actual financial proposition of sugar beet.  You can buy sugar to-day at either 8/3 or 8/6 f.o.b. at Hamburg.  Under our scheme the sugar beet factory in Carlow has an actual preference of over 30/- on an article which can be bought f.o.b. at Hamburg under 9/-.</P>

      <P>Certainly not.  That is the proposition.  Yet the Carlow sugar beet scheme cannot complete in the city of Cork with sugar which has that handicap.  They have not been selling any sugar in Cork.  What are we to think of the business organisation, the business brain of the best man, from the point of view of brains in Cumann na nGaedheal, if, in order to do that, he has rendered this country liable to a sum of two or three millions to enable it to be unable with a preference of about 30/- to sell sugar in Cork which can be bought f.o.b. at Hamburg under 9/-? That is probably his greatest achievement. For anyone responsible for <Col N="592" /> that criminal waste of something approaching three millions of money in a country that cannot afford to find £300,000 for old age pensions, a bath in boiling oil would be just about the proper appreciation of an achievement of that kind in a country as poor as this is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The future Minister for Finance, Deputy Daly, has reminded me of the Shannon scheme.  The Shannon scheme has been a hobby of mine for the last thirty years.  It has been one of the things which I have tried to believe in during all that period. It is a thing about which I actually read a paper before an engineering society more than a quarter of a century ago.  I am not at all prejudiced against the Shannon scheme. If I could believe in the Shannon scheme, as a sound financial enterprise in this country, in its present condition, there is no man here who would be more anxious to do so.  I want this House to compare the Shannon scheme as it was offered to this House with the Shannon scheme as it is in reality.  The Shannon scheme was founded on the idea that there should be a network covering the whole of the Free State fed from the Shannon and distributing to every town of 500 inhabitants and over.  It was to supply in bulk.  It was to be self-supporting. It was to cost £5,200,000.  It has already cost £6,000,000 visibly.  Do not mind that; that is a perfectly reasonable variation in the estimate. I would not have been surprised, nor would I have blamed the Minister, if there had been considerably more divergence between the actual estimate and the actual cost, but it also contained, when we got it in its naked beauty in the 1927 Act, the fact that it was going to take over from the citizens of Dublin, without paying them anything, a property that was worth 1½ millions of money. That is not recorded in the £5,200,000 or the £6,000,000.  I am a little bit doubtful about the figure, but it took an average of about £15,000 of income tax which up to the present day has been paid by the City of Dublin to the Minister for Finance and which will have to be found from <Col N="593" /> some other source.  There is a capital charge there of £300,000.</P>
    <P>Unless the Act is changed&mdash;and the Act would not be changed unless this subterfuge had been shown up&mdash;it contains a provision by which the citizens of Dublin this year are out of pocket and would be, in perpetuity, milked of £30,000 a year in rates&mdash;£600,000 of capital not included in the £6,000,000.  It contains the fact that the whole of that property spread over the whole of Ireland and representing probably £80,000 in rates is hidden in that scheme and represents, deducting the £600,000 for the Dublin rates, another £1,200,000.  It contains the fact that this organisation is specifically prohibited from paying income tax, and the Electricity Supply Board can go to the courts and can claim back from the Minister for Finance the whole of the income tax paid by the holder of that portion of National Loan&mdash;the £6,000,000, and the £2,800,000 in addition which is used on the distribution network. There is another £45,000, or another £900,000 added to the £6,000,000, £2,800,000, £300,000, £600,000, £1,200,000, and the £900,000 hidden in the 1927 Act.</P>
    <P>For the Shannon scheme to be a sound scheme financially it has got to pay interest and sinking fund not merely on its visible expenditure but upon its hidden expenditure also.  It has not been suggested up to the present that it will do that.  That is not really the gravamen of the charge. Mind, I am speaking as one entirely prejudiced in favour of the Shannon scheme development, as one who would hope to see not merely the Shannon scheme development but the development of the Liffey and other subsidiary water powers in Ireland, and who would be prepared to make considerable financial sacrifices over and above what was actually immediately profitable to have that done. I challenge any engineer to say that, given as common ground an electrical network covering the whole of the Free State, you cannot put down a steam station at the nodal points and feed the whole of <Col N="594" /> that network cheaper than it will be fed from the Shannon.</P>
    <P>Of course, we have the philosophy of Deputy McGilligan in what he once said in relation to his Patents Department.  We pointed out the fact that it was hopelessly extravagant from the point of view of the State, that in order to get a patent here in Ireland you had to pay a cost which would be equal to the cost of getting that patent in England, in America and in the Free State, and that of the total charge which was put upon the patentee, the amount which the State received was probably not ten per cent.  When that case was put to Deputy McGilligan here was his answer: &ldquo;The total expenses of the Department are X.  The total revenue of the Department is X plus Y.  That is perfectly satisfactory.&rdquo; In other words, &ldquo;So long as I can get more revenue than cost, the cost does not matter a damn to me.&rdquo; The Shannon scheme could undoubtedly have been substituted by a steam-station system, feeding into that common network, providing electricity for the Free State cheaper than the Shannon could do it.  That may be an achievement for Deputy McGilligan.</P>
    <P>I want now to put, in a few words, the other side which he is entitled to put up against that charge.  He is entitled to put up against that total capital cost the whole of the money over and above unemployment allowance to the same people who are paid for unskilled labour.  He is entitled to put up against it whatever political advantages, and I am afraid they are not very great, are involved in the fact that he will not have to import the quantity of coal which would be used by a steam station. Certainly, if Deputy McGilligan's record is to rest upon the Shannon scheme and the sugar beet scheme alone, though he may be the best case that they can put forward for that Front Bench, it is not the case to justify that Front Bench.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence has already been adequately dealt with by Deputy Hogan, and I shall leave him there.  According to the Minister <Col N="595" /> for Agriculture, the Minister for Defence is a fraud.  He is deliberately misleading this House.  He is coming here and telling them that he is spending one and a half millions or so of their money on an army, and he has not got an army. If there is any reason for the continuance of Deputy Desmond Fitzgerald in the position of Minister for Defence, they can justify anything.</P>
    <P>I now come to the last, Deputy Blythe.  I have suggested a substitute for Deputy Blythe.  In so doing I certainly was suggesting that something active should be done in his Department by his successor. It is not necessary, if the Department is to continue to carry on as it has been carried on, to substitute anything masculine.  Any office boy could obey the orders of his Department with the same amount of inspiration and efficiency with which Deputy Blythe obeys the orders of his permanent officials.  It is a Department without the shadow of imagination, without the shadow of inspiration, with no grasp of the big primal problems which have to be faced in relation to this country if it is to be rebuilt from the foundations up, as it has to be.  Deputy Blythe, with the exception probably of the Minister for Justice, has probably less control of and less knowledge of what goes on in or less capacity to deal with his Department than any Minister on that bench of duds.</P>
    <P>I simply now deliberately recall the list: Deputy Finian Lynch, Minister for Fisheries.  Is there any man who would stand for him individually, any man who would employ him with his own money to carry on business of that kind?  The Minister for In justice! Our 001 Deputy O'Sullivan.  The unteachable Deputy Mulcahy.  That bold, unbiddable child, Deputy Hogan.  Our leader-writer, Deputy McGilligan. Deputy Desmond Fitzgerald, whose Army, according to the greatest Minister for Agriculture in the universe, is not worth a damn.  And Deputy Blythe, who could be substituted by any person of ordinary elementary <Col N="596" /> education in performing the actual functions which he does perform.  At least it is coherent; at least it is consistent.  They are on a level.  They are on a level with the President, who draws his power from the fifteen whom he regards with contempt and who regard him with contempt.  They are worthy of the President who is upheld by the Farmers' Party, whose leader he has described as bankrupt of intelligence, bankrupt of initiative; bankrupt of every thing of use and value in Ireland.  It is worthy of the President under whose administration national principle in this country fell to the lowest level which it has touched in human memory, when they exploited the blood of a murdered comrade and tried to coin it into votes in a stunt election on the Public Safety Act.  It is worthy of the President who, meeting the country in that stunt, had his power broken in his hand and was sent back here to wait for the day of his final dismissal, without the courage to destroy the child he had engendered which, under the name of the Public Safety Act, will be a lasting shame and disgrace to this House and to the country over which this House is supposed to be the sovereign Assembly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the motion standing in the name of the President.  There has been a lot of time wasted on this motion.  One would imagine that the people sent Deputies here to make all these bitter speeches, speeches which are not constructive or helpful to the country.  We have listened to speeches with nothing in them but hostility to the President and the Executive Council.  A great man, who has now passed away, said on the Treaty debate: &ldquo;You on the anti-Treaty side may take all the glory and we will take all the blame, but let us save Ireland.&rdquo;  I should think that that should be the motive in the mind of every Deputy sent here to do the best he can for his country and for the people.  It is for that purpose the people sent us here and it is a pity to see the <Col N="597" /> valuable time of the House wasted on speeches such as we have heard from Deputy Flinn and other Deputies. Is it not about time that we set to work and took some pride in our country and in our fellow-countrymen? Surely the hundred per cent. patriots and the hundred per cent. brainy men who sit on the Opposition side of the House might examine their consciences and say, &ldquo;This is our country equally as well as it is theirs, and we have been sent here by the Irish people to do the work of the country.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whilst I have been a Deputy, I have not yet heard a word of praise here for any Bill introduced by the Government.  In the early days, when the first housing scheme was introduced, I was the Chairman of the Pembroke Council.  The Government proposed a scheme that for every pound raised by any local body a free grant of two pounds would be given.  The anti-Treaty element in that Council turned that down.  They would give no help to the Treaty Party.  I think the same hostility prevails all round.  No cooperation or help is given from the anti-Treaty side of the House to the President and the Executive Council, no matter how good the Bill may be that is introduced.  There is nothing but bitterness and going back on the past.  Let us look forward.  There are bright days ahead for the country. I have heard Deputies speak with hostility of their fellow-countrymen. It is only in this House you hear expression given to these wicked ideas.  Did Deputies opposite meet with some fellow-countrymen in America or Australia they would be very friendly with them; they would agree to differ.  Why not agree to differ here in this House, but at the same time to keep the welfare of the country in our minds and the welfare of the people who sent us here?  I thought that early in the evening there would be a division on this motion instead of raising many questions on it.  There will be plenty of time to discuss all the questions which we have raised to-night when they can be gone into in their proper <Col N="598" /> place.  We should go on with the nation's work and we should have a bit of patience with each other and not be suspecting each other of treachery all the time.</P>
    <P>I say to the Fianna Fáil Deputies and also to Labour Deputies, that there are a great many good things that can be said for the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, but it is a very strange thing that if any Deputy gets up to say a good word for the Government he is immediately pounced upon and attacked.  Deputy Tierney said a few kind words, and truthful words, about the Government Party. Immediately he sat down Deputy Anthony jumped up and attacked him about some frivolous thing he said in an election speech at a street corner.  I think that is a very poor spirit to show.  We should get away from that and let this party feeling die down to some sensible proportion. Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies have a perfect right to defend the Government Party.  I have great faith in the members of the Front Bench in this House.  I know them for a number of years.  I know they love their country, and I know that there is nothing in their minds but the uplifting of the country.</P>

      <P>I believe it is in accordance with Parliamentary procedure that Deputies proposed for Ministerial rank are not supposed to speak in their own defence.  That, to my mind, explains the valiant attempt of Deputy Hugo Flinn to assail them in his unmeasured language. Deputy Hugo Flinn is an orator, and he prides himself on the fact.  He seems to me to have studied his oratory under a very great orator, apart from his other faults, and that was Horatio Bottomley. Horatio Bottomley was a great orator; he was fluent, he was eloquent, and he was impudent&mdash; traits which Deputy Hugo Flinn possesses in excelsis.  Deputy Hugo Flinn has found his spiritual home amongst the Fianna Fáil Party. <Col N="599" /> Well, I do not think so badly of the Fianna Fáil Party as to wish them luck of the day that Deputy Flinn joined them.</P>
      <P>It is well known to mental specialists that people of third-rate mentality have an obsession that they cannot get over, in season and out of season, of belittling in every way men of first rate mentality, and that is also a little trouble from which Deputy Hugo Flinn suffers.</P>

Anything that has been said has not lessened the proposed Ministers in the estimation of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party. We know some of the members of the Opposition well, and there are men in the Opposition of whom I would not like to say anything hard, and there are men that would never disgrace their country by making <Col N="600" /> what Mr. Augustine Birrell once described as carrion crow speeches. We have had the greatest example of a carrion crow speech to-night, and that was delivered irrespective of the harm, financial or otherwise, that it might do to the country. That was Deputy Hugo Flinn's contribution to this debate, and I must say that I sympathise with the Party to which he belongs.</P>

I only want to make a few remarks about things that have arisen in the debate. I noticed that when Deputy Tierney was speaking he made an appeal to the members of this Party to give up recriminations, personal attacks and so on, to cut them out altogether.  I wish that advice would be taken. On that I would like to say this.  I was speaking to some people from Greystones after the 1927 election and they said that the most abusive and the most scurrilous speaker they <Col N="601" /> had ever heard in the town was Deputy Tierney, with one exception, and that was Deputy Doctor Hennessy.</P>

Deputy Flinn asked if there was a member in the House who could point to one single good act which that Minister had done while in office, and the House remained silent.  I believe the House would still remain silent if the question was again put.  I do not know whether the President will also remain silent when replying to this debate.  The Minister for Fisheries sleeps peacefully while the French and British trawlers raid the fish along our shores, leaving our own fishermen to go without any fish. The only thing that wakes the Minister up is when he is reminded by some official in his Department that there are annuities due by those fishermen who have to go without fish.  Along the coast with which I am most familiar, the only thing the fishermen there ever hear from the Minister for Fisheries is that their annuities are due and that they had better pay up.  When they make representations to the Department of Fisheries about the raids carried out along the coast by French and British trawlers they get no satisfaction. It would appear that the only class of fishermen who get satisfaction from that Department are the rod men, especially those who fish along the river Barrow.  I do not know whether the same rule applies in the case of other rivers or not, but so far as the river Barrow is concerned, for two months after the ordinary fishermen, who earn their bread from fishing, are forbidden to fish in the Barrow the rod men are allowed to fish there for salmon.  That bye-law is typical of <Col N="602" /> the rules carried out by the Department of Fisheries.  If Deputy Lynch is returned to that Department he will still, I suppose, carry out the old policy.</P>
      <P>Since speaking here on a former occasion a little book has been published dealing with the agricultural output of Saorstát Eireann.  Some very interesting facts emerge from that publication.  Again and again we have pointed out here that Denmark, which is half the size of Ireland, is able to export £24,000,000 worth of butter per annum, while the Free State is only able to export £4,000,000 worth.  When we have pointed to that we have been met with the reply that that is due to the fact that the Danish people use margarine and export their butter. To a certain extent that is true.  That is referred to in this little book.  We are told that the people of the Free State consume 30 gallons of milk per person per annum.  That applies to the City of Dublin.  Would any Deputy in this House who knows the north city constituency well, and is familiar with the conditions under which people live in Marlborough Street, Gloucester Street and other streets in that area, agree with this report, which says that every man, woman and child in these streets consumes thirty gallons of milk per annum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is true that they are not getting that quantity of milk and eating 38 lbs. of butter per annum, could you conceive it possible, if they are only getting a few pounds of butter each, that the big percentage of the population of this <Col N="603" /> country are consuming twice that quantity, namely, 76 lbs. of butter each.  I think that even a person with an abnormal appetite would find it hard to consume that amount.  It has been pointed out to us that the reason why Denmark is able to carry on an export trade in butter to the extent of £24,000,000 a year, while the Free State can only export £4,000,000 worth of butter, is because the Danish people are content to eat margarine themselves&mdash;that is to say, that the Danish people are content to put up with an inferior article, because we all regard margarine as inferior to butter.  This book also tells us that the output of agricultural produce per worker&mdash; that is including farmers and labourers&mdash;is £96 per annum in the Free State, whereas in Denmark the corresponding figure is £196 per annum.  Why, therefore, do the farmers or labourers, as the case may be, in Denmark take margarine in preference to butter?  It cannot be through any spirit of want or saving, as has been suggested here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested here again and again that one of the reasons why we are not able to carry on the same trade in butter as Denmark is because our people have a high standard of living, but when we look into these figures what do we find?  That the average income of agricultural workers in this country&mdash;taking farmers and labourers together&mdash;is 37/- per week, whereas the average income of the corresponding class in the rural districts in Denmark is £3 15s. per week.  The report goes on to say that the Danish practice of exporting the superior article and consuming the cheaper substitute at home is, therefore, akin to the Irish practice with regard to bacon.  The Danes, the report states, manufacture the bulk of the margarine which they consume, while the cheaper bacon consumed in Ireland is imported. That may have something to do with it.  The fact with regard to Denmark is that any article that they want is, as far as possible, produced at home.  The remedy that has been <Col N="604" /> suggested here by the Minister for Agriculture and speakers on the other side is, first of all, more production. But what incentive is there for more production at the present time, say, in the case of butter, the price of which has fallen to such an enormous extent over the last few months?  The drop in the price of butter as compared with this time last year amounts to between 40/- and 50/- per cwt.  If we take the total, which is given in this book, of butter as 1,491,000 cwts. per annum, the loss from falling prices amounts to £73,000 per week.  That is an accidental loss over which we have no control, as we cannot control the British market.</P>
    <P>The loss could be got over only by an increase in the milk yield of the cows of the country to the extent of 150 gallons per annum, so that even if the agricultural policy of the country succeeded in increasing the milk yield to the extent of 150 gallons per cow, that would have gone for nothing on account of the fall in prices for butter in the British market.  That is a proof of the foolishness of trying to develop a line in a market over which we have no control, while we allow foodstuff to come into our market which we can control fully if we wish.  The Minister for Agriculture said when speaking at Ballygar a few weeks ago &ldquo;I advised the farmers last Autumn to keep their corn to feed their cattle, and now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if they had taken my advice look at what prices they would be getting for their cattle.&rdquo;  The prices are good now, but the farmers he advised to do that cannot afford to keep their grain as they have to sell it to pay their annuities, or, perhaps, they have no storage for their grain, or no cattle to feed it to.  If they had to buy cattle, what about the people who sold the cattle last autumn when they got as low a price for cattle as was got before the War?  I know a man who kept his cattle and he fed them his own grain.  About three or four weeks ago they broke into a field next his own farm and the bailiffs came along and took them to <Col N="605" /> pay the other man's annuities.  They were sold in public auction in Dublin, and the money went to the Land Commission to pay the annuities of the other man.  There was some cash over and that also went to the other man.  The cattle of this man, Hayes, were taken under a legal quibble.  As I say, they had broken in for the first time to the other man's farm, Hayes alleges, and in that he is supported by local witnesses, and even by the Civic Guards; but it was known that a malicious informant from the district sent word to the Land Commission that these cattle had been habitually grazing on the farm upon which the annuities were due, and the Land Commission, therefore, took them for the payment of annuities for themselves.</P>
    <P>That is the case of one man who took Deputy Hogan's advice to keep his cattle over the winter.  Many other comparisons could be made between this country and other countries that have a higher agricultural output per head of the population. In this book, for instance, the output of this country is given as £96 per head; in England and Wales, £169, and in Denmark, £196. In Denmark, they have not, as we have, to send land annuities to England or anywhere else.  I notice that Deputy Gorey and others only laugh at the annuities going out of this country, but when the speakers on Deputy Gorey's side were in Sligo and Leitrim they began to take this question rather seriously and they&mdash; Deputy Gorey amongst them&mdash;suggested that now that there was a new Government in England something might be done about the question. But that was to the electorate of Sligo-Leitrim.  Neither has Denmark to send money across to England to pay pensions to ex-Danish police, or people of that sort.  They keep the money at home for their own industries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Minister does there, but I do suggest he would not be so foolish if there were farmers in Denmark who had derelict farms, and who owed money to the Land Commission, to the county councils and to the shops, and who do not know where they are going to get the next meal, as to tell them &ldquo;The way you will get on is by buying another cow and another sow.&rdquo;  We have suggested before, and we will keep on suggesting it until the people opposite see the error of their ways, that it would be much better to try and develop our own market here, and try and supply our own wants here, rather than export stuff to an uncertain market like the English market, which is at one time uncertain for cattle and at another for butter, and so on.  If we were to develop our own market and employ more people in the towns, by protecting our own industries, we would be building up a market to a certain extent.  For instance, on various occasions we have discussed here the question of a flour tariff.  For the year 1929 we paid for flour coming into the country £2,438,000.  That was 3,112,000 cwts. of flour.  At the price of wheat last year, as it was bought by this country, the wheat that would produce that flour would cost £2,280,000.  As well as getting the flour required, we would have got, as everybody knows, 30 per cent. of offals, and if these offals were to realise only £7 a ton, that would amount to £469,000.  The difference between what the wheat could be got for and what we paid for the flour is £158,000.  Therefore, the total gain to the country by importing wheat instead of flour would be £627,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may be told by some of the efficiency experts on the other side that the flour mills do not give much employment, or they may tell me <Col N="607" /> that we cannot have a tariff on flour until our mills are efficient&mdash;as the late Minister for Industry and Commerce said, well placed, well managed and well machined.  If we had brought in wheat instead of flour last year we would have had £627,000 for distribution in the way of wages, profits, dividends, or in some other way; it would at least have been another £627,000 free for circulation and free for the purchase of agricultural or other produce.</P>
    <P>Last year we had an item of £224,000 for bread and buns imported, principally from bakers in the North of Ireland.  Those who read the Report of the Tariff Commission and the other publications on the flour and wheat question will know that at the rate of 93 pairs to the sack of flour, and taking 70 per cent. as the yield of flour from wheat, the cost of the wheat to produce that bread would have been about £60,000.  We paid £224,000 for the finished articles of bread and buns which came in across the Border, but the materials to make them could have been imported in the form of wheat for about £60,000, and all the labour up to the time the bread and buns were produced could have been done in this country, so that we would have had, with that item alone, £160,000 free to spend in wages, dividends, and in other ways. The flour and the bread are only two items to show what a strong policy of protection could do in creating a home and a stable market for our own produce, not the sort of market that we have in England, where we get 180/- for butter one day, and a couple of months afterwards it is down to 124/-.  The farmer who has spent perhaps the last six or seven years in trying to improve his herd of cows and in trying to get into good strain will now find that if these prices are to last&mdash;and we hope they will not&mdash;he has got into a stock which will be no use to him, and he will have to turn to some other form of farming.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into all the various other items of imports of <Col N="608" /> articles which could be produced at home and that could be stopped from coming in.  There are millions of pounds going out for wearing apparel, for leather, and for boots and shoes.  All these things could be produced at home, giving a large, amount of employment here, and every single halfpenny that would be paid to the workers on the production of these articles would be available to buy the produce of our own market, which market could be regulated to the advantage of the producers at home and which would give the agricultural community at least a chance to know what line it could develop in the coming three or four years.  The present policy is not the policy of the Minister for Agriculture alone nor of the Minister for Industry and Commerce alone; it is the policy of the combined Executive Council, a policy of free trade and free competition As a matter of fact, the policy of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, as he expressed it here on the Vote on Account with regard to the flour mills, was that there would be no tariff until we had efficiency.  He then went on to say that the more British companies that came in to buy up the flour mills the quicker a tariff would come, which means that we cannot have efficiency until the British manufacturer comes in and buys the mills: then we will have efficiency and then we can have a tariff.</P>
    <P>A threat was made outside by Deputy Blythe, who has been proposed as Minister for Finance.  He told his audience that if Fianna Fáil succeeded in its policy of withholding the land annuities from Britain, Britain would strike back by putting a tax on cattle going into the British market.  If Britain is going to frighten this country from her rights every time that this country has a right to claim by the bogey of a tax on our exports to Britain, then the sooner we drop this sham of independence the better.  But how could Britain do it?  If Britain puts a tax on our cattle, would we not be entitled to put a tax on articles that come in here from Britain?  We are <Col N="609" /> purchasing more from Britain than Britain is purchasing from us, and if there is to be a war of tariffs between the two countries we will have the best of it.  There is no likelihood that Britain will try a tax on cattle or anything else, because, as I said, we are a larger customer for her produce than she is for ours; but if she does try it on, then let us retaliate.  If this policy of free trade between Britain and this country is to continue and if this status which we have got of being a fully-fledged member of the British Commonwealth of Nations is to continue, can the President say what advantage has been brought to this country by the Treaty?  If we are not to go ahead and try to be independent, both politically and economically, if we have no hope in front of us, can the President give any reason why we should remain as we are now, part of the British Commonwealth of Nations, having practically lost the desire, if not the power, to put tariffs on foreign articles coming into the country? If we are to be, as it were, not only politically but economically part of the British Empire, then can the President say what difference it would make if we were again to merge with and become part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland?  I would like to know what advantage there is in remaining like this if we are not going to push forward towards complete independence, not only politically but economically.</P>

      <P>I do not think I shall keep the President very long.  I may say at the outset that I am rather disappointed at the manner in which the President has presented his proposed Executive Council to the House.  After the adoption of the glorious principles of the Revolution <Col N="610" /> to which Deputy Cole and Deputy Haslett adhere&mdash;the Revolution of 1690&mdash;I should have thought that at the opening of the session to-day the President and his nominees would have entered dressed in the appropriate scarves, beating the big drum, and garlanded with the lilies which commemorate the glorious victories of Derry, Aughrim, Enniskillen and the Boyne.  It would have introduced a touch of colour into the dull and sombre proceedings of this House.  I am certain that henceforward, thanks to the missionary zeal of Deputy Cole and Deputy Haslett, the meetings of the Executive Council will open with the toast of the glorious, pious and immortal memory of William III., Prince of Orange, who has saved us from the Pope and Popery, wooden shoes and brass money, But that is merely by the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I rose to ask the President to justify the inclusion in the Executive Council of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, the late Minister for Justice.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has a remarkable claim upon posterity. We remember him in this House as the sole progenitor and the only begetter of a remarkable cow, a regular two-handed son of a gun of a cow, a cow who was able to kick with both feet, a phenomenon, I believe, which has not come within the purview even of a sportsman like Deputy Gorey.  But what other claim has he beyond his capacity to improvise a cock-and-bull story whenever the exigencies of defending the policy of his Department in this House compel him?  What other justification has Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney to sit as a member of the Executive Council of this State? None other, except that he is the centre of a conspiracy to secure the defeat of justice, a conspiracy which has been exposed, as Deputies on those benches have put it, in the courts of justice, a conspiracy which has been condemned in the courts of justice, a conspiracy, the instruments of which have been cast, as Deputy Flinn said, in damages in the courts <Col N="611" /> of justice of this State, a conspiracy for which, in the Estimates, Deputy Ernest Blythe, who is to be Minister for Finance in the new Executive Council, will provide the sinews of war.  In the Estimates for the current year the sum of £1,444,000 is to be provided out of the taxpayers' money for the Gárda Síochána.  That is £30,000 more than last year, and a large part of that sum is to go as wages, salaries and allowances to the thugs and gun bullies who are the active instruments of the policy which was adopted by the late Minister for Justice, Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, whose name is now one of those before the House.</P>
    <P>Again, in Vote 26. dealing with law charges, sub-head G, which provides for the defence of public officials in actions taken against District Justices or the Gárda Síochána, I notice that for the year 1930-1931 the amount devoted to that sub-head has been increased from £200 to £800.  What is the significance of that fact?  Does it portend an intensification of this lawless campaign, for which Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney was responsible, and for which he will possibly be responsible again if the House returns him?</P>
    <P>I submit that there is one section in the House that has a particular responsibility in this regard, and that is, the section which has, like Pilate, hitherto washed its hands of the whole affair.  If this Executive be kept in power it will be by the votes of the fifteen Independent members in this House.</P>

      <P>I ask them, in view of the facts which have been brought before their notice this evening, in view of the facts which, I am sure, they have read for themselves in the newspapers, do they stand for an intensification of this campaign of lawlessness, which has been carried on under the leadership and at the instigation of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney?  Does Deputy <Col N="612" /> Good stand for that; does Deputy Haslett stand for that; does Deputy Cole stand for that; do the Deputies who represent Trinity College stand for that?  Do they stand for this, continual and persistent sabotage of the civil liberties?  That is the issue we are putting up to them.  This debate has concentrated on the personality of the late Minister for Justice.  We have recited to those members, in order that they may not vote in ignorance of the facts that have been published in the newspapers, the astonishing fact that members of the police force have been cast in damages in the courts of this State, and that instead of being suspended from duty, instead of being dismissed with ignomy from that force, they have, on the contrary, been commended for their action by the ex-Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>For a moment I would ask them whether, even though at this time this particular campaign may be directed against a certain section of the community only, do they think it is going to end there? Do they for a moment believe it is going to be against Republicans always and only?  Let me remind them of an incident which.  I am sure, is well within the recollection of every member of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About two or two and a half years ago it was quite a common thing for a citizen of Dublin who possessed a motor car and who happened by chance to leave it outside his house at night to waken in the morning and find the motor car gone and the next day, or a couple of days afterwards, to hear that it had been found somewhere in the highways or bye-ways around the city.  For a long time it was believed that this temporary theft of motor cars was the work of the Irregulars, but then a shocking and a startling thing occurred.  There was a fatality at Bray in which three members of the Civic Guard, the force for which the Minister for Justice, Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, was then responsible, were found to have taken a motor car, and in consequence of the <Col N="613" /> fatality and the ensuing inquest, it then transpired that this temporary theft of motor cars had been the habitual and customary practice of members of the Gárda Síochána on night duty in the city.  At the police court proceedings the surviving Guard I am glad to say was discharged. I think he was sufficiently punished for what had happened.  I regret that the punishment was so drastic.  But in consequence of the fact that it then became known that this practice of joy-riding by the Guards had not been condemned at once there was a regular epidemic of it through the city, so much so, that even Deputy J.X. Murphy, who I presume is going to vote for this motion, had to write to the papers protesting and condemning it, and asking that some appropriate action should be taken, either by way of an amendment of the law, or some other way to stop such proceedings.  The Guards took the motor cars in the first instance and the immediate result was, as I have stated, that there was a widespread imitiation of their action in taking motor cars without the leave of the owners.</P>
    <P>The Guards at the moment are conducting a campaign of lawlessness throughout the country.  In the hands of the Independent members at this present moment rests the power of determining whether what the late Minister for Defence described yesterday as the primary and fundamental function of a Government, the preservation of law and order or the enforcement of the social order shall be undertaken seriously. In the hands of the Independent members at this moment rests the power to determine whether the Executive Council which is going to be constituted to-night will make that their primary and fundamental function and exercise it without regard to party advantage or party gain.  The Guards have been, as I said, convicted of lawlessness.  At the moment it is confined to them, but if they are allowed to go on, make no mistake about it, there will be widespread imitation of their action throughout the land.  Lawlessness <Col N="614" /> and disorder inevitably breed lawlessness and disorder, and if the Independents stand for peace, stability and progress in this country it is their duty and it is incumbent upon them before they cast their vote to-night to have from the President a statement that he will discard from his Executive Council Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney and instead will put in charge of the police forces of this country a man who has some conception of the duty of a Minister for Justice.</P>

      <P>This debate has gone on since 3 o'clock, and there has not been much reference to the particular incident which gave rise to the necessity for appointing a new Executive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this day week a Bill which would have entailed a Money Resolution was passed by this House, and it is obvious to everybody, more perhaps to Deputies on the far side of the House, the Fianna Fáil representatives, than any others, that if there were a firm decision of the House, if they meant business by reason of the passing of the Second Reading of the Bill introduced by Deputy Dr. Ward that some serious steps would be taken, some definite action should undoubtedly be taken which would emphasise the sincerity of those who voted for the Second Reading of the Bill.  It is idle to say that what transpired here yesterday was a normal outcome of the proceedings which took place here on Thursday night last.  Within the last three years the Deputies opposite came into this House for the first time and their first act was to vote against the continuance in <Col N="615" /> office of the then Executive.  I am positively certain that they had in mind then voting for a different Executive and that that Executive would not have come from their Party.  There was something political about that particular decision, there was something economic, but I cannot say so about the decision that was taken here on Thursday night last.  If they were really sincere in the vote they gave then they would, in my opinion, have voted for Deputy O'Connell last night.</P>
    <P>What was the reason they refused to vote for Deputy O'Connell?  There was one reason, and one reason only. They did not wish to see the leader of their Party placed in a larger minority than Deputy O'Connell. There was no anxiety about the old age pensions, not at all.  We must keep up the prestige of our own chief.  We must make it clear here in Ireland, and more especially in America, that the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party could not be placed in the lowest minority in this House.  That is the whole sum and substance of it, and that is the explanation they have got to give to any person outside who, by reason of the non-passage into law of that measure, suffers a loss of 1/-, 2/6 or any other sum in connection with old age pensions.</P>
    <P>That should have formed the basis of discussion here to-day.  Not at all; other matters were brought up. We are living here under a Constitution more democratic than that of any other country in the world.  In no other Parliament is the President of the Executive Council or the Prime Minister elected or nominated by the Parliament; in no other Parliament are the members of the Ministry submitted for consideration by the Parliament, and one would have imagined that on an occasion such as this an opportunity would be afforded, now that the House is full, of placing upon the records of the House something like a respectable discussion in connection with that procedure.</P>
    <P>The selection of an Executive is perhaps the most important incident <Col N="616" /> in the life of a Parliament, and on such an occasion one would look for some light and leading, some fair discussion, some decent discussion, some discussion that would be free from personalities and all the rest of it.  Not at all.  We are concerned with the actions of the Civic Guards and with various details all of which can be discussed on the Estimates. Some of them have already been discussed and passed by this House. Deputies will have some difficulty in explaining to the people of the country why it was when they were afforded an opportunity of putting an alternative Ministry in control of this country they would not vote for Labour.  Not likely.  They would let down the Fianna Fáil flag and the Fianna Fáil flag is the most important thing in this country to the Deputies opposite; not the prosperity of this country, not the independence of this country, but the success of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>The same thing. This is an occasion upon which one would naturally expect policy to be outlined.  Deputies occasionally ask for it.  It is an unusual occasion; one might reasonably expect that such an expression of policy should fall from the lips of the President of the Executive in the nomination of the Ministry.  I endeavour to save the time of the House and to avoid, as far as possible, any invasion of the time that should be devoted to really constructive work here in the Parliament of the people of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy of the Government is well known; it is in the book of Estimates under each of the Votes that have been introduced since we first took up office.  It is in the legislation which is passed through the Oireachtas and becomes law and we have, if we might say so, an alternative to it, all the wailings, the screechings, the pessimistic utterances, and the deplorable outbursts of pessimism that have come from the far side of the House.  The second last speech is evidence of it. The price of butter is down.  The <Col N="617" /> Government policy is wrong.  The Government should have foreseen, within the last few years, that in this year of Our Lord.  1930, in the month of March the price of butter would fall to 30/- a cwt.  The Minister for Agriculture, having foreseen that, should have taken the necessary steps, should have an alternative policy in mind.  I wonder how many people from over the Border, coming in here to this House or taking up the newspapers or the records of the speeches made in the last couple of days, would say that this is a place they ought to join.</P>

      <P>There has been no change in the policy of the Government. It is unchanged.  It is progressive. The advantages which the country has derived under its administration for the last eight years are to be seen on all sides.  More might have been accomplished, more could have been accomplished, much better results would undoubtedly have ensued if the calibre of the Opposition was of a different character, if there was a conception of true patriotism, if there was an incentive to work, if there was not a continual cry of &ldquo;What can we hammer out of the National Exchequer; what extra doles can be got; what new imposts can be put upon industry, upon agriculture, what further outcry can we make that will appeal to some one or other section in the country which for one reason or another is not particularly prosperous at the moment?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>From that side have come pronouncements which would be undoubtedly a forerunner of national uneasiness, a shaking of public confidence, a feeling of unrest and insecurity, nervousness about investing capital in this country and nervousness about the future, a feeling that everything was not right.  Is that a good policy to adopt?  Is that going to lead towards progress in this country?  Is it likely to make us more prosperous?  Is it likely to increase industry and employment in the country?  Deputies sometimes tax us with being unfair to them.  I do not intend to be unfair to them.  Taking that Party as a whole, what is its policy?  The policy of this Government is seen in this House.  It is seen outside in the better roads, the better streets, improved drainage, the improvement in the number of houses and in our agricultural produce, in the number of tariffed industries there are, and so on.  What is the policy of the Party opposite?  I have it under the name of their own leader.</P>

      <P>A good deal of play was made here this evening about the Guards.  That is a matter that could be discussed on the Estimates. It is a matter that ought to be discussed on the Estimates.  Let us for a moment, and without any heat, revert to the peculiar circumstances in which the Gárda Síochána were inaugurated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time in which they were formed was a time of grave disturbance in the country, regrettable disturbance, and what happened?  In May, 1923, an order was issued by the leader of the Party opposite to cease fire.  The pity about that was that along with that there did not come an order to surrender arms. They are through the country; they have not all been collected.  Some of them are in the hands of young enthusiasts; some of them are in the hands of persons who, perhaps, do not take the same interpretation of the moral law as ecclesiastics and, in consequence, a very big responsibility was placed upon the administration and upon the new Gárda.  Deplorable incidents have happened within the last few years.  Many members of that Gárda have lost their lives within the last few years.  It is not a normal situation.  But listening to perhaps the most moderate speech which was made in connection with this matter this evening one thing struck me very forcibly.  There were some decisions of the Courts recently <Col N="621" /> against Guards.  That is one assurance, if such were required, that there is impartial justice in the Courts.  There were in addition to the convictions two or three acquittals. This most moderate of all the speakers centred upon some of the features of the acquittal, and I gathered if that was the view of a moderate Deputy on the far side that it would be hard to expect from a less moderate person any more impartial view.  I gathered that as far as convictions were concerned they were bound to have been right, but that so far as acquittals are concerned there was something wrong about them.  I have said before in this House in connection with another Party that one of the disadvantages we are at in this country is that people address themselves to public questions who are unaccustomed to the exercise of authority.</P>
    <P>Although that pronouncement was made by a very moderate person on that Party, I was firmly convinced, having heard that person make that pronouncement, that that person was utterly and entirely unaccustomed to the exercise of authority.</P>
    <P>There must be a change in the administration in this country sooner or later.  Time alone will make that a necessity.  I invite Deputies opposite not to consider isolated instances, however reprehensible they may be and however much they may condemn them, without having the whole picture before them, without considering all the circumstances, without bearing in mind some of the difficulties, some of the complexities and the troubles &mdash; the terrible troubles&mdash;with which these guardians of the peace, who have the confidence. If not of the Deputies opposite, of the vast majority of the people, have to contend.  Such charges as that major crimes have not been detected and that persons have not been brought to justice do not form a fair accusation, having regard to the number of arrests and the percentage of convictions in connection with those cases.  It is a subject which should be considered calmly, dispassionately and without <Col N="622" /> any advertence to one's leanings towards the persons whom the people believe are suffering on one side or the other.  The whole subject was not dealt with in this House this evening in the manner in which one would like it to be dealt with. Any stranger coming here and listening to the debate would form the impression that it was the best that could be provided in this Parliament of Dáil Eireann.</P>
    <P>I said I was not going to keep the House long, and I do not intend to. The policy of the Government, as I have pointed out, is emphasised in the various Acts which have been passed through the House, the Estimates which have also come before the House, and the various Budgets which have been considered.  The policy has been to make this country a place in which industrialists would have confidence, where the burdens on industry and agriculture would be made as light as possible.  That was the main consideration which we felt compelled us to refuse to impose a tax on the people of this country in order to carry into law the Bill which received a Second Reading on Thursday last.</P>
    <P>The credit of the country stands high, very high.  It does not follow from that that it is possible for us in a short space of time, at a moment's notice, to float loans. There were some very sensible suggestions made here this evening. Yesterday evening there were some criticisms on the election of myself, which I expect referred also to the other Ministers.  Some members of the Labour Party pointed out the democratic programme of the First Dáil.  They said that it had not been carried into effect.  Deputy J.M. O'Sullivan dealt with that to some extent last night when he said that it might be possible to do all the things which had been suggested by the members of the Labour Party and the Fianna Fáil Party, but that it might possibly entail the introduction of a £25,000,000 Budget.  Could industry bear that?  Could agriculture bear that?  Are the people rich enough to bear it?  On the Benches <Col N="623" /> opposite there is a Deputy who at one time advocated a no income tax campaign.  This was modified subsequently to a proposal that there should be no income tax on Irish investments at home, Irish industries, Irish manufactures, and so on.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies went so far as to say that we were legislating entirely for the rich and that we were indifferent to the poor.  That is not a true charge.  There is no foundation for it.  During the last seven or eight years&mdash;though I am only responsible to account for the future. I suppose&mdash;we have been responsible for as intensive a social programme as the country was able to afford.  I invite Deputies to contrast the condition of affairs here with their ideals, to examine other countries much longer established than this, countries with greater opportunities and better traditions than we have got, to compare affairs in those countries with conditions here, and to bear in mind that it is easy enough to table a programme of houses for all, houses for everybody, but it is quite another matter to find out who can be taxed to pay for them.  If during the last two days we had bent our energies towards considering what were the difficulties of the present situation, how they can be solved, how the production of the country could be increased, how it would be possible to get cheaper houses for a larger number of people, how we might induce industrialists to develop at a still further rate the existing factories in the country, it would have been much better than all this rámeis that we have heard at great length and thundering sound.</P>
    <P>This morning I received from a friend of mine an extract from the writings of Thomas Davis, and I propose <Col N="624" /> to conclude with these words. My friend writes:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Let me write down here a passage in one of Davis's essays:&mdash;</P>
    <P>It is not a gambling fortune, made at imperial play, Ireland wants; it is the pious and stern cultivation of her faculties and virtues, the acquisition of faithful and exact habits, and the self-respect that rewards a dutiful and sincere life. To get her peasants into snug homesteads with well-tilled fields and placid hearths; to develop the ingenuity of her artists, and the docile industry of her artisans; to make for her own instruction a literature wherein our climate, history and passions shall breathe; and to gain conscious strength and integrity, and the high post of holy freedom.  These are Ireland's wants.</P>
