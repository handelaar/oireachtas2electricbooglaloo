      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Bourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's intentions regarding the problem of dealing with coast erosion depend to a large extent upon the terms of the report which will be furnished in due course by the Inter-Departmental Committee on Coast Erosion.  This Committee will not complete its work for some time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the reply of the Parliamentary Secretary, would he make a recommendation to the Coast Erosion Committee to make a special grant in view of the urgency that has arisen in Greystones, where a number of houses have been washed away, and in regard to Wicklow, a portion of which has also been threatened?  Is the position this, that we must wait for the report of the Committee before a grant can be made?</P>

      <P>Could the Parliamentary Secretary give us any idea as to when the Inter-Departmental Committee is likely to report?  Will it be weeks, months or years?

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he will state the wording of the &ldquo;secret instructions&rdquo; issued by the Revenue Commissioners to pension officers (referred to in paragraph 19 of the Report of the Old Age Pension Committee of Enquiry) on which these officers act in investigating and reporting upon old age pension and blind pension claims.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners issue instructions to their officers for the purpose of ensuring the efficient administration of the Old Age Pensions Acts.  As the instructions are for the use of these officials only, I am unable, having due regard to Departmental consideration, to comply with the Deputy's request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say why there should be so much secrecy with regard to the administration of this Act?  Further, is the Minister aware that the Old Age Pensions Committee of Enquiry reported that these secret instructions had caused a great deal of mistrust and antagonism between local pension committees and the pension officers?  In view of that fact, would the Minister not see his way to disclose these instructions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in the way of secret instructions. There are the ordinary instructions that officers get in administering all the Acts, and it is because it would be impossible to publish the <Col N="167" /> instructions that officers get in administering all the Acts that it is impossible to do it in this case.  On this matter, I replied at greater length to a question asked by Deputy Tadhg Murphy on 26th November, 1924.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries if he will state what is the present position in regard to responsibility for the dredging of Arklow Harbour; whether he is aware that the fishermen of the town have lately been confined to the port for several days, due to the entrance being blocked with sand; and whether, in view of the big loss accruing thereby to the fishery industry, and to the particular fishermen concerned, he will undertake that the harbour will be kept open for fishermen; and further, whether he proposes to arrange that the responsibility for dredging work at this particular harbour will be placed on a more definite basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands and Fisheries (Mr. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The responsibility for dredging at Arklow harbour lies with the local Harbour Commissioners. In view, however, of the fishing interests involved, State grants in aid of dredging have been made from time to time.  I am informed that fishing vessels have been confined to harbour recently through blocking of the harbour entrance, and I am considering the question of a further grant for clearing the obstructing silt.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on Section 2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentRice" hpid="Mr. Rice Mr. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night, in dealing with sub-section 1, I suggested that a change in the machinery proposed by the section would be desirable, the reason being that under the section as it stands the mother, or the expectant mother, of a child could <Col N="171" /> go into the office of the District Court, and without application to the Justice have a summons issued there against the alleged father to attend and show cause why an order should not be made against him in respect of such child.  I suggested that that was an undesirable procedure, for it would leave the way open for blackmail proceedings, and that something in the nature of a judicial mind ought to interfere before the summons is issued in that form, because the summons really amounts to this: that it is a prima facie finding that the person against whom it is issued is the father of the child.  I agree that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in regard to the issue of the summons should stand, but that application should be made to the District Justice.  There is an amendment, No. 11 on the Paper, and I do not know if I would be in order in referring to it having regard to the fact that I have not put down an amendment to the sub-section myself.  That amendment, which stands in the names of Deputy Little and Deputy Law, is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>All applications to the District Court and all cases under this Act shall be heard in camera, and publication of such cases shall be limited to the statement of the fact that an affiliation order has been granted in a particular court against a person whose name and address shall be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that this preliminary proceeding, namely, the issuing of a summons, should be not only safeguarded by having the application made to the Justice himself, but it should be further safeguarded by having the application for the summons made in camera before the Justice.  I do not agree with the amendment as it stands.  What it proposes is that the hearing of these proceedings should be in camera.  Apart from the fact that it would be an infringement of the <Col N="172" /> principle that the courts of our State are open courts, and that all legal proceedings should be in open courts, I think what is proposed by the amendment is undesirable for another reason.  If a summons is issued and heard before a Justice, if the proposed amendment is accepted, then in a case where a man succeeded in clearing his character of the charge made against him, although probably the whole neighbourhood would be aware that the summons had been issued against him they would not be aware of the fact that he had cleared himself of the charge.  I think it would be undesirable to have court proceedings held in camera.  If an order is made against him there is no reason why there should be a departure from the ordinary principle of an open court.  On the other hand, if a man succeeds in clearing himself of the charge against him it would be undesirable that there should be no publicity of that fact.  I suggest the Minister should consider the advisability of amending the section by providing the safeguards I have suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I reserve arguing the question as to whether such cases should be tried in camera until we come to deal with the amendment, but I think there is a great deal to be said for Deputy Rice's contention that only a District Justice should deal with this matter.  I do not know what the view of the Minister was when the Bill was drafted. Now, however, that his attention has been drawn to it, and in view of the unsatisfactory state of the law and procedure with reference to certain matters which are dealt with by the Clerk of the District Court it would be far better to make it explicit in the Bill that the matter should come before a District Justice before the summons is issued, and that it should be in camera.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is largely a matter of procedure.  If any more satisfactory procedure than that embodied in the section can be discovered <Col N="173" /> I am perfectly willing to accept it.  I will consider bringing in on the Report Stage an amendment embodying Deputy Rice's views.</P>
      <P>Section 2, as amended, agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
      <P>(1)  On the hearing by the District Court of a summons issued under this Act the Justice, if he is satisfied in accordance with this section that the alleged father of the illegitimate child (whether born alive or still-born) to whom such summons relates is the father of such child may make an order (in this Act called an affiliation order) adjudging such alleged father to be the putative father of such child and ordering such putative father to pay the expenses, as measured by the Justice, incidental to the birth of such child, and, where such child was born alive, such of the following moneys as may be appropriate, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  if such child has died before the making of such order, the funeral expenses, as measured by the Justice, of such child to an amount not exceeding five pounds, or</P>
      <P>(b)  such weekly sum not exceeding twenty shillings as the Justice shall fix for the maintenance and education of such child, or</P>
      <P>(c)  where the putative father so consents, a lump sum of such amount as shall be fixed by the Justice in commutation of any weekly sum which might otherwise be payable under this Act by such putative father in respect of such child.</P>
      <P>(2)  No Justice of the District Court shall be satisfied that a person is the putative father of an illegitimate child without hearing the evidence of the mother of such child and also evidence corroborative in some material particulars of the evidence of such mother.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="174" /> (3)  Where a Justice of a District Court by an affiliation order orders the putative father of an illegitimate child to pay a weekly sum in respect of such child he may attach such conditions as he shall think proper to the payment or to the receipt of such weekly sum.</P>
    <P>(4)  The provisions of this Act relating to the fixing of the amount of a lump sum paid in commutation of a weekly sum payable under an affiliation order and the payment, administration, and application of such lump sum shall apply to the fixing, payment, administration and application of a lump sum made payable by an affiliation order in commutation of any weekly sum which might otherwise be payable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>A dying declaration would be absolutely hopeless.  But even in the case of a man who has made a statement, the value of that evidence depends on the person who heard him making the statement.  If a man makes a statement taking responsibility for the child you may be sure he will support the child.  Any man who takes responsibility for the child will, in fact, if he is able to, support the child.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment which has created a good deal of interest amongst people who have a real experience of institutions where these women are looked after.  Where the questions were put to them they said that it would be infinitely better to have cases of this sort tried in camera than to have them tried in public, because it is only the hardened sinners, people who have completely lost their self-respect, who will come into a public court in cases like this.  You have people who would rather die than have the matter made a public matter, but you would find that these people would come into court when the question is heard in camera.  There is no one who can be so inhuman as a legal theorist, and one must necessarily take cognisance of people who are dealing in a practical way from day to day with this problem &mdash;people who know the psychology of these people.  These are people who have no ulterior motives, no motive other than that they are trying to do the best for those who are in their charge.  I think that the facts they have put before us should weigh very heavily with the Dáil. This is not a kind of case where the question of the Constitution, as far as public courts are concerned, arises.  It is not a case where Constitutional issues are involved or where an injustice can be done to people because the case is not heard in public.  The amendment safeguards the public.  The principle of publication comes in there; it lays down that when a decree or affiliation order has been granted in a particular case against a person, that may be published.  In that way <Col N="177" /> publication is not entirely evaded, but the actual hearing of the case is in the spirit of the old procedure of the ecclesiastical courts, which are the foundation in British law of the Chaneery Courts.  The old ecclesiastical courts dealt with matters of this kind, and when they did deal with them they were not matters for publication at all.  It would be in consonance with our tradition as well as being a merciful method of dealing with these cases that matters of this sort should be dealt with in camera.  Also from the point of view of the man who is being charged there is far less chance of blackmail in cases where the question is to be tried in camera, because the force of blackmail depends upon the amount of publication which can be threatened, but if there is no publication then the threat of blackmail to a very large extent disappears.  A man under a threat of blackmail may say, &ldquo;Very well, take your action and bring it into court.&rdquo;  If the case is heard in camera that will completely disarm the person trying to blackmail.  I think the amount of public opinion in favour of this amendment justifies me in asking the House to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will ask the House not to accept this amendment. I am not going to follow the Deputy through a good deal of his speech, because I have only to point out to him that all criminal and quasi-criminal courts in this country are public, with one exception, and that is with respect to a charge of incest.  In England charges of incest were heard in camera for some time, but the experience there was of such a nature that they repealed the section dealing with that matter, and these cases are now heard in open court.  I do not say that we should follow blindly English customs.  I do not say that at all, but I do say that in this country, where legislation and the court procedure are very much the same as in England, where they have tried and where they have found the thing not to be successful, we should <Col N="178" /> not lightly embark upon the same principle in new legislation.  Really the words the Deputy has used here that nobody but a hardened sinner would come forward have very much surprised me.  I am astonished at hearing a Deputy make such a case.  The Deputy is a practising solicitor.  As the law stands at present, actions for seduction may be brought, and such actions are brought from time to time.  Whenever a girl lives with her father or mother, her father or mother can bring an action for seduction against the father of her child, if there is an illegitimate child.  If the Deputy were correct, nobody but a hardened sinner would ever bring a case of this kind.  That is not so; that is not my experience.  I have acted for the defendants in a considerable number of those cases, and I have never heard in my experience anything of the sort suggested.  I could challenge anybody, and I have challenged a deputation which came to see me on this very particular question. I challenged them to let me know if they knew of a single case in which fear of publicity had prevented a girl taking legal proceedings, and not a single one of the deputation could mention a case that in their knowledge had happened. It must be borne in mind in the first place that everybody's public is, so to speak, very much confined.  It is generally what your personal enemies, your friends or your neighbours think of you.  That is the public which affects the ordinary person.  One's public is one's own immediate surroundings.  If a girl has an illegitimate child every person in her neighbourhood, whether she brings the action in camera or in public, will know that she has had that illegitimate child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Her reputation is no more damaged amongst the people that count as far as she is concerned; that is, her own immediate home circle.  Nobody is made the slightest bit the wiser by the public hearing of the case.  As I have said, I am perfectly satisfied that whether this case is heard in public or private <Col N="179" /> there will be exactly the same number of cases brought.  It ought also to be borne in mind that a girl in a case of this nature, or in an action for seduction, has not to go through anything like the same ordeal as, for instance, a girl who is a State witness in a case where there is a charge of indecent assault brought against a man and she is the individual who has suffered.  In such a case it is necessary to have a very close examination of the facts.  That examination must be gone into and certain very unpleasant details have to be brought out.  I now refer to charges of rape and indecent assault. In charges for seduction, no unpleasant details are gone into. Simply the main fact of the seduction is deposed to.  There is no necessity to go into details and there is no putting of difficult questions for the girl to answer beyond the one leading question: &ldquo;Were you or were you not seduced by this man?&rdquo;  and she answers &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; There is not in the case of seduction the terrible ordeal to the girl which there sometimes is in charges of rape.</P>
    <P>According to this amendment, if an action is brought against a man it can never be known that he is clear of the charge.  If there is a verdict against him, that can be published.  The girl's name is not published, but his name has to be published.  That is as I understand the amendment.  But suppose the charge against him is dismissed; suppose he completely vindicates his innocence&mdash;that fact can never be published.  Is that fair?  After all, men have their reputations to look after as well as women.  A charge may be brought against a man and it may be very damaging to him.  He may face that charge and demonstrate his innocence.  Is he not entitled to let the public know that his innocence has been demonstrated?  I will go further than that.  The mere fact that the charge against him has been dismissed is not enough.  All his neighbours will know, of course, that a charge has been brought <Col N="180" /> against him.  If a summons is served on him it will pretty quickly get out and all his neighbours will know of the charge.  Suppose that they even hear that the charge has been dismissed, they will not know the grounds upon which it has been dismissed.  Sometimes the charge may be dismissed on technical grounds and for want of corroboration. The man may be guilty or innocent, but the case has not been proved against him.  He gets a dismiss on that ground.  But suppose it may be otherwise; suppose he proved that he was not in the country at all at the date of the conception of the child that he is alleged to be the father of; suppose he can completely establish his innocence. In such circumstances is he not entitled to have that fact made public?  In my judgment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The general principle is that a person who has a serious charge brought against him is entitled to a public investigation of that charge.  The Deputy talks about blackmail.  Surely this amendment makes for blackmail. If there is a decree against a man his name is to be published.  I could see visions of some hardened woman getting a decree against one man.  Everything is kept quiet and private and only the name of the man is published.  Possibly, if there is to be no publicity, that hardened woman might get several decrees in respect of the same baby against different putative fathers.  They might even go so far as that if you are going to have no publicity.  A woman might issue summonses against three different persons and everything is heard in camera. The safeguard of the individual is the publicity of the proceedings against him.  I am perfectly satisfied that if the cases are heard in public not one single woman less will bring a charge under this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughALaw" hpid="Mr. Law Mr. Law">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Law</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to find myself in opposition to my friends the Minister and Deputy Rice.  I should be the more affected were it not for this consideration, that I know so well that if the legal profession has a weakness&mdash;which I should be reluctant to admit&mdash;it would be attributable to undue conservatism. Deputy Rice's objection rests mainly on the point that to give in camera proceedings in this particular class of case would be contrary to our general legal procedure.  Of course that is quite true.  The Minister bases his objection upon that ground partly and also upon other grounds with which I shall deal in a moment. On the general question, this is not the first time one has come up against this sort of attitude.  I remember some years ago&mdash;I happened to be in England then&mdash;when an Act was passed which regulated and restricted the publication of details in divorce proceedings.  That Act, of course, does not provide for what <Col N="182" /> we call in camera proceedings, but it does&mdash;and we copied it in our own Censorship Bill last session&mdash;very greatly restrict the amount of information in such cases which can be published in the newspapers.  Even that moderate measure met with the most determined and violent opposition from members of the Bar in England, notably from personal friends of my own, leaders of the Bar in Divorce and Probate.  I do not believe that now, after some years' experience, anybody would wish to go back to the old state of things.  I spent a considerable part of one year in attending proceedings in that Division and I was profoundly convinced that nothing but harm could come, whether to the public or to the parties, from the publication which formerly attended such proceedings.  This is relevant to something that the Minister said a moment ago.  He pictured&mdash;and I think it was one of the most forcible parts of his speech&mdash;the possibility of a man being the victim of a false charge.  His neighbours would know that a charge was made against him.  Under this amendment, if carried, he would be unable to obtain any publicity beyond the mere fact that the case against him had been dismissed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughALaw" hpid="Mr. Law Mr. Law">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Law</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Little indicated that there would be no difficulty in adding words which would secure that.  I was assuming that would be done.  It ought to be done.  I am only concerned to point out that exactly the same sort of problem arose in connection with the divorce procedure in England.  I remember having been very deeply impressed by one case in which the charge made against the husband was of a terrible nature.  I think it was quite the most revolting case to which I ever listened, as presented by the wife's counsel.  In the course of cross-examination, however, her case completely broke down, but no doubt there must have been many people who were aware <Col N="183" /> of what had been said about that man who had no opportunity by means of any publicity attending the proceedings of letting people know that the case had broken down and that the particular charges had been completely disproved.  That seems to me to be one of the risks which we have constantly to take. Now I come to consider another matter.  Broadly, there are two parties who are to be considered&mdash; namely, the man against whom the charge is made and the woman who brings a claim for an affiliation order.  So far as the man is concerned I am inclined to agree with Deputy Little.  It is a very nicely balanced question.  Take a man against whom a charge has been improperly brought.  Is he more likely or less likely to yield to threats of blackmail if the proceedings are to be attended with full publicity or to be held, I will not say in secret, but with modified publicity?  It is a very difficult question, and on the whole I should be inclined to agree with Deputy Little.  If it were my own case I should be more inclined to fight and not to yield to threats of blackmail if I were not going to be exposed to the full view of all the loungers in a public court and to all the publicity attending such proceedings with unrestricted publication in the papers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is my personal point of view, and I find that it is shared by many people, but it is a nice question upon which people may come to various conclusions.  Now I come to consider the question of the woman.  The Minister says that he does not believe that any girl would be deterred from applying for an affiliation order because of the publicity attending the proceedings if the Bill is passed as is proposed.  He also tells us that he believes that exactly the same number of cases would be brought in the one instance as in the other.  The Minister may be right&mdash;I do not believe he is&mdash;but I do know that neither the Minister nor I can be regarded as the best judge in these matters.  The people who are the best judges of <Col N="184" /> the psychology of the unmarried mother are surely the people whose duties bring them into contact with them, such as social workers, the clergy and certain religious orders like nuns.  From what has appeared in the public Press and from private letters which I have received there appears to be absolute unanimity in opposition to the view put by the Minister.  Rightly or wrongly, the decent girl&mdash;and in the great majority of cases they are fundamentally decent&mdash;will be prevented in many cases from bringing her claim to court if she has to face the publicity which is contemplated in the Bill.  Therefore, for my part, though I see the force of certain objections raised by the Minister, I still remain of the opinion that such proceedings should be heard in camera, and I ask the House to agree with that view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephXMurphy" hpid="Mr. J.X. Murphy Mr. J.X. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.X. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Law, I have been greatly impressed by the views of social workers and the nuns who run the Magdalen Asylum.  They seem to be unanimous that these cases should be heard in camera.  The Minister for Justice spoke about seduction cases, but I think that the number of such cases in the Free State is comparatively few.  I think that many girls hesitate to bring actions on account of the publicity given to them, but they would be glad to get relief if the cases were heard in camera. With Deputy Little, I suggest that the Minister should agree to insert after the words &ldquo;affiliation order has been granted&rdquo; the words &ldquo;or refused.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in opposing the amendment, said that one of his reasons for doing so was that we should follow the precedent in England, give all the publicity possible to these cases and that it should be known through the local press whether a charge against a man was dismissed on technical grounds or whether he got off with a clear sheet.  As Deputy Law pointed out, I think that there is a great outcry in England against <Col N="185" /> this form of publicity.  I know that there is an agitation to establish a censorship in the Press in order to cut out a lot of the stuff in which certain types of newspapers deal. According to the Minister we are to have plenty of publicity in regard to cases in which charges are brought in the courts against putative fathers.  You might divide the mothers into two classes.  You have the middle-class mothers with whom social workers and nuns in cities come into contact.  In the other case, you have the mothers who go to the county homes and who comprise the vast majority of mothers of illegitimate children in the Free State.  Amongst the latter type you have a small percentage of mothers who themselves are illegitimate, who come of an illegitimate stock, and who observe no moral code whatever, but are bred in the art of blackmail.  Taking the male psychologist outlook in regard to this matter, it is not fair to the man charged that he should be brought into public court and the charges against him turned into a kind of comedy out of which certain people would get vulgar enjoyment. It would be embarrassing to him, he would not get as fair a trial in open court as if his case were tried in camera, and sooner than face that vulgarism he would prefer to pay off the blackmailer.  Taking his point of view alone, the trial in camera, as advocated in this amendment, is the more desirable method. Whether the public know that he got off on a technical ground or cleared himself or not, is apart altogether from the matter.  He will get publicity enough if he has to maintain the child, without going into the details of the evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again what applies to the man who is liable to be blackmailed by these charges in court also applies to the girl who perhaps is paying her first visit to any public court and it is only fair to her that the proceedings should be conducted in camera. We all know that in such cases the neighbourhood will know of it but there is a difference between the neighbourhood knowing it and <Col N="186" /> having the proceedings conducted in public in court, with her name appearing afterwards in the local Press which will be read in three or four counties.  As I say, if there is a precedent in England for this kind of thing it is condemned by the best thinkers in England and it should not be a precedent for us here.  We ought to see that it is not followed here by adopting this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain Redmond Captain Redmond">
      <NameTxt>Captain Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Deputy who last sat down has ever considered what is the idea of publicity in criminal trials.  Is he aware that the general maxim is accepted that publicity is for the benefit of the accused and that everyone who is charged with crime is innocent until he is proved to be guilty?  Let us examine briefly the point of view of the mother in the first place and of the alleged father in the second place.  If the mother has a genuine case, if she is not a blackmailer or a virago, she has nothing to fear by coming into public court, and I thoroughly agree with the Minister that nothing shall deter her from doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Murphy stated that there were very few seduction cases in this country.  From a moral point of view, unfortunately, I must disagree with him.  They are heard in every Circuit Court that I visit on the Leinster Circuit.  I agree with the Minister that if the girl can prove through her father or mother that a man is the father of her child and if she wants the father or the mother to get damages for that, there is no reluctance on the part of the individual girl to come forward and give the necessary evidence.  I would like to say also that the Minister was perfectly right when he stated that the character of evidence which had to be given in such cases is entirely different from that which is given in cases of indecent assault.  Let us then take the position of the woman who might bring false charges against the alleged father.  Is it not right that the charge should be tried publicly and if the charge is false then it shall be publicly broadcast?  Take <Col N="187" /> the case of the man who is guilty. Why should his guilt not be brought out in public?  Why should the case not be decided in open court?  Is it not for the benefit of the country that it should be known that this man has committed this offence?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain Redmond Captain Redmond">
      <NameTxt>Captain Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not for the benefit of the country that it should be known what the circumstances were in which this offence was committed and that he should be branded as the criminal that he has been found by the Court to be? Take the case of the innocent man. Surely, if a man is innocent he is not going to demand that a serious and, to a certain extent, an immoral offence should be heard in camera. On the contrary will he not come forward and say: &ldquo;I want this case brought up against me in public.  I deny this charge.  Let the accuser come forward and make what statements she can and I will be prepared openly and publicly to deny them.&rdquo; That, to my mind, would be the natural viewpoint of the innocent accused, and when it is suggested, as it has been by Deputy Little and Deputy Law, that to have cases tried in public would lead to more blackmail, I cannot for the life of me understand the rationality of that view.  Surely if one person wants to blackmail another it is far easier for him to do so when, as a result of his attempted blackmail, the issues will be tried in private and not in public.  Surely it is easier for that would-be blackmailer to make these charges when he knows that the charges he is making will never be sifted in public.  I certainly cannot follow the reasons put forward on the other side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then Deputy Law spoke about the divorce law in England.  The procedure in regard to divorce law was changed in England with respect to the publication of the proceedings. That was done for one purpose and for one purpose only.  It was done in the hope that it would not encourage people throughout the country by reading these proceedings <Col N="188" /> to indulge, if I might so describe it, in divorce.  What has been the result?  Is there less divorce to-day in England than there was when this new procedure was adopted?  On the contrary, I do not think I am wrong in stating that the divorces have actually in creased.  But the main reason why I stand by the section as it is, may be, if you like, due to my conservatism, conservatism as a lawyer, perhaps, as well as conservatism in other respects, but conservatism in this way.  I do not object to being called a conservative because what I want to conserve is the liberty of the subject, the liberty of the individual citizen of this State, that, when at any time a grave charge is brought against him, he shall have the right to have that charge brought forward and sifted and the issue decided in public.  As the Minister has said, in respect of every criminal charge in this country at present, with the exception of a charge of the crime of incest, the individual citizen has the right to have his case tried in public.  I think that not only would it be detrimental to the public interest at large if that system were discontinued, but it would be an exceedingly bad precedent for the future criminal administration in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not yet acquired that legal attitude towards things which very often leaves out humanity.  There is a social evil to be remedied here and what we should consider is not what the legal mind thinks of it as but how best to remedy it.  Deputy Redmond says the case should be sifted in public. I wonder does he think that the presence in court of people who go to court to hear things for certain purposes will help to get justice for <Col N="189" /> anyone accused.  Do they go there in the legal frame of mind?  Do they want to see everyone get fair play or do many of them go through idle curiosity to hear these cases? It would be well if that class were included.  I notice Deputy Rice and Deputy Redmond time and again emphasise the case of the man accused.  There are two parties to the case.  Men are the sterner stuff and the tougher fibre and should be better able to bear the charge than the woman.  We should give her the chance which it is agreed by social workers of all denominations she will have if the case is heard in secret, and we should not have, as very often happens, a ribald public present when these things are discussed. It is not, of course, a party question at all.  It is a question of how best to remedy that social evil, and I am strongly of opinion that you are more likely to get the evil remedied by having the cases heard in camera.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Minister's objection, it would be possible to add to Deputy Little's proposed amendment some such words as these: &ldquo;or where the order is dismissed, such order in its entirety may be published or not, according to the desire of the defendant.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T.J. O'Connell Mr. T.J. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this House should be very slow to interfere with the general principle that all cases should be heard in open court.  An attempt was made some months ago in this House to interfere with that principle or rather to introduce a certain element of secrecy into our criminal procedure, which we on this side resisted as far as we were able.  I think that no case has been made on behalf of Deputy Little's amendment which would justify us in interfering with the principle.  It appears to me that there is a further consideration that has not yet been touched upon, except in a very slight way by Deputy Redmond, and that is the question of the effect of these secret trials, as against public trials, on general public morality in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="190" /> It seems to me that we should consider the case not alone of the innocent man but of the guilty man also and consider the effect which publicity would have as a deterrent. I have no hesitation in saying that it would have a good effect on public morality and act as a deterrent against actions of this kind by a man who might occupy a responsible position and be inclined to take advantage of unprotected girls if it were known that the possibility of trial in open court was to be faced. If, on the other hand, he knew that even the greatest consequences of his act would be an affiliation order, which, so far as the actual financial cost of it went, meant very little to him, it would not be as great a deterrent as the possibility of being dragged through the public court would be.  I think that is a consideration we must always bear in mind when deciding how we should cast our vote in this particular matter.</P>
    <P>The main argument in favour of Deputy Little's amendment is whether or not justice will be sought, whether the mother will be prevented from seeking justice because of publicity.  I believe you can roughly divide these people into two classes, the people who would be inclined to go to the court and the people who would be inclined to hide their shame and not tell anyone about it.  As far as these latter are concerned, it will not matter much to them whether the proceedings are heard in secret or in public.  They will endeavour so far as they can to keep away from the court whether the proceedings are public or private.  I believe that the number of mothers who would be reluctant to go to the court because of the publicity would be comparatively few.  I think the amount of possible hardship that would occur as a result would not be so great as to justify us in departing from the general principle of publicity.  I think that, on the whole, the weight of the arguments is in favour of publicity and it is because of that that I intend to vote against the amendment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fahy has observed that the motto of the King's Inns is &ldquo;We are unwilling to change.&rdquo;  I confess that where we have experience behind us, not merely of generations but of centuries, I am adhering to the maxim. In fact, I have observed that Deputy Fahy himself, as his training in the law has progressed, has become more reasonable and broad-minded in the views he has put forward in this House, and I hope that progress will continue until he reaches a prominent rank amongst the members of the Bar.  There is only one observation I desire to make in addition to what I have already said on the section itself, and that arises out of a suggested analogy by my friend, Deputy Law. He suggested that there would be an analogy here in our position if this amendment were adopted and the position in England with regard to the non-publication of the reports of divorce proceedings.  I suggest that that is not an analogy, because the main objection I had to this proposed amendment is that it does not give an opportunity of acquittance to the man who proves he is innocent of the charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fahy said that I spoke of the man who was being accused all the time.  I do not desire any protection for the man who is the father of an illegitimate child and who has refused to shoulder his obligations, and if publicity is his punishment I think he should get as much publicity as the Press will give him.  But I am concerned with the man who is innocent and may be falsely charged.  If you have this amendment, he cannot get an acquittance in the eyes of the public. There is no analogy between the position if this is accepted and the position in England with regard to the publication of divorce reports because, there, a special exemption is made, in prohibition of publication, in favour of the summing up of the judge at the conclusion of the case.  Of course, when a man is innocent of the charge brought against him he can get no better acquittal in the eyes of his fellowmen <Col N="192" /> than the summing-up and conclusions of the judge at the conclusion of the trial.  For these reasons, I oppose the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind the House, first of all, of the purpose of the Bill.  It is to make provision mainly, I think, for the child, to impose upon the father the obligation of providing for the child he has begotten.  It is quite true that in attempting to make that provision, we do offer to an unscrupulous person what might be an instrument of blackmail but, at the same time, we have to bear in mind that the principal purpose of this Bill is to ensure that provision shall be made for the child.  Therefore, we should do nothing that will tend to make this Bill in any way ineffective. In that connection we have got to remember the deterrent, even from defending proceedings, that the danger of publicity may be.  I listened to Deputy O'Connell who stated that publicity would deter men from committing these offences. The unanimous testimony of social workers is that publicity will deter the wronged woman from seeking redress and the main purpose of the Bill is to enable that woman to seek redress.  Therefore, when dealing with this question the first consideration should be, what is going to make the Bill more effective, and the second consideration, possibly, ought to be that the Bill should not be used for the purposes of blackmail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Redmond in dealing with this measure said that the general maxim is that publicity is in favour of the accused; that everyone charged with a crime is innocent until proved guilty.  That is the theory but I am sorry to say that it is not in accord with the actual facts. I think in the minds of the general public a man is held almost invariably guilty until he is proved innocent, and even after he is proved innocent, and after the verdict of the jury is given in his favour, very often he is held to be guilty more or less.  That general attitude of public opinion in this country towards the accused person will <Col N="193" /> often deter men accused in the wrong from defending themselves and from incurring the publicity which such defence will assuredly entail.  They prefer to settle in secret rather than have the cases blazoned in the columns of the newspapers. That publicity is one of the things that will go towards making this Bill an instrument of blackmail.  That is the argument for the man.  If a man knows that a case will be heard in camera, that he can go and put his case before the judge, that no publicity will ensue, you may be certain if he is conscious of innocence he will defend the case and not submit to blackmail.</P>
    <P>In the same way, if a woman falls, she can go there to seek redress without exposing her shame to the public view.  Then the woman, for the sake of the child, and possibly for the sake of herself, will take advantage of the Bill and seek redress. There is one other point I would like to mention.  The Minister said that after all a person's public is very limited and circumscribed.  That depends very largely on the position of the person.  A person may belong to a family known over a much larger area than the particular person has acquaintance with.  In that case, a woman will be very often deterred from taking action, because of the fact that such action will reflect not only on herself, but on her friends and relatives who might be known, as Deputy Kennedy said, throughout three or more counties. It is not merely the limited circle of one's friends that will be affected in these cases.  No person can set a limit to the damage which might be done not only to the reputation of the aggrieved person, but to the reputation of her relatives and friends in cases of this sort, and for that reason, and for the sake of the persons concerned, we think these cases ought to be heard in camera.</P>
    <P>The last argument I want to advance is this: On the one side, you have heard the lawyers, practically unanimous, against the amendment, while on the other side I think you have social workers, practically <Col N="194" /> unanimous, in favour of the amendment. I ask the House which of these has the more intimate association with, and knowledge of, the persons affected by this Bill?  Surely those who are succouring these unfortunate women can speak with much greater knowledge as to their psychology and desires than the Minister for Justice, Deputy Redmond or Deputy Rice.  If the fate of the amendment is going to be determined by the experience of one or other of these parties, then I think the House ought to be determined in its judgment by the experience and desire of those engaged in social work who want this amendment to be accepted.</P>

      <P>I would like to hear of any concrete case, from social workers or anyone else, of a woman having been so deterred. As I said before, I asked social workers if they could give me a concrete case, and they said not.  It appears to me to be a question of theory against the actual experience which we have, which not only lawyers but everyone in this House more or less must have, that girls who bring an action for seduction, girls who have only fallen once, girls who until that fall were virtuous, are never deterred from going into court.  I would like to hear of a concrete case in which a girl said she would go into court if the case were heard in secret.  It is mere speculation as to what will happen in the minds of girls in the future, weighed against the course of conduct which girls similarly circumstanced have adopted in the past.  I completely agree with Deputy Fahy in this, that it is certainly not a party matter.  It is not a political matter.  It is a matter which has <Col N="195" /> nothing at all to do with political questions.  It is purely a social question. It seems to me to be a social question of no slight importance.  Deputy MacEntee says that the main thing we must look on is the position of the woman.  That is slightly wrong. The Bill is for the support and maintenance of the child, and not for the advantage of the mother at all.  The question here is, will this alleged shame of letting not only her own immediate circle, who do know, but outside persons know, that she has borne an illegitimate child overcome in her mind parental affection?  I do not think it will.  In fact, I am sure it will not.  As a matter of fact, any girl who has borne an illegitimate child, who has had to face the scorn which we all know the mother of the illegitimate child receives from her acquaintances, has borne a very hard thing.  She has borne a thing in comparison with which appearing in public court is a mere trifle.  I am sure the House will agree with me in that.  To say that she would be deterred by going into court appears to me to be utterly wrong.</P>

      <P>I heard the Minister say that he had not got any definite cases.  I have not got them at present, but when the Bill was introduced I was speaking to a parish priest who told me that he knew several cases where girls would not bring a case into court for the reason that they did not want the thing broadcast.  It is bad enough to have local publicity, but when it comes to broadcasting it all over the country it is another matter; probably for the reason that their friends and connections would be also blamed.  Being a lawyer, every case which came under the Minister's notice came into court.  Lawyers think that every case should be brought into court.  I wonder has that occurred to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I confess I find very considerable difficulty in making up my mind about this question. <Col N="196" /> I was very much impressed by what the Minister said with regard to it being equally our duty to protect the innocent as to look after the mother of the child in certain cases such as are under consideration.  I was also impressed by what the Minister said, by what Deputy Rice said, and, particularly, by what Deputy O'Connell said.  In consequence I find myself in the position of not liking the amendment as it appears on the Paper.  I do not think I can vote for it as it stands. I do feel, with those who put the amendment forward, and feel very strongly, that if the Bill goes through in its present form it will very largely fail to meet the difficulty which it sets out to meet.  I have a certain amount of social experience. I am bound to say that that social experience does not confirm me in the view that the Minister takes, that open publicity in court does not deter very many people from seeking to fix guilt upon a father which he ought properly to bear.  I do not think that the amendment is right, and I do not think that the Bill in its present form is going to be as useful as I would like it to be.  My inexperience of courts rather prohibits me from putting in any concrete form any suggestion, but I cannot help thinking that the Bill could be improved if there was some intermediate course possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the pronouncement of the justice or the judge who hears the case ought to be given every publicity, and that, I think, would very largely protect the innocent person. I think if there was partial publicity of that kind, if the statement of the judge and the result were made known, the taking of evidence, etc., being held in secret, it would go a certain distance towards helping these unmarried mothers to get the help for their child which they ought in right to be entitled to receive.  I think the Minister has made his point strongly that the amendment, even partially altered as Deputy Murphy suggested, would not sufficiently protect from attack in <Col N="197" /> some cases men who are quite innocent of what they are accused.  Again, as it stands, I do not know that the Bill will meet very many cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughALaw" hpid="Mr. Law Mr. Law">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Law</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, I shall certainly accept and welcome the suggestion which Deputy Thrift has made, if Deputy Little will agree with me, that in addition to that provided in the amendment publicity should be given to the statement of the judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that suggestion is a very good one, and, provided we can establish the protection in the form of the trial being in camera, we are willing to accept any adjustment after that which would be in the best public interest.  I do not know if either Deputy Redmond or Deputy O'Connell adverted to it, but we have tried in the amendment to protect the principle of publicity, because the decree is to be published when it is made against the party. That meets some of their arguments. The Minister said that he had not come across cases where women were deterred from coming into court. Curiously enough, within the last twelve months I myself have had a case in my office of a woman who would not go into court in such case. I do not wish to specify the action, but it was an analagous case.  She had a clear case if she had gone into court, but she refused because of the publicity which would attach to its being heard in public.</P>

I should <Col N="198" /> like to point out to Deputy Thrift that there is no analogy between the case of a judge charging a jury and a magistrate giving a decision, or a Circuit Court Judge giving a decision on an appeal.  The judge charging a jury will go through and examine all the evidence placed before the court.  On the other hand, a magistrate giving a decision very often simply will say &ldquo;decree&rdquo; or &ldquo;dismiss,&rdquo; and not give any reason.</P>

      <P>Surely it is not beyond the wit of man to discover a way in which the judgment can be published in a case like that.  If the justice is directed by an Act of Parliament to write his judgment, whether it be short or long, it cannot take very long to write it, and let that judgment be published.  We are under a misapprehension here. Technically speaking, it is not a criminal matter.  It is an action for tort.  It is not a criminal proceeding at all.  It is not a case where the State intervenes and prosecutes. There is no prosecution in these cases.  These cases are civil cases arising out of a criminal act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty as far as the Minister is concerned seems to be that he does not believe that there are any cases of suppression of this kind due to publicity.  It seems to me that that might be statistically examined.  There is <Col N="199" /> such a thing, I presume, as a return of illegitimate births.  What proportion do the affiation orders bear to them?</P>

      <P>What proportion do actions of this kind bear to the recorded number of cases of illegitimate birth?  I should imagine a very small proportion, and, therefore, prima facie the case seems to be that there is suppression.  What I am going to put to the Minister is this: If between now and the Report Stage Deputy Boland or someone else brings to his notice cases of suppression will he, on Report Stage, consider whether he can meet this difficulty or not?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is this: I frankly say the Minister is entitled and is bound to act as strongly in the protection of the man as in the protection of the woman.  He is bound to be fair between the two. There is no suggestion whatever that he has any special obligation towards the woman as distinct from the man.  But take a case of seduction where there has been no publicity of any kind, where, from the fact that they may have means or facilities of one kind or another, the matter has been kept entirely private.  The only way under the Act that I can see to get any remedy is to get the very publicity which they try to avoid.  The Minister says that this is not the clause for a division on party lines or anything of that kind.  Neither should it be, but there is a difficulty here, and I think between the amendment and the Minister's own view there ought to be accommodation.  If between now and the Report Stage there is put in the Minister's knowledge the kind of cases which he says do not exist, that ought to modify very considerably his action in relation to this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice a great deal is made of the suggestion that there is a value in publicity as a deterrent in this matter.  I would like to urge the opposite point of view, and to plead that for the sake of the public we should be careful not to establish the doctrine that publicity is a cure in matters of this kind.  I can visualise a state of affairs where the Press, which has already a sufficiently large appetite for this kind of news, will be encouraged to indulge still further in that appetite, and ordinary, inoffensive citizens will be deluged with all sorts of nauseating details which are of no benefit and to which they object.  I think some people are apt to make a sort of fetish of publicity in matters of this kind.  There is no virtue in publicity in itself. In so far as it is urged as a deterrent, it seems to me that the penalties inflicted by this Bill, if it becomes law, ought to be a sufficient deterrent and that publicity is a weapon which is apt to act in both ways.  I think that is one of the most objectionable results of a certain type of cheap Press that we have in the modern world, and so far from being a deterrent, you may very easily by the artificial publicity which you give to acts of this kind &mdash;by a kind of morbid suggestion&mdash; encourage such acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To my mind, a Bill of this kind will do much damage if it goes through in its present form.  Its chances of being effective will be lessened considerably and the chances that it may do actual harm instead of good will be increased. As far as I know, social workers, interested in this matter, are all in <Col N="201" /> favour of having such cases heard in camera.  They believe the interests of both persons&mdash;the injured and those against whom the charge is made&mdash;will be secured by having them heard in camera.  The only argument urged against that is the rather doctrinaire and visionary notion that publicity in itself has some virtue attached to it.  I think we should be very careful about that notion, and we should remember that while publicity may have these virtues in some respects, there are other respects in which it is as <Col N="202" /> much a disease and a danger as a virtue.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(1)  In the case of every affiliation order directing the payment of any money (other than in respect of the costs of such order) whether in one sum or periodically by the putative father of an illegitimate child such payment shall be made to the District Court Clerk or to such other public officer as the Justice of the District Court may with the approval of the Minister for Justice appoint to collect such money to be applied by such officer in such manner as the Justice shall from time to time by order direct.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is an attempt to prevent a person who has to pay an affiliation order paying it directly to the mother of the child.  It has been found by social workers that where that has been done in the past it has led to undesirable results. Quite recently a case came under my notice where, actually, the putative father had been paying money to the mother and, because of the fact of having to see the woman it led to a repetition of the offence.</P>

      <P>Yes, one that had been adjusted by lawyers on both sides. We suggest, as a substitute for that possibility, that the money must be collected by some court officer.  We hold an open mind upon the wording of the amendment.  If the Minister is prepared to accept the thing in principle we are quite willing that he should re-draft the amendment. We also hold an open mind as to who the officer should be who is to collect the money and pay it over. There is a further reason why that procedure should be as automatic as possible.  It is this: that if there is delay in making payment, or if the defendant does not pay the affiliation order then, according to the wording of the Bill as it is, it would be necessary for the mother or whoever the person is who is ordered to collect the money, to take proceedings in court, whereas according to the machinery that we suggest that should be done by the court.  If the money is not paid regularly into court, then automatically the matter would be dealt with by an official of the court.</P>

      <P>Under the Bill as it stands, a complete discretion is given to the District Justice. He can order that the sum of money which is to be paid shall be paid over in one sum or in weekly instalments, as the case may be, to the District Court Clerk, &ldquo;to be applied by him in such manner as the Justice shall from time to time by order or otherwise, direct for the purposes for which such money was so ordered to <Col N="205" /> be paid.&rdquo;  That power exists.  If the District Justice thinks in his discretion, or a Judge on appeal thinks in his discretion, that it is wiser that it should be paid not to the District Court clerk but to the mother of the child, or to whoever may be for the time being the guardian of the child, he can make such order.  He will make it to the District Court clerk, to the mother or the guardian of the child as the case may be.  I think it is wise that he should be left that discretion.</P>

      <P>Amendment 15, which is in my name, is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To insert at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where any such payment or any part thereof is in arrear for seven days, the collecting officer shall notify accordingly the person <Col N="207" /> who is entitled under the affiliation order to receive such payment. On the request in writing of the mother or other person entitled to recover payments under the affiliation order the collecting officer shall proceed on behalf of the mother or such other person against the putative father for recovery of the payments under the affiliation order, and all costs properly incurred in such proceedings shall be payable by the putative father.</P>
    <P>The object of my amendment is to obviate the necessity for those actions the Minister referred to.  It will make the collection of arrears automatic and it will also prevent association between the parties again, which would be very undesirable. These are the three main purposes of the amendment, which would replace amendment 14.</P>

If it is the District Court clerk, then he will have to take proceedings.  It is only the person to whom the money is payable who can say whether or not it has been paid.

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole principle of this Bill is contained in Section 2. As we believe it would be a disastrous thing for the Dáil to agree to, we want to remind the House of the principle which is involved in this Bill and the dangers inherent in it. If anyone, having heard our criticism of the Bill on the Second Reading Stage, took pains to read up the Constitution he would find that Article 62 is as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dail Eireann shall appoint a Comptroller and Auditor-General to act on behalf of the Irish Free State/Saorstát Eireann.  He shall control all disbursements and shall audit all accounts of moneys administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas and shall report to Dáil Eireann at stated periods to be determined by law.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, the Comptroller and Auditor-General in this case, if we pass this Bill, is not to be allowed to see the documents upon which the proper audit of the accounts of the Department of Defence depends.  He is going to be prevented from seeing any records showing the services rendered by the individual pensioners, whether the service had, in fact, been given in a military way, or the duration of the service.  If we come to the powers set out in the Bill to be given to the Department of Defence, there is no reason in the world why we should not in the future be asked to give similar powers to the Minister for Finance, to the President, to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health or to anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Bill we are definitely precluding the Comptroller and Auditor-General from seeing all the accounts which are necessary to enable him to make a proper audit.  In the future, some other Minister may have the impudence to come along and ask the Dáil to agree to pass his Estimates and pass his accounts without the Comptroller and Auditor-General going into them.  The principle of democratic Government would indicate that the Comptroller and Auditor-General has the right to see all accounts and audit them in a proper <Col N="212" /> manner.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General is not a creature of the Ministry, and he is not appointed by the Ministry.  He is appointed by the Dáil to look after the Ministry.  The Ministry do not furnish the funds which they handle.  The funds are provided by the people, and the people have appointed representatives who, in their turn, have appointed the Comptroller and Auditor-General to look after the disbursement of public funds by the Ministry.  And we, in this instance, give authority to the Pensions Board to pay out sums without being subject to the authority of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
    <P>Deputies who were present during the Second Reading Stage will remember that the Minister took very little trouble to reply to the allegations that were made, that the payment of these pensions was rather to provide future political services for Cumann na nGaedheal than to reward past military services.  In proof of that, the members of the Fianna Fáil Party produced evidence, as far as they were allowed to produce evidence under the ruling of An Ceann Comhairle.  However, without mentioning names&mdash;and they were precluded from mentioning names&mdash;they brought forward certain cases within their own knowledge showing that the persons who had been awarded pensions had not given the services required, or that they had not served during the prescribed period.  Deputy G. Boland mentioned one case of a man whom he discovered on the list of pensioners, drawing a pension for services during the Black and Tan War, and he proved from his own knowledge that this man gave no services at all during the Black and Tan War.  Deputies must remember also that it was almost impossible for the Finna Fáil Deputies to examine the cases adequately.</P>
    <P>A couple of years ago we asked for a list of the pensioners.  We pressed for that list, and all we got was a long list of names&mdash;just the names of the pensioners, the amounts received, but no further particulars whatsoever other than <Col N="213" /> the county in which the man resided. It was impossible for anyone who wanted to find out how public funds were spent to locate the pensioners. There are thousands of people of the same name in any county given in the list of pensions.  There were cases which Deputies located. Deputy Ward discovered some cases in his constituency where the pensioners did not receive their pensions until the period between the June and September elections, 1927.  We all know the delicate situation that existed in Monaghan as far as the Cumann na nGaedheal Party were concerned, between the June and September elections in 1927.  Ministers made no effort to prove that the giving of these pensions at that time had any relation to the position of the Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe) in the County Monaghan. I would like if the Ministers would give some explanation to the Dáil as to why if these men were entitled to pensions in 1927 they did not receive them four years previously? I would like to know why it took them until 1927, when the Minister for Finance was in a tight corner in Monaghan, to discover that these men were entitled to pensions?  It is a ridiculous thing to ask the Dáil to pass moneys which have been used by the Cumann na nGaedheal Party to secure their political power here in this country.  I hope the Dáil will have sense enough not to sanction such a proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>From what I have heard in the discussion and debate here and from different people through the country, there seems to be a prima facie case that in certain cases pensions have been awarded under circumstances in which they should not have been awarded.  That is my summing up of the position, and it is not in any sense a prejudiced opinion.  A particular case came to me with which, if it were in relation to anything else, I would be thoroughly dissatisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every case which was mentioned in the House seemed to me to be almost conclusive as an individual <Col N="214" /> instance of misuse.  I am not going to say what proportion of cases has been wrongly dealt with.  I have no means of knowing, but, having regard to the smallness of the amount of information which was in the hands of those who tried to check it, the number of individual doubtful cases that have been brought forward seem to me to throw doubt upon the whole procedure of the Commission or whatever it was that was set up.  In a case of that kind, where one wanted to form an honest judgment, where one had instances which on the face of them seemed to be wrong, one would naturally look back and ask what was the constitution of the court which decided these things.  For instance, if you found that the constitution of the court was itself prima facie good, if you found that the personnel of the court was one which obviously could claim a right to be regarded as judicial and impartial, then you would be inclined to modify the judgment which you would form on the particular instances that were put before you.  One would say:&mdash;&ldquo;Well, perhaps, having regard to the authority, the dignity and the impartiality of that court, we are entitled to assume that there were circumstances in relation to even those individual cases which might make us give them the benefit of the doubt.&rdquo;  One would want to have the number of instances of apparent miscarriage which were given multiplied, in order not merely to indict the procedure but to indict an obviously impartial court.  When, however, you find that the evidence and implications of individual instances are backed up by the actual composition of the court so that one would naturally expect from a court so composed such results, by exactly the same law as you would modify the implications of a number of individual instances when faced by an impartial board, you must multiply the effect of individual cases that are given by the lack of authority and the lack of impartiality of the court.  Does anyone suggest that the Chief Whip of a political party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the Board, however composed, is to be immune from the supervision or review of any possible court and is to be specifically immune from the supervision of the watch dog appointed under the Constitution for the purpose of reviewing the legality of payments made out of the Treasury of this State, I, for one, am not satisfied on the evidence which has been given that there has been even general acceptance by the reviewing authority of the principles under which the reviewing authority was told to act.  Now let us assume for one moment that, instead of this Bill being what it is, it was a Bill to assert the existence of a principle, in the absence of the acceptance of which this Bill ought never to have been introduced, let us assume for one moment that the particular clause with which we are dealing was the reverse and that it did say that the Auditor-General should examine these things and if he did examine them and did find evidence that an individual applicant to his knowledge in his statement of claim had claimed something which he knew to be false and out of which he had got benefit, then these individual beneficiaries would be liable to criminal prosecution.  If, further, the Auditor-General, on going through these things, found that to the knowledge of the court the evidence <Col N="216" /> on which those pensions were issued was false the members of the court themselves would be open to criminal prosecution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>From the evidence which has been produced to me individually, and from the evidence which has been produced in general to the House on individual cases.  I myself am satisfied that there has been gross abuse of this Pensions Act.  It is because I am satisfied that there has been gross abuse of this Pensions Act by whomsoever has grossly misused it, and because this Section 2 attempts to put out of the purview now or in future of any court in this country gross abuse of the finances of the State under that particular Act, that I am opposing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="217" /> If this Act passes for the duration of the present Dáil, however long it may be, not merely will these pensions be paid, not merely will the gross sum taken out of the country for the payment of these pensions be increased, but protection will be given to those who individually have grossly abused the procedure of this Act, from the criminal prosecutions to which I believe they are liable.  Not merely will it be for the duration of this Parliament, but for the total time which, under the Constitution, as revised, the Seanad can hold up the revision, which is inevitable, of this Act, when this Ministry comes to an end.  You have a period in my opinion of, roughly speaking, between three and four years assuming that the total powers of delay are used, in which the present expenditure under this heading, which in my opinion has been grossly abused, will be continued.</P>
    <P>The country cannot afford extravagance of this kind, and above all the people cannot afford corrupt abuses of this kind.  They would have to be a rich country, they would have to be a country with very much stronger traditions of honest administration of public funds, for public as distinct from party purposes, before they could put up with the discredit, the growing and cumulative discredit, that comes to them by the open continuance of financial abuses of this kind. I believe that in every case where men have served and suffered, where men have been disabled, where men's financial and other positions have been gravely injured by public service of this kind, that to the extent to which the community can afford to do so, it ought to come to their assistance, but because I believe that under the Army Pensions Bill these funds have been used for other purposes and because I believe that under this Bill machinery is set up to cover up and to continue that abuse, I ask the House to cut out of the Bill the operative section and, by so doing, destroy the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that on <Col N="218" /> this occasion we are going to have a repetition of the silence which actuated the Government on the Second Reading of the measure. Deputy Flinn has just pointed out that a very serious attack is being made in the second section of the Bill on the whole system of financial administration in this country.  It is the first occasion, I think, within the legislative history of this Dáil that an attempt has been made upon the prerogatives and the legislative power of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  Deputy Flinn, I think, is right in advising the House that a very serious precedent is being created.  Members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party cannot have it both ways.  They cannot go about the country talking about financial rectitude, keeping the standard and the credit of the country high, and urging the need for constitutional action when they, themselves, when it suits particular Party necessities and particular Party crises, take upon themselves to scrap the Constitution which we had understood they were pledged to defend against everybody and everything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no power in the Constitution of a modern State that is more fundamental than this power of the control of the purse.  If there is any safeguard at all for democracy and the people against an unjust or an unscrupulous Executive, it is that there are going to be safeguards in the Constitution which are going to prevent that Executive from having public funds used in a manner that was not contemplated by the Legislature.  It would obviously be impossible for the Dáil or any assembly to examine the financial transactions of the Government themselves, and we have set up, as part of our machinery and part of our Constitution, a particular officer who is charged with scrutinising all these transactions, with vouching them, and with certifying that they are in accordance with the law and with the intention of the assembly. If you remove that and decide that in particular cases the Comptroller and <Col N="219" /> Auditor-General is not going to have that power, you are setting a precedent, and a very unfortunate one, because you are showing the country that no matter how sacred or how fundamental to the administration and to the Constitution a particular cog of the machinery is, that can be upset, destroyed, and taken apart when it suits the present Executive. We know how our opponents talk about changing the Constitution, but then they attempt to change the Constitution in a manner which affects the people more perhaps than any other possible thing could affect them.  Because the Government is tied down and restricted in the expenditure of public moneys in the way that it is now, under the Constitution, the people have safeguards and controls.  In this particular instance, these things are going to be all removed.  If the Government have at this stage the temerity to ask the country and ask the Dáil to accept this, and to ask us to make an exception to the basis of all financial administration, I only wish they could have found a better case and made a better claim, made out better reasons and adduced better arguments than they have done.  Cases have been quoted, as the previous speakers have pointed out, and the Minister for Defence has not contradicted them, where pensions are being wrongfully paid, where they have been deliberately or unwittingly paid to persons who did not deserve them.  It is a matter of common knowledge that there are people receiving pensions who have not the service for which the Minister for Defence, or whoever is responsible, has given them credit.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the question whether the whole matter of these pensions should not be gone into with a view to seeing whether economies could not be effected, we have the position now, as Deputy Flinn said, that we are going to be absolutely committed to this expenditure for a further number of years, during the lifetime of this Dáil and perhaps for some years afterwards, even if there be a change of Government. <Col N="220" /> We are going to be committed to this expenditure, and still we are being told that we have control of expenditure.  We spend I do not know how many hundred hours every year discussing finance, trying to reduce costs, and so on, and here we have an Act which is going to commit us for a number of years to the full expenditure which is contemplated and which has been granted under this Military Pensions Scheme.  There is no Court of Appeal.  If the Government think, as they have so weakly urged, that the Comptroller and Auditor-General, who is good enough and is placed there under the Constitution to examine every other aspect and account in our national finances, is not good enough to do this particular work and that there are reasons why he should not do it, they might have given some alternative.  They might have come forward and suggested that there should be an appeal to some court, say the Supreme Court of the Dáil, but they are not alone treating the Dáil with contempt in placing this thing out of bounds for a number of years, but they are placing the Comptroller and Auditor-General himself in a dangerous position indeed.  If the House is going to tell him, in spite of his constitutional and legal powers, that he is not going to have the right to do this thing, it seems to me that that is opening the road to the present or any future Executive to come along and say, &ldquo;You were not allowed to examine the accounts for the Military Pensions, you were not allowed to examine the vouchers and dates of service, and so on, and we are going to see that in any other matter the Executive may choose to select you are not going to have that power either.&rdquo; No alternative has been suggested. No compromise has been suggested either.  The Ministry take it in this case, as in all other cases, that they have a sufficiently supine opinion in the country and a sufficiently pliable and large majority in this House to carry through any kind of legislation.</P>
    <P>I say what is sauce for the goose <Col N="221" /> is sauce for the gander, and you cannot continue the state of affairs that has been going on in this House since we entered.  You have tried to trample the Fianna Fáil party under foot, to make out that they were false to all the principles you ever heard of and at the same time that they were absolutely out against the Constitution.  You cannot take up that attitude and pretend on the other hand that you are out for peace and unity and all the rest of it in the country.  If the Government party are serious and recognise&mdash;I am sure some of them do&mdash;that there are genuine cases which ought to be examined and that no Executive ought to have power to place any payments outside the scope of this officer for so many years, I think they ought to assert themselves.  I think they ought to tell the Government that it is not right to say the party on this side are solely actuated by political prejudice against the men who are drawing pensions.  The basis on which these pensions are being granted is laid down in the statute.  All that is necessary is that it should be shown that they had service in the Republican Army and in the National Army for a certain period.  It ought to be possible, if the Government were really anxious to get at the bottom of this thing, to come to some decision which would enable the country to see that no effort is being made to hide this thing up, because if years pass and if in the future this legislation is revised or is abrogated it would be very much harder to get evidence than it is now.  Even as it is at present, if you have sufficient personal knowledge to say that a particular person who is drawing a pension did not occupy the position he is credited with in the old I.R.A., it is extremely difficult to get evidence.  The men of that body are broken up.  A great many of the men are out of the country.  Some of the pensioners themselves are out of the country. I think this is not treating the country as a real Constitutional Government should.  A Government that really stood for the will of the people and really wanted financial <Col N="222" /> rectitude should do the right thing in this matter towards the country. It should pay some attention, at any rate, to the claims made on this side of the House and the statement made about pensions being paid wrongly. Instead of that, the Government are going to preserve silence; they are going to try and get this piece of legislation through like so many other pieces.  Then when they have it through and secured a good number of their own supporters for many years to come in comfortable pensions, without any regard as to how other members of the community may look on it, they will treat us, I suppose, as they have treated us in the past few months, with all kinds of lectures as to how we ought to behave and act towards the Constitution. If they are really sincere let them give the example.  You may fool the country some of the time, but you are not going to do it all the time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to enter into the aspect which has been so well dealt with already, namely the manner in which the pensions have been paid.  I shall merely deal with certain arguments of a legal nature put up by the Government. It was argued strenuously by members of the Government that this court really constituted a judicial tribunal and, therefore, its findings should not be interfered with.  When we look to the authority of the Constitution, we find Article 69 lays down that &ldquo;all Judges shall be independent in the exercise of their functions, and subject only to the Constitution and the law.&rdquo;  If that is really their case, the proper method for them to have adopted would have been to have stated a case in the High Court and have carried it to the Supreme Court and have had nice lines drawn between Article 69 of the Constitution and Article 62.  Under Article 62 of the Constitution &ldquo;Dáil Eireann shall appoint a Comptroller and Auditor-General to act on behalf of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann).  He shall control all disbursements and shall audit all accounts <Col N="223" /> of moneys administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas and shall report to Dáil Eireann at stated periods to be determined by law.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly, it is possible that there was a doubt as to which of these two clauses holds good, first whether the tribunal is a judicial tribunal, and, if so, in the conflict which undoubtedly arises&mdash;it is a line-ball case&mdash;as to which of the two clauses should be upheld.  I think that was a very nice case, one certainly which a responsibly-minded Government would submit to their Judiciary if they had any respect for the law, for their Constitution, for that reverence which they want to have attached to the Constitution, which makes people feel that it is not going to be changed; that as between the Government and the citizen on questions of Constitutional law, the Constitution is there to protect everybody, and the judiciary is there to enforce the Constitution in favour of the weak against the strong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of stating that case, they come and put the case in this form to us.  They bluffed many of their own followers into supporting them by stating that case.  They do not go to the courts and get a decision either for or against.  Their alternative would be frankly, if they thought the case was going against them, or that they would not be likely to get the judgment which they would like before the Supreme Court, in other words, that the terms of Article 62 would prevail over the terms of Article 69, would be to introduce a Bill which frankly amended the Constitution.  At least, that would be the honest line.  They did not do that.  In mending their hand they do it by the backdoor method and pretend to one set of followers that it is really no amendment of the Constitution at all.  As a matter of fact, I am not quite certain whether they will amend their hands in the way they think, because I believe it is still open to question whether you can amend the Constitution <Col N="224" /> by implication.  I can really imagine a decision given by the Supreme Court that the Constitution must be upheld unless it is explicitly amended.  There is the mess.  Of course, it is a party matter, one in which not merely party sentiment is concerned, but in which party interests are deeply concerned.  We have already had evidence to show that.  Therefore, we cannot expect to get a fair review of these cases, and I regret very much that those Independent members of the House, for whom personally I have had considerable regard on questions where they felt that they could exercise influence, and get fair dealing, have in this matter been absolutely hopeless, by the way they are acting as ignominious tools of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to protest against the quaint allegation that was made by Deputy Derrig that members of this party have not spoken on this subject.  I have been in the House and I have heard a good deal of the debate and I would be almost inclined to reply by saying that the cost of printing what has been already spoken on the subject would be sufficient to pay at least one decent pension for a number of years.  I have heard speeches delivered at great length from both sides of the House and that the accusation of silence should be brought against this party seems to be most extraordinary.  It becomes clearer what the Constitutional position of the Fianna Fáil party is. Listening to Deputy Derrig's speech, and to what he said about the prerogative of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and about his legislative powers, one gets an idea of what the Fianna Fáil Party would have done, if they had a share in the formulating of the Constitution of this State.  They would have no Parliament at all.  They would have done away with judicial, legislative and executive authority, and substituted for the lot one great big Comptroller and Auditor-General whose function it would be to supervise everyone else.  The exaggerated <Col N="225" /> respect which the Fianna Fáil Party claim to have for the office of the Comptroller and Auditor-General really goes beyond the imagination. They want to put the Comptroller and Auditor-General in a position of absolute supremacy, higher even than the King himself in the Constitution. The Comptroller and Auditor-General does act as Deputy Little has been claiming he should do.  He is given power to audit the accounts of the State and he does audit them.  In respect to pensions, he gets the claims and the decisions and he has then to decide whether the pensions are paid as laid down. He has those powers and these are the only powers the Constitution give him.  He is not given the legislative powers and prerogatives by the Constitution that Deputy Derrig suggests.</P>

      <P>I think it will be within the knowledge of the Deputy that we have had a series of Acts, for the introduction of which a reason has been given; that is, specifically to remove doubts.  That being a recognised procedure we are entitled to ask, in the absence of such procedure, if this Bill is to remove a doubt.  There are a considerable number of precedents for introducing Bills to remove doubts. If this Bill does not contain that statement then we are entitled to assume that it is not to remove a doubt but to do what it sets out to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill to decide definitely a matter which was apparently in dispute, as has already been explained half-a-dozen times.  This Bill decides definitely that it shall not be the duty of the Comptroller and Auditor-General to scrutinise cases under the Act.  It is a Bill to do that, and in doing that it does not take away from any of the powers that the Comptroller and Auditor-General has under the Constitution.  I fail to understand what position the Fianna Fail Party wish to create.  If they wish to set up the Comptroller and Auditor-General as an authority to go into all the details in connection with all the pensions from the beginning, then what was the necessity to set up this tribunal at all?  Of course, the Fianna Fail Party were obsessed with another chimera at the time the tribunal was set up, the formula difficulty.  This whole matter was to be left to the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and I suppose he would be provided with an elaborate staff and machinery, much more elaborate than is provided for in this Bill.  This notion of turning the Comptroller and Auditor-General into a sort of uncrowned king and combined civil servant of the State is about the strangest I have ever heard in this House.</P>

We are told there was doubt.  We are not told in the Bill.  This is to give new powers to a Commission.  This is to restrict the existing power under the Constitution of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  If there was a doubt for two years, why was he obstructed?  Why did not the Government try it out?  Why did they not find out who was right&mdash; whether the watch-dog had a right or had not?

      <P>The Deputies who have spoken so far confined themselves, as far as I can make out, to two points (1) the question of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and (2) abuses under this Act.  The point as regards the Comptroller and Auditor-General was made abundantly clear to anybody who wanted to see what was obvious in the previous debate. I pointed out then that the original Act laid it down that on certain terms certain moneys were to be paid.  Moneys were to be paid to pensioners according to rank and term of service, and the Act laid it down that the time of service for that Act was the time of service declared in the certificate of the Board of Assessors.  All that comes into my hands is available to the Comptroller and Auditor-General; there has been no doubt about that at any time.  All that comes into the Minister for Finance's hands is available to the Comptroller and Auditor-General. We, who are called interested parties, are ready to hand over to the Comptroller and Auditor-General all that we have a right to have ourselves.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General, having no legal knowledge, misunderstood and thought he should have access to certain notes made, not under the Act, but for their own guidance by the members of the Board.  The Attorney-General advised us that not only was the Comptroller and Auditor-General not entitled, but neither was the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This question arose owing to his asking for certain notes of evidence kept for their own guidance by members of the Board.  I assume he would not have asked for them if he had not been under the misapprehension that he should get them.  The Attorney-General gave his advice, and that advice was made available to the members of the Public Accounts Committee.  The advice was:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only records of evidence to which either the Act or the Regulations refer are:&mdash;(a) the record of applications (Regulation 6); (b) the reports sent to the Minister for Defence.  Any other records of evidence tendered to the Board would really be in the nature of notes made by the Board for its own convenience, and need not be handed over by the Board. All that the Minister is entitled to under the Act is the report of the Board made upon consideration of the evidence.  Neither the Minister for Defence nor the Minister for Finance is entitled to demand the records of evidence in the possession of the Board.  He has by his regulation settled the form of the Report, and no reference is made therein to the evidence on which the Report is based.  It is submitted that the Minister is not prejudiced under Section 3 (6), as he can always request the Board to re-open their findings.  Of course, if the evidence has already been before them, they can decline to comply with the request. The Board under the Act was constituted by the Minister with the approval of the Executive Council and exercises judicial or quasi-judicial <Col N="232" /> functions.  The Act does not contemplate that either the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Finance should act as a court of appeal from the Board or a revising authority over the findings of the Board or the effect of the evidence heard by it.  If that were intended, the Act should have been framed differently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The case was perfectly obvious; there was talk of keeping things back from the Auditor-General which he ought to get, and that he should be able to audit the accounts.  An Act was passed showing that on certain certificates certain moneys should be paid.  We show to the Auditor-General the certificates on which they were paid, and he audits the payments; that is his end.  If the Comptroller and Auditor-General thought that we were withholding from him powers; if we were perfectly satisfied in our own minds, and if common sense and previous experience and intelligence indicated that we were taking the right line in so acting, if the Auditor-General thinks that line is wrong, or if he has a grievance about the matter, then obviously, as he is the aggrieved party, he is the person to take action in the court.  The Deputy opposite knows that if he owed me £10 he is not the person to go into court to decide on that point.  If I feel he owes me £10, my business is to take the proper course to get that money from him.</P>

It is not for the Comptroller and Auditor-General out of his own pocket to take the case to the court.</P>

      <P>They know also perfectly well&mdash;it is as clear to them as it is to us&mdash;that the proposal to make public the evidence, as I explained in the previous occasion, tendered before the Committee would be definitely against the interests of the State and definitely against the interest of the individuals who gave that evidence, whether on their own behalf or on behalf of other applicants. The third report of the Public Accounts Committee of 1926-27, published on 22nd November, 1928, states&mdash;and the Committee of Public Accounts are the controlling body over the Comptroller and Auditor-General&mdash;&ldquo;The Committee is satisfied with the determination to seek the decision of the Oireachtas in this matter.&rdquo;  The Committee of Public Accounts asked that this should be done, and we are proceeding to do it.  These things came out on a number of occasions, and on this question there never was any doubt, in my mind at any rate.  I handed over to the Comptroller and Auditor-General all that was available and all that I had a right to demand from anybody else.  But the Comptroller and Auditor-General wanted to get something from my Department which my Department does not posses and which, we are advised, we have no legal right <Col N="234" /> to demand; then we bring in this Bill to clear the matter up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, to clear up what the Public Accounts Committee wanted.  They say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Comptroller and Auditor-General as in two former years reports that his audit of certain military service pensions has been confined to an examination of the amount of pension awarded, based on reports of the Board of Assessors. The Committee of Public Accounts in its report dated 24th February, 1928, recommended that this position should be regularised and the present Committee concurs with this view.  Since the Committee began its work, the Minister for Finance has communicated a minute replying <i>inter alia</i> to the paragraph in question. He states that, in deference to the opinion of the Committee, proposals for legislation will be laid before the Oireachtas, and he states that the object of these proposals will be to establish that the data on which the Board of Assessors based its findings, shall not be, and shall be deemed never to have been subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor-General. The Committee is satisfied with this determination to seek a decision of the Oireachtas in this matter.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The necessity is &mdash;the Fianna Fail Party seems incapable of understanding it&mdash;ordinary courtesy.  The Public Accounts <Col N="235" /> Committee wanted this done and we are proceeding to do it.  One thing that I object to in this debate is that time and again assertions are made that proof has been adduced of irregularities in giving these pensions. Now, no one in this Dáil or outside it is more anxious to rectify cases of pensions given where they were not due than I am, and I have taken every possible means to get after such cases.  Some time last year, a Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party referred to such a case.  He told me he was in the position to prove that the recipient had not fulfilled the requirements.  I asked him to produce evidence, and he came along with documents from some people, and from these very documents I got sufficient evidence to show that the particular man was entitled to a pension.  The Deputy himself more or less agreed with me that the man was entitled to get his pension, although statements were made publicly that that man should not have got a pension.  Last June Deputy Ward asked certain questions about certain pensions, and he made certain statements about these cases.  I had these matters looked up. I do not pretend to carry everything in my head.  Yet without previous warning on the Second Reading debate, Deputy Ward got up and referred to Questions 21, 22, and so on, which he said he had asked.  I made a mistake in regard to the first one. He gave information in regard to it that more or less coincided with another case, and I said I had already dealt with that.  The Deputy went on to other cases.  He gave six cases in all.  As I was here in the House and had not the reference required at the moment to show exactly what were the details of the case, I asked the Deputy would he tell me if he gave information on a previous occasion such as he had given now, and he said I was merely trying to put him off his track.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In most of these pension cases, I admit I have no information whatever. A man applies to the Board for his pension, that application comes to the Board, the Board may <Col N="236" /> report to me that they have gone into his case and have ordered a pension for a period, or the Board may have refused a pension.  The man is notified.  He then re-applies with additional evidence and it comes on to them, so it is only by an accident that I have any information whatever about the matter.  But coming to the case of Deputy Ward, what was the case he made here?  He alleged that men were getting pensions that not only were they not due to get, but that they were getting them solely in the personal interests of a member of this Government.  Take Question No. 21.  I do not pretend to know a great deal about this case. The Deputy got up and said he could prove these men should not have got the pensions they were getting. Deputies Flinn, Aiken and Derrig got up and made a case not directly but by way of innuendo.  It was a crude case, and the word &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; was used with regard to it.  Certain scurrilous organs have printed as proof statements that Deputy Ward chose to make.  Deputy Ward quoted the case of No. 21.  He said:</P>
    <P>This man was courtmartialled and dismissed from the Irish Republican Army early in 1922.  He never served in the Free State Army in his life, not one hour&mdash; neither did his brother, for that matter, and he also has a pension. I would like to know from the Minister what steps he has taken since the 13th June to ascertain the accuracy or otherwise of the allegations which I made regarding this man's position and his claim for a pension.  He certainly has not asked me about it, nor has he asked my assistance in establishing whether this man was entitled to a pension.  He knows that I would have first-hand knowledge by reason of the position which I held at that time.</P>
    <P>I do not consider that if anybody likes to get up and make accusations that it is my business to go after him. It is the duty of any ordinary citizen who has evidence to prove that a man is drawing a pension that he should not be drawing to come forward <Col N="237" /> and give that evidence.  There is no need for Fianna Fáil Deputies to get up here and try to prejudge a case against an unfortunate man who may be getting a pension which he is justly entitled to.</P>

      <P>A thing may be quite all right in itself, but when pilloried in the newspapers it is a different matter.  Deputies know perfectly well that to wear a bowler hat is an innocent thing, but to call after a man in the street that he is wearing a bowler hat is an attempt to pillory the unfortunate man. The Deputy got up in the middle of the debate, rattled off things, and <Col N="238" /> wanted to know what was being done.  When he spoke of Case 21, I thought he was speaking about Case 22.  I said it was not denied that he was dismissed from the Volunteers. I was wrong in stating that.  I confused Case 21 with Case 22.  The case was sprung on me without notice.  In this case the O/C of the division and the colonel, who was the man's battalion commandant, both informed me he was never courtmartialled.  He was reduced. This man, I believe, was a particularly good fighter when fighting was on.  When it came to peace time, when Deputy Ward, for instance, was showing very good form, this man had not much use for the mere training business.  He was not dismissed from the Volunteers according to the information that I have.  On the one side we have the evidence of the O/C of the division and of this man's battalion commandant that he was never dismissed from the Volunteers.  On the other hand, we have the statement of Deputy Ward, who had a much less distinguished military career and less knowledge in the matter, getting up and stating that this man was dismissed from the Volunteers. On question 22, the Deputy stated that the man had been dismissed from the Volunteers.  He was right in that, but it is interesting to notice that he did not mention that he was reinstated in the Volunteers.  The man is not being paid a pension for the period during which he was outside the Volunteers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I think it was before the Four Courts.  He was reinstated while Deputy Ward was still around, but I am not sure of that. The Deputy referred to one of six cases in Monaghan town.  He said he would undertake to prove that this man was not entitled to a pension. What is the proof?  This is the proof <Col N="239" /> that Deputies opposite swallow and are prepared to damn a man's character on&mdash;&ldquo;is in receipt of a pension, period of service based on so-and-so.&rdquo; That is all the proof the Deputy gave that the man was drawing a pension illegally.  He merely states that this man is drawing a pension, and asserts that his statement was sufficient proof that the man is drawing a pension illegally. What do I know about this man?  I happen to know the man through a divisional commandant who was divisional O/C. in this area.  He was particularly interested in this man. When there was no award at first the O/C. of the area took the case up again.  He gave me a most emphatic declaration of the value of the services of this man referred to in Question 23.  I am assured by others who were not exactly on the spot but were associated with that area, very well known fighting men in the district, that during the Black and Tan times this man gave splendid service. I am told, moreover, that if anyone goes to the town of Monaghan and asks there who gave the best pre-Truce service, whether it was this man in Question 23 or Deputy Ward, the answer unanimously given would be that it was this man, No. 23.</P>

      <P>If this man had such a splendid record and was recommended by his divisional O/C., by the Battalion Commandant, and all the rest, why did he not get a pension until 1927?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ward, for instance, referred to a man of splendid service who did not get a pension.  He said he did not get a pension simply because he was not a supporter of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  This man was notified on the 5/5/'26 of the Board's decision disallowing his claim. He appealed against the decision, but he did not produce any evidence purporting to be additional to that which he had given to the Board originally.  Although he was asked to give such additional evidence in letters from the Department dated <Col N="240" /> the 21st June, 1926, the 13th July, 1926, and the 22nd February, 1927, he failed to produce any evidence that purported to be additional. That is the reason that the man he says who gave such splendid service did not get a pension.  Often through stupidity and one thing and another men did not put their cases properly.  This man was given every opportunity to produce additional evidence, and he did not produce it. It happened in many cases that the people with the best services, pre-Truce, did not give sufficient evidence. In many cases people who gave the best services in their districts were not awarded pensions on their original applications.  They appealed and were told additional evidence was required.  Sometimes they only sent in the same evidence again.  We wrote back saying this evidence is not additional.  Finally, when the bait of the pension was before them, they did get sufficient additional evidence to go before the Board.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ward is pretty wrong about things occasionally. One case he told us about was that of a man who was violently opposed to Cumann na nGaedheal in March or April, 1927, I do not pretend to have information about all the cases he mentioned.  Deputy Ward stated in regard to case No. 26: &ldquo;I happen to know this man was a public representative.  I happen <Col N="241" /> to know that he was particularly hostile to the Minister for Finance in April or May, 1927.  He had applied time and again to the Board of Assessors and the Board of Assessors turned him down because he was not entitled.&rdquo;  As far as I can make out the Board of Assessors granted a pension on his first application on 1st January, 1927.  Once the Board had granted it the delay in giving the pension was only contingent upon the time necessary to make certain inquiries as to whether the man was ineligible for it by reason of having been sentenced to a term of imprisonment. The man had the pension granted to him on the 7th January. If he was violently antagonistic to Cumann na nGaedheal Party in the May or April after that January, there was no action of the Government or the Pensions Board that was calculated to change his point of view.  If he were violently antagonistic in April or May he was violently antagonistic with full knowledge that the Board had granted him his pension.</P>

      <P>That was the decision of the Board.  After that we had no power to alter it.  The man was certificated as due for a pension in January.  The suggestion was that this man was violently hostile in April or May and that the Government took action to buy his support by granting him a pension. The Deputy knows that unless the man was sentenced to a term of six months' imprisonment there was no power to withhold the pension from him after 7th January.  The suggestion that he was bought over is a thoroughly dishonest one.</P>

      <P>On the occasion of the Second Reading debate references were made to this.  Three members of the Fianna Fáil Party got up and made bald and incorrect statements.  Deputy Ward referred to these cases as proved cases because he stated the men were drawing pensions to which they were not entitled. Deputies opposite not only implied but stated that this was done not merely by the dishonest act of the applicant but of the Board.  I have been most anxious to get at any cases of pensions that are being drawn and that should not be drawn. Any case that has come up here I have looked into with the amount of information at my disposal.  Deputies opposite have time and again said that the majority of people drawing pensions were not entitled to them. One would think from the suggestions made that if one looked into it it would be found there are cases of buying people over, or that people were receiving pensions on the strength of statements that were patently untrue.  On the contrary, in every case I had any information about and was able to look into, the information was such as assured me that the man drawing a pension was well entitled to it.  Deputies opposite, <Col N="243" /> and especially Deputy Ward, appear to be particularly anxious to delude the public into thinking that their desire was to save the public purse. In this case the Divisional O/C and the Battalion Commandant was better able to speak than Deputy Ward.</P>
      <P>There is one case in which I should be very glad to have the Deputy's assistance; it is the case of a man who is being paid for two full-time jobs for the same period, a man drawing £25 per month as full-time M.O. in Monaghan.  During the same period he was drawing for one part of the time £5 per week, and for another part of the time £8 per week as liaison officer.  That is a case which Deputy Ward would be in a much better position to give me information about than any person I have in the Army.  The man I refer to is F.C. Ward.  I am most anxious to get after people who are drawing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I apologise for doing that, but I felt strongly in regard to certain cases.  As far as the information that was in my hands was concerned, it satisfied me that there was a greater proof that the men were due to get a pension than the mere statements of Deputy Ward. These statements were not merely made here but they were published in newspapers outside.  It is most unfair to men to have statements made about them and to have it asserted, merely because a Deputy states it, that they are getting pensions dishonestly, and to have that subsequently broadcast.  This thing was repeated during the debate on Section 2, and, because of my position, I necessarily felt called upon to give the information which I had at my disposal.

      <P>The Minister has come to the House and said that some considerable time ago the Government were advised that the attitude of the Board of Assessors in withholding certain files from the Comptroller and Auditor-General was correct.  If the advice given was correct&mdash;that is, that the Board of Assessors were right&mdash;what is the reason for this Bill?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, what is the reason for this section of the Bill. If they were rightly advised that their attitude was correct, why are they now bringing in this Bill?  In order to indemnify themselves, we suggest, against the illegality of which they have been guilty during the past three years.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General is an officer of this House, directly responsible to this House and not responsible to the Government.  He is responsible through this House to the people of this State for discharging certain functions and examining certain documents.  There is a similar officer who acts in a similar capacity in regard to the British House of Commons.  Long experience has shown that for the proper discharge of his duty it is essential that he should have recourse to all documents, whether secret or confidential, which he, in his unfettered judgment, thinks right and necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the office of the Comptroller and Auditor-General was instituted in this State under the Act of 1923, it was laid down that he should exercise here and enjoy here the <Col N="251" /> same rights and privileges as were already enjoyed by the Comptroller and Auditor-General in regard to the British financial administration. That is the point at issue.  This officer was appointed by this House and given these very full powers. Between him and an officer of the Government a dispute has arisen and in order that the Comptroller and Auditor-General may be deprived of the rights vested in him by the Constitution and by the Comptroller and Auditor-General Act, Section 2 of this Bill has been introduced.  The point I want to make&mdash;and I want to make it not to this House because I know that is useless but to the people of this country&mdash;is that if this section is carried it will be carried by the votes of certain Deputies in this House who are personally interested in withholding from the Comptroller and Auditor-General papers and documents which he wants to see in order to discharge his duties properly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies sitting in this House have a perfect right to vote.  The Deputy has no right to say that they have a personal interest in withholding documents and papers from anybody. That is purely a personal implication by Deputy MacEntee and it is absolutely wrong.  To say that Deputies have an interest in withholding documents from any particular officer is to make an improper personal imputation.</P>

      <P>There is more than the rules of order involved in this.  Rules of order are based upon the rules which people observe in their ordinary relations. The Deputy has no right to state that there are in this House Deputies who have a personal interest in keeping documents from the Comptroller and Auditor-General or from anybody else.  The implication is clear. It is for the Deputy to withdraw if <Col N="252" /> he is so minded, but I will not allow him to repeat the statement.</P>

      <P>I should, however, say that if I were in their position I should certainly have great hesitation in voting in a matter of this sort on account of the misunderstandings to which it might give rise.  Having said so much, I am inclined to look at this from a non-party point of view.  I feel that about it at any rate.  We have not reached finality in our political development here. We do not know what the exact future of this country is going to be. But there is one thing that we do know&mdash;that the things that are done now will be held up later here as financial standards to be adhered to. If we are lax in our financial administration now, if we show that we are not going to be meticulously careful with regard to the expenditure of public money, I have no doubt that the future of this country is going to be an unhappy one.  The Minister and the Executive Council know very well what the general feeling of the people of this country is in regard to this measure and in regard to the working of the Pensions Act.  They cannot disguise from themselves what is the general feeling in the country in regard to this measure and these pensions as well.  They create a certain impression abroad as to the financial rectitude of the Government's administration here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>All that is in this section is a declaration that a particular tribunal shall declare what military service is and that that declaration shall not be reviewable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  The point we have to meet here is that the reason why the Government desire that these declarations are not to be reviewable is that they are declarations which cannot stand review <Col N="253" /> and cannot stand examination and that therefore the Government have used a certain statute of the State in order to procure for themselves political support in the country, that under the aegis of the Pensions Act they are creating a political slush fund.  That is what is being said here and what is being said throughout the country.  It is what, I believe, will be conveyed abroad and the primary reason for that is the action of the Government in this matter.  The Government in a few months, we understand, are going to borrow money.  Do they think that those to whom they will have recourse for that money will lend it more readily if they believe, as the action of the Government in introducing this section must make them believe, that the Government misuse public money in order to secure political support?  That is one of the consequences of the Bill and it is going to make the loan which the Minister for Finance proposes to float this year, or within a short period, a much more expensive transaction to the country than it would be if this section of the Bill had not been introduced.  I know, of course, that in appealing to the Minister one is only appealing to deaf ears.  The Minister and his party are already committed to that course and nothing will prevent them from following it.  They are determined to remain in power and to use all the resources of the State, financial, military and police, to maintain that power.  Therefore our exhortations and warnings go unheeded but one day or another a day of reckoning will come and, when it does come, let Ministers and those who are drawing pensions, and who will continue to draw pensions possibly when this Bill goes through, have no false sense of security and let them be under no delusions that this measure is going to form part of the permanent legislation of this State.</P>

He stated to-day that in regard to the person referred to in Question 21 on 13th June, 1928, that this man was never courtmartialled, that he consulted with the O.C. of the division and the Battalion Commandant and ascertained that this was either a concoction by me or that I was misinformed.

      <P>It is a wonder to me, considering all the time which the Minister had at his disposal to make up his brief and to reply to the case which I put forward on Second Reading, that he did not find something to say in regard to Question No. 24 which was discussed on Second Reading. I stated here that the man mentioned in that case never served in the Free State Army.  He lives in the town of Monaghan and I do not think that he could have served in the Free State Army unknown to the people there.  He is in receipt of a pension and I say quite definitely that he is not legally entitled to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite prepared to prove it if I get an opportunity. It is because things like that are <Col N="256" /> happening and have happened that the Comptroller and Auditor-General ought to be allowed to see some of the evidence on which some of these pensions have been awarded.  The Minister carefully evaded Question No. 25, which dealt with the case of a man who was in the wholetime employment of a public body in Monaghan, who was in that employment during the whole of the Anglo-Irish war, who was never absent an hour from his work during that time, who was on full pay all the time, and who never was absent an hour from his work during the Civil War.  Yet, apparently, he gave military service in both these wars that entitled him to a pension.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not given any explanation of that case, and I do not think that he will.  I stated that I would cite as many cases as the Minister was prepared to deal with of people who are not entitled to draw pensions in Monaghan, and I have been as good as my word.  To my own knowledge fully 60 per cent. of the people there who are getting pensions for political services are not entitled to them according to the terms of the Military Service Pensions Act.  That is the reason why I want to see that the Comptroller and Auditor-General will be allowed to see the evidence on which these pensions are based.  I stated previously that a sum of £368,000 had already been paid in gratuities to officers who retired from the Free State Army since 1924.  That is a fairly large sum of money.  These men have been pensioned according to rank and period of service, but how are we to know that they have held the rank attributed to them and that they have given the service in the Army which it is alleged they have given?  I think that the Comptroller and Auditor-General should be allowed to see how that sum of £368,000 came to be expended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy say what was produced before the Board of Assessors?  He talks of a document which only came into existence after the Board ceased to exist, and he complains, in view of that document, that the action of the Board was wrong.  I have never pretended, in dealing with these cases, that there may not be people who are getting pensions illegally.  I think it is practically impossible, when you are dealing with such a large number of cases, not to find a flaw somewhere.  What I have pointed out is that people get up in the Dáil and purport to make statements that certain persons are drawing pensions to which they are not entitled, and when I look up these cases I see that, so far as I have any information about them, that information is contrary to the information given across the Dáil.  In these circumstances I have nothing to do except to leave the matter where it is until Deputies come along with something more substantial.  Deputy Dr. Ward expects us to accept his statement when he says that a certain individual never served in the Free State Army, but without wishing to reflect on Deputy Dr. Ward in any way, I think he will agree that certain officers were in a better position to know the circumstances than he was.  When these officers have given their assurance, there is no prima facie case which would justify me in reopening the case and in having that man charged in court with getting a pension illegally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy said I did not speak in reference to the case mentioned in Question 24.  He goes on to say that this man only got a pension for Party purposes.  Now, when he was speaking on the Second Reading of this Bill he said: &ldquo;It looks as if everybody was spying on us&rdquo; and I asked him had he given in this case, such information as he would be in a position to give in the case of 21 <Col N="259" /> and 22.  He did not give any such information.  He did not answer the question.  He said he put these questions down on the 13th of last June and drew my attention to certain facts.  He further said: &ldquo;Considering that I have been available since if he wanted any information or to make any inquiry into these cases he could easily have got it.&rdquo;  What facts did he give?  None.  He came along, having mentioned the case, with no facts to support him in June and on 5th December made the statement that this man was never in the Free State Army.  That was the first time he mentioned it.  He had not even said it on the previous occasion. Why did he not mention these facts on that occasion if he wanted to have the case re-opened?  In this case, the Board only made one report and they granted him a certificate.  If the Deputy has information, which is in the nature of evidence, to prove that the man is not due to get a pension it is his duty as an ordinary citizen without my approaching him, to produce that evidence.  Instead of that, on the 5th December he got up and asked why I hadn't dealt with the case since June and said for the first time that the man was never in the Army.  The fact that Deputy Ward says that he was not, is not going to be accepted by me as full proof that the man is getting a pension dishonestly.  The Deputy gets up in his airy way and insinuates that there is something wrong in the majority of cases but the Minister cannot accept that only as proof.</P>
    <P>He also complained about another man and says he can prove that the man was never in the service because he carried on his own employment.  I do not know a great deal about that case but, I think as far as I remember, that the Board granted the pension, on the first application.  There was no representation made thereafter. I know many cases of men who apparently, and very necessarily apparently, carried on their ordinary employment all through and at the same time were giving very real service. I do not know whether it is a <Col N="260" /> case of that sort but it is not proof to say that the man gave no service because he carried on his own employment. The Deputy will remember that on the Second Reading Deputy MacEntee quoted a very truncated and unessential part of a case before the Public Accounts Committee and I pointed out that the man got a pension quite rightly, although at the time of the injury it looked as if he were pursuing his ordinary employment.</P>

      <P>I had made most of the speech I intended to make when the Minister interrupted me the last time.  I thought he was going to clear up the question of Mr. A. in Killeevan who has given such service, as was suggested by General O'Duffy.  He disappointed me in that.  He did not clear up that question. This certificate was, he says, issued a considerable time after the operations of the Board of Assessors had been terminated.  That is inaccurate. This actual certificate bears the date of the 8th May, but the substance of this certificate was before the Board of Assessors.  As I mentioned here on the Second Reading, I discussed this particular case with a member of the Board of Assessors, and he told me that this man's pre-Truce service was not such as would entitle him to a pension.  Now that in itself is proof of my contention that these pensions are being awarded for political services, and it proves the necessity of the Comptroller and Auditor-General seeing the evidence.  If that man was not entitled to a pension on his pre-Truce service, as I said on the Second Reading, there is no man in Monaghan who was.  The evidence was before the Board of Assessors, and they turned him down for political and no other reasons.</P>

      <P>I have some remarks to make concerning this section.  I intend to confine my remarks to the section.  This section has been introduced into this Bill for the purpose of ensuring that the proceedings of the Board of Assessors appointed under the Military Service Pensions Act shall be shrouded in secrecy for all time.  The Minister must be aware that the operation of that particular Act has occasioned a considerable volume of suspicion throughout the country.  The existence of that suspicion was made clear on the debate which took place in this Dáil.  The suspicion has been mainly due to the fact that the Minister for Defence and the Executive Council have been at all times anxious to conceal the decisions of the Board of Assessors and the awards given by the Board of Assessors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>At no time was any publicity given to the awards of the Board.  When a Deputy asked for information from the Minister as to the names of persons in receipt of pensions that information was given to him in the most complicated manner which human ingenuity could devise.  The Minister may make what defence he likes when <Col N="264" /> this matter is raised in the Dáil, but he cannot possibly convince any reasonable person that he has not got in his Department an alphabetical list of the persons in receipt of military service pensions, with their full names and addresses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy show me how that arises under Section 2?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this section is to provide that the findings of the Board of Assessors shall be final and conclusive and binding on all persons.  I am speaking against the passage of this section.  I think it is good policy that the findings of the Board of Assessors should not be final and conclusive.  I say that the passage of this section will only help to increase the suspicion which exists concerning the operations of the Military Service Pensions Act.  I say that the passage of this section, particularly when the Government are advised by their legal adviser that it is not necessary, will tend to have that effect.  The Minister here has, in the course of his speech, made various statements concerning the Government's attitude to these pensions. He said they were not anxious to conceal the identity of the pensioners but that they were only anxious to prevent publicity being given to the evidence upon which the pensions were awarded and that is why they are trying to make doubly sure that there will be no obligation to publish that evidence by the insertion of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that the Minister has in the past put himself to considerable trouble in his efforts to prevent publicity being given to the identity of the pensioners.  He may or may not have in his Department that alphabetical list to which I refer.  I believe he must have it or else his Department must not be efficiently managed.  Yet, when information concerning these pensioners was asked for, a list was published of names only without addresses, in every order, so that it would not be possible for any person outside the Minister's Department to identify <Col N="265" /> any persons given on the list.  The Minister in the course of his remarks a few moments ago said that the publication of the full names and addresses might injure the persons concerned.  I cannot follow that argument at all.  Surely the Minister is not contending that it is a disgraceful thing to be awarded a Military Service Pension.  I cannot imagine anyone in the Minister's position holding that view.  If that is not the implication of the Minister's remarks, I would be glad to know what he intended to imply. The Act implies that pensions should be awarded in respect of the rank, period and length of service given in the Irish Volunteers or the associated forces.  If the Government are prepared to publish the names of the pensioners, why are they not also prepared to publish the rank in respect of which the pension was given and the length of service?  Surely no injury could be done to anybody by publishing full lists of pensioners with their addresses, rank and length of service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that. I said that I was not prepared to deny that nobody was drawing them illegally.  I think it is humanly probable that there are people doing so. I could not say that I knew there were people drawing them illegally, as if I knew there were such people I would take proceedings immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister at least admits the possibility of persons receiving these pensions illegally.  He asks Deputies to make available for <Col N="266" /> him any evidence concerning such illegal conduct.  How can any Deputies make it available unless they are in a position to identify the persons in receipt of a pension?  If the Minister wants to make doubly sure that no one will get a pension unless he is entitled to it under the Act, then it is in his own interests, in the interests of the public, and of the pensioners, to give the name, the address, the rank and the period of service.  No injury can be done to anyone.  The Minister's argument, that it would adversely affect the interests of the pensioner, does not hold water.  On the Second Reading, the possibility of injury being done to persons resident outside this State was mentioned, but the fact that they are in receipt of pensions was already published.  Those who might be prepared to take action against the interests of those pensioners know that they are in receipt of such pensions, and know that they must have had some period of service and held some rank in the Irish Volunteers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole operations of the Military Service Pensions Act have been shrouded in secrecy, and consequently shrouded in suspicion as well.  The passing of this section will only help to increase that suspicion.  The Minister read for us the opinion submitted by the Attorney-General on the question as to whether or not the Comptroller and Auditor-General was entitled to demand the papers on which such awards were made.  According to the legal adviser of the Government, the Comptroller and Auditor-General has not got that right.  If the Attorney-General was right in his opinion, there is no need for this section.  The introduction of the section implied either that the Government have not got full confidence in the opinion of the Attorney-General, or else they are prepared to admit that they have been acting in an illegal manner up to this.  If this section is not necessary its introduction is unwise, because it helps to increase the suspicion that attaches to the operations of the Military Service Pensions <Col N="267" /> Act.  If it is necessary, then it is for the Government to come here and say that in withholding this information from the Comptroller and Auditor-General in the past they have been acting contrary to the letter of the Constitution.  They are trying to have it both ways.  They are trying to pretend that they acted legally in the past, while, at the same time, they are trying to secure the passage of this section through the Dáil.  If this section is not necessary, this debate can be terminated now, to the gratification of everyone present, by an announcement from the Minister that he is prepared to withdraw the section.  He should surely have no hesitation about it.  The Dáil thanks the Ministry for its act of courtesy in introducing it.  It is permitted to take the intention for the deed and to withdraw it again. It is only an act of courtesy according to the Minister, and yet this act of courtesy has given rise to most unseemly scenes in the Dáil.  I admit it is a bit of a shock to some of us that the Government should be courteous in anything, but now that we have the statement from the Minister, that the section is only introduced as an act of courtesy he can withdraw it, and we are quite prepared to give him credit for the best intentions.  The discussion will then be over and the suspicion created by the introduction of the section will be removed.  That will be to the benefit of the Government, to the benefit of the pensioners, and no one else.  In this matter it is not necessary to make doubly sure, as the Minister stated.  Either the legal opinion offered by the Attorney-General is correct or it is not.  If they are satisfied it is correct, that ends the matter.  If they are satisfied it is wrong, then someone is to blame for the illegal practices that were permitted to take place hitherto.  I suggest, however, that we can end this dispute now by the Minister withdrawing the section, and I ask him to do so.</P>

      <P>There is one point I wish to have made clear.  When <Col N="268" /> dealing with one case where Deputy Ward stated that a man had never been in the Free State Army, the Minister replied that it might not be known to everyone in Monaghan that he was in the Army, or words to that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood Deputy Ward to say that the man had never been in the Free State Army, and that the Minister replied that he could be there without people knowing it.  The conclusion I draw is that he could have been on secret service.  I want to ask the Minister if a person who remained in civil employment, even though he was acting on the intelligence side, and in that way was, I suppose, of use to the Army, is entitled to a pension. Surely the Minister is not going to stand over giving a pension to such a man even though he was on their staff.  I fail to see how it could be given.  If that is not the case what other service could such a man give? I would like the Minister to explain that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to get some information from the Minister.  The Minister stated that he is prepared to look into cases that were mentioned to him, and that he is prepared to give every assistance to Deputies, so that they may discover these cases for themselves.  Some time ago I looked for information from the Minister regarding pensions in my constituency.  I got a list which showed that so and so had pensions of £50, £60 or £70 yearly, as the case might be, and that these people were from Cork.  Cork is a very big county.  I think I have laid my finger on a few particular cases in which parties are in receipt of pensions that they are not entitled to.  In order to make sure, I want the addresses from the Minister. What I want from the Minister is that in reply to a question I asked him, he should give the names and addresses of the pensioners.  I think the Minister is not acting fairly to <Col N="269" /> this House when, in addition to refusing to supply information to the Comptroller and Auditor-General, he also refuses to supply full information to Deputies.  I think every Deputy is entitled to information when he asks a question.  When we asked a question as to the names and addresses of men in our constituency who are drawing pensions, we did not want just the names and the information that they resided in Cork. &ldquo;Jack McCarthy of Cork&rdquo; might come from North, East, West, or South Cork or Cork City.  It would be very hard to know where he was from.  It is very hard for us to get the information. Is the Minister prepared to give that information now&mdash;to supply the names and addresses of those pensioners?  If he is not, then I think the duty of every Deputy is to pass a vote of no confidence in the Minister and put him out of office.</P>
      <P>A refusal to supply that information means that the Minister is attempting to cloak these perjurers. Information has been given to us in such a manner that no man could find out who, for instance, is the Jack McCarthy who is drawing a pension.  That is unjust and unfair. I should also like an explanation from the Minister as to why it is that men who were sworn into the I.R.A. by the Minister for Finance in 1914, who served until 1921, and engaged in several ambushes, as was borne out by the statement given by their Brigade O/C, and who joined the National Army for a couple of years, were then put out without pensions. The individuals I am dealing with were put out on account of the famous mutiny, for which other gentlemen in this House are drawing pensions.  Is it fair that the ringleaders should get pensions and that their dupes should be put out without any?  If we get full information we shall be satisfied, but if the Minister refuses the information we can only take it that he is trying to cloak these perjurers, and, if he is, there is only one cure for it, and that is to get rid of him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing this Bill for two reasons; primarily because <Col N="270" /> I believe that the country cannot afford to pay all the pensions awarded within the last few years, and, secondly, because I believe that the Comptroller and Auditor-General should have access to all the papers and persons whenever pensions are being considered or have been awarded.  If there were a review of the whole pension list it might mean that some pensions might be increased, but in the vast majority of cases they might be reduced, if not abolished altogether.  I believe that we should have some sense of proportion in matters of that kind.  Let us examine what other countries do, countries which admittedly are far richer and bigger in every way than this country.  I am one of those who do not want to proclaim to the world that we are a poverty-stricken country, that we are not able to do anything off our own bat.  We prefer to say that the country is what we ourselves are able to make of it, and can make it, if we have the will.  Let us see what another country does. Let us take one of the richest countries in the world&mdash;Great Britain. Many men who went through the great European war and lost limbs in that campaign&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We know of cases in Cork City and County where persons who are entitled to pensions have not got them.  That is, perhaps, a side of the picture which might appeal to the Minister for Defence.  On examining these cases we find that in the main the dependents of many of these young men who lost their lives in the Anglo-Irish war&mdash;some of them were university graduates&mdash;have not received anything in the way of recognition for the services these young men gave to the country.  That is a matter which requires further investigation.</P>

I should like to point out that in a number of places in this country certain names are very numerous.  In Donegal there are two predominant names&mdash;O'Donnell and O'Doherty. In Glengevlin most of the people are called McGovern.  In Fermanagh a large number of people are called Maguire.  These are the areas with which I had to deal during the <Col N="272" /> Black and Tan war and it would puzzle me to know whether or not a &ldquo;John Doherty of Donegal&rdquo; was the John Doherty that was in the Volunteers.  There might be fifty or a hundred or two hundred John Dohertys.  It is not helpful to me. I might have known one John Doherty, who was either a private or an officer in the I.R.A., and who gave distinguished services during that period, but how can I say whether or not that John Doherty is the man who has been granted the pension?  If I were asked as that man's O/C, how can I say whether that John Doherty deserved a pension or whether he did not?</P>

      <P>It ill behoves the Minister to speak in the manner he did in reference to Deputy Ward, when he said that it was during the period of the Truce that Deputy Ward was most active.  If the Minister wants to know anything about me he may say it sotto voce or sub rosa or whatever way he likes but there are Ministers on his own benches who know what I was, and the area I was in charge of, also.  He does not, but it ill behoves him to talk about anybody.  He is one of the men who lives in a glasshouse and cannot throw stones.  He certainly cannot throw any at me.  I should like to know what distinguished service he put in in the I.R.A.  It was not under Section 2.  In this connection we are asked to give carte blanche to the Government to freeze everything that has been done, to solidify it and to make it absolutely watertight if you like, that nobody in the future can come along and say that this is right or wrong.  Everything that is done by these gentlemen must be taken as gospel, but we have pointed out that those things done by them are not gospel and we do not accept them as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It happened that in the working of this Military Service Pensions Act, <Col N="273" /> when a man made an application he had to give the names of two officers who would vouch for the accuracy of the statement he made in putting in his application.  If the Minister knows anything about the matter he will know this, that it happened in certain instances that the only officers that the applicants could get to put into their applications for pensions were perhaps of the National Army, and the men making application had never been in the National Army and were more or less, perhaps, opposed to the Government. Their applications, perhaps, were turned down because the officers would not vouch for the accuracy of the statements made; perhaps they may have been prejudiced. How do we know that they filled in the forms sent to them and vouched for the accuracy of the men's statement, as they were bound to do.  We had no means of knowing that; neither has the Accountant and Auditor-General, and he never will have that knowledge until he has access to every bit of documentary evidence that can be produced in each case.  My knowledge of these cases goes as far that I know these were men who were afraid to make applications, because they knew that the only men capable of giving information on their particular case were members of the National Army and would turn their application down, and would not, at least, vouch for the accuracy of their statements, or perhaps when they made applications these forms were cast into the wastepaper basket by the officers, with the results that men who might have been entitled to pensions never received them.  What we want to know is this: Is there going to be any means by which the Comptroller and Auditor-General can find out whether a man is entitled to the pension he is getting or not?  Is there any means by which an ordinary man in the street, or a man who took part in the I.R.A. movement can ascertain whether a certain man, say, called John Doherty, is a man who served in the Volunteers.  Give us his name and address and we will be able to find <Col N="274" /> out.  The Minister said hardship would accrue if a man's name and address were given.  I say no, because if a man was a soldier of the I.R.A., or in the National Army, and was entitled to a pension because of wounds or disease he should not be ashamed to have his name and address published.  If it is legitimate and above board it should be an honour to that man to have his name and address published and not a hardship.</P>

      <P>What the President could not say if he tried, and tried hard.  I want to revert to the question I put to the Minister a while ago.  I think it contains the kernel of the whole position and situation. I asked him definitely in the case where an applicant for a pension was turned down, and where the applicant had new evidence to adduce had the Board of Assessors to ask the Minister for leave to release the files for a re-hearing of the case, and if that was contingent upon what the Minister said that everything in his Department was available for the Accountant and Auditor-General.  In this case the Minister had to release the files for the Board of Assessors.  If he did not, then, where are the files?  They may not be directly in charge of the Minister, but who are they in charge of?</P>

      <P>I said most of the things that I wanted to say in previous speeches that I made on this section.  Deputy Little and other Deputies on his side have talked about doubt in the minds of people. We cannot legislate to remove doubt from everybody's mind.  Deputy Lemass is concerned that people should be suspicious about anything the Government does.  We cannot help it.  I feel that nobody could be more annoyed than Deputy Lemass to know that when I go on the Continent to see my family and come back again certain organs talk about my mysterious movements in London. When two Ministers are on the closest and most intimate terms certain organs say that the meetings of the Executive Council are made lively by the fighting that takes place.  No legislation will prevent people who like thinking these things from thinking them.  Deputy Hogan kept on saying and asserting that the files had to be released for the Minister for Finance when additional evidence was required.  Of course, that is complete balderdash.  We do not hold the files.  The files belong to the Board.  As long as the Board was in existence it held them, and when it ceased to exist it handed them over and they were put in the strong room.</P>

      <P>We do not hold the files.  Deputy Lemass and Deputy Corry talked about this question of names and addresses.  Deputy Lemass maintained that we had alphabetical lists.  When questions were asked for a complete list of the names of everyone receiving pensions, I told the officials in my Department to get it ready.  They were busy at the time, and produced it in the form most convenient to them. <Col N="278" /> The case is argued on the other side in this way: Deputy Lemass says it is ridiculous for me to ask them to give information of any type of cases, as how could they give information when they do not know who the pensioners are.  He derided the suggestion that anybody living outside the State could be adversely affected by the publication of the names.  Is ample information to be given to anybody who wants to injure an individual who is outside the country so as to make him perfectly sure of his man?  Deputies know perfectly well, in seven cases out of ten, when looking up the list for a particular district, who the people receiving pensions are.  If you take a list, the vast majority of the people in a locality know exactly &ldquo;who's who.&rdquo;  Deputy Corry has some grievance.  I presume he was referring to the cases mentioned in columns 2153-2154.  We were unable to get the details of the cases.  If Deputies, publicly in the Dáil or privately, ask me if a Mr. A.B. in Donegal or some place else who is drawing a pension of £70 is the actual Mr. A.B. of a particular townland or district, they get the answer either that he is or is not. That has happened time and again. Deputy Corry is not quite sure whether a man in Midleton who is drawing a pension is the A.B. on that list.  To get such information he has only to ask whether that is the A.B. of such a place and he will get an answer whether he is or not.</P>

      <P>Deputies asked for lists in all sorts of permutations and combinations alphabetically arranged, and so on.  We gave a list that involved a good deal of work in my Department.  Any Deputy when he got the list could form a good idea as to who is getting a pension. Deputy Lemass is very concerned about the suspicion attaching to the <Col N="279" /> Government in this matter.  He says it is only brought in as a matter of courtesy, and he asks us to withdraw the section.  I would not see a great deal of objection to withdrawing it, once I had the assurance that the question of the evidence being made available would not arise again.  I know Deputy Lemass's manner well enough to know that once the thing is withdrawn he will be the first to sow suspicions in people's minds, and say after all was it not quite right it should be made available.  Deputy Boland wanted to know about the possibility of a man being in the Army and doing his ordinary work at the same time.</P>

      <P>I understood the Minister to say, in dealing with Deputy Ward's case, that a man could have remained at his ordinary civil occupation and yet be entitled to a pension.

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Army in its early stages, as the Deputy knows, men were not formally attested, and membership of the Army was not as clearly defined as if it were limited to people formally attested.  In the Army it was quite possible for a man to appear to be carrying on his ordinary work while fulfilling the legal requirements of membership of the national forces.  I am not making <Col N="280" /> a legal pronouncement on that, but I think it is easily possible.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is putting a hypothetical case to me.  I do not want to interpret the law.  I think it was possible for a man who to all appearance was following his ordinary avocation to fulfil the requirements of membership of the National Forces.  In the discussion on this section I have been accused of being out of order in departing from the section.  The only reason I called the attention of the Chair to the fact that Deputy Anthony was not confining himself to this Bill but was talking about other Bills was because I thought when it came to answering him I would not be able to deal with the matters he discussed, or if I did his confrere, Deputy Hogan, or some other Deputy, would get up and make reference to the Government habit of talking away from the point under discussion.</P>

We say that the Title of the Bill should be &ldquo;An Act to amend the Constitution.&rdquo; I think that the Dáil should hold that the Constitution should not be amended by implication. Undoubtedly, anybody reading the Constitution and then reading this <Col N="283" /> Bill will say that the Bill is actually an amendment of the Constitution. Article 62 of the Constitution, I think, says that the Comptroller and Auditor-General shall have control of all disbursements and shall audit all accounts of moneys administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas, and shall report to the Dáil at certain periods to be determined by law.  If this Bill is passed and approved by both Houses, the Comptroller and Auditor-General shall not exercise the functions which he is entitled to carry out under Article 62 and the functions which it is his duty to carry out under Article 62.  He cannot audit the account, and therefore he cannot report to the Dáil in the manner provided as to the disbursements of all public moneys.  The Bill is undoubtedly an amendment of the Constitution, and the Title of the Bill should make some reference to that. The Bill should be entitled an Act to amend Article 62 of the Constitution so as to curtail the powers given to the Comptroller and Auditor-General under that Article. For that reason we object to the title of the Bill.</P>

      <P>When listening to the case in favour of this Bill we heard it openly declared that this was not an amendment of the Constitution, but we had the case made that it is an amendment of the Constitution. If you turn, for the sake of argument, to the Bill and suppose, for the sake of argument, that this Board is vested with all the virtues of a judicial tribunal, and that is putting it very high, rather higher than intended, then it would come under Section 69, which sets out that the judges shall be independent in the exercise of their functions and subject only to the Constitution and to the law.  The judges there are subject to the Constitution. Therefore this must be subject to Article 62.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>In this sense&mdash;I am arguing that this is a tribunal, that its powers are judicial powers, and, therefore, independent of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  Article 69 lays it down that the judges are independent, but that they are subject to the Constitution.  But Article 62 lays it down that the Comptroller and Auditor-General must deal with all questions of money paid out through the Oireachtas.  My point is this, that a question of law is really in doubt.  There are two contentions. One is that this is an amendment of the Constitution, and another that it is not an amendment of the Constitution.  I suggest that the Title should, in some shape or form, confirm that it is or is not an amendment of the Constitution or that should be stated in the body of the Bill itself.  There should be something stating that it is an amendment, because otherwise it leaves things exactly as they were before.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="293" /> The object of this amendment is to bring all the pork trade into the one half year.  The pork season starts about October and it ends in April.  Consequently there would be no overlapping in the matter of computing the amount of the fees for any one half year.  So far as pork is concerned, all the fees will be payable between October and April, and there will be a dead six months between April and October.  If the months of January and July are left in the Bill it will mean that you will have one couple of months of the pork trade in one half year, and another couple in the other half year.  I think the Minister might see his way to agree to the amendment for the sake of convenience, as it will make it easier for his own staff to compute the amount of the number of carcasses sent away during the pork season.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that it is agreed that this amendment will make no difference in the amount of fees that are to be paid.  Deputy O'Hanlon's point is that as the Bill stands fees will not have to be paid, as far as pork is concerned, partly in one half year and partly in another, but that the total will be the same, and that the Deputy is advocating the amendment on the ground of convenience?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>From that point of view the first thing to be said is that if we change these dates now we will have to make a large number of consequential amendments in the Bill. The second is, that from the point of view of mutton and beef these dates are more suitable.  The mutton trade begins about the 1st of July.  From the point of view of the Department's staff&mdash;this is going to be a very heavy Bill, it will take a lot of administration and a lot of officers will have to be appointed&mdash;we regard it as a distinct advantage that the year should commence on a date like this, so that for the first three or four months we will be only asked to deal with mutton.  Pork will not come in until later, so that we will <Col N="294" /> be able to bring the Bill into operation gradually.  It is a distinct inconvenience from the point of view of administering the Bill to have the year commencing on the 1st of July. We will commence with beef and mutton, and when we come to October the pork season will begin.  By that time the machinery for administering the Bill will be fairly efficient and we will be able to go on to control pork, so that we will bring the Bill into operation gradually.  It is really no disadvantage to the pork man, who will not register his premises until October for the first year. He will pay from October to January and again from January to April, and in the long run it will make no difference.  So that for these three reasons: (1) it entails a large number of consequential amendments; (2) it is more convenient for the Department to administer the Bill; and (3) for other reasons I would ask the Deputies to leave it as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not regard it as a matter of importance, but having regard to the fact that pork is the principal thing in the Bill, and that the pork export is bigger than the mutton export, I think we should begin with the large end. There is another aspect.  The exporters will be able to give a complete return once a year.  That is to say, the return made in April will cover the whole year, whereas under the other arrangement you would be making two divisions, and the return you would have would be nothing between April and October. There would be a nil report.  I do not want to push the amendment if the Minister thinks it more convenient for his Department, but I think it would be more convenient for the pork exporter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be willing to admit it, but there is very little in it, and I am advised by the staff that it is a distinct advantage to begin control of dead meat with a product like mutton, where there is not a large quantity.  We want to have the administrative machinery in order before the important exports <Col N="295" /> of pork come on in October.  I put it to the Deputy that essential point, if it should be altered at all, should be altered in the early stages of Committee.  We are committed twice in this Bill, and if it is to be changed now it will entail a large number of consequential amendments in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Now, it was pointed out that a number of firms who export pork do their own crating, and this would prevent them from crating on their premises, which was not intended. To meet that, the above amendment was to be inserted.  That was to make it clear that the only premises to be registered were crating premises exclusively, business premises where no other business is carried on.</P>

      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in this Bill as it stands to compel anyone who crates pork on his own premises to register it as a crating premises.  The only proprietor who must register the premises as a crating premises is a proprietor who crates exclusively and does nothing else on the premises.  Therefore, a man who kills pigs and exports pork and still crates them is under no necessity to apply for a crating licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the legal effect of this, but it does not appear clear to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are always at cross purposes on this particular point.  Remember the Deputy and myself are on the same point.  We want to make sure that your bacon factory may crate its own pork on its own premises.  Is not that the Deputy's object?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Is that the object of the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, according to the draftsman I think it is clear enough. Section 5 deals with the registers which must be kept.  Only the registers specified in this section must be kept.  What are they?  The Minister shall cause to be kept (a) a register of cattle slaughtering premises; (b) a register of pig slaughtering premises; (c) a register of sheep slaughtering premises; (d) a register of herse slaughtering premises; (e) a register of goat slaughtering premises; and (f) a register of crating premises, of premises in Saorstát Eireann in which the business of crating for export pork, mutton and lamb or any of them, and no other business is carried on.  Clearly, <Col N="297" /> therefore, the only crating premises that must be registered is a premises where the crating of pork exclusively and no other business must be carried on.  That is the draftsman's argument, and I think it is clear that he is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is clear in the Bill.  It says &ldquo;a register (to be called and known as the register of crating premises)...in which the business of trading for export ...is carried on.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>And no other business. That is my amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was inclined to agree with Deputy O'Hanlon that the effect of this amendment would be the direct opposite of what the Minister has explained, and I think there will be an amount of misunderstanding. I was wondering whether the Minister would insert a few words in (b) on the Report Stage to show that the register of pig slaughtering premises would include crating.  He could put in &ldquo;and crating.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>An amendment would show that it would include crating. I would say, without having any special knowledge of drafting, that it is a rather dangerous thing to do. If in certain parts of the Bill you add a qualifying phrase to say that something is included, you may have reactions and interpretations in other parts of the Bill that you do not appreciate.  All I can say is that we agree in what we want to do.  I put that danger to the draftsman and it is his view, and I may say it is my view as a layman, that it is abundantly clear that in this our purpose is being carried out.  Let Deputies read it for themselves. Nothing in law except what is passed here.  When this Bill passes, Section 5 will be law.  Section 5 is not law now, and you need not register. It sets out what premises are to be registered&mdash;inter alia premises used for creating exclusively, where no other business is carried on.  Other crating premises will be in the same <Col N="298" /> position after the passing of the Bill as they were before.  That seems clear.  If there is any doubt, Deputies should consult a lawyer.  I am absolutely clear, and so is the draftsman, and I would not like to agree to the Deputy's suggestion, to add words, as they might have reactions we do not anticipate.</P>

Business could not be done on these lines.  All the lawyers are agreed&mdash;and I have no vested interests in the matter&mdash;that this meets the point.

      <P>The following amendments stood on the paper:</P>
      <P>13.  In pages 8 and 9 to delete Section 12 (1) to 12 (8), inclusive, and substitute ten new sub-sections as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  On every application for an exporter's licence there shall be paid to the Minister by the applicant a deposit of fifteen pounds returnable to the applicant if his application is refused, and the payment of such deposit shall be a condition precedent to the grant of such licence, and upon the grant of such licence the said deposit shall be retained by the Minister and applied in accordance with this section.</P>
      <P>(2)  Every person who holds or has held an exporter's licence shall, for every half-year during which or any part of which he held one or more exporter's licences, pay to the Minister&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  where such person so held either one exporter's licence only or two or more such licences all granted in respect of the same registered slaughtering premises, a fee (in this Act referred to as an exporter's half-yearly fee) computed according to the rules in the Schedule to this Act, or</P>
      <P>(b)  where such person so held two or more exporter's licences and such licences were not all granted in respect of the same registered slaughtering premises, a fee (in this Act included in the expression &ldquo;exporter's half-yearly fee&rdquo;) computed as aforesaid for each registered slaughtering premises in respect of which any one or more of such licences was or were granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="303" /> (3)  Every deposit paid under sub-section (1) of this section by an applicant for an exporter's licence shall be allowed as a payment on account of the first exporter's half-yearly fee payable by such applicant after the grant of such licence in respect of the registered slaughtering premises in respect of which such licence is granted, and if such deposit or deposits is or are greater than such fee, the difference shall be allowed as a payment on account of the next exporter's half-yearly fee payable by such applicant in respect of the same registered slaughtering premises.</P>
    <P>(4)  As soon as may be after the expiration of every half-year the Minister shall ascertain, in respect of every person who during the whole or any part of such half-year held one or more exporter's licences, the amount of the exporter's half-yearly fee or of each of such fees payable by such person for such half-year.</P>
    <P>(5)  Where all the exporter's licences held by a person in respect of the same registered slaughtering premises are revoked by the Minister under this Act, the exporter's half-yearly fee payable by such person in respect of such premises for the half-year then current, shall, if the Minister so directs, be ascertained immediately upon such revocation and not under the foregoing sub-section.</P>
    <P>(6)  Where an exporter's licence is held by two or more persons in succession during a half-year, such licence shall, for the purposes of this section and the Schedule to this Act, be deemed to have been held during the whole of such half-year by the person who last holds the same during such half-year and not to have been held by any other person at any time during such half-year.</P>
    <P>(7)  When and so soon as the amount of any exporter's half-yearly <Col N="304" /> fee has been ascertained under the foregoing provisions of this section, the Minister shall, unless the whole of such fee is discharged by a deposit or deposits required by this section to be allowed as a payment on account thereof, issue a certificate (in this section referred to as a certificate of indebtedness) in the prescribed form certifying the half-year for which such fee is payable, the person by whom and the registered slaughtering premises in respect of which such fee is payable, and the amount of such fee or (where the circumstances so require) the amount payable in respect of such fee after deducting from such fee such sum as is required by this section to be allowed as a payment on account thereof.</P>
    <P>(8)  Every certificate of indebtedness shall be conclusive evidence of all matters purported to be certified therein and any document purporting to be a certificate of indebtedness issued under this section shall, on production thereof in any proceedings to recover the amount thereby certified to be payable, be deemed until the contrary is proved to be a certificate of indebtedness duly issued under this section and shall be admitted in evidence accordingly.</P>
    <P>(9)  As soon as may be after the issue of a certificate of indebtedness, a copy thereof shall be served by post on the person thereby certified as liable to pay the fee the subject thereof and immediately upon such service the amount certified by such certificate as payable by such person shall become and be payable by such person to the Minister and shall, after the expiration of four weeks from such service, be recoverable by the Minister as a civil debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>(10)  If a person who is a licensed exporter fails or neglects to pay the amount certified by a certificate of indebtedness to be payable by him within four weeks <Col N="305" /> after the service of a copy of such certificate on him, the Minister may revoke the exporter's licence or all the exporter's licences held by such person in respect of the registered slaughtering premises in relation to which such amount is payable, but such revocation shall not relieve such person from liability to pay the said amount.&rdquo;&mdash;(Mr. Hogan.)</P>
    <P>14.  In page 8, line 46, Section 12 (1), to delete all words from and including the words &ldquo;on account of the payment&rdquo; to the end of the section and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;or licences on account of the payment of the first yearly registration fee payable in respect of such licence or licences under this section a deposit of ten pounds and the payment of such deposit shall be a condition precedent to the granting of such licence or licences.</P>

    <P>(3)  There shall be paid to the Minister every year by every licensed exporter the sum of twenty-five pounds as a registration fee.&rdquo;&mdash;(Dr. Ryan.)</P>

      <P>There is only one other point dealt with in the amendment of Deputy Ryan and I do not understand it.  It is clause 3.  My point is this.  If I take Deputy Ryan's amendment, Deputy O'Hanlon's amendment and my own amendment, namely, the new section, Deputy Ryan's and Deputy O'Hanlon's amendments only modify the particular relevant portion of my new section to this extent, that Deputy Ryan suggests £10 and Deputy O'Hanlon £12 10s., instead of £15 in my new section.  In addition to that change, there is another change I gather contained in clause 3 of Deputy Ryan's amendment which I do not understand, because the registration fee as I know it is £1.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>You will have to refer to the schedule to some extent to make it clear.  If the Minister's new section were carried and if the schedule were also carried, there would be a capitation fee and a minimum fee of £25 for all licences, except pork or beef, in which case it would be £50.  There are also provisions about making the minimum smaller in cases of combined registration. If my amendment were carried there would be no schedule, but the person would pay £25 as a registration fee.  That is all he would pay, no matter how many licences he had applied for or got. £25 would be the total he would have to pay each year.  That is what I meant my amendment to convey, and I believe it conveys that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue between us is this: I propose, first of all, that there shall be minimum fees; secondly, that the normal fees shall be so much per head and that these fees shall be payable, both the minimum fee and the normal fee, in respect of every export item&mdash;beef, mutton, or pork.  The Deputy proposes that there shall be one fee for all exporters and that it shall cover all exports; that the fee shall be £25; in other words, a fee of £25 for any exporter of pork, a fee of £25 for any exporter of goat's flesh or horse flesh, or of mutton or beef; and that there shall be a fee of £25 for the export of all three.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the issue.  All <Col N="308" /> that that would mean is this: First of all it is unscientific; it does not make the punishment fit the crime. A very big exporter&mdash;I shall mention no names&mdash;who is doing one-fourth or one-eighth of the trade of the whole country would pay no more and no less than the small exporter and vice versa.  And in addition to that the exporter who is exporting two or three items say pork, mutton and beef would pay exactly the same as the exporter who is exporting only pork.  There is no relation between the amount paid and the amount of meat exported.  It must be assumed for the sake of debate that the Bill is going to bring about some improvement in prices for the exporter, otherwise the Bill should be rejected on Second Reading.  If that is so, undoubtedly the exporter who is doing the biggest trade will get far the biggest benefit and will only pay exactly the same as the smaller man. Who will find the difference?  The taxpayer.  If we confine this to a minimum of £25, the taxpayer will be called upon to find at least 5/6ths of the cost of this Bill.  Is that fair or is there any sound reason for it? Either the Bill is sound in its main principles or it is not.  If it effects the purposes which it proposes to effect&mdash;that is to say, if it sees to the control of dead meat leaving this country, if it ensures that no bad dead meat can leave the country but that on the contrary fresh meat shall be of standard quality, if it effects that purpose and that intention, then undoubtedly it will put good money into the pockets of the people in the business at the present moment.  Is it fair in that state of affairs to ask them to pay only 1/6th of the cost of the Bill and to ask the taxpayers to pay 5/6ths?  I do not think it is.  That is the issue as between the people and the trade, the exporters themselves. There is the same issue as between any two exporters.  Is it fair to ask the exporter who is only exporting X cwts. of dead meat to pay exactly the same figure as the exporter who exports 50 times X?&mdash; It is not.  There is only one way to deal with it and that is the sliding scale and to see that a particular <Col N="309" /> businessman is making some payment which has some relation to the benefits he is getting under the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to clear up the points in which the amendments conflict, I think the first question that would require to be put is: &ldquo;In pages 8 and 9 to delete Section 12 (1) to 12 (8) inclusive.&rdquo; That question, I assume, will be agreed to.  The next point for decision is what is to be the amount of the deposit&mdash;whether it should be £15 or £12 10s.  If there is agreement on that point, the amendment can be made now.  The next point is as to what the scheme will be.  On that we would consider the Minister's amendment, that the whole ten new sub-sections, as amended, in respect of the deposit stand, and on that question discuss amendments 13 and 14.  That would meet Deputy O'Hanlon's point on amendment 15.  Does the Minister agree to the figure £12 10s. 0d.?</P>

      <P>We must decide the amount of the deposit first.  Is it agreed to delete sub-sections (1) to (8)?  It is agreed.  Then next we come to the question of £15 in the proposed new section, and I shall allow Deputy O'Hanlon to move that the amount be £12 10s. od.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>That hangs on another point.  The only minimum in the Bill refers to pork.  In the original Bill the Minister had power to revoke a licence to pork exporters who do not export 3,000 carcases in a year.  In Committee that was reduced to 1,000.  My £12 10s. 0d. is really the fee on 1,000.  I agree with Deputy Ryan that there should be no fee except capitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand, but that is the beginning and end of it so far as my amendment is concerned. It is deposited as security. Even though an exporter only exported 800 carcases, he still would have to pay £12 10s. 0d., and if he <Col N="310" /> did export more he paid so much more at the rate of three pence per head.  If he is a beef exporter or a mutton exporter, there is no revoking of licence if he does not export anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not arise on this section at all.  We will come to that later.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Minister referred to the fact that the goat flesh exporters and others would have to pay the same as the pork exporter. They are not in the same category, which makes it extremely difficult to deal with the Bill as it is. I do not know what statistics there are of goat and horse flesh exporters, but they must be very small.  I think it is wrong to bring these into a fresh meat Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Deputy Ryan's plea for a £25 registration fee to cover the whole amount to be paid by people licensed to export meat.  I think the Minister was rather unhappy in his reference to making the punishment fit the crime.  I think we should try and <Col N="311" /> make the reward fit the virtue.  The Minister talked of making the punishment cover the crime of exporting. We believe that those who export more dead meat than their fellows should have the greater reward.</P>
      <P>Most of the things that we export are exported in an unmanufactured form.  The slaughtering and packing of animals give employment. In the future we hope that the offals left over will be manufactured in this country.  We should reward, if we can, the people who engage in the dead meat packing industry in Ireland, reward them as against the people who export the raw material &mdash;live stock, fat cattle, pigs, and so on.  I think that £25 is a fair fee for the Ministry to get for the registration of premises.  It will repay them for the amount of money they will have to spend in examining dead meat of all descriptions, and of putting the mark on it.  The taxpayers as a whole will benefit by the employment given in the treatment, as far as we can do it, of our agricultural products here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out to the Minister that there would be a certain amount of trouble and expense saved if the exporters were not asked to keep an account of the number of animals slaughtered.  If that is insisted on there will be a good deal of expense in the matter of book-keeping in the case of the exporters, and also of the Department which will have to engage officials to make out proper bills to send to the exporters.  You will probably have two or three civil servants engaged on checking the numbers and sending out bills to the exporters, while as regards the exporters, it will mean that each of them will have to pay a special clerk to keep an account of the numbers.  I think that what we ought to say to the exporters is that they need not keep an account of the numbers slaughtered for export, that all they need do is to pay the yearly fee of £25.  If this Bill is a good Bill, which we expect it is, <Col N="312" /> then I agree with the Minister that the exporters will eventually benefit by getting a better price than they are getting at present, when Irish meat comes to get a better name on the foreign markets.  For the first few years, I do not say that the exporters are going to benefit.  I do not want to go into all the arguments that we used on the Second Reading of the Bill, but it was then pointed out that the exporters of dead meat are in a very difficult position, that they are trying to compete against the exporters of livestock and find it hard to do that.  As a matter of fact, we know that certain dead meat factories have closed down in the last few years and that others can barely exist.  I fear that the fact of putting a large levy on them, in the shape of this minimum fee, may be the means of closing those that are finding it so hard to carry on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true, as the Minister has said, that under this amendment the small exporter will have to pay as much as the very large exporter.  At any rate, under the amendment the small exporter will derive a considerable benefit.  The difference to the small exporter between £25 and £75, which will be the usual fee paid by the small exporter dealing in pork and lamb, will be very considerable.  It means a difference of £50.  The difference to the large exporter between this £25 and what he may have to pay under the Minister's amendment &mdash;he will have to pay perhaps £400 or £500&mdash;will, of course, be very considerable, but in view of his revenue it will make very little difference to the large exporter.  I suppose we cannot deprive him of it.  Personally I would prefer, if I could, to draft an amendment the effect of which would be to give a larger benefit to the small exporters than to the big. We have put in an amendment naming the sum of £25 as the fee for a licence for export.  I believe that is just a nominal fee.  I think that even in the case of the small exporter it is not exorbitant, but I think that at the same time, in the beginning at any rate, it is as much as they can afford to pay.  In two or three years' <Col N="313" /> time, when the factories are benefiting to the extent that we hope they will benefit under the Bill, then I think will be the time to come along and to put on larger fees.</P>

Anyone who has any idea of engaging in the industry in the future should, for a few years at least, get all the help that can possibly be given to them.

      <P>It is not very clear that they are going to benefit directly for some time.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to encourage more meat factories at all. My point of view is to have less of them and a much bigger trade.  The Deputy is wrong in thinking that there are no meat factories in the country.  This Bill deals largely with pork.  The Bill is for the benefit of the trade and not for the benefit of the people who export.  If the intention of the Bill is carried out better prices will go to the exporters and they should be asked to pay a reasonable proportion of the cost.  They should be asked to pay, at any rate, far more than the general taxpayer, who will benefit only in a small, indirect way.  The point is that the people who get direct benefit from this Bill should be asked to pay a big proportion of the cost.  What the Deputy is seeking is that the taxpayer should pay directly all the cost, whereas my proposal is that the people who are going to benefit directly should pay a big proportion of it.</P>

      <P>The Minister says, and rightly so, that the most important thing in the Bill is the pork export. My object is that the fee should be as low as possible.  When the Bill becomes operative only the well-equipped slaughtering houses will benefit.  The higher the fees are the greater the likelihood there is of excluding people from entering into the pork export business.  I can conceive a set of circumstances under the Bill under which you are stereotyping the big men engaged in the pork export trade.  I can see the export of pork falling every year by reason of the number of exporters being so few, and the difficulties of the farmers in getting their pigs to the slaughter houses.  What is likely to happen is that they will give up the pork trade altogether, and turn again to the vicious system of selling their pigs alive, not knowing exactly the value they are getting.  It should be made easy for those who intend to start in the export business.  I agree with Deputy Ryan that you should not put a blister on those who are getting the privilege of a monopoly, but you should not make it difficult for those who are going to start in the business.  Taking my own area, for instance, in the County Cavan, there would be three engaged in the business.  When you take a county forty miles long and the pigs have to be brought to three centres for export, it will be found that the vast majority of the pig raisers will not sell their pigs for the London market as dead pork, but will sell the heavy ones for bacon curing.  In that way they would not be turning in their money as quickly. The Minister declared on the Second Reading that he favoured monopoly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>We are concerned in this way, that we do not like the prospect of driving any man out of business.  There are some small men in the business, very admirable and ambitious men, and their industry is in great favour locally.  They would probably develop into big men as exporters if they had the capital.  So far as their capital enables them they are carrying on a sound business and getting a good reputation for their products.  I think it would be a <Col N="317" /> serious thing if the passing of this Bill would so increase their expenses that they would be driven out of business.  I am sure the Minister hardly desires that.  I have been assured by one man that a minimum fee of £50 would be a very serious matter for him.  He has a very good reputation in the trade, and the farmers of the district look to his industry as a thing that will probably develop and bring some hope to their village.  We must remember that this business has been tried on a very big scale and has failed.  It has been tried in probably the best premises that could be constructed and with very big capital at its back.</P>

      <P>So far as the ordinary Deputy is concerned, it was tried on a big scale, and with all that elaborate machinery the Minister seems to desire in such a factory, that is, with managers, splendid slaughtering machinery, and all that <Col N="318" /> sort of thing.  If the industry has not succeeded on these lines might there not be some hope in the smaller concerns, where the persons who manage the business would be the persons owning it and taking a direct personal interest in it?  I am sorry to see the Minister adopting such an obstinate attitude, for if the Bill goes through in the form he proposes I can assure him it will cause a good deal of discontent, and a good deal of resentment towards all parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like a ruling from the Chair as to whether amendment 16 is in order. This is a Bill to make provision for the regulation of the export of fresh meat and offals with a view to improving the general standard thereof, and for that purpose to make provision for the registration and control of premises used for the slaughter of animals or for the preparation and packing of fresh meat and offals intended for export, the licensing of persons engaged in exporting fresh meat and offals and the examination and certification of fresh meat and offals intended for export, to make provision for the proper packing of dead rabbits and dead poultry intended for export, and for other matters incidental to the matters aforesaid.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposes that when the animals intended for slaughter are purchased by weight it shall be the duty of every registered proprietor of every registered slaughtering premises to allow the person or a representative of the person from whom an animal is purchased to be present at the weighing machine when the animal is weighed.

      <P>No; three or four will be combined.  This amendment of the section is absolutely necessary to protect the men whom the Minister for Agriculture wants to knock out of the trade altogether.  These are the producers of the meat.  The effect of this Bill will be that when the producer takes his pig or his pork to the slaughter-house he is going to be told &ldquo;it is not what you ask but what we are prepared to give.  We have decided that this is going to be the price in the Twentysix Counties and that is what you will get.&rdquo;  We want to provide that the producer will at least get the right or the privilege of being present when the animal is being weighed.</P>

      <P>I think this amendment is appropriate to the cancellation of the registration of premises.  I quite agree this Bill was not designed to assist the producer, nor is it designed to help the pig-raiser of this country in catering for the trade of England. The effect of it would be quite the reverse.  I think it would be a very slight concession to give the producers if it were seen that the men who raised the animals knew exactly what weight they were being paid for, and they could then compare the prices that are advertised each day for pork in England with the prices they receive from the monopoly exporters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>At Question Time yesterday Deputy Lemass raised a very important question. He put a question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce concerning a scheme for the control of the price of coal in Ireland.  In his reply the Minister left us in very considerable doubt as to what the position was, as <Col N="327" /> to the nature of the information which he had, and, in fact, whether or not he had any information, or whether there was any such scheme as that referred to by Deputy Lemass in existence.  Since Question Time yesterday a document has come into my possession which leaves no doubt whatever as to what the actual position is in regard to this very important matter.  I think that it is only right that this House, and especially the Minister, should know what is being done and the scheme that is not only in contemplation, but that is, I believe, actually in existence. It is important, too, that we should know from the Minister what steps he proposes to take in view of this information to protect the interests of coal consumers in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The document which I have before me and which has been circulated to numbers of people engaged in the coal trade is called a &ldquo;Memorandum of Constitution of Joint Co-ordinating Committee representing coal owners in Great Britain and importers in Ireland engaged in the supply of coal to Ireland.&rdquo;  The Chairman is named R. L. Angus, Esq., Ladykirk, Monkton, Ayrshire, and the Vice-Chairman is Sir Samuel Kelly, Station Street, Belfast.  The Joint Hon. Secretaries are Major F. Middleton of the Old Silkstone Collieries, Ltd., Dodworth, near Barnsley, Yorkshire; and P. Newman, Esq., of 18 Donegall Sq. North, Belfast.  It sets out who are the members of this Co-ordinating Committee and it includes as far as I can gather practically all the coal owners in Great Britain.  They are set down in the list as Forest of Dean, the Lanarkshire Coalmasters' Association Area, Ayrshire Coal Owners' Association Area, Fifeshire Coal Owners' Association.  Area, Lothians Coal Owners' Association Area, Cumberland Coal Owners' Association Area, South Wales Coal Marketing Association, North Wales Coal Owners' Association, and Central Collieries' Commercial Association. As far as I have been able to find out these Associations cover the whole of the coal owners <Col N="328" /> in Great Britain and on the other part is the Association of Importers in Ireland whose names are given. They are set out in the list here and I think it is important that they should be given because it shows that practically every coal importer in Ireland is included in this scheme.</P>
    <P>It is stated in the memorandum that it is understood that the following firms have either signed or are willing to sign an undertaking in the form set out in the appendix to the memorandum: In Dublin&mdash;Thomas Heiton and Co.; Wallace Bros., Ltd.; S. Irwin and Co., Ltd.; Diamond Coal Company; S. N. Robinson and Co.; McKenzie and Co.; Flower and McDonald; Tedcastle, McCormick and Co.; J.J. Carroll and Co.; P. Murphy; P. Donnelly and Sons, Ltd; Dublin General Steamshipping Co., Ltd.; North City Coal Co.; Thomas J. Nicholl and Sons, Ltd.; Clarkin and Co.; McCarthy and Co.; Sheridan Bros., Ltd.; Doherty and Co., Ltd.  In Waterford&mdash;Messrs. G. Spencer; McCullagh, Ltd.; Tedcastle, McCormick and Co., Ltd.; S. Morris, Ltd.; Mr. Thomas Power, Mayor's Walk; Joseph A. Nolan, 83 Quay.  In Limerick&mdash;Phillip O'Donovan; R. Despard and Sons; Clyde Shipping Co.; Tedcastle McCormick and Co.; Limerick Steamshipping Co.; Suttons, Ltd.  In Cork&mdash;Suttons, Ltd.; D. W. Tooms; J. Collins and Co.; Kelleher and Harrington; Metropole Coal Co.; David Tierney; Clyde Shipping Co.; G. Scott and Co., Ltd.  It states that the list includes all the important coal importing firms and practically all the small firms.  It is important to note that the scheme is not confined to the Irish Free State.  It covers all Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's reply, I think he stated that he had no information as to whether any agreement had been made or was about to be made for the purpose of raising the price of coal in Ireland, but we have it stated very definitely in the Memorandum that one of the objects of the Committee is as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;The Committee shall act in a consultative and advisory capacity, and shall meet from time to time for the purpose of <Col N="329" /> considering and making recommendations to and for the mutual benefits of the subscribing coal-owners and importers concerned.  Such recommendations shall deal inter alia with the following matters:&mdash;(a) The raising or lowering of all or any of the prices of coal supplied to Ireland; (b) the conditions which are to apply generally or specifically to sales of coal in Ireland.&rdquo;  They provide in the next paragraph for penal action against any of the parties concerned should they depart from the arrangement or break the ring.  This paragraph provides for &ldquo;any necessary joint action in regard to subscribing coal-owners or importers acting in a manner prejudicial to the objects contemplated.&rdquo; They set out what the action will be as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Where the Committee shall be satisfied that any subscribing coal-owner or importer is acting or has acted in a manner prejudicial to the objects contemplated by the Memorandum of Constitution, they shall make a recommendation upon the following lines or otherwise as may seem to them appropriate, viz.: that importers shall refuse to deal with an offending subscribing coal-owner or vice versa, as the case may be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It seems to be quite clear from this that the importers of coal in Ireland are especially being forced into this combination by the action of the coal-owners in Britain.  That is what I read into it, in any case, that as practically all the coal importers in the country are in the combine or ring, and as the coal-owners have bound themselves not to supply coal to anybody who is not a member of the particular ring, it will be impossible for any small importer to get coal from Britain.  I think it is clear from this that there can be no longer any doubt in the mind of the Minister that there is a definite combination here to raise prices.  None of us believes that these people are philanthropists whose object it will be to lower the price of coal to consumers in Ireland. While undoubtedly one of the stated ends may be to lower prices, we all believe and feel that <Col N="330" /> the principal object of this combine is, and will be, to raise prices, to control prices and to create a monopoly in regard to the supply of coal in Ireland.  I think it is the Minister's duty, and it will be the Government's duty to take steps to prevent the possible fleecing of Irish consumers of coal by the action contemplated here.  I have no doubt that the Minister will take cognisance of what is being done, and that he will take steps to see that the interests of the coal-consuming public will be protected against possible exploitation by a combine of coal-owners and coal importers about whose existence there can no longer be any possible doubt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the case put forward by Deputy O'Connell, and to show why the Minister for Industry and Commerce should take action to prevent anything in the nature of a monopoly in the coal trade being established here. I think it would be very undesirable that such a monopoly should be established even if the immediate effect of it was not to produce an unreasonable increase in the price of coal.  There are many reasons other than the price of coal why national interests demand that the Government should take action to prevent the formation of this ring.  It is true. I think, that the competition between coal importers in Dublin has been very keen in recent months.  A number of firms have, in fact, gone into liquidation in consequence of the keenness of the competition, and the prices which have been prevailing here have been on the whole lower than those prevailing in Belfast and other centres.  Nevertheless, I think that that matter should be allowed to rectify itself through the operation of the ordinary economic laws. Any attempt on the part of the coal importers to combine for the purpose of rectifying that position, while it might do their interests some good in the immediate future, would ultimately result in the production <Col N="331" /> of a situation very undesirable in the national interest.</P>
      <P>I would like to remind the Minister that under the scheme for the reorganisation of the British coal industry, which is at the present time being discussed in the British Parliament, the Free State market is reckoned as the home market.  The Minister is, no doubt, aware that the basis of that scheme is to increase the price of coal in the home market in order to permit the subsidising of exports to foreign countries.  Under that scheme the Free State is to be treated as the home market and consequently an increase in the price of coal is to be expected here whether this ring is formed or not.  That increase in the price of coal will help to make possible the economic working of Irish deposits of coal, which has been impossible heretofore.  This ring is, of course, for mutual business. It is designed to serve not merely all the coal importers in Ireland but the coal exporters in England. Consequently it will be undoubtedly utilised to prevent that development of Irish coal deposits which the increase in British prices would make possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite easy to visualise the manner in which a well organised ring can work.  Prices could be cut in a particular district, or coal actually offered at particularly favourable prices to special customers, if there was any danger of the importing trade being seriously affected by the development of coal production here.  Because of the fact that there is a possibility of increased production of coal within this country we should view with disfavour any attempt to organise this industry in combination with British coal exporters. If it was merely an association of Irish importers, acting independently of the British exporters to protect their own interests, it would not be so serious.  The fact is, that the British coal exporters, according to the Minister's reply to a question which I asked here last May, took the initiative in this <Col N="332" /> matter and on their initiative the ring has been formed.  The prime purpose is to protect the interests of the British exporters and only incidentally to increase the profits of the importers.  It is, therefore, in my opinion, desirable that the Government should utilise any powers they now possess to prevent this monopoly being constituted.  If they do not possess adequate powers to deal with the question, they can come to the Dáil immediately with a proposal to acquire these powers. I am quite certain any Bill seeking to give the Government power to deal with a situation of this kind would receive a favourable reception and a quick passage in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very thankful to Deputy O'Connell for having raised this matter in this particular way, and particularly for giving the contents of a document which has come to his hands.  I propose to supplement what he said.  I would like, at the beginning, to call attention to one or two things.  The Deputy, in speaking of the firms in Ireland which are in this ring, as he calls it, went on to state that he believed the ring was actually in existence.  I would like to point out that his own phraseology was to the effect that &ldquo;the following firms&rdquo; have either signed or are willing to sign, and secondly, that at the bottom of the page it is stated that it is understood the promoters of the scheme anticipate including therein practically all the coal importers in Ireland.  I know certainly, with regard to a company formed recently in this country, that the articles of association allowed for fifty members joining.  It will be noted, even from the list that Deputy O'Connell read, that thirty-eight people are mentioned and only six as signing or willing to sign.  That is why I am not clear that the ring has been, in fact, formed.  However, that is a small matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point we have to consider is the effect of the reactions in this <Col N="333" /> country of what is happening on the other side.  A Bill is being discussed in another Parliament arising out of either one or the other of two things, or a combination of both, the working of shorter hours and giving more pay in the mines.  The result of that is that a bigger price has got to be charged for English coal.  Personally, I disagree fundamentally with Deputy Lemass when he says that the serious part is that it is a combination of British exporters.  We cannot, to any great degree, counter what the British exporter does until his coal goes to a price with which either home produced coal can compete or at which other coal can be imported.  The serious thing is the establishment of any organised profiteering here.  That organised profiteering would be a much more serious thing if completely divorced from the exporters on the other side, because on the other side there is a scheme going through which has openly for its purpose an increase in the price of coal and an increase in price particularly in what are called the &ldquo;home districts.&rdquo;  The Irish Free State has always been, from the point of view of the English coal trade, reckoned as a home area.  How far this combination is going to advance, what exact use it is going to make here of the powers taken with regard to looking after their mutual interests, with the special emphasis Deputy O'Connell placed on the raising or lowering of prices of coal, all that will fall for consideration, and can only fall for consideration when the measure on the other side has assumed its final shape.  Meanwhile, we can watch the situation here and can make preparations if it attempts to organise profiteering on a large scale in this country.  I would remind the Deputy that there is already on the Statute Book an Act for the protection of the community, the Protection of the Community (Special Powers) Act, 1926, to deal with what was then considered a national emergency.  The Act gives considerable powers, even compelling the breaking up of any such combination.  I do not think it will <Col N="334" /> be necessary to use that.  I think the worst part of this combination is a matter to which Deputy O'Connell did not refer.  It confines trading to the people mentioned, and even prohibits direct trading except in the case of certain mentioned undertakings of a public utility character. Even with regard to these few exceptional undertakings, it says that it shall be the duty of the association to divert direct trading so that trading will be done only through the importing bodies.  That is under consideration at the moment, to see whether or not it comes within the law as being an illegal combination, an illegal restraint of trade.</P>
    <P>It is doubtful if a document of this sort, which obviously has been prepared by lawyers, would err in that way.  The law can be changed to meet the situation, and by permission of the House can be changed if it is seen that this is going to result in fixing unreasonable charges on the Irish consumer.  There again I find myself in disagreement with Deputy Lemass.  I do not see why I should seek to prevent a monopoly just because it is a monopoly; and I do not see why we should force by law merchants in this country to continue what Deputy Lemass calls cut-throat competition.  That would not appeal to the reason of anybody here.  I would not like to say myself that I should forbid any combination with regard to prices.  It is a thing we merely do not prohibit but even encourage in other businesses in order to let them go ahead. The whole matter will fall for consideration afterwards when the facts become clear, and when we get information of the price at which coal will be sold to the Association by the coal exporters on the other side, and the price at which it is afterwards retailed to the consumer. It happens that coal is a very easy matter to deal with in that respect. We can get the pit-head prices easily and know to the last penny the freight paid coming over.  It is an easy matter to determine what profits have been made hitherto, what are the profits reasonably to be <Col N="335" /> made, and we could see what the consumer is charged and estimate what the profits accruing to the merchant are.  When these facts come to light, that will be the time to deal with them.  I will not be remiss in dealing with the situation. It has been under consideration since last spring, when the first move was started.  The document Deputy O'Connell read came into my hands about a week ago.  The situation is not clear at the moment. This debate is useful to enable me to take action, and to give warning to the people concerned, that if there is profiteering on any scale that profiteering will be dealt with in so far as any legislation can be made to deal with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I knew the Minister would not interfere at the stage at which this combination has arrived, and I do not think Deputy Lemass or anyone else expected him to step in and pass a Bill here against a combination which, as the Minister says, is not in existence.  But I have in mind a combination of coal owners that did exist in the city of Dublin, unknown to the public.  I was a member of the Board of the Grangegorman Mental Hospital fifteen or sixteen years ago, when one of the officials reported that they were not getting satisfactory coal, and that it was not being delivered properly.  The complaint was that the institution was not getting the coal contracted for.  Investigations were set on foot.  The Board had the advantage of having experts on it. They happened to be members, if I remember aright, of the Transport Union, men who had worked all their lives at coal.  They had grown up in the business and knew where the various classes of coal came from.  I believe they actually knew the collieries in England and Wales from which the coal came.  On investigation, it was discovered that there was a ring to supply the Electricity <Col N="336" /> Supply Committee of the Dublin Corporation, the South and North Dublin Unions and the public boards. The ring was not set up by any agreement such as the Minister or Deputy O'Connell read out, but there was an arrangement whereby when these public bodies advertised for coal the ring arranged what contractors were to supply the various institutions. They sent in tenders which were arranged amongst themselves. There was zoning of a kind. One was to get a contract in Grangegorman, another in the Dublin Union, and so on.  When they got the contract some big men in the trade did not supply coal of the quality stipulated, and in that way in one year sums of more than £10,000 were filched from the Dublin ratepayers.  As the Minister said, it is useful to have even an attempt at a ring exposed.  What we want is not to prevent fair competition in anything, but to prevent anything that will revive robbery of the ordinary ratepayers.  It is a good job someone has, in advance called attention to this matter so as to give warning that if there is any attempt to revive that kind of dishonest trading in the Twenty-six Counties steps will be taken to forestall it.</P>
