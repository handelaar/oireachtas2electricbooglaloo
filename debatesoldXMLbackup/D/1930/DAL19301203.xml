      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will state what steps have been taken to improve the telephone services in the Rathmines and Terenure areas; how many applications for telephones in these areas are still unsatisfied, and how many of these applications were made-more than six months ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Heffernan)</NameTxt>
      <P>A temporary Relief Exchange was opened at Terenure on the 1st July last which enabled all applications for telephone service in that locality to be met.  In addition, the lines of 240 subscribers resident in Terenure have been transferred from Rathmines Exchange to the Relief Exchange. The equipment set free atRathmines will be used to provide service for waiting subscribers in that area, as soon as additional underground cables which are essential have been laid and a rearrangement of overhead lines carried out.  The work is in hand and is being pressed forward with all possible expedition, but as some of the new cables have to be specially manufactured, at least four months will probably elapse before completion of the scheme.  The number of outstanding applications for service in the Rathmines area is 91, 53 of which are more than six months old.</P>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that almost three years ago he gave me an assurance in the House that this matter was having attention and that he hoped that in the immediate future arrangements would <Col N="791" /> be made whereby applicants for telephones would all be met?  Can he now say, after a lapse of three years, what additional period will be necessary before these waiting subscribers are satisfied with telephone connections?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated in my answer, we expect that the requirements of all the subscribers in that area will be met within four months by means of a temporary relief scheme. The main scheme, which includes the building of a Post Office and Exchange in Rathmines, will take a considerable time.  In any case, we can definitely state that requirements will be met within six months at the longest.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce with reference to the battery which was tested at Inchicore on the 21st August last, and in relation to which he subsequently issued a public statement, to state:&mdash; (a) the ampere-hour capacity of the battery when discharging at constant current at the half-hour, 1-hour, 3-hour, and 5-hour rates, respectively; (b) the cell-voltage at the beginning and end of discharge at each of the above-mentioned rates, and the mean cell voltage during discharge at each of those rates; (c) the normal and maximum practicable rates of charge, respectively; (d) the cell voltage at the beginning and end of charge at each of the above-mentioned rates, and the mean cell voltage during such charge; (e) whether he will cause to be published charge and discharge curves showing the characteristics of the battery under each of the charge and discharge conditions referred to in (a) and (c) above.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's questions relate to matters which were not under test in the demonstration runs of the battery coach on the 21st and 27th August.  This matter is covered by a reply to another question on this subject.  I am prepared to publish information when I am advised that <Col N="795" /> further improvement in any particular direction is unlikely and that our investigations will not be hampered by such publication.  The Patents cover the battery generally, but the experimental work, so far, has been directed mainly towards perfecting a quickcharging type of battery with very low internal resistance.  I, therefore, do not propose to give the information requested by the Deputy, as the publication of this information would not assist, in any way, the development of the battery along the lines recommended by the experts whom I have consulted.  Information on such of these points as Celia Ltd. think likely to be of value for technical purposes will, no doubt, be released by Celia Ltd. when, in their opinion, the need for secrecy has passed, and when the present development has reached a stage which allows research staff to be diverted to the collection of data which is not of immediate importance.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce with reference to the test which took place on a battery at Inchicore on the 21st August last, and in relation to which he subsequently issued a public statement, to state whether electrical instruments of meters of the following kinds and of sub-standard accuracy <Col N="796" /> were duly connected in the test circuits on that occasion, viz.:&mdash;(a) in the charge circuit: ammeter, voltmeter, integrating ampere-hour meter, integrating watt-hour meter; (b) in the discharge circuit: ammeter, voltmeter, integrating ampere-hour meter, integrating watt-hour meter; if no instruments of sub-standard accuracy were used, to state what instruments or meters were connected in the charge and discharge circuits, respectively, and with reference to each of these, to state the name of the manufacturer, the type of meter or instrument, and its grade, rating and maker's serial number.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question seems to indicate a misunderstanding concerning the object of the demonstrations which took place on the 21st and 27th August.  The object of these demonstrations was to show the practicability of the charging rates and discharging rates and the total output for the battery, and also the acceleration and speed and total mileage for the coach for the day's running.  Accurate determination of efficiencies and output, etc., is made with precision instruments in the laboratory.  Consequently, the various instruments of sub-standard accuracy, to which the Deputy refers, were not installed upon the coach.  The instruments installed were:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1 voltmeter on charging and discharging circuits.</P>
      <P>1 ammeter on charging circuit.</P>
      <P>1 ammeter on discharging circuit.</P>
      <P>1 watt hour meter in the discharging circuit.</P>
      <P>On the day's running, the following figures were established:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Total distance travelled&mdash;173 miles.</P>
      <P>Total output&mdash;193 kilowatt hours.</P>
      <P>Output per pound weight of battery for one day's operation&mdash;32.2 watt hours per pound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The instruments were supplied by the railway company.  The figures may be taken as correct within a few per cent., which is the order of accuracy required.  I may point out that meticulous accuracy in these matters is of no value, because the figures will almost always change within a few per cent., depending upon conditions of operation, temperature, charging rates and <Col N="797" /> several other variables.  For example, the energy efficiency varies between, say, 73 per cent. and 80 per cent., but under the general conditions of operation has been taken at a low average of 75 per cent. for the purpose of stating the claims of the battery.  The Deputy stated here that the claim that the Drumm battery had a 50 per cent. higher voltage than existing alkaline batteries was not justifiable in view of his own observations.  He stated that he had an alkaline cell which had a discharge voltage of 1.2 volts and that the Drumm cell appeared to have a discharge voltage of 1.57 volts, but he did not state the discharge rates in either case.  At the average discharge rates used in the battery coach the voltage of the existing alkaline cell would be considerably less than 1.2 volts per cell.  At high rates of discharge the Drumm cell would have voltages much more than 50 per cent. higher than existing alkaline batteries at similar discharge rates.  At very low rates of discharge the difference in voltage would fall to about 40 per cent. The claim for 50 per cent. higher voltage is very conservative for the type of service for which the battery is designed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that in 1929 the general rate for artificial manure was 10s. 8d. per ton, two kinds only being charged 7s. 9d.  It appears to have been decided that there was no justification for the reduced rate in the case of these two kinds of manure and that the rate of 10s. 8d. should apply generally to artificial fertilisers.  The rate of 10s. 8d. is itself an exceptional rate considerably less than the standard rate applicable normally.  I am not prepared to take up questions of particular rates on behalf of the consignors of goods.  The decisions of the tribunal were not arrived at without every interest affected being given an opportunity of presenting its case, and if any interest is now dissatisfied it should approach the Railway Company or, alternatively, the Railway Tribunal, in accordance with the procedure prescribed in its rules.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that Shaw's Flour Mill at Cork has recently ceased production.  This temporary cessation is, I understand, due to difficulties inseparable from an industry whose raw materials have been falling in price for some considerable time past.  A number of Irish millers are, according to my information, at present overstocked owing to a temporary shortage of demand, due to falling prices.  If bakers' flour is not at present being produced in Cork it does not necessarily mean that Cork bakers cannot get locally milled bakers' flour.  The present situation of Irish mills, being due primarily to the recent fall in prices, does not warrant any special action on my part.</P>

      <P>In regard to the concluding part of the question, the requirement as to the disinfection of dealers and other persons landing at Free State ports, who might have been in contact with animals in Great Britain, is strictly enforced at our ports.  Arrangements are also in force for securing that the clothes, boots, etc., of such persons are disinfected at the ports of landing, Departmental Inspectors being specially detailed for this work.  It is obligatory on such persons, under the Department's regulations, to submit themselves for disinfection whether they are requested to do so by the inspectors or not.</P>

    <P>The only thing which is new in this Order is No. 3.  When members who had resigned or had been dismissed from the D.M.P. were reinstated in the D.M.P., they were allowed to date their service, for the purpose of pensions, back to the date of their original entry into the D.M.P.  A similar provision did not exist for resigned or dismissed members of the D.M.P. who, instead of rejoining that force, joined the Gárda Síochána.  The <Col N="829" /> purpose of this Order is to put resigned or dismissed members of the D.M.P. who joined the Gárda Síochána on the same footing as regards pensions as those others who rejoined the D.M.P. Section 4 simply makes clear the expression &ldquo;annual pay&rdquo; in the existing Order.  Some doubt existed as to what it was, but this makes it clear that &ldquo;annual pay&rdquo; means annual pay without reduction. There is no change in practice.  It is simply carrying on the practice, but making it clear that the practice was right.  The only other provision enables the Minister for Finance, when a person entitled to a pension is suffering from mental disability, to pay the pension to somebody for the benefit of that person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands and Fisheries (Mr. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, in so far as it affects the Sea Fisheries Association, is necessary for the purpose of enabling me to transfer to the Association such assets at present vested in me as may be required in connection with the carrying out of the tasks committed to them, and for the further purpose of strengthening the powers of the Association in the enforcement of hire purchase contracts entered into with the members.  By Clause 2 (1) (a) I am empowered to hand over boats <Col N="830" /> and gear that are at the moment in the hands of the Department which members of the Association may wish to take and on such terms as may be agreed.</P>
      <P>Under Clause 2 (1) (b) I can transfer any sum outstanding due to the Department for loans previously made.  This does not necessarily mean that every such obligation will be transferred if the borrower does not desire it.  I do not wish, nor indeed have I the power under the Bill, to make such a transfer against the borrower's wish.  I anticipate the method of repayment to the Association will be preferred by borrowers in the majority of cases and that they will welcome the change.  Perhaps it would be well to explain the present method of repayment.  The present method of repayment by borrowers is in two half-yearly instalments.  In the case of the larger borrowers this is very often a liability which they cannot meet when the half-yearly gale comes round.  Under the new system the borrowers will pay to the Association out of their catch a percentage of the owner's share.  In a week when the borrower would have good fishing he would pay more and in a week when the fishing would be bad he would pay less.  It may be a condition of certain revisions of outstanding loans, in regard to which I have shortly to bring in a Bill, that the reduced amounts where there is a reduction shall be collected by the Association instead of by the Department. I do not wish to lay down any hard and fast rule on this matter because it is something on which the Association will also have to be consulted. I only wish to make it clear that any borrower who has a contract with the Department which he is satisfactorily carrying out will not have that contract varied without his wish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clause 2 (1) (c) enables me to transfer land, and land under the Interpretation Act includes buildings. Sub-clause 2 dispenses with some of the ordinary formalities in connection with these transfers.  Clause 3 should be read in connection with Section 6 of the Rules which, in accordance with the promise I made, <Col N="831" /> have been circulated to Deputies.  This section, which begins with Rule 15, deals with the arrangements for the hire purchase of boats and gear.  The use of the word &ldquo;hire&rdquo; in the section must not be construed as implying that a fisherman will not in due course become full owner of the boat and gear on which he is paying instalments.  It will be seen from page 14, paragraph J, that when the purchase price and interest of the boat have been paid in full the boat becomes the absolute property of the hirer.  It was evidently considered by the directors that this course represented the simplest and most satisfactory method of giving effect to the plan which I proposed to them by which boats and gear will be issued in future to competent fishermen without requiring them, as in the past, to find solvent sureties.  The practice in the past has been that where persons applied for loans from the Department, the borrowers had to find two solvent sureties.  This practice will now be done away with.</P>
    <P>In other words, a man will be given loans for a boat or gear on his own security, the Association having a hold of him by the fact that they will be dealing with his catch.  I have sufficient faith in the general body of fishermen to believe that this plan will be welcome and that it will be loyally and honestly worked.  The directors felt, however, that it should have strong powers to deal with any persons who might be tempted wilfully to evade their obligations.  For that reason, this section has been inserted in the Bill.  I feel that resort to these powers will be extremely exceptional.  They will constitute a very great advantage to the industry itself, which would suffer most from the derelictions of a few members.</P>
    <P>The clause dealing with these powers applies only to the contract under which fishermen obtain boats and gear through their societies.  It does not apply to the other contracts, which you see mentioned in Rules 12 and 13&mdash;that is the contract for co-operative marketing. This is purely a voluntary contract entered into with the society by members who have already boats of their own.  This is the only portion <Col N="832" /> of the Bill directly affecting the Association, and it may be convenient for me to state here that the rules which are now in the hands of Deputies are practically as submitted to my Department by the Directors.  They were, of course, examined in my Department, but having invited a certain number of eminent business men to undertake this difficult task, I was opposed to any interference with the methods which they proposed to follow out in the working of the Association. The directors appreciate the extent to which the Association must, in its early years, rely on State assistance, and they have made provision for the protection of the public interests, which I think is fully adequate.  Clause 71, in page 26, indicates where they make such provisions.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need deal in any detailed manner with the character of the Association's Rules, which are more or less in the ordinary form, and speak for themselves.  The objects are set out in Rule 4 of the Association.  They are very comprehensive and would, I think, cover any activity necessary for the development of the industry.  The Association will be started from scratch to organise a national industry without any existing co-operative unit of any sort.  The Association contemplated, for the present at any rate, is a centralised one under the control of the Committee.</P>
    <P>Under Rule 140 (5) provision is made for the formation of local or regional committees, if the Central Association is encouraged by the amount of local interest taken in it to do so.  I have no doubt that the constitution of the Association may ultimately conform to a more useful type of co-operative effort, that is, where you have local branches of the Association affiliated to the central body.  In the meantime, prior to the setting up of these local branches, provision is made under Rules 131 to 137 for a very democratic method of appointment of the elected members of the committee.  Under these rules every member, no matter how remote ho may be, can exercise his vote under conditions which will preserve absolute secrecy.  This, I think, will be a laborious and costly procedure, but the Directors think it <Col N="833" /> is worth while.  There is an additional provision under Rule 140 (6) for the payment of expenses to regional representatives or delegates attending from any area the general meeting of the Society.  I understand that these provisions are designed to give every member an opportunity of direct interest and influence in the Society, and I think that they will tend to make the Association more responsive to the views of every section of the industry.  In Part 3, however, of the Bill, Section 4 provides that in any area which may be specified the provisions of this Part of the Act as to the licensing of auctioneers and salesmen may apply.</P>
    <P>Clause 5 provides for the granting of licences to auctioneers and salesmen of fish in such an area, and makes it a condition of the granting of such a licence that the holder shall not be otherwise interested in the fishing trade.  I anticipate that it will be one of the primary purposes of the Association to provide better markets for fish in this country by means of which fish may be sold by auction, negotiation or arrangement of some kind.</P>
    <P>The object of this Part of the Act is to provide a means of ensuring that in every market of importance these transactions shall be carried through by persons, and in such a manner as will, so far as is humanly practicable, avoid even the shadow of suspicion.  I do not want anyone to think from what I have said here or elsewhere that they could infer from this requirement which I am suggesting, that there is any ground for criticism of the way in which the business is conducted at present. But if there is to be an extension of markets in any part of this country, I think it is desirable that the business of selling fish should be regulated in a manner beyond criticism so that there may be implicit confidence on the part of those who may be consigning fish from distant places.</P>
    <P>I may say that I shall not probably put this Part of the Act into operation except on the application of the Directors. Section 6 to Section 11 are consequential on Section 5.  Coming to Part 4 of the Bill I want to point out that this Part deals with the conditions in which fish may be sold in retail <Col N="834" /> shops.  Fish is so important a food and it is of so perishable a character that it is important, in my view, not only in the interests of the industry but also in the interests of the public, that it should be sold under proper hygienic conditions.  I think that this provision may be found to be in the interests of the fish retailers themselves.  They will, I expect, reduce the portion of the fish becoming unsaleable.  The better the condition in which the fish will be sold the greater will be the consumption of fish in the country.</P>
    <P>Section 12 requires that there shall be a state of general cleanliness and adequate water supply; proper facilities for the display and handling of fish and cold storage for fish when not so displayed.  Section 13 provides for the avoidance of contamination by the cold storage of fish when not displayed and prompt clearance from the premises of fish offals.  We shall see that fish offals will be cleared away every day.  It will be an offence if the fish offals of the day before are found on the premises.  Section 14 provides for the necessary inspection to ensure observance of the conditions specified above.</P>
    <P>While those conditions will become operative immediately on the passage of the Bill, I may say that there is not in my mind any intention of setting up an immediate inquisition in the matter.  While I should look for an early improvement in the conditions generally, I should be disposed to await representations from the Association or from some other responsible quarter before taking action, and I would not be inclined to press any action without giving some notice to the persons concerned, so that defects might be remedied.  I quite realise that the trade is not in such a position that one can expect ideal conditions, and I shall have some regard also to the locality in which the offence occurs. I do not mean that I have any intention of letting this portion of the Bill become a dead-letter, but, on the other hand, I do not intend that it should be exercised vexatiously.</P>
    <P>Sections 15, 16 and 17 require no comment.  Section 18 relates to meeting the expenses incurred in the carrying out of the Bill.  In this connection <Col N="835" /> I may say that I have no present intention of appointing any inspectors under Part 4, that is for the examination and inspection of retail fish shops. I anticipate that what is necessary to be done in that part can be done by the existing staff.</P>
    <P>Before sitting down I ought to refer to an undertaking which I gave here at one time to introduce a measure for the instituting of a system of branding mackerel.  That undertaking was given before the inception of this Association. Measures had in fact been drafted, but I am inclined to think now that following the establishment of the Association that question might be more satisfactorily solved without legislation.  The Association will have a very direct interest in the method in which members will cure their fish, and there will be very effective means of redress if there should be any failure to cure properly.  I should therefore like to be released from that undertaking, with the assurance on my part that if at any time the Association thought that legislation would be desirable I shall, of course, have no hesitation in introducing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement of the Minister in introducing this Bill gave us very little to go upon.  In the first place, I think the House is entitled to a definite statement from the Government as to their general attitude towards the fishing industry.  We are not so much concerned with the actual methods, perhaps, if we can find out what exactly is the Government's attitude. Are they really in earnest in trying to reorganise this industry or are they not?  I must say I am astonished that the Minister has not given any time to the consideration of the general position of the fishing industry. It is an important industry. In some counties, such as Donegal, it is suggested that the herring industry would be worth a quarter of a million pounds in a normal year.  Even during the past few years, when the fishing industry has been in a particularly difficult position, the annual take has run into some hundreds of thousands of pounds.  If you add to that the amount spent on curing and transport <Col N="836" /> of the fish there is no doubt that, even in present circumstances, the industry is worth at least half a million pounds, or perhaps more, to the country.  Therefore, that point ought to have been dealt with by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister has stated that he is handing over certain assets to this Association. I am very sorry Deputy McDonagh is not present to hear what we have to say on this matter.  What are the assets of the Fishery Department at present?  Then the Minister has spoken of handing over these old debts.  It is time to get rid of the question of debts.  The position of this Association, if it does start, will be difficult enough without being complicated by taking over old debts and old accounts from the Department.  Let the Department get rid of these accounts themselves and not burden the new Association and the directors with endeavouring to straighten them out.  They are hanging fire long enough.  Now that the Minister has definitely promised to introduce a Bill, I think he might very well keep that question of debts within his own Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the matter of assets. What are the assets of this Department? We are told that there are a considerable number of boats throughout the country belonging to the Department, but these boats in some cases are in a very bad condition. Even if they are not, it is very doubtful whether they are worth the price that the mandarins of the Minister would be likely to place upon them because, unfortunately, these gentlemen must have their say in all these matters. One of the things that disappoints me in connection with this Bill is the feeling that the Department of Finance has its finger in every clause of these rules.  On 15th March, 1930, the Secretary of the Department wrote to me and stated that the State in connection with this new organisation would provide the initial funds for the supply of boats; would make an annual grant towards the administration charges, and would give financial assistance in other approved proposals.  It is very significant that the Minister has not said one word about the finance of this scheme.  That is what we are interested <Col N="837" /> in.  How exactly is this scheme going to work?  So far as the Association raising any capital is concerned, I think we may dismiss that.  The only powers they have to raise money are on the strength of mortgages on their property.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not stated what is the value of their property, but whatever value it may be I think we can take it that it is not sufficient for the new Association to raise a considerable amount of money upon&mdash;say, £100,000 or £50,000&mdash;to go on with this work. How are they going to raise capital? It seems to me that there is no way of raising capital.  The membership of the Association in itself will not bring in any capital.  It is going to be one of those democratic Associations that the Plunkett House tradition unfortunately has conferred upon this country&mdash;an Association where you have a lot of members who have no responsibility and who simply come together and talk academically and generally get in the way of the few people in the Association who want to do something.  Instead of not complicating the position of the directors who may want to do something, we are simply overloading this with red tape and in an essential matter like finance we have no information as to what the Government are going to do.  At any rate, there are no powers in the rules to enable them to raise money to any substantial amount, such as the Electricity Supply Board or the Agricultural Credit Corporation has done. I am afraid that the basis of this scheme, as far as commercial efficiency and putting the fishing industry on its feet are concerned, leaves a lot to be desired.  What was the objection to setting up a commercial board such as was done in these two cases, if not actually getting the directors to pledge themselves to some extent financially and make them in that way responsible? Unfortunately, however good a director may be or however honourable officials may be, they have a habit of dealing quite differently with the taxpayer's money from the way they would deal with their own.  If, however, it is impossible to devise a scheme by which directors or business men would be got who would pledge themselves financially and invest <Col N="838" /> capital in this business, while at the same time getting an amount of State control and supervision&mdash;I think that should have been possible&mdash;then a commercial board should have been established, and I suggest that power should have been given to enable the board to raise money by State guarantee.</P>
    <P>Either the State has taken up the matter in earnest or it has not.  If it is not taking it up in earnest let us be finished with it and not give the country the impression that a really serious effort is being made to develop the industry when there is no word from start to finish as to how the money is to be raised for that purpose. The Minister has very great powers in connection with this matter.  Another defect in the co-operative system of organisation is that, as well as being thoroughly inefficient in essence it gives control to a number of members who will have no qualification or interest in the fishing industry except that they pay one shilling a year for membership.  I do not see what use that is.  To suggest that they should have power and control over the directors and have power to change rules seems to be an extraordinary affair.  The directors will not know where they are; they will find themselves in a quick-sand.  If there is to be membership at all, if the idea is not to get a large membership, why have it on a co-operative basis?  The directors, in fact, will find themselves encumbered on the one side, and on the other side they will be merely the creatures of the Minister, because of the fact that the Minister is to have a majority on the board.  When the directors have no financial interest themselves in the matter and are nominated by the Minister, it seems to me the Minister's word is going to go on this board and then you are not going to have any independence.  Is it suggested that it would not be possible to give the members of this board powers to exercise their discretion in a reasonable way as they would in their ordinary private business and to restrain the Minister from crippling them by too many restrictions.  He is to have complete authority over the affairs of the board and to remove and to nominate the directors without <Col N="839" /> stating any reason.  He is to have power to make the appointment of manager and I think I may say practically all the regulations.  Money matters and so on are not alone to be subject to the scrutiny of the inquisitorial officials from the Ministry of Finance but also subject to the veto of the Department of Fisheries.</P>
    <P>I think it would be far better to let the new body go ahead on a commercial basis, and to give them the fullest possible liberty.  We cannot in the nature of things discuss the possibility of this scheme as we stand; we want experience of how it is going to work. If we look at it now we may take the most optimistic view, and may say, because we have men on the Board that the House has confidence in, that it is going to be successful, or we may take the opposite view and say, judging by the past record of the Ministry of Fisheries, which has been very bad in the past seven years, then from the very fact that these proposals have emanated from the Ministry no good can come out of them.  However, I do not know whether the directors of this co-operative association have made themselves familiar with these matters or not.  I presume they have.  But I cannot for the life of me see how they are going to work if they are to be held up by the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Fisheries and if, as well as that, they are to be called before general meetings of the people who will not have even the qualification that they are fishermen or that they are interested as producers or otherwise in the fishing industry.  I think it is a terrible blot on the whole thing.  Certain people may have a sentimental regard for co-operative societies.  I have no such regard for them.  I do not think they are efficient.  If you want a friendly organisation to run a club or a thing like that a co-operative association is all right, but if you want work done it must be on the joint stock basis or on the basis of a board such as the Electricity Supply Board or the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
    <P>Another thing is that the directors themselves under the rules are to have power to enter into contract and business arrangements with the organisation, <Col N="840" /> and, as well as that, their remuneration is to be in fact fixed by the Association though sanctioned by the Minister.  It seems to me, therefore, that when the question of the directors' remuneration or the directors' contracts with the Association come up for discussion if you are going to have a general meeting of members from all over the country and if by any chance things should not be well with the Association&mdash;if, for example, there should be a slump such as there is in the creamery industry at the present time, the directors will be open to be treated very unfairly.</P>
    <P>Assuming that they have done their best and have not made that a success, they are going to get the blame, and every Tom, Dick and Harry can go to the meeting and abuse them.  You may say the same thing will happen at the shareholders' meeting if the Association was organised on a joint stock basis, but in that case the shareholders would be financially interested in the business and the shareholders should be allowed to say what they thought. In this case the members have no financial interests whatever.  They can be members without taking any part in the industry.  It is stated also in the rules that there is provision for settling disputes, but it is quite possible that you might settle a thousand disputes under a system of arbitration designed, and which is a very good thing as saving expenses of litigation, but it is conceivable that, run on this democratic basis, it may bring in political and other matters, and you have these disputes from the beginning.  You may have one portion of the membership of the organisation on the side of the Minister, let us say, and another portion against, and you may have a feud going on there from the beginning.  I think it is bound to happen if you establish an organisation and do not put it on a proper commercial basis.</P>
    <P>There is another provision also which shows the weakness of the whole things Rule 182 says that directors shall not be responsible individually for the actions of other directors or for the officials of the Association.  In a joint stock company I think the directors would have to bear responsibilities, <Col N="841" /> and I think the directors, to a certain extent at any rate, would have to bear responsibility for the acts of the agents of the company.  It seems to me that the implication is here already that you are going to have difference of opinion&mdash;I have not examined the matter, and I have no legal opinion on it, but it seems to me that an effort to fix limitations in the matter of individual responsibility is not going to succeed.  If one director or one important official is working in an unsatisfactory way and causes dissatisfaction amongst the members of the Association there is no doubt the whole Association is going to get the blame, and the directors themselves, and particularly those who are best, are going to get blame for any mala fide action that may be attributed to the officials themselves.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not told us what the functions of his Department are going to be in connection with this Association.  Is it contemplated that the officials of his Department are going to work under this new Association, or is it suggested to the taxpayers that side by side with this new organisation&mdash;which the State are going to carry and the undertaking I have read which must cost a considerable expenditure annually for its upkeep as well as a certain expenditure of private capital&mdash;the Department of Fisheries should be carried on as well? The functions of that Department will be, to my mind, considerably altered when the Sea Fisheries Association is set up.  The Sea Fisheries Association will be charged with the control of the sea-fishing industry proper.  I cannot see, therefore, how the Department of Fisheries will have any great responsibility in the matter. They will, however, have to do with inland fisheries, with rural industries and with the protection of the fishing industry.  They will also collect statistics.  I think that all these functions could be carried out by existing Departments without having any Department of Fisheries at all. If the Minister is really in earnest about the fisheries, the best thing he could do would be to throw in his lot personally as director or chairman of this Association and put an end to the absurdity of having a Department <Col N="842" /> which has, in effect, done nothing and which is now going to saddle itself on an Association which might, if left alone, do something but which, with all this red tape and with all these regulations, will be placed in an impossible position.  A lot of armchair officials are going to direct it. The taxpayer will be interested and the Department of Finance will be interested.  They, through their representative in this House, the Minister for Finance, will tell us the silence to-day on the question of finance suggests that&mdash;&ldquo;You cannot have money for this industry.&rdquo; We may have a re-echo of the Minister's famous statement, that there is no future for the Irish fishing industry. The Department of Finance are not going to get away with that.  We must point out to them that we want to see whatever money is being expended on fisheries expended in the way that will give the best possible result.</P>
    <P>We are not prepared, I think, to pass this Bill without finding out exactly where we stand in that matter.  Are we going to face the annual expenditure of the Department of Fisheries and the new expenditure on this Association as well?  It ought to be possible to combine the two and to reduce or abolish the Department of Fisheries, now that one of its chief functions is being taken over.  The rural industries branch ought to be able to look after itself.  We have set up a special depôt in respect of that, and I see no reason why that depot, and the kelp scheme or any other scheme dealing with the Gaeltacht area should not be brought under the Fisheries Board.  If the Fisheries Board is going to deal with the whole question of sea fisheries, is it contended that it could not deal with rural industries, kelp, carrageen moss and any other activities of the Gaeltacht areas?  The only other work the Department of Fisheries has to do is to collect statistics.  There is, already, a statistics branch, and there is no reason why they should not do this work in conjunction with the Gárda Síochána.  There is no reason why the officials whom the Minister would consider absolutely essential to the securing of whatever statistical information <Col N="843" /> is required could not be transferred to the Department of Agriculture. It seems preposterous that we should have a separate Fisheries Department in this country when in Great Britain it is allied with the Department of Agriculture.  So long as it is there, it will remain a vested interest, and it will be up to it and the officials to pretend they are doing something, whereas in reality they are doing nothing.  This is an opportunity for members of the House who are interested in the question to insist on a drastic reorganisation of the Department of Fisheries.  If the £30,000 being spent on salaries, wages and expenses in that Department were handed over to any individual business man conversant with the fishing business&mdash;for example, Deputy McDonagh &mdash;does any member of the House think that he would not get better results within a single year for the £30,000 than this Department has got for the last seven years?  There is not the slightest doubt that he would.</P>
    <P>I now come to the Bill.  The Bill simply amplifies and strengthens the rules of the Association.  The Minister has referred to the hire-purchase system.  The granting of loans is to be the basis of the assistance to the industry. These loans are generally to be granted on, I think, a fifty-fifty basis.  It was suggested by a Sea Fisheries Conference which the Minister set up in one of his innumerable attempts to do something&mdash;he has probably forgotten about it by this time&mdash; that those to whom loans were given might be induced to pay up even before the time for payment, if they had the money, by offering a discount of 2½ per cent. or more.  I think that is the proper way to approach the question. We are setting up here a definite system of lending money to an industry that we are supposed to believe in. The Minister says that he thinks this Bill will appeal to the vast body of fishermen.  He is providing, however, not for an ordinary commercial contract, which could be followed up in court for recovery of the debt, but for a term of imprisonment up to six months if the unfortunate fisherman is not able to pay.  There is no use in <Col N="844" /> telling us, as the Minister has told us in regard to practically every one of these sections, that these provisions are not going to be enforced unless the Association so requests.  If that were so, what would be the use of passing this Bill at all?  If circumstances arose in which the Sea Fisheries Association wanted to take these measures, why could not the Minister then come before the House with his proposals? He wants this Bill passed, and yet he admits that some of the provisions are so extraordinary that he could not take responsibility for carrying them into effect.  The proposal to inflict imprisonment upon a fisherman who may not be able to pay is very severe, and will have to be drastically altered. It simply shows, as I said before, that the co-operative basis is the wrong basis.  The co-operative creamery in Ballymacelligott had to go to the House of Lords to try to enforce a contract against some of their members, and even then, I think, they did not succeed.  A special clause is being introduced to help out the co-operative society in the enforcing of contracts where the co-operative society itself is essentially and intrinsically weak, and is not able to enforce its own regulations. I think that that is approaching the question from a wrong direction. There is no suggestion that the directors are going to have a discretion. If they let a case pass, then they will have set a precedent, and they cannot go back.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if they set out to implement this section, imposing imprisonment or heavy fines on defaulting fishermen, where is it going to stop?  I should not like to be at a directors' meeting at which it would be announced that proceedings were being taken in a bad season against fishermen in Donegal or Connemara. This is approaching the matter from the wrong point of view.  I think the Association should be allowed to go ahead and see what they could do. If it is impossible to lend money without a reasonable chance of return, they should adopt some other basis. In the present position, where there are so many loans outstanding, I think if they went frankly on the basis of employing the fishermen themselves <Col N="845" /> and paying them a regular wage until the scheme came into operation, it would have been much better.  The loan business may be all right in good times, but in bad times like the present, and with the industry in the condition in which it is, I doubt if you are going to get anywhere even with this proposal for inflicting imprisonment on defaulters.</P>
    <P>As regards the loans, another important matter is this: We are asked to pass the principle of a severe clause inflicting imprisonment on these people, and we are not to be told what the rate of interest on the loans is going to be.  If the rate is going to be five or six per cent. it will be too high.  Unless the Government can definitely say that they will pay the annual expenses and grant a certain sum at a very small rate of interest to enable the fishermen to get the loans, I do not see any hope at all for the Association.  There is a provision with regard to agents who sell fish by public auction.  They are not otherwise to be concerned in the business. The Minister says that is not to be enforced unless there is a request from the Association to enforce it. How is the Minister going to secure that an agent will not get what is called a &ldquo;hand-over,&rdquo; or be connected with the persons with whom he is dealing, who may offer some financial inducement?  The only alternative is to send down officials, but there are too many officials already, and I suggest that we should not appoint any more.  We ought to take these men away and approach the question from a commercial point of view.  I think the Association ought to be able to get men who have experience of the industry who will get going, and not pay attention to any other consideration, men who will make this scheme go, dispose of the fish, and do the work which the directors lay out for them.  That is the sort of men we want.</P>
    <P>As regards Part IV of the Bill I am opposed to the provisions dealing with the retailing of fish.  Is it suggested that the Department or the officials of the Association are going to set up retail shops themselves?  They have power to do so.  I take it that is not <Col N="846" /> intended.  It would not be accepted that they could make it a paying proposition.  What they are not prepared to do themselves, even though it might give them a certain monopoly which might eventually come to something, they are going to make other people do.  Apart from the question of interference with retailers who are now selling fish, there is the question of whether it is an economic proposition for a man in a small town of three or four thousand of a population, to instal all his equipment which the Minister demands. If a man wants to set up a fish shop he will have to get in a refrigerator, a fish slab and a water supply and to satisfy the Minister that his fish is being marketed in a clean way and is quite free from contamination.  In other words the retailer of fish is being asked by the Minister for Fisheries to do things that the retailers of other foodstuffs have not been asked to do by the Minister for Public Health although we have a number of Public Health Acts and special medical officers of health throughout the country.  Is it suggested that the unfortunate people who are selling fish are going to have a standard set up for them, which is far higher than the standard established for butchers, fruit sellers or the sellers of bread, butter or dairy products generally?  I don't think it is an economic proposition.  I do not think you will get people in small towns to set up shops in that way. If it is a medical question I think the Minister for Local Government and Public Health should tackle the butchers' shops and other shops which are selling foodstuffs.  You have only to walk down a street in Dublin and if there are not cobwebs on the foodstuffs exhibited there, you will see flies and insects of all kinds and the food subject to all kinds of contamination.</P>
    <P>If we are going out on a ramp of clean food for the consumer, let us consider it very seriously, but let us not put it into operation in respect of one particular section of the community only, even though I admit that in this case the food is perishable. Would it not be better for the Minister <Col N="847" /> to pick out certain retailers throughout the country&mdash;I presume he has discussed the question with them &mdash;and say to them: &ldquo;I realise that you cannot go ahead satisfactorily, but I am prepared to grant you a loan to fit up your shop.  If you do that I will give you the agency in your particular district.&rdquo;  I think it would be much better to give them facilities to set up proper shops against which there could be no complaint than to rush into a proposal to condemn all shops and in effect to prevent the sale of fish except in shops which come up to this high standard.  The Bill refers to premises, and I do not know if the premises include hawkers or not.  Perhaps the Minister would be good enough to state whether &ldquo;premises&rdquo; in sections 13 and 14 includes hawkers' vehicles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case hawkers will be free from restrictions and will be able to go on selling fish.  If they are to be allowed to continue they will be serious rivals to the people who will be setting up shops and who will be trying to carry on this business in the way in which the Minister desires. The Minister is in a dilemma, it seems to me.  If he stops the hawkers he is going to have the poor population who buy fish from them up against him. On the other hand, if he allows the hawkers to continue, what chance will the retailer have against the hawkers? In large centres, of course, where there is a large population who are prepared to pay extra prices, the retailer may have some chance, but in the ordinary small town, say a town of less than 10,000, I do not think these provisions can be carried out.  There is another matter in connection with that question: If the Minister is trying to set up a monopoly he will have to ensure a constant supply of fish to these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even then I submit that in the small towns it would be very doubtful whether a man would find it a paying proposition to invest a couple of hundred pounds in a shop.  Unless he had some other line of business, I think it <Col N="848" /> would not pay him, but how is the Minister or the Association going to assure these people that they are going to have a regular supply of fish? I think that reinforces my argument that the best way to improve the retail and marketing of fish, and to make it presentable and attractive to the consumer, would be to offer some facilities in the shape of loans to people who would be willing to set up shops which would meet with the Minister's requirements. I have nothing more to say in connection with this Bill.  Other speakers will, no doubt, have other things to say, but I am thoroughly disappointed that the Minister has not given us an account of what is actually in the Government's mind in this matter, and the financial facilities they are going to give this Association.  We have no information whatever except that a scheme has been set up, take it or leave it.  If you are not prepared to take this scheme, we will go out to the country and say: &ldquo;You are obstructing us.  You are not anxious to help.&rdquo; If, however, we take this scheme, we accept our share of the responsibility. Before we do accept it, I think we are entitled to a much fuller statement from the Minister as to what these assets are taken for, as to whether he is going to clear off the old debts, and not burden the new Association with them, as to whether he is going to provide capital, and on what basis, and as to whether he is going to pay the expenses. In other words, what will the commitments of the taxpayer be on this whole matter?  If we want to come to a decision on the matter, if we mean to get the work done, we cannot do it without finances.  You are going to put the directors of this Association in an impossible position if you do not make it quite clear to them and to the country that you are giving them a job to do that you feel that they have the ability to do, and which, I am sure, they have, too, if they have the means to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Clery Mr. Clery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clery</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say that I am accepting this measure with rather mixed feelings.  We have got from the Minister for Fisheries for a number of years such outlandish promises and statements from time to time that we <Col N="849" /> are rather doubtful if there is any reality in this measure.  I do not know if it is an indication of a change of policy on the part of the Government that they have decided to set up a Board and to give to them powers to deal with the fishing industry.  I am rather nervous in believing that they are doing this in good faith.  Only a few days ago in Dublin the President of the Executive Council scoffed at the idea of the work of a Department of the State being handed over to a Board set up by this House.  We had suggestions dealing with housing and unemployment a few days ago from this side of the House, that a competent Board be set up to deal with these matters.  The President said that was an easy way out of it for members of the Fianna Fáil Party. He scoffed the idea of a Board to take charge of the work of the Department. Yet we have to-day the Minister introducing a Bill which gives over to a Board set up by the Government power and authority to carry out the work of its Department.  The President stated in this House that doing so was an indication of failure.  I am prepared to accept this from the Minister for Fisheries as an indication of a failure on his part or on that of the Government to deal with the fishing industry.  In the words of the President, I think it is the only way in which things can be accepted.  I am disappointed, too, that after a period of seven or eight years of very great expenditure by the Minister for Fisheries we now only have a proposal to set up a Board to take over his responsibility in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not know what facilities in the way of finance are to be placed at the disposal of the Board.  I think it is simply on the part of the Minister putting off the matter for a little further time.  It is even at the moment, owing to the attitude of the Department of Fisheries, a question for argument as to whether it is wise to attempt even to revive this fishing industry.  The industry has gone into decay so much by the Department for a number of years that it is probably now beyond redemption.  I admit that any Board, Department or Government tackling this big question of fisheries <Col N="850" /> and trying to revive and transform it into a great national asset have a very big task to tackle.  It is probably one of the biggest questions of the moment. It is a matter of whether, if it is to be done at all, it must be tackled in a big, generous way by the Government. It is a question, too, of whether co-operation from all parties will be given; even with all that it will take a long time and very hard work to make it into anything like a paying industry.</P>
    <P>We have a proposal now to hand over certain powers of the Minister to this Board.  Is there a necessity for this Board at all?  We have a fully staffed Department of Fisheries, and if it is decided that they are to stand aside and give over to this Board certain powers to regulate and to organise the fishing industry, what is the Department to do in the meantime?  I hold that the Minister, at any rate, and perhaps some of the officials of his Department will become redundant.  I do not think there is a necessity at all for a Minister for Fisheries if the work for which he has been put into the Front Bench of the Government is to be handed over to a Board.  If a Board is to be appointed because the Minister has not the ability to tackle this question I suggest that members of the Board who have practical knowledge of the fishing industry, like Deputy McDonagh, should perhaps replace the Minister in the Front Bench, and then you might not require a Board at all. You are going to incur a great amount of public expense in setting up this Board.  If it is not going to be at the expense of the public it is going to be at the expense of the industry.  Before it is decided to set up this Board at all I think we should have come to the conclusion that the Minister for Fisheries is incompetent to deal with this question.  We should not have the two going hand in hand.  If you have the Board anxious and earnest to go ahead with the work of building up the industry, and if you have the Minister hampering the industry in every possible way in obstructing the work of the Board I do not think we can get very far ahead.  With regard to the giving of loans, that is according to the <Col N="851" /> rules to be decided by the Board in committee.</P>
    <P>If we had from the Minister a statement dealing with the financial side of things we would see light better than we see it by reading over the Bill, and the rules which give no information whatever on that point.  Are we to take it from the very start of the operation of this Board that the industry is supposed to be able to carry on on its own?  Are we to take it that from the first year the catches of fish have to bear the full expense of the Board and, in addition, to pay back from the very start a percentage of their loans, and the interest on their loans; and in addition, running expenses for boats and gear?  If those are the intentions of the Board and the Minister, I think they may as well not tackle the question at all.</P>
    <P>The industry will not be able to meet its expenses from the start as too much will have to be deducted, according to the rules, from the price of the fish to enable the fishermen to earn a livelihood.  Take, for instance, isolated places, such as those in Mayo, where the industry is carried on in a small way and where the catches are small.  There they are forced to sell their catches to the representative of the Marketing Board.  When the catch is disposed of by the salesman appointed by the Board a percentage of the expense is deducted from the price, so that when they have in addition, to pay interest on loans, insurance premiums, and other expenses, little remains to them.  Indeed I submit that in such localities, where fishing is isolated and catches small, the industry cannot be carried on on a paying basis.  If the Minister intends to tackle this question seriously and if he desires to put it in a sound position, I would seriously suggest that the payment of interest on loans should be waived for the first three, four, or five years, as I am convinced that the industry cannot afford to meet overhead charges and pay back interest on loans, especially during the early stages.  That means that in effect the State will have to subsidise the industry, as is done in other countries where the industry is <Col N="852" /> prosperous.  The Government should be sufficiently interested in the question to inquire into the matter of subsidising it.</P>
    <P>The Government has, after all, found it profitable to subsidise beet growing, the Shannon scheme, and other industries and I submit that this industry, if properly organised, would be of far greater importance and that the risk in regard to subsidies would be less than in the other cases mentioned.  In my opinion the Government should from the start be prepared to deal with it as a great national industry and to subsidise it, at least during the earlier years when the fishermen would be organising and getting their gear and craft together.  It is, in fact, waste of money to tackle the industry in a half-hearted way and I must say that that seems to be the way that it is being tackled in the Bill.  The Minister stated that the great body of fishermen welcomed this measure.  I agree that they welcome it inasmuch as it transfers responsibility, from the Minister, who, they naturally feel, has never attempted seriously to tackle the question.</P>
    <P>I would like to know if certainbranches of the industry which are in a fairly sound financial condition will be affected.  I refer, for instance, to the cray fishing industry, which is carried on fairly successfully in the West, and which seems to be on a fairly sound financial basis.  I would like to know whether it is the intention of the Minister to bring that particular branch of fishing under the-operations of the Board.  In my opinion it would be wrong to do so, seeing that the industry, independently of the Department, is doing well.  The French people connected with the industry found it worth while in Blacksod and other places to establish the fishermen in the industry, and it would, therefore, in my opinion, be unfair now for the Minister to step in and, more or less, to confiscate such industry on behalf of the Board.  It should be allowed to be carried on on its own.</P>
    <P>Now, in regard to the method of paying back loans, I desire to refer to the regulation which gives the right to imprison fishermen who are unable to <Col N="853" /> pay.  This would apply very harshly, especially in a bad season, to the small groups of fishermen in Blacksod, Lacken, and other places along the Mayo coast, where the industry is not organised on a big scale, such as it is in Killybegs, for instance.  I think that these fishermen should be dealt with as isolated cases.  The general rule in regard to compulsory marketing under the Board is, in my opinion, wrong.  The great difficulty in a county like Mayo is not so much the finding of a market but in the provision of boats, nets, gear and landing places. So far as I can see, neither the Bill nor the rules make any proper provision for supplying these necessities, and in my opinion if more attention were given to that end of the industry and less to the organisation of markets better results would be achieved. Another matter which affects us in County Mayo is the need of proper protection from foreign trawlers.  We have been told frequently by the Minister that something was being done in that connection, but nothing seems to have been done.  The presence of these foreign trawlers is, in fact, as big a handicap to the fishermen round that coast as is the lack of boats and gear.  I would like to know whether the proposed Board will have authority to deal with that important question, and, if they have such authority, will they be financed adequately to enable them to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I am sure, realises the great damage inflicted on our local fishermen by foreign trawlers, yet what action has he taken in regard to it?  Has the matter ever been raised at a conference abroad; has it ever been discussed at the Imperial Conference or the League of Nations?  Did our Ministers take up that matter abroad, or did they feel that it was not of sufficient importance to be discussed? This question cannot be ignored, and we would like to hear something about it when the Minister replies.</P>

      <P>It is for you, I admit.  The Minister stated that this is a Bill to put the fishing industry on its feet again.  The Minister claimed that for it.  I do not think he can continue that claim, for this Bill cannot do it.  Why has he not tackled the whole question of fisheries in this measure?  Why has the Minister not tackled the question of foreign trawlers in this measure? Is power to be given to the Board to tackle that, or is it to remain in the hands of the Minister?  I submit that the Minister has not been in earnest at all in tackling this question.  I have been content to remain silent on this matter of fisheries for a considerable time because we got a promise that this question of dealing with foreign trawlers and with matters pertaining to fishing, and to gear and boats, would be dealt with by the Bill which the Minister was to introduce.  In fact, the Minister stated last March that the Bill which he was to introduce would be in operation within three months. Now, in this Bill before us the most important part of that industry is not tackled at all.</P>

      <Col N="855" /> This Bill is a disappointment to me, and if there is any sort of support in this House against the Second Reading, I will be prepared to vote against it and, further, I am prepared to go to the country against the Minister's attitude on this matter.  The Minister's attitude has been the same on this question of fishing for the last seven years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.T. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite admit that this Bill is well-intentioned, but I greatly fear that it commences at the wrong end.  It deals with the selling and not with the catching of fish.  If I were to make a suggestion to the Minister, it is that he would have been well advised had he commenced at the other end and said: &ldquo;First catch your fish and then sell it.&rdquo; This Bill proceeds to deal with the sale of the fish and not with the catching of it.  At the present moment the sale of fish in country towns is in the hands of four different parties.  You have, first, the hawker, who sells it either in the public street or goes from door to door. I gather from a glance at the Bill, which I was only able to see within the last few minutes, as I mislaid the copy which I got, that the Bill does not interfere with the hawker, and I understand, too, that the Minister has so stated.  The second class of people who sell fish in country towns is the hawker, who uses the improved method of selling within shelter and free from the street dust.  He sells in the public market.  Under the Bill as it is drawn, that is to cease.  That fish market is killed under this Bill.  Every fish market in the Saorstát is to be killed.  Sales in the public fish market can no longer be allowed.  I think that is abundantly clear, because you have in Section 12 (e) this statement, that no person is to sell fish in such premises as are not provided with a refrigerator.  That provision must be complied with under Section 12 (e), &ldquo;so situated and fitted as to exclude all contamination.&rdquo;  That will drive the hawker from the fish market and close the fish market.  I would ask, in all seriousness, how that will improve the supply of fish or keep free from possible contamination the selling of fish in country towns?  I would rather <Col N="856" /> suggest that the fish would be sold in those markets, clear and free from dust.  In such cases the sales ought to be permitted.</P>
      <P>I am told all those hawkers who sell fish in the markets keep their fish clean and fresh.  Why should they be turned out on the road?  Why should they be told: &ldquo;You can sell it if you like under dust flying around in the streets and roads but you are not to sell it in the comparative cleanliness of the fish market which is at present open to you&rdquo;?  My suggestion to the Minister is that the closing of these markets and the preventing of these people from selling fish there and driving them into the public streets and from door to door will not tend to end in any way the risk of contamination to the fish which is being sold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third class of fish vendors are rarely seen in country towns.  The population of the town in which I live is somewhat over 3,000 and we were unable to keep up a fish shop.  There are in the two adjoining towns fish shops beautifully kept and as clean as possible.  The owners of these shops make very little out of their business. So far as their actual fish trade is concerned they are doing a very struggling business.  I would say that their net profit would be something between £1 and 30/- a week at the outside.  Under this Bill, such shops are to be closed.  There is no doubt about that.  At the present moment the people carrying on business in those shops if they have any fish exposed for sale keep it in boxes carefully isolated.  They do so for their own protection.  In future, that would be an offence within the meaning of this Bill if it becomes law.  I do suggest that the closing of such fish shops would entail a hardship and would not in any way work in favour of freeing these shops or the fish sold in them from contamination.  It would tend rather in the direction of sending out street hawkers which is still permitted under the Bill.  Now in the case of those people who earn a very wretched livelihood out of the sale of fish I suggest the Minister would usefully get rid not merely of the sub-section which I have read <Col N="857" /> but also of 13 (b) which says that</P>
    <P>all fresh fish on such premises which is offered or intended for sale and is not displayed for sale is kept in a refrigerator which is so situated and fitted as to exclude all contamination and is maintained at a proper temperature.</P>
    <P>These people cannot afford to keep a refrigerator and the order so far as they are concerned will mean that the third class of person I have referred to will have ceased to have all interest in the sale of fish.</P>
    <P>There is a fourth class of person engaged in the sale of fish found in many a country town.  A great many of us who live in the country get our supplies in this way.  We buy from the wholesale fish buyer, who sends his fish to the market as quickly as he can.  He is willing to sell to any person when he has the fish to sell, and he sells these fish on his own premises. That is the best and safest mode of getting fish at present.  It is the method resorted to by most people in country towns, and I know of no better method of getting a good and wholesome supply of fish.  I would much rather buy fish through one of the wholesale men in Bantry, Skibbereen, or Clonakilty, or elsewhere along the sea coast, than through any of the fish merchants in the City of Dublin or any fish merchant in the City of Cork.  In that way you get the fish absolutely fresh as they pass through to the market.  That is the fourth class of fish dealer that I know of in connection with the trade in the country towns whose dealings will be affected by this Bill.  The effect of this measure will be to close down that type of dealer, too, and no longer will a supply of fish through those channels be available for the public. If I send to a fish merchant, as I do from time to time, and ask if he has got any fish, if he dares to send me any fish, he commits a criminal offence and is liable to very serious penalties under this Bill.  I suggest that no useful purpose is served by preventing that trade.  It will mean taking away our best chance of having a fresh and pure supply of fish in Saorstát Eireann.  I think this Bill commences at the wrong end.  Canada has increased <Col N="858" /> her territorial limits so far as trawling is concerned to within ten miles of her coast, and Sweden has increased her limits to four miles.  We are not even at the three-mile limit; we have actually brought the limit to the rocks themselves.  Along our seaboard, along the stretch from Berehaven to the Old Head of Kinsale&mdash;one of the best spawning grounds of the two or three that exist in Europe&mdash;foreign trawlers have been pulling and dragging and actually invading our fisheries to the very rocks.</P>
    <P>I think the new Board and the Minister for Fisheries would have been far better advised if they allowed the people interested in this decaying industry&mdash;at present it has almost ceased to exist&mdash;to put themselves in the position of procuring fishing appliances.  It would have been much better if this Bill were directed towards enabling the poor people, who at present are living in a wretched state, with their boats actually rotting on the beach, to procure proper boats and gear.  At the moment they are afraid if they go to sea they may not get anything, and when they come back they are afraid of meeting the bailiff, who may be waiting to recover the amount of decrees for instalments due.  The Minister would send a far more cheerful message to those people if he said to them: &ldquo;I am going to do something which will enable you to get fish, and when I have done that it will be time enough to look after the sale of the fish.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome certain proposals which are contained in this Bill. I believe there are in the Bill certain features which will help to improve the fishing industry and make better provision for those engaged in it.  It is a Bill long overdue.  In view of the fact that the system outlined in the Bill is more or less an innovation as far as the fishing industry is concerned, I do not propose to severely criticise it or, on the other hand, to pass any eulogies.  I believe the Bill is worthy of a fair trial.  The Minister said that the Sea Fisheries Association is starting from scratch.  In view of the fact that during the last year the imports of fish exceeded exports, and approximately <Col N="859" /> 75 per cent. of the fish landed have been handled by non-Saorstát fishermen, I believe that not alone will the Sea Fisheries Association start from scratch, but it will be conceding large handicaps to the fishing industries of other countries.</P>
      <P>Whether the progress which will be made under this legislation will be at the rate of a 100 yards sprint, or whether it will be progress at the rate of a snail-like crawl, depends to a very great extent upon a subject with which the Minister has not dealt.  The Minister said that the Association, in its early years, has to rely on State assistance.  One would naturally have come to the conclusion that he would have let the House know what amount of assistance was going to be given to the Sea Fisheries Association.  If this industry is going to be a success the Association, through the Minister's Department, will require to have placed at its disposal a very large amount of money.</P>
      <P>On many occasions I have criticised the Minister's Department for the manner in which he has dealt with our fishing industry, but I have always pointed out that I believe the Department of Finance was responsible to a much greater extent owing to the fact that a sufficient amount of money was not placed at the disposal of the Department of Fisheries.  I hope that will not apply as far as the Sea Fisheries Association is concerned.  I hope the Minister for Fisheries will have a long chat with the Minister for Finance, and will point out the great possibilities of the fishing industry.  I hope he will be able to prevail on the Minister for Finance to open his purse-strings to a wider extent than he has hitherto done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that there would he a democratic method of election to the Committee.  I desire to register a most emphatic protest against the selection by the Minister of the directors who are to control the operations of the Association.  One must take into consideration that the most important centre of the fishing industry in the Saorstát is Donegal. The Minister apparently has overlooked those who are experts in the <Col N="860" /> industry in Donegal.  It must be remembered that the fishing industry in Donegal is very successful in comparison with other counties in the Saorstát. I do not think it is right that that county should be overlooked by the Minister when selecting people to act as directors on this Association.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the situation that has not been dealt with by the Minister.  What is to be the power of the directors?  Are they to be subject to the will of this House, or are they to be like the Electricity Supply Board&mdash;an independent body, not answerable to the House?  I hope the Minister will deal with that question, as it is an important one.  On Friday last, when speaking on the Relief Vote, Deputy Lemass made a suggestion regarding the setting up of a certain board, and the President, in reply, said that he believed the suggestion had been made in order to try and take the responsibility off the shoulders of certain people.  I should like to know is this board to be set up without having any responsibility to this House?  I am open to correction if it is not so, but it appears to me to be an attempt on the part of the Department to take the responsibility off their shoulders and put it on the shoulders of a private company, whose directors are selected by the Minister, and not elected.</P>
    <P>The Minister said his Department would have power to hand over boats and gear, and also lands and buildings, to the Association on terms to be arranged.  I take it that this Association will be a private company.  It is well known that the old Congested Districts Board set up by the British Government, which used to provide it with £41,000 per year, each year purchased or erected for the use of the people certain buildings in congested areas.  I question very much whether the Fisheries Department have power to take these buildings from the people and hand them over to a private company.  Under Rule 4 the Association will have power to sell these buildings.  As the buildings were provided by the Congested Districts Board I do not think it would be fair to hand them over to a private company, <Col N="861" /> as the time might come when that company would sell them to some other private company to be used for some other purpose than that originally intended by the Congested Districts Board.  There is one thing that I do welcome, and that is the provision for the repayment of loans.  As the Minister pointed out, under the present system loans are paid in instalments twice a year.  I think it is a much better system that they should be paid back out of catches.</P>
    <P>When the Department came to deal with this question of sea fisheries it was rather a pity that they did not endeavour to nationalise the industry rather than to hand the control over to a private company.  It is well known that, taking the fishing industry generally, whether inland or sea fishing, there are quite a large number of several fisheries owned by private persons that were granted hundreds of years ago through certain charters in the time of Charles II.  These fisheries are run in the interests of a comparatively few people.  While the people engaged in the industry generally are eking out a very poor livelihood tens of thousands of pounds are going into the hands of a few people who inherited these several fisheries.  The money is being sent out of the country to enrich a few people.  The Minister may say that a discussion with reference to the nationalisation of fisheries is outside the terms of the Bill, and I admit it is, to a certain extent.</P>

      <P>I am sorry the Minister did not endeavour to put this industry on a national basis rather than hand it back, if you like, to private enterprise.  There is another matter that has not been dealt with. A considerable time ago the Minister promised to introduce a Bill for the revaluation of boats.  That has not been done since.  The Minister says the industry is starting from scratch.</P>

      <P>If this Bill is to be <Col N="862" /> made a success and if the fishing industry is to be put on its feet in the way we are all anxious to see done, I make an appeal to the Minister that the small outstanding loans of the poorer fishermen should be wiped out and that we should start anew.  I hope the Minister will let us know definitely whether this Association is to be subject to the will of the House or whether it is to be in the same position as the Electricity Supply Board and that this House is to have no control over it.</P>

      <P>I do not think the same principle could possibly apply to the two things.  With regard to Section 13, if Deputy J.T. Wolfe's criticism be correct it would seem to indicate extraordinarily careless drafting.  That suggestion is supported by an examination of the sub-section that Deputy Wolfe did not refer to&mdash;sub-section (c), under which it becomes an offence if there are at any time on any day in such premises any offals removed from fish on any previous day.  I think that to be able to identify at, say, 12 o'clock in the morning, offals that belong to the previous day will require very expert inspection.  The inspector, I imagine, would want to be a genius to be able to say, at 12 o'clock on Saturday, that the offals in the shop belonged to the previous evening and not to that morning.  I wonder what the Minister means by introducing a sub-section of that kind?  I think it would be utterly impossible to put such a sub-section into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry I was out of the House when the Minister was speaking, but I wish he would make clear in what way surplus fish are to be disposed of. There is considerable alarm in Arklow with regard to the abolition of the auctioneers.  It is stated that at present all auctioneers buy the surplus fish and the fishermen there want to <Col N="863" /> know whether, when professional auctioneers, who must have no connection with the industry, are brought in to replace the existing auctioneers, they will have any responsibility for the fish that will remain unsold.</P>
    <P>It appears at present that a great many, in fact the bulk of the auctioneers, buy the surplus fish after the auction is over.  A number of fishermen send their fish regularly to auctioneers, and that is their common method of disposing of them.  In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred these auctioneers themselves are fish merchants, and it seems a very drastic change to do away with that system and to introduce into the business people who need have no connection with or any experience of the fishery business.  In the interests of those I am concerned with I would like to hear how this system is to work.</P>
    <P>Will the Association itself take over the surplus fish, and will they guarantee prices corresponding to the prices realised at the auctions?  I hardly think the Minister can expect the Dáil to pass Section 3 of the Bill.  It is entirely too drastic to establish as the law of the land that when a fisherman fails to pay his instalments he shall be liable to imprisonment.  No matter what confidence one might have in the directors of the Association or the discrimination or mercy they might exercise, I think the Dáil would be very wrong if it left such a responsibility in the hands of any body of men.</P>
    <P>There are a few things in the rules that seem to me calculated to demand a good deal of attention.  For instance, Rule 13 (b) provides that &ldquo;each particular party to the contract shall comply with all reasonable directions given by or with the authority of the Committee.&rdquo;  Now, &ldquo;reasonable directions&rdquo; seems to offer an opportunity for a lot of contention and bickering.  Every fisherman will consider any direction that he gets, and does not wish to adopt, unreasonable, of course, and the directors, as regards any direction or instruction they issue, will regard it as perfectly reasonable, and I think there is no provision made for arbitration between the two interests. Then the phrase in Rule 16, <Col N="864" />&ldquo;inevitable accident,&rdquo; offers, I think, a similar opportunity for dispute and contention.</P>
    <P>Then as to Rule 17, I would like if the Minister would throw a little more light on the intention of the organisers with regard to the matter dealt with in that rule.  The rule is: &ldquo;The expenses to be allowed as running expenses under the provisions of an agreement for hiring shall be such expenses as are customarily treated as the running expenses of similar boats or classes of boats in the area in which the usual port or place of departure of the boat for fishing operations will be situated,&rdquo; etc.</P>
    <P>At present it seems a great many fishermen have to go out a long distance from their base and have to incur credit in the district in which they are operating.  They have no working capital.  They get food and oil for their boats and other requisites on credit because they are well known.  It is stated that a good many bills were unpaid in such places because it was held that the Government was responsible for the despatch of the boats on the particular occasions and the fishermen denied liability.  For that reason this rule is going to be scrutinised very carefully and of course its working will be of considerable importance to the fishermen.  Are these expenses to be paid in advance?  Are the fishermen going out in a boat to be given a certain amount of money to pay the running expenses while operating in these distant places or, will they get letters of credit to authorise them to incur expenses up to a certain point or what is to be the method?  It is said by some fishermen with whom I have been discussing the matter, that unless they get such credit they could not attempt to work; unless they can get the money into their hands at the beginning of the season after they have been many weeks idle or, unless they get authority to get goods on credit they would not be able to fish. I would ask the Minister to explain as carefully as he can what method he proposes with regard to that rule.</P>
    <P>To come back for a moment to Section 13 of the Bill I hope that even <Col N="865" /> if the Minister discovers that the drafting is faulty he will not entirely part with the principle.  To my knowledge a great many people in the country hardly know the taste of fish simply because they are not prepared to purchase it from people dealing in it at the present time, because they have no confidence that the fish is preserved in a cleanly state from the time of its arrival.  I think nothing will do so much to create a good home market for fish as the assurance of cleanliness.  Goodness knows the minimum equipment for a proper fish shop is not a very severe one.  The equipment required is a refrigerator and fish slab.  In that connection I think it would be well if some effort was made to grade such shops; if there could be some inducement to people to provide really efficient and attractive fish shops with, say, tiled walls and general equipment that would give an assurance that the fish were being preserved and could be relied upon to be as safe from contamination as if they had been only just taken from the sea.</P>
    <P>It is very hard to express an opinion as to the future of this Association, but I am sure everybody will hope that it will be some improvement on the conditions that prevailed in the past seven or eight years.  It is better to do something at least of a constructive kind than to do nothing, and it is not too much to say that the progress of fishing in the past seven or eight years has been altogether backward.  If the Association can make a good, determined effort to capture the home market, and if they can provide an efficient system of transport from the fishing ports to the inland centres, if they could induce some persons to purchase properly equipped motor vans which would sell fish at the cross-roads and villages, then I think they would do a great deal for the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>There is need for dealing immediately with this question of outstanding loans.  I have just received a letter from Arklow, which informs me that at a meeting of the committee of the Fishermen's Association, held last Monday evening to consider the new Fisheries Bill, the following resolution was unanimously adopted: &ldquo;That we <Col N="866" /> ask the three members of Dáil Eireann for the county to raise the important question of revaluation.  We believe no improvement can take place in the industry unless outstanding loans on boats be either wiped out or reduced, at least, to present market value.  We are satisfied that it would be utterly impossible to procure crews for fishingboats, or take any interest in the prosecution of the industry, unless the present commitments be reduced to an economic value.&rdquo;  If the new Revaluation Bill were safely through the Dáil, and if the fishermen who have persevered and carried on the industry, in spite of all difficulties, knew their actual banking position, and were aware of all the liabilities&mdash;if this were done, and if the question of marketing were attacked vigorously; if a tarift were imposed, or some protection given to the home-fishing industry, and if an efficient system of transport were provided, then, in my opinion, we could look forward to a very considerable advance in the industry.  I hope the directors of the new Association will not lose time in setting vigorously to work to effect these reforms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that this Bill is remarkable more for what it does not contain than for what it contains.  We have been waiting for the last seven or eight years for something to be done by the Minister for Fisheries for the fisheries of the Free State.  For that time, the mountain has been in labour and now it has brought forth a mouse.  We are presented with a Bill&mdash;I am sorry that the Minister has seen fit to go away at this juncture&mdash;which contains only one clause that has any importance at all.  The importance of that clause lies in the fact that the Minister, like Pontius Pilate, has washed his hands of the whole question of fisheries in the Free State and has thrown the responsibility on to the shoulders of the Committee or Association, the directors of which have been appointed by himself, or those representing him in his Department.  The one clause of importance in the Bill is that wherein the Minister hands over all responsibility to a certain Association to carry out the duties <Col N="867" /> which the Minister should have carried out during the past seven years.  The Minister was entitled in this House, or outside this House, to do certain things for the fisheries of the Free State.  Those things, I say here and now, the Minister has not done.  The Minister had grants given to him of moneys allocated by the Dáil and he came to us in the last financial year and said that those grants were not availed of.  Nobody could understand why those grants were not availed of, because the fishing industry in the Saorstát had declined year after year during the period of his administration.  Nobody could understand why the fishermen, who were living in semi-starvation around our seaboard, were not availing of the opportunity of using moneys allocated to the Minister for the purpose of re-establishing them in the fishing industry. The Minister had under his control during all that period a number of boats.  Those boats were rotting at their moorings during all the time of his administration.  Now, as I said, like Pontius Pilate, he has washed his hands of the responsibility and proposes to hand over all those boats and all that gear to do work which he was supposed to have been doing during the period of his administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part II relates to the handing over of the Minister's responsibility to the Fisheries Association.  The Minister purposes to transfer any property in boats and any gear he may have under his control to this Association, so that it may take upon itself the responsibility of dealing directly with the fishermen of the Saorstát.  The Minister has formulated a lot of rules and regulations whereby that Association is supposed to deal with the fishermen and thus take the responsibility off the Department.  I hope that in thus washing his hands of responsibility the Minister is not making a scapegoat for himself, and is not creating a lot of red tape whereby the fishermen will be compelled to go firstly to the Association and say: &ldquo;We are in destitution; we want to be supplied with boats and <Col N="868" /> gear,&rdquo; and that then the Association will say: &ldquo;We are sorry the Minister has not done so, and so to facilitate you; apply to the Minister.&rdquo;  The fishermen might then have to apply to the Minister, who would tell them that the matter was one for the Association. If this were to occur, the fishermen would find themselves in the position of the fool in the middle.  There is only one important clause in the wholes Bill.  The importance of it lies in the fact that the Minister has washed his hands of all responsibility, and has made his Department what might be described as defunct.  If the Minister is not empowered to deal directly with the fishermen, if he has not carried out his duties during the past seven years, and if he now throws the responsibility on to the Association, then he should have automatically dissolved his own Department and let the Association, which is his nominee, carry out the job he was supposed to do.</P>
    <P>There are Parts IV and V and a lot of other parts in this Bill, but what do they amount to?  They are a lot of inartistic, useless padding to the one important section of the Bill.  The Minister wants to teach people how to sell fish off a marble slab and how to auction fish.  We have plenty of auctioneers under the Department of the Minister who are quite competent to auction all the fish that are at present being caught in the Saorstát.  If the Minister walks around the streets of Dublin, he will find that the retailers of fish are quite competent to sell fish. He will find that they are complying with every regulation which the Minister at this late stage has included in the Bill, and that they were complying with all these regulations before the Minister was knee-high to a grasshopper. You do not want to teach fishmongers how to sell fish.  What you require to do is to protect the fishermen and provide them with such boats and gear as will enable them to catch fish.  It will be easy enough to sell the fish after that.  Mrs. Beeton, in her cookery book, has a phrase which has become famous.  &ldquo;First catch your hare, and then make soup of it.&rdquo;  In the Free State we must first catch the fish, and we can sell them afterwards.</P>
    <P>The Minister need not worry about <Col N="869" /> the selling.  All these sections which pretend to deal with the selling of the fish are so much padding to the single section in which the Minister washes his hands of his responsibilities. There are fishermen around the seaboard of the Saorstát who have been in semi-starvation for years.  They have looked for relief to the Minister, but they have not got it.  Many of them have emigrated.  They have gone across to England and Scotland to work in the harvest or at any job by which they could eke out an existence. After seven or eight years the Minister comes along and wedges in one important section in the Bill, and then gives us a lot of junk in the remainder of it about the selling of fish.  It is like teaching our grandmothers how to suck eggs.</P>
    <P>We expected that if the Minister produced a Fishery Bill there would be something in it in reference to the burning question that arose in this Dáil time after time&mdash;that is, the question of the several fisheries.  The Minister has done nothing so far about that.  That is why I say that the present Bill is remarkable, not for what it contains, but for what is left out. The Minister is going to throw any little responsibility he had on to the shoulders of a certain Association.  I am not casting any aspersions on the individual members of that Committee when I say that the Minister might have chosen more widely when he was forming it.  He might have chosen from some areas like those along the Donegal seaboard, where the fisheries are a very important item in the scheme of things.  I could give the Minister the names of men who are auctioneers under the Department, who might have been chosen from Killybegs, from the Downings, from Bunerana or elsewhere in that area. I do not see the name of any practical man on that Committee from that part of the country.  When the Minister formulated this Bill he did it&mdash;I say it distinctly, definitely, and without any equivocation&mdash;in order to take himself out of a hole, a hole in which he has been for years and out of which, on his own initiative, he has not been able to get.  When he chose this Committee he might have chosen it more widely, <Col N="870" /> and he might not have served up a lot of eye-wash such as we are being served with now.  If that is all the Minister has been able to do, after all the advice he has been able to get from his Department and all the advice he could get from outside sources, then I say to the Minister that when he is handing over the responsibility to the outside Association to do his job he might have automatically dissolved his own Department and thus saved some money for the State.</P>
    <P>I would recommend the Minister not to try to teach people how to retail fish.  I would recommend the Minister, if he still pretends to have any control over his own Department or over the Association that is his creation, to try to help the people of the Saorstát, some of whom are in a state of semi-starvation along the seaboard&mdash;to help them to catch fish and not to try to teach people who know more about it than the Minister can ever hope to know, how to sell fish.  That is not what we want in this country.  We want protection for our own fishermen from foreign trawlers and foreign corporations that are fishing along the seaboard here and taking the bread out of our fishermen's mouths.  We want protection from the small bodies of people in this country who own charters and who make thousands of pounds out of chartered waters and spend it in other countries.  We want, first of all, protection from all these people for our own fishermen.  Then we want full facilities for our fishermen to catch fish around our coasts.</P>
    <P>We do not want to be beholden to anybody but to our own countrymen for any facilities that these fishermen may get.  We want all the facilities at the disposal of the Minister and of the Association he has set up.  We are not begging the Minister or the Association for them, because when they give that assistance out of the moneys that may be given into their control, it is not their own money they spend.  It is the money which belongs to the State, and the Minister or the Association do not produce that money like a conjuror taking rabbits out of a hat.  We do not want to go to the Minister with hat in hand asking him for God's sake to give the fishermen <Col N="871" /> some facilities to earn a livelihood in their own country.  All we want is our own money, and we are not going to eulogise the Minister and to tell him that he is a little tin god on wheels because he gives a certain little grant for fisheries.  All we want is that the Minister should do the job he has been appointed to do and that the Association should likewise do the job for which they are appointed.  We want them to expend the money that may be given to them to foster this industry. Then they will have done the job for which they were appointed.</P>

      <P>The Bill which is under discussion at the moment does not answer the question which I have frequently put to the Minister since I came into the House.  It does not answer the question which I asked him to answer in the adjournment debate last July, and it certainly does not answer the question which any sensible Deputy should ask himself before taking part in a discussion on this subject: have the Government any definite well-considered policy, and have they produced any definite well-considered plan for attacking this problem of the fishing industry on a national scale? We have been hammering at this question particularly for the last two years, seeking to secure from the responsible head of the Department in this House an answer to the question as to whether or not the Government really believe that the fishing industry is worthy of salvation?  What is his mentality on this subject?  We should know whether it was considered only as a question for dilly-dallying or tinkering with, or whether a really serious attempt was in contemplation to deal with the problem in order that this industry, which could easily be made to rank as the second largest in the country, could be saved.  After all these months of waiting, and after all the hopes held out in the adjournment debate of last July of a comprehensive Bill which would stabilise the industry and put it on its feet, we now get this measure before us as the only constructive solution which the Department of Fisheries can offer for the salvation of the fishing industry.  Although I welcomed <Col N="872" /> the establishment of the Fisheries Co-operative Board last July. and had high hopes that in consequence of the initiative shown on that occasion something concrete would materialise I must frankly admit that I am disappointed with this Bill.  I am afraid that the fishermen around our seaboard, before whom this measure was dangled for the last six months, will really be disillusioned when they find out what it means.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that the Government, through the Department of Fisheries, cannot make up their minds once and for all on this question.  Is the industry worth saving or is it not?  Is it worth a serious attempt on the part of the Executive Council to decide whether it is possible to do something to pull it out of the decayed condition into which it has been allowed to get? It is a pity that the question has not been taken seriously and answered, because methods of this nature and Bills of this type are in reality only attempts at tinkering and pot-mending and do not get at the source of the evil.  They do not suggest a proper remedy for the evil and are, in fact, only a waste of time and public money. It was not fair to lead people to believe that a comprehensive measure was going to be introduced to stabilise the industry and introduce instead a milk-and-water Bill like this, three-fourths of which is devoted to telling people how to sell fish, people who, in fact, have neither boats nor gear with which to fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In introducing the Bill the Minister stated that he thought that the fishermen would welcome it.  As I have said, I will vote for the Bill on the principle that something is better than nothing but I am very much afraid that this feeling of disillusionment will become more widespread than the Minister seems to imagine. Deputy Wolfe pointed out the danger when he analysed the provisions of the Bill in regard to fish shops in Section 4.  He mentioned, what every Deputy who reads the Bill will realise, namely, that it abolishes fish shops. It closes the markets, abolishes the wholesale merchants who sell retail and it leaves the hawkers.  That is a revolutionary proposal, in fact the <Col N="873" /> only one in the Bill, but in my view it is not going to do much good.  I am afraid that the Bill will have to be drastically amended before it satisfies even the most optimistic Deputy on the Government side.  It is not a serious attempt to deal with the problem.  It is a poor effort to submit to the House after nearly two years' consideration.  I remember in 1928, in answer to a question of mine in regard to the introduction of the Bill, that the Minister promised to bring it in before the Recess of that year.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains one item of which I approve very strongly, but I am very much afraid that it may be abused and nullified by the amount of red tape by which it will be surrounded. I refer to the system of hire purchase for nets and gear.  I believe that such a system, without such red tape regulations as the provision of two securities, will have good results.  Provided that it is not destroyed by the amount of red tape that is placed around it, I believe that such a provision will assist competent fishermen who know their job to secure boats, nets and gear, a proposition which under present circumstances cannot be regarded as economic.  I hope that those engaged in administering the measure will see that loans will be readily given with the least possible trouble to the men and to the Department, and that months will not, as previously be allowed to lapse before such loans are sanctioned.  The defects in the Bill are numerous, so numerous, in fact, that it will be possible to amend it to such an extent that the Minister will hardly recognise it when it emerges from Committee.  I should like to know where the finances are to come from.  So far as I can see from reading the rules the proposed Board will not have powers such as those which other Corporations and boards established by the Government have to secure sufficient finance.</P>
    <P>The Minister should indicate whether the Government intend to provide a lump sum to finance the operations of the measure, because, if not, I am afraid that the Bill is only an illusion, and that we are discussing a matter <Col N="874" /> which depends for its success on small subscriptions.  The Minister should give some indication as to what steps the Government intend to take in regard to financing the Association. Perhaps he would also disclose his mentality in regard to the assets to be transferred to the new Association. Will these assets include the old debts incurred by fishermen for loans for the provision of boats and nets under a system which has proved uneconomic? Time after time we have asked the Minister to wipe off these debts, as in our opinion it will prove impossible to collect them.  If the new Association starts with that millstone around its neck, I am afraid that any good purpose which might be served by the Bill will be lost.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wolfe and others spoke of the need of protection.  Time after time I stressed the fact that all efforts to stabilise the fishing industry, and all attempts to reconstruct it, would prove to be a failure unless the waters around our coast were adequately protected. Deputy Wolfe spoke of the extension of territorial waters in countries like Canada and Sweden.  The United States of America have also extended their territorial waters, and no international squabble followed.  Surely some effort should have been made at the Hague by our representatives some nine months ago to secure an extended limit of territorial waters of eight or ten miles, outside which all foreign boats must keep.  Unless a concrete constructive effort is made on all fronts I do not see any possibility of satisfactory results coming out of this attempt to save the industry.  This Bill, at any rate, will not save it.  It is an attempt on a very small scale to do so, and I suppose it is better than nothing.  In the hope that the Minister may have some sort of brainwave as a result of this discussion, and will decide to produce the comprehensive Bill which he has long promised, including the branding of mackerel and the re-casting of loans, and in the hope that the Bill will be improved in Committee. I intend to vote for it.  I hope that the Minister will take seriously the suggestions which have been offered here with a desire to assist the industry, and will support the efforts <Col N="875" /> which will be made in Committee to amend the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When leave was asked in the Dáil to introduce a Fisheries Bill we thought naturally that big questions of sea fisheries would be tackled in the Bill.  Practically every speaker has drawn attention to the difficulties the industry is up against. The biggest one of all is the protection of territorial waters.  The protection of territorial waters is the big complaint we have all been raising in this House and been putting before our constituencies for the last four or five years.  The Minister has never given a satisfactory answer as to how he is to deal with this matter.  As a matter of fact he attempted to frighten Deputy Clery off the question by saying it was a matter for a speech on the estimates.  Even if it were raised on the estimates the Minister has never dealt with it.  If the Minister has any constitutional or international difficulties he should take this House into his confidence to see if we are going to help him out of his difficulty, but this trying to evade the question is hardly good enough. At any rate the Bill does not deal <Col N="876" /> with this question.  The fishermen are to be left in the position that the foreign trawlers can come in and take the fish that they are entitled to.</P>
      <P>The second question the fishermen were up against was the repayment of loans.  I believe the new Board will have the question of the repayment of loans in their hands.  I do not know whether they are going to be any more lenient than the Minister but the power of re-valuation is not given to this Society and until the Minister introduces a Bill on re-valuation the fishermen will still be saddled with a huge debt which they are not able to pay.  It is well, however, that they will be empowered to get boats, equipment and so on in the Society, and it may help fishermen in some cases to get along with the industry provided the fish are there. They are not there in some cases as a result of foreign trawlers.  I agree with Deputy Wolfe that the Bill has more or less started in the wrong place.  It is not so much that we should start at the consumption as at the catching of the fish, making it possible for the men to catch more fish and then to market them to better advantage.  It may help men to market their fish to better advantage but it does not see that the fish will be left there for our own Irishmen to catch.  The prices fishermen are getting for their fish are not at all fair.  I have seen during the summer, in different parts of the country, not alone in my own but in the Minister's constituency, lobsters caught and the fishermen were not geting as much as fifty per cent. of what the consumers were paying for a lobster in Dublin.  If there were any sort of orderly market then surely lobster which is not a very perishable fish ought to yield more than fifty per cent. to the fishermen of what it cost to the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As conditions are in the fishing industry, we have an increasing amount of fish coming each year into the country, and the amount of fish caught by our own fishermen is going down every year.  The Bill would appear to me to make it possible for foreign fish to be sold here with advantages in competition with our own fish in many <Col N="877" /> cases.  For instance, if we are to licence the number of retail shops, and if we are to make it a condition that whatever retail shops are left must have refrigerators, it would appear to me that the native fishing industry will have no advantage whatever over the imported fish.  If fish is to be kept in a refrigerator it will not matter very much whether it is kept 36 hours or 12 hours.  In that way foreign fish will be put on an equal footing with our native catches.  If we are to make it difficult for people to sell fish; if we charge them for licences and put them to the expense of remodelling their premises and buying marble slabs, naturally the shopkeeper who does that will try to recoup himself out of the sale of his fish afterwards, and in all probability we will find that the fishermen will be getting a smaller share of the price of the fish than at present.  I do not know whether our fishermen or the fishing industry can stand that or not, and whether the men can continue to remain in the industry if they are to get a smaller percentage from the sale of the fish than at present.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Minister, in the matter of fines, can be very well shown by Section 3 of this Bill as compared with other sections.  The Minister proposes in this Bill to fine a fisherman for the first offence a sum not exceeding £20, and in the case of a second offence for a breach of his contract a sum of £50, or, at the discretion of the court, imprisonment for any term not exceeding six months. That would be fining the fisherman for not paying an instalment of the loan through circumstances which he could not avoid and over which he has no control.  He may have passed through had times, and may not be in a position to meet these instalments, but still he is threatened with fines and imprisonment.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if you take the wholesalers and the auctioneers, usually clever and wealthy men, men who will commit offences under this Bill with their eyes open, you will notice that these are only to be fined £20.  Why should a wholesaler or an auctioneer, usually wealthy men and men who know when they are doing <Col N="878" /> wrong, get off with a fine of £20 while the poor fisherman who makes a default in his annuity, a thing that possibly he may not be able to help, is to be imprisoned for six months?  I think if the Minister had seriously considered this Section 3 before the Bill was introduced he would not have allowed that section to go before the Dáil in its present form.  Deputy J.T. Wolfe pointed out what would appear to be very serious defects in this Bill with regard to retail shops, and Deputy Moore pointed out very serious defects both in the rules and in the Bill.  It is not to the credit of the Minister, who has not been kept very busy in his Department during the last nine years, and who, in that time, has not done much constructive work, that he should allow such a Bill as the present to come before the Dáil, a Bill with such serious defects.  However, if the Minister will reconsider the matter on Committee Stage and have these defects remedied he will improve the Bill.</P>
    <P>In the last two years the Minister had only two things in his Department to which he had to attend.  The first was collecting instalments on loans. That was the principal function of his Department.  Fishermen all over the country tell me that the only communication they ever got from the Minister was one asking them to pay their loans; the second function was the matter of the marketing of fish, a thing to which he did not at all attend. Under this Bill the marketing of fish has been handed over to this new society, and the collection of instalments has also been handed over to them.  What function will remain to the Minister when this Bill goes through?  I think there is only one thing more for the Minister to do, and that is to bring in a Bill for the re-valuation of loans.  After the loans are revalued the Minister should follow up with a Bill to eliminate himself and wind up his Department.  I would very much like if the Minister would tell us what his function will be when this Bill becomes law.  I would like if he would tell us what duties lie will have to fulfil, or if he can justify himself and continue on and call himself Minister for Fisheries?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>As one of the three representatives from perhaps the most important fishing district in Ireland, I must say I feel somewhat disappointed about this Bill.  In our district the question is not so much that of catching fish.  It is rather a question of disposing of the fish when caught.  We find that here in Dublin, when the fish is caught, two shillings a dozen is the price charged for herrings, while the fishermen are only paid five shillings a mease.  If this Association will do nothing else but provide a market, and enable the men who catch the fish to dispose of it, it will have done something good.  I do not put the blame for the depression in the fishery industry in the last seven years on the Department of Fisheries.  I realise their difficulties.  I realise that the Department of Finance has been all along pressing the Department of Fisheries, and refusing to sanction loans to fishermen for boats and gear. We have time after time appealed for a revaluation of the boats.  In 1927 a promise was made that a Bill would be brought in for the revaluation of boats and gear.  We are all aware that boat? and gear are not worth one-fifth of what was given for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1927 the Minister promised a scheme whereby everybody owing £100 would get a reduction of 20 per cent. The Minister said to-day that he has started an Association from the scratch.  On the contrary, it is not from the scratch.  There is a great handicap.  If you are to hand over the debts and liabilities and the collection of loans to the Association, I fear very much it will not come up to the expectations of the Minister, and for this reason that the fishermen are in the position, that they have already paid in interest plus insurance, five times the amount of what they originally borrowed.  I would suggest to the Minister that before handing over the boats to the Association he would bring in a Bill for revaluing the boats and gear.  He would thus start the fishermen from scratch.  In many cases it is impossible to get crews for these boats.  That is especially so in the case of young men, because they see that fishing is naturally a matter of chance. If the Minister will organise a fish <Col N="880" /> market through this Association in local areas he will have done something.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Moore, Deputy O'Mahony and others, I have received a resolution from people interested in the fishing industry, and they point out that unless the Minister immediately brings in a Bill dealing with the revaluation of boats, they have grave doubts as to the success of the Association contemplated under this measure.  I am sure every Deputy wishes this Association success, because the fishermen have suffered untold hardships during the last four or five years, if you are introducing a Bill and forming a new Association to better their conditions, surely you should give this Association a free hand in the matter and not be compelling fishermen to go to courts in connection with their loans.  Many of these men have proved that in interest alone they have paid fully five times what they got originally.  Through no fault of their own they have fallen on bad times, and through the loss of gear and other materials they are not in a financial position to meet all their obligations.  They have always been willing to pay.  I am sure the Minister will be willing to testify that 90 per cent. of the men of Arklow have met their liabilities as far as any body of men could meet them.  They have had their difficulties from time to time and yet the Department&mdash;possibly it is the Department of Finance that is responsible&mdash;has time after time been sending processes to these men.</P>
    <P>On another occasion I mentioned here that they refused to give gear to the men.  The fact is that the shopkeepers in Arklow will have to continue giving credit to the fishermen. The shopkeepers are the people who have been doing the work which the Department of Fisheries should have been doing.  I know there are shopkeepers in Arklow who gave the fishermen there gear, boats and food.  If the season is a successful one they are repaid. All this should be the work of the Fisheries Department, but this Department refused to give loans to fishermen because, apparently, the Finance Department would not sanction. While I am prepared to vote for <Col N="881" /> this Bill, if conditions are to be the same under the new Association, I have grave doubts that it will meet with the success the Minister expects. Last year, in Arklow, the Minister mentioned that he was bringing in this Bill.  It has been introduced now, and I must say that we are gravely disappointed with it.  However, as far as it goes, we will support it.  We ask the Minister to allow the fishermen to start on scratch.  Let the Society take them over and let them begin with a clean slate and so put them in the position of making the fishing industry a success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not done justice to whatever there is in the Bill.  We would prefer to see a constructive measure introduced than to see something brought forward which is entirely useless.  We have not had sufficient data from the Minister to be able to treat the Bill even tenderly.  The Minister has not told us what the scheme of operation is to be.  He has not showed us how he expects the fishing industry is going to be properly established.  One gathers from the Bill that the idea is to deal with the home market rather than with a foreign market.  It deals largely with shops and the sale of fish.  In so far as it deals with the home market one welcomes the effort although I must say that in its present condition the Bill is extremely defective.  It is so defective that I anticipate the Minister will have to withdraw it and recast it before it again enters the House.  Before the discussion finishes I hope we will hear what the full scheme is and how they hope to build up a market in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been stated that the Irish people will not eat fish.  It has been pointed out from these benches on the Estimates and during other discussions that the method of selling fish and the transport of fish are so defective, especially in the inland towns, that people have almost forgotten how to cook fish in a really good way. These are all problems upon which we expected the Minister to give the House some assistance.  He might have told us how he expected the sale <Col N="882" /> of fish was going to be developed.  He has imposed certain restrictions upon the vendors of fish.  He has given no outline of how the scheme is to be financed.  From the point of view of the fishermen we have no idea where the finance is to come from for equipment. All we know is that certain directors are to be nominated and elected.  We know that each member of the co-operative society is to take a share.  According to statements made in the House there are about 1,000 whole-time fishermen.  That statement was made in reference to the Gaeltacht. Possibly there are about 10,000 part-time fishermen.  I assume a share would be £1.  Suppose each of these fishermen took one share, that would mean a total capital of £11,000.  I have in mind now a little Irish-speaking village near Ring.  I refer to Ballinagow.  Fifty years ago in that little village it was considered a lucky thing if the daughter of a farmer from the hills at the back got married into one of these families because at that time the fishing industry in Ballinagow was in a very prosperous condition.  At the present time in that village there is scarcely a young person.  All the people living there are old people, and all the young people have emigrated. People accuse these fishermen of being lazy, and of not going out to fish. Obviously the reason why men who had such an excellent tradition in fishing and who had had very prosperous periods do not engage in fishing now is because they cannot make any money out of it.</P>
    <P>Presumably there will be three parties to this scheme, the fishermen, the directors, and the people who will supply the finance from somewhere. It is a very important thing that the finance should come from people who, as it were, will not be parties interested. For instance, if certain people in that industry are going to be interested in the sale of fish, or if they are in a position to exercise undue influence over fishermen, they should not be placed in the position of supplying finance.  The Minister has a certain controlling interest, and he is going to be in an extremely awkward position, in that he may have to put <Col N="883" /> up a stiff fight in favour of the fishermen against the people who put up the money.  The co-operative basis of this Bill is not complete co-operation.  It is just that defective co-operation which has already been attacked by Deputy Derrig.  It is co-operation which does not mean that there are bonuses to be granted to fishermen; it is not put on a profit-sharing basis.</P>
    <P>We are really at a loss in criticising the Bill, because the Minister has not outlined the scheme as a whole and put it before us in the proper light. Reference has been made to the territorial waters.  One would have imagined that in dealing with this question the territorial waters would also have been dealt with.  Deputy Wolfe has referred to what has been done in other countries.  He mentioned that in Sweden he thought the limit was four miles, and that in Canada it had been fixed at ten miles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very interesting light on the situation, but it just falls upon the wrong place from the Minister's point of view, because I have recently had a complaint again from Dunmore that even within the three-mile limit, such as it is, the British trawlers seem to be able to do absolutely <Col N="884" /> what they like.  I suggest to the Minister that he should make some provision so that, not small vessels but bigger fishing vessels should become possible as part of the enterprise under this Bill and that these vessels should be allowed to be armed so as to protect the territorial waters.  The territorial waters are not going to be protected by one or two boats specially provided for that purpose.  The Minister will have to make other arrangements even if the three-mile limit, such as it is, is not questioned.  We have not been told what has been the result of the negotiations which were to have taken place, I think, at the Hague.  The Minister should tell the House what the position is with reference to this matter.  In the case of Scotland, I understand that certain waters are regarded as enclosed, namely, in the Moray Firth and the Firth of Forth.  Is there any reason why a line should not be drawn from Malin Head to Erris Head and all waters within that limit regarded as territorial?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as Moray Firth and the other Firth are concerned, the Deputy has exactly a similar position in his own constituency.  A bye-law was made which affected the British only when they were in control, and as far as Moray Firth and the other Firth are concerned, steam-trawling by British citizens only is prevented.  They cannot prevent the Germans coming up to the ordinary three-mile line, and they actually do so.</P>

We could make such a by-law affecting Saorstát citizens, but we could not legislate for the people of other countries outside the three-mile limit as international law stands.</P>

      <P>I wish the Minister would do something to bring about the necessary treaty or treaties.  He may legislate for fish shops or for putting fishermen in jail, but I suggest that the first thing should be to try to get an agreement with these various countries so that at least we should have security within our own territorial waters.  According to the Bill, salmon fishing is excluded altogether from sea fishing.  That would be a very unfair thing.  For instance, at the mouth of the Blackwater, and of the Suir, there is a certain amount of salmon fishing. The fishermen have a hard enough struggle for existence, but they are going to get no benefit from this Bill. They are nobody's child.  On the one hand, their interests are in conflict with the salmon fishermen up the rivers and, on the other, they are going to get no benefit from this Bill.  The Minister should consider the case of these fishermen very carefully and give them whatever little protection this Bill provides. The section dealing with the penalties would want to be re-drafted. I suggest that it is not necessary to put fishermen in jail when they do not pay their debts.</P>

      <P>Of course I take all that for granted.  I do not suggest that we have gone back to that stage of primitive society yet.  I shall not say anything about the Revenue Commissioners on a debate on this Bill.  But there is power to impose a fine of £20. If you take a fisherman in a place like Ballymagowan, where would he get £20?  For another offence there is a fine of £50 or six months' imprisonment. I wonder if the Justice has very much discretion in the matter.  I am inclined to think he has no discretion.  I ask the Minister to have that clause examined very carefully from the point of view of making it less drastic.  The fishermen are anxious to get on with their business, and to make money, and to live comfortably, and they will pay their debts if they can.  I think it is quite unnecessary to have a clause like that, leaving in the background a menace of that kind as between directors and the ordinary members of the Society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope someone like Deputy McDonagh or some one else will give an idea of how they expect the Act is going to work.  How is it going to create markets throughout the country and how do they expect the whole concern will be financed?  Where is the money to come from?  Until we are <Col N="887" /> satisfied on these matters we are left in the air with this Bill, and one has the feeling that in the end there may be a great deal of discredit in being in any way associated with this Bill. We are anxious to see something done for these men, but one has a sort of uneasy feeling that in six months or two years people may be more disgusted with the Department after the passage of this Bill than before.</P>

      <P>As an old fisherman I desire to say a few words upon this Bill, which I welcome.  I believe it is an honest endeavour; if it does not solve the complex and intricate problem of the sea fisheries of Ireland, at least it is an endeavour to put into practice something that will help one of the most deserving sections of the Irish community.  The best or the worst about this problem of sea fisheries is that the less a man knows about it the more he can speak on it. I put the question of the sea fisheries of Ireland in the same contentious arena as tariffs, and the question of unemployment.  While I realise that this Bill is not perhaps the acme of perfection I believe it is going to do a great deal of good.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that what I think is one of the greatest difficulties as far as fisheries are concerned, that is the question of finding some practical means of giving protection, has not been dealt with in the Bill, because I believe that until we adopt some means of protecting the three-mile limit we will, to a great extent, not be doing the best that we could do for the inshore fisheries.  I know it is all a question of £ s. d.  It is very easy to get up in the Dáil and say you should have four or five cruisers or some kind of guard ships throughout the Saorstát.  I do not know how many they have in Scotland but I know they have three or four at least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was reading some time ago an article on the Scottish fisheries.  In Scotland they have sea fisheries developed to a point that no other nation has.  We find that last year <Col N="888" /> their fishing fleets were subsidised or backed by very wealthy people, yet the sea fisheries of Scotland were hardly a paying proposition.  Now, when you recollect that the fisheries of Scotland and everything connected with them have been subsidised by the Government for a great many years you cannot expect all of a sudden that the Minister for Fisheries or anybody else in Saorstát Eireann is going to produce a first class plan in a couple of years.</P>
    <P>This question of the development of the fisheries is one that will have to be approached very slowly and very carefully and with great consideration, because when dealing with it you are dealing with one of the most uncertain problems that perhaps any Government could be faced with.  We know that, just like bad weather in the case of crops, so with regard to the fisheries&mdash;one year may be good and another, may be very bad.  Anyone interested in sea fisheries knows that, this year, as far as the South and West of Ireland were concerned, the mackerel fishing and the herring fishing were practically a failure, and also the salmon fishing.  At the same time on the east coast of England and Scotland they had herring in abundance and shoals of mackerel.  How does it occur that you find shoals of herring and mackerel on the east coast. of England and Scotland and practically none on the coast of this country? I do not know.  So when people talk about fisheries, and say the Minister has only to wave a wand and you will have shoals of fish in Dun Laoghaire or Galway or anywhere else, they know that that is not true.  Anyone who knows anything about fishing knows that this is an aspect of the question of which we know practically nothing&mdash; that is, why fish should be in one place one year and disappear the next year. In order to make this Bill a success&mdash; and I believe it will be a great success &mdash;something will have to be done about protection, because it is within the three-mile limit a lot of these fish breed.  When you have the nets of these trawlers and drifters going in and tearing up the spawning beds and frightening the fish, it follows, naturally, that the following year the <Col N="889" /> fish will not come to spawn there.  The result is that, within the three-mile limit, when this goes on, the fish do not come back.  When the otter trawler was introduced in Irish fishing&mdash;it was first used in Dungarvan about the year 1750&mdash;there was a large amount of hake taken.  The next year there was only 50 per cent. of that number of hake taken, and every year since the number of hake there has been steadily falling.</P>

      <P>I could not tell you.  I desire to congratulate the Minister. As I said at the beginning, I believe this is going to be a thumping success. I should like to ask the Minister if he could supply to some of the professional fishermen&mdash;I mean men who earn their living all the year round by fishing&mdash;a trawler-drifter.  The port of Dunmore was, in old days, a packet port.  It is built in the same form as Dun Laoghaire, and I submit, with respect, that there is at Dunmore a suitable basis on which the Minister, if he so desires, can make an experiment&mdash;which I believe would be a success&mdash;with a trawler-drifter.  When the trawling is done, the boat can be used as a drifter and vice versa.  The three-mile limit, I think, originated in the old days when they had muzzle-loading cannon.</P>

      <P>I was speaking in reference to the fishing grounds.  The origin of the limit was in the time of the muzzle-loaders.  The cannon ball only went a certain distance.  First, it went a mile, and then it extended to three miles.  I suppose the limit could be made twenty-seven miles now, but that would have to be ratified by the League of Nations.  The only people who have extended their three-mile limit are the Americans, and they have done it, not for fishing purposes, but for smuggling purposes.  I congratulate the Minister on the Bill.  I do not think it is going to solve absolutely the problem of the sea fisheries, but I think it will go a long way towards solving them and that it is going to be, <Col N="890" /> like the question of Carrigeen moss, a thumping success.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasOReilly" hpid="Mr. T. O'Reilly Mr. T. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened very attentively to the speech of Deputy Jasper Wolfe.  He covered almost all the ground that I wished to touch upon.  I agree with every word of his speech in this debate.  There are two sub-sections to which I wish to refer. Deputy Wolfe did not deal with those. Under Part III of the Bill, any person who wishes to get a licence to sell fresh fish must satisfy the Minister that he is a fit and proper person to hold a fish-sales licence.  I should like to know from the Minister what kind of person will be deemed &ldquo;a fit and proper person.&rdquo;  Will it be necessary that the person be of the political colour of the Minister, for instance? Will it be necessary that he should be opposed to Fianna Fáil in order that he should be eligible for a licence to sell fresh fish?  I would be in favour of deleting that sub-section and substituting a sub-section for the granting of licences to persons who have not been guilty of fraud.  I think that would be quite sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under paragraph (d) of Section 5, the person to whom a licence is granted must not be employed, engaged or otherwise concerned in the sea-fishing industry.  I think that is very vague and I do not know why it is there at all.  In Part IV, Sections 12 and 13 will, in my opinion, have the effect of driving out of business every retailer in the seaboard towns and in many of the inland towns.  Under paragraph (e) of Section 12, the premises of these retailers must be provided with a refrigerator so situated and fitted as to exclude all contamination. That means that all the retailers of fish in the small towns like Cahirciveen and Dingle must have refrigerators.  They cannot afford to purchase refrigerators.  Paragraph (a) of Section 13 would affect the position of hawkers.  This paragraph refers to &ldquo;all fresh fish on such premises which is offered or intended for sale and is displayed for sale is so displayed either by being so hung up as to be removed from all sources of contamination or is set out on a fish slab so situated and fitted as to exclude all contamination.&rdquo;<Col N="891" /> I am not so much concerned with that paragraph as with paragraph (d), which provides that the following conditions must be carried out: &ldquo;all fresh fish on such premises which is offered or intended for sale and is not displayed for sale is kept in a refrigerator which is so situated and fitted as to exclude all contamination and is maintained at a proper temperature.&rdquo; The hawker who goes round town and who has a few fish left over is guilty of an offence if he brings them into his house and is liable to a penalty of £5. If he commits a second offence, he is liable to a fine of £25.  The same thing would apply if he took the fish into his house before going out to hawk them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking the meaning that any ordinary man would read into these words.  A hawker may go out and bring back unsold fish to his house.  Those fish are intended for sale, and he would seem to be liable to a penalty for bringing them to his house.  If the hawker goes to the market in the morning, and buys fish and then goes home to have his breakfast, he is liable to a penalty if he brings the fish into his own house.</P>
      <P>I should like to know if the Minister has had any demand for this proposed legislation.  In my opinion, it will create a monopoly in the sale of fish in the towns.  The small retailers of fish will be driven out of business and the wealthy merchant who can afford to put in these refrigerators will have a monopoly.  I am completely opposed to these sections.  The penalty of £25 for a second offence is, in my opinion, excessive.  Ten pounds would be quite enough, with, perhaps, £25 for a third offence.  I think the Bill should be drastically amended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>Dr. White stated a moment ago that those who know least about the fishing industry talk most about it.  I must admit that I do not <Col N="892" /> know much about it and, therefore, I will say very little on the subject.  I think we are spending too much time over a measure from which very little can be expected.  I have a certain amount of sympathy with the Minister and his Department.  They are subject to a considerable amount of criticism, and I appreciate the position in which they find themselves.  When one realises the enormous amount of-private capital invested in the fishing industry in foreign countries, and when one considers the considerable sums placed at the disposal of fishery departments elsewhere, one appreciates how difficult it is for the Fisheries Department in this country to do very much.  Frankly, I do not expect much from this Bill.  I think that it is a Bill brought forward under the pressure of severe criticism, and I doubt if the Minister himself expects great results from it.  The only good feature of it is that it will enable a certain number of fishermen to purchase boats and gear and give them a better chance of repaying the loans that they obtained. As to the benefit which will result to the fishing industry as a whole, frankly I cannot see it.  We have spent a lot of time on a measure from which the country as a whole will derive very little benefit.  Without doubt, the fishing industry will derive small benefit from it.</P>

      <P>It was refreshing to hear Deputy Goulding commence with probably the most intelligent remarks which came from the opposite side of the House by realising the difficulties. Unfortunately he went on to become rather pessimistic in his closing remarks. I must say that I am not at all so pessimistic, and that I have very considerable hopes from this Bill and from the Association.  Whatever the reason is, whenever anything in relation to fisheries is brought up in this House, we have more irrelevancies talked in connection with it than on any other matter brought before the House.</P>

      <P>We wandered over all sorts of topics that had nothing whatever to do with the Bill.  For some of <Col N="893" /> them there was some excuse, but for most of them there was no excuse whatever.  Deputies referred to territorial waters, illegal trawling, and other matters, none of which is mentioned in the Bill.  I will allow that there is a certain amount of excuse for some of them from the angle that these matters are fairly closely involved in any development that may arise as a result of the Bill.  Deputy Jasper Wolfe referred to some countries which had extended their territorial waters. Of course, in order that such legislation might be recognised by other countries, there must be treaties, and not many of these countries have succeeded in getting such recognition.  I mentioned some of them when I intervened during Deputy Little's speech.</P>
      <P>In regard to the effect of the establishment of the Association on my Department, the establishment of the Association will undoubtedly relieve the Department of some of the work which it has been carrying on, but the Association will be able to go a great deal more than any State Department ever could in dealing with a commercial matter of this kind.  Any effect which the establishment of the Association may have on my Department will be shown in the Estimates.  Deputy Derrig and Deputy Cassidy were greatly at variance in connection with the principles involved in the Bill. Deputy Derrig thought that this was far too democratic, and it was not half democratic enough for Deputy Cassidy.  I do not agree with either of them.  I have not lost faith to the extent which Deputy Derrig has in democracy, but I am not prepared to go to the extent that Deputy Cassidy would in attempting to nationalise the sea fisheries of the country.  I know the experiments that have been made in other countries in that connection, and I know how futile they were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Derrig was afraid, for instance, that the directors of the committee would be absolutely hampered by ignorant members of the Association coming up to a general meeting, or that persons who had no interest whatever in the industry could come up and outvote the members in the making of new rules.  He thought that would make the Association <Col N="894" /> practically abortive.  I think that is sufficiently guarded against.  First of all in Rule 68 any alteration in the rules is subject to the approval of the Minister for Lands and Fisheries. Then the Committee has the power of vetoing the application of any person for membership.  It does not mean that everybody who pays a shilling can become a member of the Association. The Committee will naturally see that the people who come along have some stake in the industry, that they are either fishermen themselves or that they own boats and employ fishermen.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig wanted to know what were the assets that were to be handed over to the Association.  I am sure the Deputy realises that when the Department was formed we were handed over from the Congested Districts Board and the D.A.T.I. certain property which had been vested in them.  After the Department was established that property became vested in the Minister.  It includes boats, and buildings for storage, etc., and in some of these stores we have nets, barrels, and other things.  The assets also include, of course, outstanding loans.  I mentioned in reply to a question by Deputy Moore early this evening that a Bill will have to be introduced in connection with the question of re-casting outstanding arrears.  I look upon that Bill as a corollary to this Bill.  It will have to come along, and come along fairly quickly.  I mentioned that a report had been made on all cases by the Committee.  That report was before my Department and the Department of Finance, and when we come to an agreement, the Bill can be submitted to the draftsman.  I am not entirely satisfied with the report myself.  I want some further reductions, and this will be a matter for argument between the Department of Finance and myself.  When these matters are settled the Bill will be brought in. I could bring in a Bill in the morning embodying the terms of the report and the Department of Finance would have no objection.  I am not prepared to do that because in the first place I am myself committed publicly to certain reductions on a certain basis <Col N="895" /> between the years 1916 and 1923. Where the report of the Committee does not give such favourable terms as would have been given under that promise, I must insist that the report be altered to that extent.  There are some other things also that have not been dealt with in that report.  There are some cases which have not been benefited under the report, a matter with which I am not satisfied and I wish to get some further reductions in these cases.</P>
    <P>It is only after this Bill has been introduced, after these loans have been written down, that that particular asset will be transferred to the Association if the Association will take it.  I cannot insist on the Association doing it.  If they say: &ldquo;No, collect those debts yourself.&rdquo;  I cannot compel them.  I should imagine if the Association is going to take over and sell the fish of the members or of the borrowers, it would be clearly more convenient for them to collect the outstanding amounts, and also more convenient for the borrowers to pay in that way. You may take it, when this Bill has been passed, when the loans have eventually been written down, as far as they have been written down, the outstanding amounts have got to be paid.  I should think that the particular borrowers, who will still owe something, would much prefer to pay out of their catch to the Association than to continue to pay it by half-yearly instalments.</P>
    <P>As far as the finance of the Association is concerned, I thought myself it was fairly clear from the rules that there will have to be a grant-in-aid. There will be a grant-in-aid each year in the Vote for my Department under three headings&mdash;for the administration, supply of boats, and general development. What the amount will be will be a matter for the Association to say to me.  They will tell me how much they require, and when I am satisfied about that I will go to Finance and ask for the amount.  I am perfectly satisfied that the amount will be given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the annual grant-in-aid to the Association which will be voted in this House for my Department.  Deputy Derrig referred at one moment to the ultra-democratic aspect of this, and said we should be on the lines of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, and then wonders as to what the rate of interest will be.  I cannot enlighten him, but I think if it were on the basis of the Agricultural Credit Corporation it would be at least the figure he mentioned, 5 per cent. or 6 per cent.  At any rate, the matter is one that will have to be settled between the Association and the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>Deputy Derrig also referred to the fact that it would be well, in carrying out the provision of Part IV of the Bill, if the Association could give loans to fishmongers for the fitting up of their shops.  In Rule 4 (q) there is a provision &ldquo;To advance or lend subject to the provisions of Rule 75 any of the capital or moneys consisting for the time being on satisfactory security to members or others in pursuance of the objects of the Society.&rdquo;  That would, I think, enable the Association to make such a loan if they thought fit, and, as far as my Department would be concerned, we would be prepared to entertain any reasonable proposals from the directors for funds for that purpose if the Association thought it desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal was said with regard to Clause 3, and because of the fact that imprisonment was mentioned as one of the possible penalties that might be inflicted, on a person who broke his contract with the Association there were a great deal of tears wept about the poor fisherman in that respect, and Deputy Ryan spoke of the fact that bad times might come and that they might not be able to meet their instalments. Under the new arrangement, instalments will disappear.  It will be a matter of the man handing over his weekly catch to the Association, and this penalty is to save the Association from persons trying to sell their fish elsewhere, trying to do the Association out of the small percentage that would be deducted from their cash. This Bill gives a District Justice, if he thinks fit, power to impose such a <Col N="897" /> penalty.  It does not mean, in fact, that the fisherman is necessarily going to go to jail for such evasion.  I think it most unlikely and that it will only be in an extraordinary case that the District Justice will inflict such a penalty, but I think it is very well to have that provision there.  Yon must remember that it is the fishing industry itself that will suffer by the defalcations, and therefore every possible power should be given to the Association to strengthen it in dealing with any such defaulter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig referred to Rule 182 relating to liabilities.  The liability of the directors has been very different from the directors of a joint stock company. I understand that the rule is the usual provision in the articles of association of joint stock companies and has been taken from typical articles of association.  I referred already to the point Deputy Derrig made, that members might not have any interest in the fishing industry.  The Committee will see to that.  I am not quite clear what Deputy Derrig meant about the departmental control of finance.  It is natural, where money is voted for specific purposes, that there should be a provision to see that money should not be devoted to some other purpose. However, lam hoping that in the case of the grant-in-aid to the Association the moneys will be voted in such a way that when they have been actually handed over to the Association there will be no departmental interference with the Association in the expenditure so long as they keep within the general purposes for which the money is voted.  No interference, I might say, will be exercised by the Department.</P>
    <P>A point has been made by Deputy Jasper Wolfe and others with regard to the provision in Section 4 with regard to the refrigerators in retail shops.  Perhaps the word &ldquo;refrigerator&rdquo; is not quite right to have there because it conveys a certain type of engine.  It is meant in a rather wide sense that the fish will be kept so that it will not deteriorate.  It is a section I will look into before the Committee Stage.  Perhaps I might insert an amendment myself to meet the wishes generally expressed throughout the House.  I can see myself that in certain <Col N="898" /> of the small types of shops this might be an expense that could not be borne.  It may be met by other provisions. By the way, there are rather varied opinions in the Fianna Fáil Benches about that.  Deputy Carney thought I legislated in Part IV for something that has been done already.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarney" hpid="Mr. Carney Mr. Carney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is being done in Dublin and elsewhere.  A great many of the Deputies were afraid that many of the people in the retail business would be put out of business by this provision.  Deputy Moore was afraid that the surplus of fish now taken by auctioneers who are themselves in the fish trade may have no outlet.  I cannot of course, speak authoritatively as to what the Association will do, but I imagine that provision will be made for such a contingency as that.  I imagine what will happen will be something like this.  Whoever is licensed to sell fish will go on to the pier or quay where the fishermen are, and the fish will be disposed of to men who were acting as auctioneers before. The fish will, in fact, be sold as formerly, except that it will be done through licensed salesmen, and if the fish is not bought up in a particular locality it will be disposed of elsewhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Will there be any compulsion on the Association to buy? For instance, on the east coast at present there is a glut of herrings, and if the Association were functioning now would it be incumbent on it to purchase all the fish?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill does not say that it will be incumbent, but I imagine that the Association would be failing if they did not handle any fish available.  Under Rule IV. they have extraordinary powers, including the taking and handling of fish themselves. I presume that the Association would handle any surplus themselves, though I cannot, of course, speak definitely as to what they will do in any given set of circumstances.  Deputy Cassidy is afraid that if buildings are handed over to the Association they may sell them to persons entirely unconcerned as to the purposes for which the buildings <Col N="899" /> are supposed to be there.  Clause 2, where I am enabled to hand such buildings over, says: &ldquo;The Minister may from time to time, by order made with the consent of the Minister for Finance, vest in the Society upon such terms and conditions as may be mentioned in such order...&rdquo; That safeguards that.  Such conditions will be put into the transfer of the buildings to the Association so as to prevent any such sale of the buildings to persons who would not use them for the purposes originally intended.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cassidy also wanted to know whether the directors were to be entirely independent, like those of the Electricity Supply Board and the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  They will be entirely independent in so far as money will be annually voted, for some years to come, at any rate, by the Dáil by way of grant-in-aid, and when it comes to be voted the Association and its operations can be criticised here. Deputy Clery seemed to have a fear&mdash; I do not know why&mdash;that certain persons were going to be taken by the back of the neck and made join the Association.  He was afraid that persons engaged in an industry in Mayo and Galway, which has been fostered by French interests, would be compelled to join the Association.  It will not be compulsory on anyone to join the Association, and if people desire to carry on as they are carrying on at present they may do so.  If will only be people who are anxious to obtain the facilities which the Association can provide who will join it, but if fishermen can get better terms from any other source no one is going to prevent them doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to the fact that in selecting the directors of the association I did not advert to Donegal and the importance of the herring fishing there.  I invited the present directors of the Association to act, not at all on the basis of locality &mdash;locality did not enter into consideration&mdash;but on their competence for the particular job they had to undertake. That was the sole reason which governed me in inviting these people and not others to act as directors.  The herring fishing industry is well represented <Col N="900" /> by at least one director, Mr. O'Toole, of Arklow, who knows all about it, and the herring fishing is the same, whether conducted at Howth, Donegal or Cleggan.  I will not follow Deputies into a discussion on inland fisheries, because it has nothing to do with the Bill.  The Bill purports to enable me to hand over certain assets to the Association and to make certain arrangements by which they will be empowered to enforce their hire purchase contracts.  It makes further arrangements about the licensing and the selling of fish in retail shops.  That is all it purports to do, and I, therefore, move its Second Reading.</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister to explain the object of Rule 123.  That is the rule which provides that a director may transact business and enter into contracts with the Society. I think there should be some safeguard there.  At present the safeguard is that his interest must be disclosed at a meeting of the committee.

As a great many fishermen are worried about that rule I beg him to examine it, and perhaps he might make a statement later. It is important to fishermen, especially to those who go along the east coast to places such as Ardglass, that they should be able to get credit or be furnished with working expenses after a long spell of idleness.  I have personal knowledge as to the anxiety of fishermen on this point.</P>

They would have a hold over a particular person in so far as his catch was concerned.  They would be able to make certain deductions to meet repayments.  It is a point that I will submit to them for their consideration. I can see very well that when a boat has been left aside for a period it is extremely difficult for a man to go any distance from his base and fill up with provisions and oil if his credit were gone and if some arrangement of this kind were not made.</P>

      <P>The position of the driftnet fishermen, as far as the Department is concerned&mdash;and I imagine the Association will more or less be in the same position&mdash;was that in granting loans for boats and gear they always had in mind that there were certain penalties under the fishery laws.  One penalty for infringement of the fishery laws dealing with salmon is confiscation of gear.  The Department might be giving a loan for the purchase of gear which, used illegally perhaps in a week's time, would be confiscated. We always had that difficulty&mdash;that a commodity for which we gave a loan would be confiscated within a week. The Association might feel themselves in the same difficulty.  It is a matter that I will think over.</P>

    <P>The Dáil went into Committee on Finance and resumed the debate on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That a sum not exceeding £300,000 be granted to fulfil the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st March, 1931, for contributions towards the relief of unemployment and distress&rdquo; (Minister for Finance).</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarney" hpid="Mr. Carney Mr. Carney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is something paradoxical in the fact that the Minister for Finance allocates at this juncture the sum of £300,000 for the relief <Col N="903" /> of unemployment.  It is paradoxical because of the fact that the President in his opening address this session told the Dáil, and through the Dáil the country, that we were in a position that practically no other country in Europe was in, that our credit was good, our prospects were good, that for us the sun shone, that every little cloud had a silver lining, and that the goose honks high.  Two weeks after that the Minister for Finance proposes a grant of £300,000 to relieve unemployment and distress.  Either the President, when making those statements regarding our prosperity, was a liar or a fool, or the Minister for Finance was giving something that was not required at all.  I leave it between the President and the Minister to choose which is which.  If the President was right in his statement that this country was a prosperous country, that everything should be viewed through rosy spectacles, then there should have been no necessity at all for the Minister to make this grant in order to relieve distress and unemployment. Since the Minister has persisted in allocating this grant, the only conclusion I can come to is that the Minister does not agree with the President that this is a country fit, for heroes to live in, and that this country should not be viewed through rosy spectacles.  There is a division on the Government Front Bench.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President, in making his speech here, said that they did not praise themselves.  He said if there were any little defects in his Party or in his Government he could leave it to Fianna Fáil to find out and to point out those defects.  He said: &ldquo;We do not pose; everyone knows our imperfections and perfections, and if they do not know them the Party opposite takes the earliest and the greatest possible opportunity to show them what they are.  But they always harp on the one string&mdash;imperfection.&rdquo;  Why we harp on the one string is this: that where we see imperfection we point it out.  If we attempted to point out perfection on the part of the Government we would certainly steal the thunder of some back benchers of the Government Party.  We would steal the thunder, <Col N="904" /> for example, of Deputy Sheehy, who comes along with a fine flow of sunburstry and tells the Government what great little fellows they are.  He comes along and pats, figuratively speaking, the Minister for Finance on the back.  He tells him what a grand little Minister he is.  He says that the Minister, out of the generosity of his heart, has given the country £300,000 with which to relieve unemployment and distress.</P>
    <P>Listening to Deputy Sheehy, I was a kind of muddled because I could not quite gather what status to give to the Minister.  Deputy Sheehy thanked God for the fact that this country was not as other countries.  He said that we had no earthquakes or famines or other things of that kind, and I was inclined to believe that the Minister for Finance had actually taken the part of some superhuman being and prevented earthquakes from visiting the Saorstát. In the next breath, when the Deputy told us that the Minister was giving this grant of £300,000 to relieve unemployment, I thought that the Minister must be some sort of magician, that he must have some kind of an Alf's button or magic carpet whereby at a word or the pressure of a button he could conjure up pounds and pounds ad infinitum in order to relieve the poor people of the Saorstát.</P>
    <P>The President wonders why we point out their imperfections.  We do it in order to preserve the equilibrium of that little microscopic speck of grey matter that I hope is contained in the cranium of each member of the Executive Council, seeing that they are subject to the fulsome flattery of the back benchers of Cumann na nGaedheal. Deputy Anthony referred to this particular grant and said it was dope.  I disagree with Deputy Anthony in that. If that grant were dope it would have the effect of laying to sleep, if I may put it that way, all the pains and aches of all the unemployed and of all the destitute in the Free State.  If it served the purpose of dope for the Saorstát, those people would then be like Tennyson's Lotus Eaters, not wanting to get out of the particular heaven created by that dope.</P>
    <P>I characterise this particular grant not as dope for the whole body politic, <Col N="905" /> but as a local anaesthetic applied to those particular people who were adherents and supporters of the Government. It has absolutely no effect, outside a particular clique or coterie who happen to support for the moment the Government in power.  It was typical of the mentality of the front bench of the Government that the Minister for Industry and Commerce attacked Deputy Moore when this debate was on last Friday, and attempted to hold Deputy Moore responsible for the action, the ideas and the thoughts of some people who happen to employ Deputy Moore.  I say that is a typical example of the mentality of the front bench of the Government.  They have been in the habit, by those grants they have made for unemployment and for relief of distress, of doling out these moneys to particular partisans of the Government, and they have imagined that because they dole out this dope, if you like, or this local anaesthetic, every man who participates in it or in any of this grant should be bought heart and soul by the people who are doling out that particular money.  That is what they have been accustomed to.  All the Minister succeeded in doing, in his attack on Deputy Moore, was to establish the fact that the Deputy could not be bought heart and soul because he happened to be employed by any particular person or persons.  That is what the Minister succeeded in doing in the case of Deputy Moore&mdash;that though he was employed by certain people he still preserved his own separate entity and still kept to himself his own mind, his own heart and his own soul.  I would have expected more from the Minister than to try to establish that Deputy Moore should have taken part in anything of the nature of the Minister's own particular type of mind.  Deputy Moore is not capable of it.  That is all that the Minister succeeded in establishing to any right-minded person.</P>
    <P>When we criticised this grant like the other grants that have been made periodically for the relief of distress and unemployment, we were accused of not rendering anything to the debate that should help towards solving for good and all the problem of unemployment.  Time after time <Col N="906" /> since I came into this House I have listened to suggestions that have been put forward here that would have made not for temporary alleviation of the distress in the Free State but for practically the permanent solution of the question of unemployment and destitution.  In that time I have heard from the front benches the silliest arguments put up that were ever listened to in any responsible Parliament in the world against the ideas that came from these benches for the relief of distress and unemployment. Time after time Deputies on this side of the House have suggested means by which the people of this country would be enabled to get employment in their own country instead of having foreigners making products that were imported into this country and that should have been made at home by our own people. I have seen case after case put up to deal with unemployment.  I have heard proposals for tariffs and prohibitions that would have enabled the people of this country to be employed in their own country.  These suggestions if acted on would have cut down the adverse trade balance that is the <i>béte noir</i> of every Minister in this House.</P>
    <P>Not alone is this the bugbear of Ministers, but it is the old-man-of-the-sea around the necks of the people of the country, and no responsible Minister can say that up to the present he has been able to find a definite solution of the problem.  Time and time again I have seen cases put up whereby the people of this country could be supplied with commodities that we utilise in the Twenty-six Counties.  I have heard replies from Ministers in connection with these matters that would not be accepted from a schoolboy.  The Minister for Local Government, when faced with the fact that the Corporation of Glasgow were using Irish slates in their building schemes, said that the type of houses erected in Glasgow were different to those erected in Ireland, that they used smaller slates than we did, and that, in consequence, they were able to use the Killaloe slates, which the people of Ireland could not, hence the houses were roofed with tiles imported from Belgium.  That is <Col N="907" /> one instance of the single-track mind of the Government.  They were not capable of changing the plan of the houses in order that the contractors might use our own slates, although the Corporation of Glasgow could do so. All that was necessary was a few lines drawn on paper to have men working in the Killaloe quarries, yet the Government were not capable of seeing that these few lines were drawn.</P>
    <P>Time after time I put a question with reference to the use of our own stone from Mountcharles and elsewhere for building purposes in this country. But the Government cannot find time for these things.  They must get stone from Portland, and then they come forward with their solution of the whole problem by providing £300,000 for the unemployed.  They had to do the same last year, and still we find the population decreasing.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Reynolds when these schemes were proposed last year asking for a grant for the construction of a road out of Arigna coalfields. Deputy Reynolds got up with his head in the air and, like an old war horse sniffing the battle from afar, he asked why is this road not built.  The Minister calmly and coldly told Deputy Reynolds that road would not be built, and Deputy Reynolds, instead of rearing the head of the old war horse, bent his neck to the yoke of Cumann na nGaedheal.  Developments might be carried out in the Arigna coalfields and permanent jobs provided for hundreds of men, but the Government had not the time nor the money to build the road through the Arigna fields.  They told Deputy Reynolds that could not be done.  It was a very small suggestion for the relief of unemployment, not of a temporary, but of a permanent nature.</P>
    <P>There have been pleas for tariffs on flour and everything that might have tended permanently to the relief of unemployment, but the Government had no use for these except it suited themselves, and unless they had their fingers in some particular pie, and when it is a question of saving that by means of a tariff or something else.</P>
    <P>The President may talk about the state of our credit.  Deputies on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches may <Col N="908" /> eulogise the Minister for the steps ho has taken towards the relief of unemployment, but no matter how they eulogise him or talk about our prosperity the fact remains that they have to come along year after year and give grants for the relief of distress and unemployment, although when they go to banquets they tell distinguished visitors that this is a land flowing with milk and honey.  If the Minister imagines he has done something for which he should be clapped on the back by giving this grant I hope he has been disillusioned before this.  If he has not been I would like to point out now that, so far as I and my Party are concerned, or indeed anybody else who has any idea at all in regard to the country, that the Minister is not merely not entitled to a pat on the back, but is deserving of condemnation along with the rest of the Ministers for having made the present state of affairs possible.</P>
    <P>Although we may owe very little money, and have natural resources to keep over and above twice our population, although we have withstood time and trouble and tests for 750 years, and even although the President and his colleagues have tried to beat the country to its knees, still the country's head may be bloody, but it is not bowed.  We are not pessimists, nor dismal Jimmies, nor Weary Willies, nor anything like that.  We know the resources of the country and what can be done with them, if we had the proper people to do it.  It is the greatest test of optimism that we can say the country is still alive after eight years of administration, of Cumann na nGaedheal.  We are a great country. If we were not, we would not be alive at all; we have good resources, and we have pointed, out how those resources might be used.</P>
    <P>Time after time it has been pointed out in this House how we could make the most of our opportunities; how we could make the most of the resources that he to our hands, but Ministers have, after eight years, in spite of the nice things they say at the different fine parties they have attended, to grant £300,000 for the relief of distress and unemployment in the Free State. The President and Ministers can take <Col N="909" /> it from me that every distinguished visitor that comes to the country knows perfectly well, in spite of the banquets, in spite of all the fine feeds that have been prepared for them, that this country is not as the President would have us believe, and the very fact that they have to reduce the representation because the population has decreased, and that they have had to come along repeatedly, year after year, with their grant for the relief of unemployment, is sufficient condemnation of the administration of Cumann na nGaedheal.</P>

      <P>I do not know that since I became a member of the House I have ever listened to a more uninteresting, ineffective or hypocritical debate than that which has taken place on this Vote.  What was the position when the Government introduced this Vote?  There was present amongst every Party in the House the hope that the Government would be able to provide a grant to relieve unemployment and distress during the coming Christmas and winter season. Almost everybody in the House believed that the amount would be somewhere about £50,000, but some of us were optimistic enough to expect £100,000.  Instead of that the Government came along and for once took their courage in their hands and promised £300,000 for this deserving object.  What was the effect of that? The Fianna Fáil Party and the Labour Party got the shock of their lives&mdash;a shock from which they have not yet recovered.  It has done more to force them into a coalition than anything else that has taken place in this House.  As the immediate effect of it, we had the bloated plutocrats who loll on the Labour Benches and the multi-millionaires who lounge on the Fianna Fáil Benches exclaiming &ldquo;What is £300,000?  It is a mere pinch of snuff&mdash;a mere drop in the ocean.&rdquo;  As Deputy Carney has said, it is dope; it is money which no decent follower of Fianna Fáil will touch, because it is only intended for supporters of the Government, and I presume no member of the Labour Party will have any hand, act or part in it.  That is the attitude with which the shock they got from the <Col N="910" /> Government has been taken up.  I hope Deputy Carney will, at all events, have the courage, and that his Party will have the courage, to carry to its logical consequences the announcement which he has made and that they will have no hand, act or part in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking on behalf of the working men whom I represent and as a working man myself, I look upon £300,000 as a very substantial sum, which cannot be sneered at or put as lightly aside as the Fianna Fáil and Labour Party have put it.  It is nothing to sneer at.  It is a very substantial sum for a small country to put up during a time of great need.  Deputy Byrne told us the other day that the unemployed of Dublin had already been dealt with by the Dublin Relief Bill, but for some unaccountable reason which I have been unable to understand he suggested that because of that they should get a large amount of this grant.  They have already been fed by the Dublin Belief Act, and the suggestion is that they should now get a surfeit as a result of this grant.  I do not follow that.  On the seaboard at present there is no doubt that there are districts in which very considerable want exists. That want arises as the result of various things: the agricultural depression, the loss of our sea-fishing industry, and the loss of Christmas cheques from America which have in the past largely contributed to tiding over the lean season.  I have already seen letters coming here from America which would bring tears to the eyes of anyone reading them, letters from girls in New York and elsewhere regretting that the usual Christmas cheque will not be forthcoming through no fault of their own.  One of the most pathetic letters I ever read was from a little girl who at the end of it wrote: &ldquo;You know, mother, I gave ten dollars a short time ago for a newspaper they are about starting in Dublin in order to create a free Ireland,&rdquo; and because of this she is unable to send the usual Christmas cheque.  We have heard a good deal from Fianna Fáil Deputies about tariffs, which they say are the cure for all ills.  I would put a prohibition on American cheques, and I would say that no American cheques should <Col N="911" /> come into this country from our poor emigrants save those intended for the natural source&mdash;the parents and the families who are starving.  I wonder would Fianna Fáil agree to a prohibition of that sort?</P>

      <P>Along our seacoast there is very grave distress.  In the Berehaven peninsula there is a grave danger of acute want followed by tragedy, such as occurred there before if the matter is not attended to at once.  The people there, even though they may be supporters of Deputy Carney, will have no objection to doing an honest day's work if they get an honest day's pay, no matter whether it comes from the Government or not.  On the island of Cape Clear, and adjoining islands, the people are in such a state that if something is not done for them at once there will be grave danger that something in the nature of a tragedy will occur.  Other districts are not as badly off, but there are districts even around the fishing town of Kinsale where relief can be granted at once by attending to one of the most needed works in the County Cork, the road from Cork to Kinsale.  The road from Cork to Kinsale at present serves one of the most important tourist districts in our country, and also one of the poorest districts.  In the Clonakilty district tourists are cut off from some of the finest parts of the country for want of a road.  The people around the seaboard want work and the work is there, reproductive work&mdash;work that should be done, and could be done, if funds were available.  I hope that something will be done along the seacoast, so that those people will be able to take their Christmas dinner in peace.  I should say that I hold no brief for the Government.  I am not going to throw any bouquets at them, <Col N="912" /> but I do most respectfully suggest to the House that it is putting it rather far for a representative of Fianna Fáil to say that because the Minister for Finance took his courage in his hands and introduced a Vote of £300,000 for the relief of the poor and unemployed at this time of the year, he must, by reason of that, be deemed to be a person possessed of a low mind.</P>

      <P>We have been listening to debate for the past week as to how best this money could be allocated, and I suppose another few days will pass before either the Local Government Department or the Land Commission will have the permission of the Dáil to start work and to expend this £300,000.  Deputy Cassidy, in his speech, dealt with all the materials that could be utilised in this country in the building industry.  I have heard other speeches of the same kind here time and again for the last five years.  He stated that slates were going to Glasgow which would not be used by the Government in this country. The Deputy or any other Deputy can look at the specifications for any Government contract, and I will ask him to point out one item which can be produced in this country that is not set out in that specification.  I would ask him to point out any work done, either by contract or by direct labour under the Board of Works or any other Government Department, in which it is not specified that materials produced in this country must be used as far as possible.</P>

If Deputy Cassidy says that we should have Irish limestone instead of Portland stone, I would like to ask him what is the difference between the price of Irish limestone and Portland stone.  I know that Deputy Cassidy is a great friend of labour, and that he would like to see as much money expended in building as is possible, but I would like to remind Deputy Cassidy that if Irish limestone were used in preference to Portland stone there would be much less employment given.</P>

      <P>If we are going to use Irish granite and Irish limestone in all cases, do the Labour Deputies know what is going to happen?  You are going to cripple the building industry once and for all.  Our people at present want buildings for which they are able to pay.  A person does not want a building costing thousands of pounds when he has only £400, £500 or £600 to pay for it.  I heard a Deputy some time ago ask why we should not have timber windows which would be made at home instead of steel windows which he said were foreign made.  I wonder did that Deputy know that timber windows are made abroad also, and that all that happened was that they were both assembled in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been anxious for the past week to offer some suggestions as to how best we might spend this £300,000. I have heard suggestions that it should be expended on waterworks and sewerage works.  In connection with sewerage schemes and water works, when we had a Relief Vote three or four years ago, local authorities were invited to put up certain schemes.  These schemes in many counties meant an expenditure of several thousand pounds.  I know of one instance in my own constituency in which ten schemes were put up and out of the ten schemes the local authority carried out two.  The local <Col N="914" /> authority were aware that they would get a grant of 25 per cent., but the only people who benefited from the schemes really were the engineering profession who prepared the plans and specifications.  It has been suggested that the Government should pay the full estimated cost of each scheme, but I think unless you have the co-operation of local authorities you cannot carry out these works.  In rural areas, particularly at present, owing to the approach, I suppose, of the County Council elections next June, you have pumps being erected at every cross-road, everybody knows the reason, but unless there is cooperation you cannot have these schemes carried out.  Unless the local authorities are prepared to strike a rate of ½d. or 1d. in the £ per annum, to create a fund and to contribute say about 25 per cent. of the cost of these schemes out of that fund, with probably another 25 per cent. grant from the Government, it will not be easy to carry out these schemes.</P>
    <P>The trouble at present in rural districts is that the areas of charge for carrying out such schemes are too small, and that the rate would, therefore, be too high.  In one county a rate of a penny brings in about £2,000 per annum.  If such a fund were started, it would not be many years until a number of small towns and villages would be provided with water supplies and sewerage schemes.  I wish to bring one matter under the notice of the Minister in regard to these works.  Under the Relief Vote of four years ago, a great number of works were carried out.  Some were finished, and some partly finished, and I would ask the Minister, when dealing with this Vote, to see that works carried out under the Land Commission at that time, which were not finished, should be finished with the assistance of this Vote, because, at the present time, these works are of no use, particularly roads into turbary.  Owing to the bad season in several rural districts, the turf still remains in the bogs.  Some years ago, roads were mapped out and an attempt was made to construct these roads, but they were never quite finished.  They are now in a very bad condition, with the result <Col N="915" /> that the turf this year still remains in the bog.  I would ask the Minister to give that matter consideration when the grant is being allocated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>My chief reason for intervening in this debate is to correct a statement which is attributed to me in the Official Report of the proceedings of last Friday.  I am quoted as having said, in answer to the statement of the Minister (&ldquo;The Deputy also furnished, as Secretary of the Motor Trade Association, a document directed against the tariff&rdquo;)&mdash;&ldquo;That is not so.&rdquo;  If I intentionally said that, it would be untrue, and if I did say it, it was incorrect.  All the written evidence from that source with regard to the application of the coachbuilders for a tariff passed through my hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to deal at any length with the strange contribution from the Minister for Industry and Commerce to this debate.  I do not want to deal at any length with his remarks regarding myself, except to say that he has made as extraordinary a contribution to the proceedings of this House as any Minister has ever made.  He has given his reason for the personal remarks directed against me in the following statement: &ldquo;I regard it as quite relevant in view of Deputy Moore's attempt to suggest that the Chairman of the Tariff Commission signed a certain document when, as a matter of fact, he was not in Geneva at the time and could not have signed it.&rdquo;  The Minister's method of defending his friend, of defending that civil servant, is to damage irretrievably the public character of that same civil servant, I ask the House to note the juxtaposition of the sentence I have quoted with this other sentence: &ldquo;I understand that Deputy Moore was the man who made the most suggestions to Mr. Maguire, K.C., who was appearing against the tariff.&rdquo;  That statement never appeared in the Press.  From whom did the Minister get that information?  When did he get it?  If he got it at the time it happened, how does it come that he has kept it in cold storage for so long? The coachbuilding tariff has been discussed here so often that he would surely be tempted to come out with <Col N="916" /> that information some time before this.  Did he get it verbally?  If he got it verbally, is it too much to suggest that it came from a civil servant?  Is it too much to suggest that that civil servant is the late Chairman of the Tariff Commission?</P>
    <P>It is a curious method which the Minister has chosen to defend the most prominent civil servant in this State. The most prominent civil servant in the State&mdash;the present Secretary of the Department of Finance and a member of the Currency Commission&mdash;is, by legitimate inference from the Minister's remarks, a political partisan, a party hack, a man who is prepared to brief one member of this House to make a personal attack on another.  The Minister can congratulate himself on having made a most remarkable contribution to the debate.  And all, I wonder, for what?   Because &ldquo;I have attempted to suggest that the Chairman of the Tariff Commission signed a certain document when, as a matter of fact, he was not in Geneva at the time and could not have signed it.&rdquo;  Officially, I know nothing whatsoever as to whether he was in Geneva or not.  This matter would never have cropped up a second time if it were not for the fact that the first time I mentioned it the Minister for External Affairs or the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;whichever designation he prefers&mdash;impugned my accuracy and was quite satirical in doing so.  He said, first of all, that the document I was referring to was not a free trade document, and then he asked where I got the information that the late Chairman of the Tariff Commission was at Geneva.  Naturally, I had to support my statements.  I produced the report.  The name of the late Chairman of the Tariff Commission is attached to that report, and the Minister has not yet stood up and explained how it is that his name is there if he were not there.  As to my willingness, if you like, to do injury to this civil servant, I stated twice last Thursday that since my statement I had got private information that the late Chairman of the Tariff Commission was not at Geneva.  Surely that is as much as any Deputy could do. <Col N="917" /> I need not have referred to that private information, but, in my anxiety to be just to that civil servant, I did so.  Yet the Minister for Industry and Commerce is offended at this question being brought up.  I think the real reason for his being offended is that he finds the document a very embarrassing one.  There is every reason why he should.  He makes that the excuse for this curious personal attack that he made on Friday.</P>
    <P>I am not worried at all about his remarks. I admit I was fair game, in the circumstances.  It is quite possible that any other Deputy in the House would have done the same towards a Deputy of an opposite party in similar circumstances. I am not worried as to the use he has made of the facts.  The fate of Ireland does not depend upon it, but I do call attention to the extraordinary position the Minister is in now with regard to the most important public servant in the State&mdash;that he has provided the strongest circumstantial evidence that that civil servant has briefed him, not merely with regard to a party attack, but with regard to a personal attack.  If I had definite proof he said what was stated here, I would have to use much stronger terms towards that same civil servant, because, as a matter of fact, the statement quoted is not correct.  The statement that I was the man who made the most suggestions to Mr. Maguire, K.C., is not correct.  I did not sit as near to Mr. Maguire as I am to the Minister for Education at the moment, and I do not remember that I had a single interchange with him during the course of the Tariff Commission sitting.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is, therefore, welcome to the glorious victory he won last Friday.  If he acted with similar ability, similar logic and similar persuasiveness at the Imperial Conference, it is no wonder we have had such splendid results.</P>

      <P>I ask Deputies to read <Col N="918" /> the motion which I am now about to put to the House:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That a Select Committee consisting of five Deputies, to be nominated by the Committee of Selection, be appointed to investigate and report as to the claim for compensation by way of pension or gratuity of certain members of the Connaught Rangers who mutinied in India in 1920;</P>
      <P>That the quorum of the Select Committee be three;</P>
      <P>That the Select Committee have power to send for persons, papers and records.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This motion has been on the Order Paper since early last summer, and its terms ought to be well known to every Deputy.  After long and patient waiting, we have now an opportunity to thrash out the matter fully and try to come to some definite decision.</P>
      <P>Attention has been drawn to the matter on several occasions during the past two years by way of Parliamentary question and by raising it in debate but such representations have been of no avail, and in the absence of a motion it was not possible to get a definite decision from the House.  This question concerns every Deputy.  It demands serious attention in my opinion.  Members of all parties in this House have interested themselves in the claims of these ex-Connaught Rangers, in Parliamentary questions seeking information.  Appeals for favourable consideration of their claims have come from all sides of this House from time to time.  What is now wanted is definite action by these Deputies who have expressed sympathy with these ex-Connaught Rangers.  It is not a party question. I have here letters written by the Secretary of these ex-Connaught Rangers to Deputies of all parties. We who have put the motion before the Dáil are solely actuated by the desire to get justice, however belated, for those men, to get for them the consideration they deserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want those who have on previous occasions supported the claims of the <Col N="919" /> Connaught Rangers to support them here this evening, to speak in their favour and to let Ministers know that it is not a party question.  The object of the motion is the appointment of a Select Committee to investigate and report on the claims of these men.  The Dáil is not asked to vote pensions, gratuities, or anything else, but to appoint a Committee to enquire into the claims and to express the opinion that there is a case for enquiry and that a Committee should be appointed to go into it, as the full details cannot be gone into here.  That Committee will be at liberty to reject the claim if it finds that the men had not a good case. When it has obtained all the relevant information it will be in a position to give a proper decision in the matter and so guide the House. That is a much better course than to ask the Dáil to decide here and now that these men should get gratuities or pensions.</P>
    <P>Most of the Deputies here have read an account of what took place during the mutiny in India by the Connaught Rangers.  It might be advisable, in order to refresh our memory, to recall a few of the principal facts and the consequences.  The Anglo-lrish War was at its height during the early part of 1920, when the atrocities of the Black-and-Tan campaign had shocked the world.  One result was to cause considerable disaffection among the Irish regiments in the British Army. The disaffected units attempted to have communication with one another with a view to united action.  However, they were transferred abroad, and separated as much as possible so as to minimise the chances of trouble. Organisation amongst these units, however, was extremely difficult, if not impossible.  Another difficulty was that they did not seem, if I might say so, with all due respect to the men concerned, to have had capable leaders. A good number of them were illiterate; some of them were semi-illiterate.  All were men of a humble class trained as rank and file to obey and not to lead. Otherwise the mutiny might have assumed much more serious proportions <Col N="920" /> and have had a much more serious result from the point of view of Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The mutiny took place almost simultaneously at two places, Solon and Jullundur, about the end of June, 1920. The men involved in each case belonged to the 1st Battalion of the Connaught Rangers.  At Jullundur about 200 men, in the first instance, refused to parade, stating that their action was a protest against the state of affairs then existing in Ireland.  I have made it my business to get in touch with ex-officers of the Connaught Rangers, and it was their opinion that had there been no trouble in Ireland there would have been no mutiny in India.  The following notice was served on their C/O. by the men:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I bring to your notice the recent trouble committed by British troops in Ireland.  The Connaught Rangers are determined to stand by Sinn Féin.  Our indignation will be shown by action and not by words.  We cannot, as Irishmen, stand by and see our relations murdered.  We demand the withdrawal of the military in Ireland until our orders are complied with.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At Solon also a large number of men refused to parade, stating their action was a protest against the employment of British troops in Ireland.  Private Daly was in charge here.  He acted as spokesman, and declared that similar action would be taken simultaneously by every Irish regiment in the British Army, and that the news would be published in every paper in England and Ireland.  Apparently Daly had been in communication with men in other units, and was looking forward to united action.  A number of the men at Solon, headed by Daly and armed with bayonets, made an attempt to rush the Magazine where the arms were stored.  An extra guard had been mounted, however, and the mutineers were dispersed by rifle fire.  Two of their number, Private Sears and Smyth, being killed and one wounded. Were it not for the efforts of the Catholic chaplain there would have been more bloodshed.  Shortly afterwards reinforcements arrived from <Col N="921" /> other regiments, and the mutineers' quarters were surrounded and all the men put under arrest.  The same thing happened at Jullundur, where the C/O. had gained time by parleying with the men while awaiting reinforcements.</P>
    <P>These men were tried six weeks later by Field General Courts Martial. Private Daly was sentenced to death and duly executed.  About fifteen others were sentenced to death, but in their case the sentences were commuted to penal servitude for life. About fifty others were sentenced to periods of penal servitude, varying from two to twenty-one years.  Private John Miranda died while in prison at Dagshai.  Treatment while in prison in India was very severe.  The confinement and the excessive heat were too much for this man, who was already in delicate health.  All the surviving prisoners were brought back to England, and the majority were imprisoned in Maidstone, which has memories for some Deputies on both sides of this House.  According to all accounts they received very bad treatment, and the health of practically every man suffered in consequence.  One prisoner, James O'Connell, of Finglas, who gave an interview on his release, stated that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When he and his comrades first arrived in Maidstone they were severely punished.  He was kept for three months in close confinement, and for fifteen days on bread and water, and the other prisoners were subjected to similar rigorous punishment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The prisoners took part in two hunger strikes for better treatment. The bigger of these took place about the time the Treaty was signed, and the Governor of the prison induced the men to abandon the strike, informing them that their release was only a matter of a few weeks in consequence of the new situation.  The men, however, were not released until early in 1923, having spent nearly three years in prison.  I understand that the Free State Government made representations to the British Government some time before the men were released. One of the men, Patrick Shallow, died four weeks after his release in the Waterford Workhouse as the result of the ill-treatment he had undergone. <Col N="922" /> The fact of this man coming home to die in the workhouse was a cruel commentary on the gratitude displayed by a so-called Irish Government for his action in India.</P>
    <P>Great publicity was given to the men's case when they were released and the expressions of sympathy were heard on all sides.  The Free State Government took no action to help the men in any way.  Many of the men were in bad health as the result of their hunger-strikes and prison hardships, and all of them, with their families and dependants, were in extremely straitened circumstances.</P>
    <P>There was a belief among the men that the Free State Government would make some provision for themselves and their relatives, or give some compensation for what they lost in the matter of pensions or gratuities.  They were disappointed.  Nothing was done for them and their claims were gradually lost sight of.  An agitation was carried on by a few men who lived in Dublin and neighbourhood and a committee was formed.  The men claimed that they should be treated on somewhat similar lines to those members of the R.I.C. who resigned for national reasons and were afterwards awarded pensions and gratuities.  Deputy Alfred Byrne raised the matter in the Dáil in June, 1924, and asked whether it was the Government's intention to make provision for these men.  President Cosgrave replied that the matter had not been considered but that if he were supplied with details of distress amongst these men he would see what could be done.</P>
    <P>The Secretary of the Connaught Rangers' Committee wrote to President Cosgrave in August, 1924, asking him to receive a deputation but he declined to do so.  His secretary, however, wrote asking for definite proposals as to the claims of the Connaught Rangers.  The Minister for Finance set up a Committee in 1925 to look into the matter.  There is no account available as to who constituted that Committee, which was apparently a departmental one, and there is no record as to the Committee's terms of reference.  The Committee would not interview any of the men nor receive a deputation.  It would only receive representations <Col N="923" /> put forward in writing. That was decidedly unfair to the men concerned as they had very little organisation and most of them were not of the type that could put down a good case in writing.  At any rate, they could not set it out in any convincing manner.  No genuine efforts were apparently made to get at the facts of the case and the appointment of the Committee seems to have been merely a method of side-tracking the question.</P>
    <P>The Secretary of the Connaught Rangers' Committee was informed by the Department of Finance on 3rd November, 1925, that, from the report presented by the Departmental Committee, it did not appear that the circumstances were such as would sustain any claim for compensation from the Government and that, after careful consideration, the Minister for Finance was not prepared to recommend any payment from Government funds. Promises were given to obtain employment for the men on public works, but only a few men were provided for in this way, and even then the employment lasted only for a few weeks and did not give these few men any opportunity of getting on their feet again. Repeated representations were made to the Department of Finance but a deaf ear was turned to all appeals. The part played by this Departmental Committee is important.  The position should be made quite clear as the cloak of secrecy about the whole affair is, I think, undesirable. Deputy Kerlin and myself on a few occasions raised this matter and the Minister for Finance was asked for details as to this particular Committee, as to its constitution, terms of reference, and as to the evidence the Committee had before them, and, further, on what they based their report. The Minister evaded giving the information asked for.</P>
    <P>The House is entitled to this information, and I make a special request to the Minister to furnish it during this debate.  I would also like to ask, from how many members of the Connaught Rangers were representations received and why did not the Committee interview these men if they desired <Col N="924" /> to get at the full facts of their claims?  Apparently, the Committee was not intended to deal seriously with the matter.  It was formed, so far as can be judged, to side-track the issue.  The dice were loaded against these men from the outset.  They started without resources or organisation, and had very little chance of proving their claims.  On the second last occasion on which Deputy Kerlin raised the matter here the Minister for Finance stated that the Committee which considered the matter held the view that patriotism was an afterthought, and that the men had no claim.</P>
    <P>He was quite wrong in that statement, and the Minister had to withdraw it when he found his mistake. At that time, and ever since, the members of the Connaught Rangers felt very bitter over it.  When dealing with this particular question the Minister stated that some members of the Committee had been of the opinion that patriotism was not the reason for the mutiny, but that the majority of the members thought otherwise.  Can the Minister state who the former members were, and what grounds they had for their opinion?  The Minister also mentioned some document, other than the report of the Committee, as having come under his notice.  What was the nature of that document, from whom did it emanate, and what influence had it on the decision to reject these men's claims?  It is only fair to these men, in view of the insinuations which the Minister made, and which he subsequently withdrew, against them that all these facts should be made public.</P>
    <P>As far as the actual cost of a scheme to deal with the claims of these men is concerned, we must remember that the number involved is comparatively small.  It is not necessary to go into details here as the Committee, when appointed, would make an approximation. We would have to deal with the 50 or 60 men who were imprisoned and, perhaps, not with that many. I have not got particulars of the present whereabouts of all of these men, but it would appear that the vast majority of those who are still in the country are unemployed and <Col N="925" /> destitute.  About 10 or 12 men have been completely lost touch with, and have probably emigrated.  Some of these men had long service in the British Army, and as a result of their action they have lost appreciable service pensions.  The number of men with long service is, however, limited. There would be about a dozen, with service ranging from 12 to 19 years. No one will deny that these men made considerable sacrifices, and are entitled to something in the nature of a pension.  My own opinion is that in regard to the remainder, a reasonable gratuity based on the particular circumstances of each man's case would prove acceptable, and would be a satisfactory solution of the problem. There might perhaps be something to be said in favour of making more generous provision for those whose health has been permanently injured as a result of imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Deputies should remember that if these men had not mutinied, the majority of them would probably be in different financial circumstances to-day.  Most of them would have remained on in the British Army and would have qualified for service pensions.  The others would have received certain emoluments and bounties to help them start again in civilian life.  Their position would have been entirely different from that in which they found themselves on their release from prison.  Their wives and families were destitute and they themselves were penniless.  The manner in which these men have been treated, and the attitude of the Government towards them should not be approved by any party in this House. These men have been shamefully neglected, and it is time that we assumed some responsibility for them.</P>
    <P>If I might make an estimate I think that anything between £5,000 and £10,000 would meet the case.  The actual monetary loss suffered by each mutineer consisted of pay and allowances, including dependents' allowance during the period of imprisonment. The men spent close on three years in prison and during that time their families were not supported in the matter of dependents' allowance&mdash;that allowance having been stopped by the <Col N="926" /> British Government.  In addition the men forfeited a war bounty or special payment given for services during war time by the British Government.  This would be from £30 to £80 per man. These facts should be taken into account and we ask the House and we must ask ourselves is this State going to treat these men less fairly than they would be treated had they ignored the National call in 1920, and if they had not done what they thought was right for Ireland?  Are we actually going to help the British Government in penalising them for their action? The position is harder when, from time to time, these men come across comrades of theirs who remained in the British Army.  These latter men got pensions and they have been suitably provided for.  Such men sneer at the unfortunate individuals who have been cast off by one Government and ignored by another and left to end their days in the workhouse.</P>
    <P>I might refer for a moment to the circumstances of the mutiny.  We know that a very high kind of courage and a very high form of patriotism were required in the case of those men who mutinied.  In India they were surrounded by British regiments and they had undoubtedly memories of or had known of other mutinies which took place in India on two previous occasions when the mutineers were blown from the cannon's mouth.  These men took the chance of a similar fate befalling them.  The fact that they took action far away from Ireland and surrounded by those thousands of British troops makes their action all the more meritorious from the Irish point of view.  I quite see that a British Officer would have got a different point of view.  Those who might not see eye to eye with them in their action should at least concede that faith unfaithful kept them falsely true.  They were true to Ireland despite their having entered the services of another land.  They helped at any rate to a considerable extent to make outsiders realise the situation in Ireland.</P>
    <P>When you take into account the dissatisfaction created amongst the Irish regiments at the time, there is no judging how much this incident <Col N="927" /> counted with the British Cabinet in their deliberations about Ireland.  It is difficult to say what part they played in bringing the British Government to realise the position in Ireland. The fact that these men have been neglected is a scandal, and one that should be remedied even now at the eleventh hour.  Some of them have already died in the workhouses.  I have a reference here to two of them, Patrick Kelly and Michael Kearns. There was another within the last month who went into the county home. I forget the name, but I read of it in the daily papers within the last month. I quote from a cutting I have here. dated 6th January, 1930, which reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The death has taken place at the county home hospital, Manorhamilton, of Patrick Kelly, formerly a sergeant-major in the Connaught Rangers.  He served in the Great War.  When the Connaught Rangers mutinied in India as a protest against the Black-and-Tan regime in Ireland, he took a prominent part and was sentenced to penal servitude for life.  He was transferred to an English convict prison, where his health gave way as a result of his war services.  Owing to his part in the mutiny he was deprived of a pension.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another is dated 9/8/1930, and it is from the &ldquo;Evening Herald,&rdquo; and reads:&mdash;&ldquo;Connaught Rangers Mutiny. Sir, I regret to state that another of the unfortunate mutineers of the Connaught Rangers has died in poverty in the South Dublin Union.  Michael Kearns, who was imprisoned in Portland, Maidstone, and Manchester for mutiny in India, and whose health suffered through rigorous imprisonment, died on Tuesday, 6th August, in the South Dublin Union.  His relatives, in order that he should not receive a pauper's grave, have added to their poverty by incurring the expenses of a Christian burial.  Perhaps some charitable society might interest themselves. They live at 20 Middle North Court Avenue, Church Road, Dublin.&rdquo; Well, these are the two latest.  I might read a score of letters that I have got from these men, but it would take too much time.  I have also here letters <Col N="928" /> from Deputies who have expressed sympathy and promised to see that they would get justice.</P>
    <P>In support of their claims I might take a few extracts from the summary of evidence in connection with the trial and general courtmartial of Private Daly and others at Dagshai on 23rd August, 1920.  I have the full text of the evidence here, but I will content myself by giving extracts in connection with the trial.  The witness, Major W.N. Alexander, said &ldquo;I pointed out that their action in not parading, which they stated was a protest against the employment of British troops in Ireland, would not have the slightest effect on the policy of the British Government, and I also pointed out to them the serious results which this action would entail on themselves.  A man named Daly stood in front of this parade; he informed me that similar action would be taken simultaneously by every regiment in the Army and that the news would be published in every paper in the United Kingdom.  Whatever influence what I have said may have had on the less determined of the mutineers was promptly wiped out by this man.&rdquo; I do not think anybody will deny that he did his bit for Ireland.  The witness, Captain L.C. Badham, said: &ldquo;The right hand man was carrying a Sinn Féin flag... I saw a Sinn Féin flag stuck in the ground outside the Company Bungalow.  Private Feely said to me &lsquo;You are not going to shoot down any more innocent unarmed Irishmen&rsquo; or words to that effect.&rdquo;  The witness, Sergeant-Major White, said: &ldquo;Private Daly, who seemed to be the spokesman, stated in my presence that they would not soldier any more until the British dogs had been removed from Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Quarter-Master-Sergeant Glenn, referring to a meeting of the mutineers, said they were all wearing Sinn Féin colours made up in rosettes.  Corporal Kelly said &ldquo;Private Daly stood up and said to me &lsquo;Did you see the Sinn Féin flag over our Bungalow?  That shows it was our headquarters, and if Major Alexander wishes to speak to us he had better come down here and do so... I saw a small party all of whom were wearing rebel badges or <Col N="929" /> rosettes.  Private Evers' said to me &lsquo;You should be wearing one of these badges; we have ordered 100 in the bazaar and all the N.C.O.'s of the Company and band will have to wear them to-morrow.&rsquo;&rdquo; Lieutenant Walsh said: &ldquo;Private Oliver said the men had no complaints against their officers, but his reason for being there was on account of the state of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think these extracts from the courtmartial evidence are sufficient to show that patriotism was the reason for the revolt or the mutiny.  Regarding the treatment meted out to them, I might just quote a few of the many letters I have got.  I have one extract from the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; on 7/4/'25 with reference to Mrs. Daly, of Tyrrellspass, mother of the man executed in India.  There is something in the report about a Cumann na nGaedheal meeting, and as part of it might be controversial I shall not refer to it. The report reads: &ldquo;Legislation, Mr. Shaw stated, was going to be introduced to give a pension to the Connaught Rangers.&rdquo;  That was the statement made by Deputy Shaw.</P>

      <P>I hope you will get more for them and we will all be delighted. I have a letter here from an old man residing in Drogheda.  It is dated the 18th June, 1924, and it states: &ldquo;I have been informed by the British Government that I can receive nothing from them; also to apply to the Free State Government, as he died for Ireland and it was their duty to support me. I am an old man unable to work, with only one daughter to support me...&rdquo;  He was the father of one of the mutineers, Smyth.  I have another letter from a Dublin man saying: &ldquo;I <Col N="930" /> am fed up looking for work but cannot find any.  Have you heard anything lately of the promise made by a Cumann na nGaedheal T.D., to see Mr. Blythe or whoever is responsible in the Government?  Every day I knock up against Irish loyalists of the British Army who sneer and jeer at me and say: &lsquo;What have the Free State Government done for you? Would you not have been better off to be loyal to King George and to receive your pension as we did?&rsquo; To tell the truth, I am nearly off my chump looking at my wife and hungry children.  All I have received is seven weeks' work from the Government.  I went to England and got work there, but when they learned I was a Connaught Ranger I was told to clear out as they did not want any mutineers.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Here is another Dublin letter: &ldquo;Just to let you know I am still alive.  I could not go to see you on Sunday as I had to pledge my clothes to pay the rent, and as everything in the house has been sold since I was knocked idle I am now in a proper fix.  My mother has been laid up for the last three weeks....  I wonder what the people who appealed to us to protest against the Black and Tans are thinking about to leave us in such a degraded state?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think I have shown that these men were in dire need and that they were actuated by patriotic motives. Promises have been made from time to time to do something for them.  All we now ask is that a Select Committee should inquire into the question of whether or not they have a good claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very great difference between the case of these men and the case of the resigned members of the R.I.C.  The R.I.C., it should be remembered, were an armed police force serving in Ireland and their intimate local knowledge was a powerful factor in the whole situation. The destruction of the R.I.C. was a very important factor in the struggle. There was a public appeal made to the members of the R.I.C. to resign and to refuse to carry out the duties imposed upon them.  It was clear beyond doubt that so far as the members of the R.I.C. were concerned who resigned <Col N="931" /> they did make a very important contribution to the national struggle.  These men in India were away out of the country.  They were, in reality, no factor in the matter.  There is not the slightest evidence to show that what they did had any influence whatever on the course of the struggle.  I am not denying for a moment that a very high degree of courage was required to do what they did in the circumstances, even though the mutiny was a very small matter and probably had no effect whatever.  But they were not appealed to by anybody to do this.  It was never put up to them as it was put up to the members of the R.I.C. to get out and to contribute to the national struggle by getting out.</P>
      <P>There was, moreover, a further difference between these men and the R.I.C.  Every member of the R.I.C. who continued to serve was certain of being allowed to continue there until he had reached retiring age and then to receive a substantial pension.  The member of the R.I.C. who resigned sacrificed that prospect of employment until he had reached the age of about 50 and a life pension thereafter.  The members of the R.I.C. who resigned in response to that national appeal&mdash; the greater proportion&mdash;have been awarded pensions, but certain men whose motives in resigning are not subject to doubt have been refused because the line was taken that if a man had not spent more than four years in the R.I.C. the sacrifice in resigning from the Constabulary was no more than a young man situated in a position to give a contribution to the national struggle might be expected to give.  In consequence, members of the R.I.C. who served three and a half years or three years and nine months, or other such periods, were refused pensions under the Resigned and Dismissed R.I.C. Order.  They were very different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The majority of these Connaught Rangers who mutinied, so far as can be ascertained&mdash;and there has been a certain difficulty, when the matter was examined, in ascertaining facts&mdash;must have had no longer service than these members of the R.I.C. who resigned and gave up the prospects that they <Col N="932" /> had in the Constabulary, and who received no compensation afterwards.  As far as could be learned there were about 61 of these soldiers sentenced. There is some difficulty in ascertaining the facts.  Of those, so far as can be learned, about six had long service. The average service of the remaining men was about five years, so that a great many of them must have had four years' or less than four years' service. The claim to any compensation of these men who had four years' or less than four years' service is certainly less than the claim of the members of the R.I.C. who were refused compensation.  As I say, they did not give up the prospects that members of the R.I.C. gave up, and they did not, because of circumstances, of course, over which they had no control, make the contribution to the national struggle that members of the R.I.C. made in resigning from the force at the time they did.  These men who voluntarily took such action in India, apart from the fact that they were isolated out there, are precisely in the same position as civilians who made sacrifices for the national cause at home.  There were many civilians who had to sacrifice their goods to a large extent, who had to sacrifice personal prospects and who had to run great risks at home in order to do what they considered they could do, and ought to do, in the interests of the country, and these civilians are receiving no compensation. There are many civilians who made greater sacrifices from the economic point of view than perhaps any of these men did.  All of us know civilians whose businesses were allowed to fall into decay because of the time they gave to national affairs or because of the imprisonment they suffered, and these civilians had no claim, and there has been no proposal to bring in a Bill giving compensation to all the civilians who took risks and who suffered material or economic loss because of what they did.  It would be an impossible position if civilians who could prove they did sacrifice certain prospects or lost certain trade because of their efforts during the national struggle were to be compensated. <Col N="933" /> There is no reason why a man because he wore a British uniform, who perhaps took no greater risks than many civilians took, should be given a pension or a gratuity at the public expense.</P>
    <P>As I said in the beginning, there is every distinction between the case of these men and the case of the R.I.C. The R.I.C. were appealed to by the national leaders to resign and they acquired a claim by the fact that they resigned in response to that appeal. Even a civilian might claim that he was appealed to, as he was in many circumstances, to do this or refrain from doing that, and in that way to encounter risks and incur losses, but these men were not appealed to.  From that particular point of view, they have not only not the claim that members of the R.I.C. had, but they have no greater claim than many civilians actually had.</P>
    <P>A considerable number of these people were given work for certain periods.  Undoubtedly, in certain cases the periods may have been rather short, but out of the 61 men who, as far as we can discover, were sentenced, 31 at one time or another were given employment.  I admit that in many cases the period may not have been as prolonged as we would have liked it to be.  For a considerable time they were not exactly ranked, unless they had actually served, with the ex-members of the National Army for the purpose of preference in employment. I think that there is certainly a case in all the circumstances for ranking them with the ex-members of the National Army and for trying, in as many cases as possible, to provide them with employment.  I think it is entirely inaccurate to say that the vast majority of these men would ultimately have pensions.  I think the great majority of them would not have pensions ultimately at all.  They would have gone to the Reserve on the completion of their seven years' period, and while they would have had certain financial benefits for a period of five years by being on the Reserve, they would also have had certain obligations.</P>
    <P>In regard to the men who have had long service&mdash;their numbers are very <Col N="934" /> small as far as can be discovered&mdash; there would be a case for making special efforts to get them some employment of a permanent character in the public service in some of the minor grades which might be open to them. Deputies have stated that certain of them have died in the workhouse or in distress, or are suffering from distress and destitution.  In certain quarters we hear every day complaints of ex-soldiers of the British Army being in grave distress and destitution. In fact, we see scare headlines in certain papers indicating that, not a few dozen, but actually thousands of British ex-servicemen are in a state of destitution.  If some of these men are in a condition of destitution many of them perhaps would have been in very similar circumstances to-day even if there had been no mutiny.  They would have simply been discharged from the Army in due course, and if they had not been able to fit into civilian life quickly they would have been suffering from the same difficulty.</P>
    <P>Even if it were regarded as necessary to re-examine this case in any way, it certainly is not the sort of case for a Select Committee of the House. It is a very small matter.  The number of men who might be regarded as having some serious claim would be the six long-service men.  So far as the others are concerned, they have no claims, beyond the sort of claims that might be very satisfactorily examined in two or three speeches in the Dáil.  The case of the men who had long service is one which I would be prepared to re-examine, not with a view to giving them pensions or gratuities, but with a view to considering seriously what further steps could be taken, because a certain number of them have been provided with employment in Government service, and certainly some of them with employment of a permanent character.</P>
    <P>The Deputy who moved the motion has asked what was the constitution of the Committee that was established in March, 1925, and who were the members of it.  The Committee consisted of four members, namely: Seamus Dolan, T.D. (Chairman); Diarmuid O'Hegarty, Secretary to the <Col N="935" /> Executive Council; P.S. O'Hegarty, Secretary to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs; and Mr. R.J. Baker, Chief Auditor of the Department of Local Government and Public Health. The Terms of Reference to the Committee were to examine and report on the claims for compensation from the Government of Saorstát Éireann put forward by certain ex-members of the Connaught Rangers.  It is not accurate to say that only representations in writing would be received.  The representatives of the men were asked, first to put forward their case in writing which, I think anyone will agree, is necessary in carrying out investigations of that sort.  After the representations in writing were received representatives of the men were examined verbally so that they might supplement the representations that were made in writing, and so that they might answer any queries which members of the Commission might put to them.  If the Committee had made up its mind that it was going to recommend gratuities to members of the Connaught Rangers, then, of course, it might be necessary for the Committee to see either all the men or a great number of them to ascertain in detail the facts of each individual case.  But when the Committee was examining merely a broad question of whether these men had a claim for compensation from the Government of the Saorstát, it was only necessary to examine one or two men who knew the general facts of the case, and could put these facts before the Committee.  Whatever differences of opinion there might be on one or two points of the details, the facts are exactly as I have stated them.  As regards the great majority of these men they were simply soldiers doing their seven years' service, with a period of service, after the seven years, in the Reserve, and their case was in no way comparable to the ex-Royal Irish Constabulary men; they were acting without a national appeal or national direction.  They, therefore, did not acquire any claims on the public fund that would be acquired by acting on such appeal.  They were not in a position to make any contribution <Col N="936" /> of an effective kind to the national struggle; and their sacrifices were not greater than the sacrifices made by many thousands of civilians in whose case no question of compensation had been raised.</P>
    <P>There has been talk of bad treatment in prison.  Of course, there are people whose health suffers in prison, but I would not be inclined, without a good deal of evidence, to pay much attention to the allegation of ill-treatment. In the old days some people in the prison I was in were very much inclined to write home about bad treatment when such did not exist, and because of that, I have a disposition to doubt the allegation of ill&mdash;treatment. Nevertheless, there are individuals whose health would suffer because of the confined condition, even if there was nothing that could be described as bad treatment.  We all know there are individuals whose health will not stand prison even when the conditions are good, but that applies again to a great number of civilians.  It seems to me it is a thing altogether without sense of perspective, to propose to set up a Select Committee consisting of five Deputies to consider the case of whether these Connaught Rangers should be awarded compensation by way of pension or gratuity.  As a matter of fact I think that even if the House took a view diametrically opposite to the view I am now taking that that sort of a Committee could not possibly ascertain the facts that would be required if compensation was going to be awarded.  In the investigation which took place in regard to the cases of resigned and dismissed Royal Irish Constabulary men there was often very great difficulty in ascertaining the facts, and many cases were put forward which contained misrepresentations that vitally affected the case.  If investigation were to take place I believe it could be effectively carried out only by the employment of Departmental machinery which was employed in the case of members of the R.I.C.  Although there was a Committee in that case which I think did very valuable work, it was necessary, after the Committee had completed its labours, to carry on a supplementary investigation in a very large number of cases and by means <Col N="937" /> of that investigation it was possible to elicit facts that could not be elicited by the Committee.</P>
    <P>While I have said what I have said against the claims put forward on behalf of these particular men, I do not want it to be taken that I am without sympathy for them.  I am only trying to combat what I regard as an extravagant claim put forward on their behalf. As I have said already, it is an undoubted fact that men could not mutiny in India in the condition in which these men mutinied without courage of a very high character. While it does not constitute a claim for compensation out of public funds, it is a factor that ought to be weighed to the extent that it was a somewhat remarkable thing that these men who had voluntarily gone into the British Army and who were separated from their country by thousands of miles, should have been so moved as to take this kind of action, I certainly think, because of the remarkable qualities that were displayed by these men in courage and because they were moved by the facts in Ireland in spite of their surroundings and their particular position as members of the British Army, that every effort should be made to see what can be done to ease the circumstances of those individuals who most need to have their circumstances eased.  But in view of everything, I think that in any case claims such as these would be met by giving employment to these men.  I think that the question of pensions and gratuities should not come into it at all.  As I have stated, certain members have been given employment. There are others who were, so to speak, treated on the same basis as ex-members of the National Army.  There are others for whom employment in one way or another can be found&mdash;employment of a suitable character.  So far as any claim that these men may have against the public purse is concerned, that would be more than meeting any strict claim they have.  It would be making allowance for the factors that I have already mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Clare): For the last <Col N="938" /> seven years it has been my lot to listen to arguments from the opposite benches, but anything so vacillating, anything so unconvincing, or anything so degrading to national gratitude I have never listened to than has been stated here this evening by the Minister for Finance.  He says that the retirement of members of the R.I.C. was a powerful factor in the struggle.  He says that this mutiny had no influence on the struggle.  Let us see what was the position when these men did mutiny.  What were we anxious to do in this country and to have done for us during 1920?  Whether we participated in the struggle or not, we all kept our eyes open and saw what was happening around us.  When we are told by the Minister for Finance that this mutiny had no effect upon the struggle, we are forced to ask ourselves: what was the desire of the Government of that time as regards publicity in foreign countries?  What effect had the mutiny of the Connaught Rangers upon a country like India, seething at that time with discontent, which is now expressing itself? What effect had the mutiny of the Connaught Rangers in India, seething with disaffection, and what effect had the incitement to dissaffection in India upon the mind of those who were governing this country with steel and fire?  What effect had that mutiny when it was blazoned forth in America and when it burned a gap in that wall of paper which was set up around this country to prevent the truth from reaching America and other countries? Had that no effect on the struggle here?  Had it no effect upon countries friendly to this country?  Had it no effect on showing up the kind of warfare that was being carried on in this country in the name of the British Empire and in the name of the British people?  We are told that it had no effect upon the struggle.  We are told that these men mutinied with no national appeal, that they were not asked to mutiny.  They were not asked to take any part in the struggle, and yet we cannot deny the fact that they did mutiny and blazon the position of affairs in Ireland throughout India, throughout America, and throughout the universal world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="939" /> The Minister tells us that civilians suffered and made sacrifices in this country and that their cases are comparable with the case of the Connaught Rangers.  What did civilians suffer in this country?  What was the position of civilians here as compared with 80 Connaught Rangers in India? Has the Minister for Finance no imagination?  Cannot he realise that at the time every house here was a refuge for any man who raised his hand or voice against British domination in this country?  Every boy and girl in the schools were spies to warn such a man as to where the armed forces of the British Government were. Every man and woman was on the watch on the hillsides to tell the armed forces of the Irish Republic and to tell the civilians who were in danger where the Tans or the British military were.  Every man, woman and child in the greater part of the country were active participants in that struggle against British domination. And we are told that their case is comparable with that of the Connaught Rangers in India! What was the position in British India?  What was the position of the 80 men who told their commanding officers that they would not parade, that they would not go on active service, that they would not take any active part in manoeuvres in India so long as the struggle was continued in the fashion in which it was being carried on in Ireland?  Can we not imagine the bayonets bristling around them and the bullets made ready by soldiers some of whom were not alone willing, but perhaps anxious, to have revenge on those Connaught Rangers. Where could they fly for safety? Where were the men and women to warn them, or where were the children to stop them at the cross-roads and to tell them where danger lay?  They sacrificed their safety; they sacrificed their position and prospects, and yet we are told that civilians were in the same position in this country! There is no parallel, and the Minister knows it.  Any man who lived through the conditions in this country knows that you cannot compare conditions in Ireland in 1920 with the conditions in British India, <Col N="940" /> with the British military temper as it was then.  You cannot compare those conditions with the conditions of the civilians or the armed soldiers of the Republic at that time.</P>
    <P>We are told that no civilians have got pensions, that no civilians have been compensated.  I am not anxious to detract from the activities of any man in the service of his country.  I am not anxious to say one word that would detract from their compensation or from whatever consideration they are getting for their activities.  But if we had a list of the names and addresses of those who are receiving pensions in the Irish Free State, we would be in a position to say that there are no civilians getting pensions or that there are civilians getting pensions. What is the mysterious document, I wonder, that was presented to the Government which induced them to come to the conclusion that these men did not act with patriotic motives or did not act because of what was happening in this country?  It is just as well we should have some contemporary evidence of the period under review.  Some people would be considered prejudiced in favour of these men and other people might be considered prejudiced against them.  But if I quote from two authorities, I may possibly convince the Minister that there can be no doubt whatsoever as to the intentions of these men in India. What was the position and affairs in Ireland in 1920?  What was happening here then?  Let us have contemporary evidence.  I find the following in a book written by General Piaras Beaslai:</P>
    <P>A month later the &ldquo;Irish Bulletin&rdquo; gave particulars of nine unoffending civilians killed and about 70 persons wounded during the previous 30 days by these same protectors, and the following list of towns shot up or partially or wholly wrecked by the &ldquo;Forces of the Crown&rdquo;: Bantry (twice), Kilcommon (twice), Thurles, Pennywell, Clondulane, Ballindine, Limerick (twice), Union Hall, Swords (twice), Templemore, Emly, Fermoy, Rearcross, Enniscorthy, Lismore, Ballylanders, Tuam, Newcastle West, Newtownmountkennedy, and Carrick-on-Shannon.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="941" /> We find also, in the same book, extracts from the paper issued from Dublin Castle at the time in which it belauds the activities of these men, in the following terms:</P>
    <P>They did not wait for the usual uniform; they came at once; they were wanted badly and the R.I.C. welcomed them; they know what danger is; they have looked death in the eyes before and did not flinch; they will not flinch now; they will go on with the job&mdash;the job of making Ireland once again safe for the law-abiding and an appropriate hell for those whose trade is agitation and whose method is murder.</P>
    <P>We find also in the report issued by the British Labour Party the following conclusions:&mdash;</P>
    <P>We cannot close this section of the report without an appeal to the British Labour Movement and to the British public.  Things are being done in the name of Britain which must make her name stink in the nostrils of the whole world.  The honour of our people has been gravely compromised.  Not only is there a reign of terror in Ireland which should bring a blush of shame to the cheek of every British citizen but a nation is being held in subjection by an Empire which has proudly boasted that it is the friend of small nations.</P>
    <P>Probably the Minister is wondering what is the relevance of all this.  I have here a history of the Connaught Rangers written by Lieut-Colonel H. F.N. Jourdain, C.M.G., late commanding 2nd Bn.  The Connaught Rangers, and Edward Fraser.  What do they say?&mdash;</P>
    <P>It was in these circumstances that on Monday, June 28th, 1920, after two of the hottest days that year, the following occurred.  Some of the last draft just mentioned mutinously refused to parade and several others joined them.  They were influenced, as they declared, by political news from home contained in letters from home which had arrived the day before. The numbers of the disaffected were such that they controlled the situation and they were deaf to reason <Col N="942" /> or argument, declaring that their action was intended as a political gesture of protest.</P>
    <P>It is also stated that emissaries of the mutineers had gone on to other places.  We have now this position: in 1920 murders, lootings, burnings and outrages of every conceivable kind were being committed by the armed forces of the British Empire. This information was sent out to the Connaught Rangers.  The Connaught Rangers, acting on that information, refused to be the tools of the British Empire in India.  They mutinied.  They risked their lives and ruined their prospects. They did more for propanganda for the Irish struggle than any amount of literature or any number of ambassadors sent abroad.  They blazoned forth the story of that struggle in India.  They threw its flame across to America.  They made the whole world ring with the knowledge that Ireland was struggling against conditions which no country in history, possibly, had to struggle against before.  And, then, some of them faced a blank wall and a firing party.  Those of them who escaped came back here.  We find one of them in my own county in need of sustenance and struggling among the army of unemployed.</P>
    <P>When representation is made here to the Government of the State, we are told that the action of these men had no effect upon the struggle.  Can there be any doubt as to their courage?  Can there be any doubt as to their motive? I ask the Minister if there can be any doubt as to the effect which their action had upon world opinion.  Yet, when we ask for consideration for them, we are told that they will get some kind of employment.  That is not national gratitude, and that is not the way a National Government ought to face the position.  The patriotism of these men has been proved.  Their courage has been proved.  What they did is beyond question, and national gratitude should be forthcoming in a manner commensurate with their action and not in the form of paltry doles or employment of some temporary kind which the Minister has in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. Shaw Mr. Shaw">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shaw</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say in the first place that I feel sure we all appreciate <Col N="943" /> the brave and patriotic action of these men when they laid down their arms in India as a protest against the cruel wrongs that were being perpetrated here against their countrymen. I would like to point out that the fact of their having taken part in this mutiny is no bar whatever to their rights to a disability pension from the British Ministry of Pensions.  When considering a man's right to a pension, his service record is not taken into consideration, the one and only question being&mdash;is the man's disability due to his service?  Deputy Fahy stated that we were helping the British Government to penalise those men.  He mentioned that the British Government had cast them off.  He made the case that a particular person, owing to his part in the mutiny, was deprived of his pension.  I want to clear the air on that point, when I say that the fact of a man having taken part in the mutiny in India does not in any way debar him from getting a pension.  Some years ago there was a rule in existence that a man would not be eligible for a pension if he did not apply for it within seven years.</P>

      <P>I can state very positively that there is not now any bar of that kind.  There is no difficulty now in having a claim considered no matter what the period is.  If proof of the statement which I make here is necessary, I would point to the case of an ex-Connaught Ranger who lives in Mullingar, who took part in the mutiny and who was sentenced to a long term of imprisonment.  He is now in receipt of a life pension from the British Government.  That was awarded in 1928, just prior to the end of the seven year period.  That was principally due to the fact that he had some help.  I wish to say this: there are thousands and thousands of persons in the Free State, men, women and children, who could get increased that £2,500,000 which is coming <Col N="944" /> in here, if the persons who profess to have great sympathy with them only raised one finger to help them.</P>
      <P>I am Chairman of the Pensions Committee for seven counties.  I am not going to dwell here on the wonderful work we were able to do and the wonderful sums we are able to secure for these people.  I make this statement, however, that every single individual&mdash; I don't want to say anything about Parties&mdash;ought to come along there and help to bring money into the country.  There are plenty of people who could help them if they made the attempt to help them.  There is another ex-Connaught Ranger living in my constituency who took part in this mutiny, and who was sentenced to a long term of imprisonment in India, afterwards being dismissed from the British Army.  He was awarded a pension.  I admit it was only for a period, and that that period has now expired, but he has received both treatment and treatment allowances. I know that his treatment has cost hundreds of pounds to the British Ministry of Pensions, as he has been for very many months in British Hospitals in this country.  I have certainly the greatest possible sympathy for these men.  I would make a very strong appeal to the Minister that we should not be any less sympathetic to them than the British Government were.  I submit the proper thing is to give employment to them. I want to make this point at which some Deputies on the other side would perhaps sneer.  There are a great many of these Deputies chairmen of county councils and boards of health. What have they done for these men? I begged employment for the particular man I mentioned from the Westmeath County Council and the Board of Health.  He never received anything from them, and he was almost starving until he got a pension. I ask Deputy Fahy, who has a great influence with a large number of persons on these county councils, to use that influence to try to get them employment.</P>

      <P>I think these men should be treated sympathetically, undoubtedly, <Col N="945" /> and I would make a strong appeal to the Minister that they ought to get preference of employment from the Government, and also plenty of work from the county councils which, I am sorry to say, in some counties Fianna Fáil dominate.  The only case I refer to, and it is a sad one, is that of Mrs. Daly, of Tyrrellspass, the mother of Private Daly, who was shot in India.  I administered £20, which President Cosgrave gave me out of his own pocket, to her, and I got her 10/- a week home help; but unfortunately she died; but what did the Party on the other side do?  I say that these men should get preference for work, and I repeat that the Minister should see that they do get Government work. I want to pay a tribute to the few people in this country who have worked hard in the interest of ex-Service men, and I am sorry to say they are only too few.</P>

      <P>Deputy Shaw tells us that he begged for employment for members of the Connaught Rangers who mutinied in India.  He tells us a lot of bunk about men who should be entitled to a disability pension, and that the regulations governing pensions from the British Army are such that a man could claim a pension after a period of seven years.  Any ex-soldier knows that.  These are not disability pensions that are being claimed.  What we claim is justice for men who, at the time when Ireland was in the throes of a war with England, were prepared to do or die for their own country.  We are not asking for charity for anybody.  We are looking for justice.  The Minister, in his vacillating speech, stated that their case is not comparable with the case of the R.I.C.  It is not.  The R.I.C., who fought against the people of this country, were granted pensions because the Minister and his colleagues agreed to it.  They fought tooth and nail against this country.  These men, who served in the British Army, who knew that on the slightest sign of mutiny they were doomed in India to death or imprisonment, were prepared to do and die, and their case is not comparable with the R.I.C., who are enjoying £2 10s. and £3 10s. a week pensions.  The men who fought against <Col N="946" /> this country, until they had to be disbanded, until they could do no better&mdash; their case is not comparable with the case of the Connaught Rangers who, when they were members of the British Army in India, went out in rebellion against the British Army on account of what was being done in Ireland. Deputy Shaw talks about begging for jobs for men like those.  I remember when the case for the Connaught Rangers was up here before in this House, having particulars of the individual cases of these men.  I remember that the father of one of these at that time was in the poorhouse. The Minister then says that it is not comparable with the cases of the R.I.C.</P>
      <P>The Minister was one of those who stumped this country from one end to the other, who was a fountain pen warrior at a time when other men were risking their lives.  The Minister wanted propaganda.  As Deputy Hogan pointed out, this was one of the finest pieces of propaganda during the trouble in Ireland.  It was said of the Minister that his words were so hot they might have burned the paper they were written on.  That Minister is one of those who comes along to us and tells us their case is not comparable with the cases of the R.I.C.  The Minister refuses to treat those cases on their merits.  Some of those men who had 17 years' service ordinarily would have been coming out of the British Army with a pension.  Those men were prepared to lay down their lives for a certain ideal.  They were prepared amongst hostile troops in India to say: &ldquo;We will not carry on as long as things exist in Ireland as they exist at the present time.&rdquo;  Those men knew what they were up against.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ministers may pay lip service to the British Empire and tell us what they think of the British Army and Navy, as they have done in the last three or four weeks.  I know what it means to be in the British Army, and know what it is to mutiny in the British Army.  These men were prepared to die for their country.  That Minister for Finance is not even prepared to put them on the same footing as he put the R.I.C., who fought against this country to the bitter end.  We do not <Col N="947" /> beg for these men.  All they want is jobs.  They are entitled to pensions, but they do not even get jobs; their people were left to die in the poorhouse, and Deputy Shaw talks about begging for jobs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Question 18, which was on the Order Paper to-day, and the subject-matter of which I desire to raise on the Motion for the Adjournment, was as follows:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether the claim of Mrs. Mary Finlay, Tullyvogey, Tydavnet, Monaghan, for an increase in her old age pension is now before him on appeal by the pensions officer; whether he will state the approximate date upon which this claim will be decided, and whether he will also state in detail the headings under which the pensions officer has assessed her income, and the amount attributed to her under each heading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's reply was very brief. He said that such a claim was at present before the Department on appeal. I asked the Minister to come down to details, as in such a case as this the Old Age Pension Acts and the regulations governing them are complicated. From the knowledge of them previously displayed in this House by the Minister, I have been driven to the conclusion that he does not understand much about the matter.  I do not think it is right that he should get away with such a discourteous reply as that which he gave in this particular <Col N="948" /> case.  I submit that it is not to the credit of the Minister, and that if he were as wise as he is discourteous in this particular instance he would not make such desperate attempts to secure economy at the expense of the class of the community involved in this question.  It is hard to see any adequate reason why the Minister should not inform us as to the approximate date upon which this question will be decided.  One would imagine that that was not too much to ask, yet the Minister refused to give that information.  He refused to tell us how the pensions officer arrived at the amount of income attributed to this old lady and refused to tell us the headings under which each item of income was put down and the amount attributed to her under each heading.  It seems extraordinary that such obstacles are put in the way of claimants to old age pensions, while every facility is placed at the disposal of pensions officers whose business it is to secure that old age pensions will cost the State as little as possible. When evidence is submitted on behalf of a claimant, whose case is appealed to the Local Government Department, by a Deputy or anyone else acting on behalf of the claimant, the evidence is sent to the pensions officer for his criticism.  He is afforded opportunity to criticise, find fault, and pick holes in such evidence if he can.  The claimant is not informed at any time of the case which, is being made against him or her by the pensions officer.  I submit that that is utterly unfair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is utterly untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The time at our disposal is limited and I do not propose to waste very much of it in dealing with the flimsy and futile interruptions of the Minister.  He will have an opportunity when replying of proving the inaccuracies which he alleges are contained in my statement of the case. The pensions officer has to appeal in the case of an increase in the pension whether he is convinced that the claimant is entitled to an increase or not.  Automatically such case is appealed arid the grounds of appeal are never placed before the claimant.  It <Col N="949" /> has actually happened&mdash;if the Minister states that this is untrue I will quote two cases for him&mdash;that an appeal against an award of a pension has been made by the pensions officer to the Local Government Department on the ground of age.  The claimant was informed that an appeal had been lodged against the decision of the Committee on the ground of age.  A notification was sent from the Secretary of the Committee and from the Local Government Department and, while evidence was submitted to the Department on the ground of age, the appeal was disallowed on the grounds of means, though the claimant was never informed that there was an appeal on the grounds of means.</P>
      <P>That should not be allowed to continue. To my mind, a person of seventy years of age, or over, is entitled to an old age pension if he or she complies with certain statutory qualifications as to means.  If it is alleged that the latter requirements are not complied with, surely, in all human justice the claimant is entitled to know the basis of calculation.  In these old age pension cases the pensions officer is, for all practical purposes, a State counsel.  Most of the claimants for pensions are people who are practically illiterate.  It is the duty of the pensions officer, if he can possibly secure it, to see that as few pensions as possible are allowed.  The Minister might, perhaps, put forward the argument that the sub-committee can make the necessary recommendation on behalf of the claimant whose case is appealed.  The sub-committee may do that, but they are not bound to do it, and the appeal is very often laid against both the Committee and the pensions officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take, for example, the case of school records.  If there is not statutory evidence as to age, the pensions officer searches for any possible clue which would show that the claimant is not of age.  He sometimes turns up the old school records, and on such records a claimant may be deprived of a pension. It has been proved time and again, and I personally proved it in many cases, that the records are inaccurate to the extent of even ten years.  Will the Minister tell us, when the pensions <Col N="950" /> officer submits such evidence against a claim, that the claimant is ever informed that such a document has been submitted and used against him? I have never known it to occur.  I think that the Minister's attitude on this whole question of old age pensions appeals is nothing short of a public scandal.  There is a motion in my name and in that of another Deputy of our Party which will give the House an opportunity of dealing with that particular aspect of the question.  If Deputies were allowed, as they were allowed up to 1929, to make personal representations on behalf of claimants and know the case made by the pensions officer behind the back of a claimant, they could deal with the case there and then, and the necessity to raise such matters as this on the Motion for the Adjournment would not arise.  The Minister should not be allowed to get away with this.  We will continue to raise such matters and we will see that this section of the community will get justice whether the Minister likes it or not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not quite clear what exactly he wants to talk about or what he wants to complain about.  On the 4th December last year, almost exactly a year ago, a question was raised here complaining of the arrangements that I had introduced that third parties would not have approach to the Deciding Officer in connection with old age pension appeals.  We had a lot of talk about that here&mdash;that twenty-five questions would be asked by one Deputy and 47 by another and questions were to be raised on the adjournment and the whole place was to be filled up by all the terrible cases arising out of old age pension appeals that Deputies wanted to deal with so very much.  But now on the 3rd December, twelve months with the exception of one day after that, we are now discussing an old age pension question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been asked by a Deputy in connection with the case under appeal to state here what the claimant's means were.  I do not think that the Deputy, much as he suggests about my ignorance with regard to the operations of the old age pension appeal system, knows anything about it.  I <Col N="951" /> would suggest to him and to the Deputies who are really interested in the proper deciding of old age pension appeals that they refer to the report of the Committee set up to examine the old age pension system in 1925, which Committee reported in December, 1926.  Their report is now in the library.  I think, sir, that if Deputy Ward had ever looked at that report on the whole question of old age pension appeals his attitude would now be quite different.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not necessary. The report showed that the procedure followed in connection with old age pension claims was this&mdash;that the applicant got a form at the post office and filled up the claim.  That claim then went to the pensions officer who filled a very elaborate form which gave all the details as to how the applicant's means were arrived at.  That form passed through the supervisor's office and it came to the Committee. The old age pensioner at that time got two days' notice&mdash;I think he now gets longer notice&mdash;that his claim had been appealed against, if there was an appeal against it.  He gets notice that the Committee is going to deal with the matter on such-and-such a date. Anything that the old age pensions officer has to say in the case is down in black and white in a very elaborate form.  Then before the appeal comes <Col N="952" /> on, the claimant gets notice that the matter is before the Committee, and he is asked to attend at the hearing when his claim is to be adjudicated upon.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy need not expect that every answer I will give him will be perfectly satisfactory to him, any more than I find it perfectly satisfactory or any more than the House finds it perfectly satisfactory, <Col N="953" /> that we should be discussing this question twelve months after we discussed it before.  If the Deputies who are supposed to be so terribly concerned about this whole machinery would read the very careful report that was rather elaborately prepared by the Special Committee set up five years ago to examine this matter, this discussion might not be now necessary.</P>
      <P>I stated that the statement made by Deputy Ward was untrue, and that is, that the old age pension claimant is not informed at any time of the case made against him by the pensions officer or by the sub-committee.  Deputies will find in that report that the Committee that investigated the matter emphasised that the local or sub-committee was the pivot on which was based this whole question of old age pension claims.  I suggested to the Deputies, discussing this whole matter twelve months ago, that what they wanted was that the work of the sub-committees would be left undone.  I still consider that the work of the sub-committees or committee is the pivotal point in this whole business of old age pension claims and appeals. The Department of Local Government has before it normally no information except the information that is before the committee, that was before the old age pensions officer and before the claimant, if he came to hear his case adjudicated on by the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department cannot refuse to take the recommendations and statements of facts sent by Deputies.  I have stated here that we will place all the machinery that a Deputy may require at his disposal to take down any statement of facts.  It may be that statements can be sent in by a third party which would decide in the mind of the appeals officer whether it would be a case which should be handed over to a departmental inspector to investigate on the spot.  We do that in very many cases, because we do send down an inspector to investigate cases on the spot.  It may be that written representations made by a third party may, when other facts are turned up that have not been before the committee and the pensions officer, lead the officer to decide whether he <Col N="954" /> should send an inspector down.  What I ask Deputies to give further consideration to, before they take exception to the arrangements that we have made in the Department is, that it is unreasonable that any third party should have, behind the back of the pensions officer and behind the back of the sub-committees and behind everybody's back, direct personal appeal and approach to the person who is Deciding Officer and whose duty is to decide on the facts put up by the pensions officer on the one side and by the old age pensions sub-committee on the other side, and to judge on whatever contradictions there are in these two statements.</P>
    <P>The Deciding Officer is responsible for deciding on a question of fact.  I hold him responsible for doing his duty in a detached and thorough way. If I am to hold him responsible for doing that I must secure him against personal approach by third parties, whomsoever these third parties are. But no Deputy can complain that any scrap of information is not accepted in the Department for what it is worth, or that any case of any doubt is not referred to the local committee by means of sending down an inspector there.  I do suggest this to Deputies that in spite of all said about this matter twelve months ago, there has not been a single sub-committee in the country that has made any representation to me on the whole business of appeals, that this business is not being thoroughly satisfactorily and reasonably dealt with.</P>
    <P>When I say that that is so, I want to say that I would expect it to be so, because I do know that these appeals are thoroughly and carefully gone into. I know from the report of the Committee appointed to investigate this matter that that is only a continuance of the satisfactory conditions that obtained before 1925, when the Committee had been set up actually to investigate this matter.  That Committee went into this question.  They had evidence of complaints on all these questions with regard to means, age, delay and all that sort of thing.  They went thoroughly into the matter and they stated the facts that came before their notice.  They certainly had to <Col N="955" /> admit that the matter was being thoroughly, systematically and sympathetically dealt with.  If there was any thing wrong in the system I would expect to hear from the sub-committees who deal with these cases that there was something wrong.  Nothing can be very wrong when it does not come to the Department's notice because, much as Deputies suggest that they have a very sympathetic interest in these matters, I do seriously suggest that the officers of the Department dealing with these matters take a more systematic and, at any rate, a more intelligent interest in them than the Deputies who are raising the question here now.</P>

In reply to Deputy Ward, I say that it would be quite out of order, if at any time in the consideration of a claim it appeared that the claimant was not, under the heading of means, entitled to a pension, he should get it. Why should a person whose means can be shown to be above the statutory limit get a pension?</P>

      <P>That is not the question. The question is: Is it reasonable or thoroughly satisfactory to decide a question on the ground of means when the claimant has been notified by your Department that the appeal rests on the ground of age?</P>

      <P>I cannot conceive, and personally I have never come up against, a case in which a pension officer makes his report which then goes to his superior and to the pensions committee and in which a further report is submitted by the pensions officer direct to the Department.  I certainly think that it could be returned by the appeals officer to the committee. If there were any cases in which there are claims like that, I feel I would have them brought to my notice by some sub-committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very general impression that when an appeal is entered the pension officer does, in fact, submit new evidence which the applicant or even the sub-committee has no knowledge of, and I was anxious that the Minister would make that point clear.  It is, undoubtedly, a general impression.</P>

      <P>The Minister has indicated, if he has not stated quite definitely, that the pension officer never makes a further report which is not submitted either to the claimant or to the sub-committee.  When representations are made to the Department on behalf of the claimant whose case is appealed, are copies of the representations sent to the pension officer for his private report and does that private report ever come either before the sub-committee or the claimant?</P>

      <P>I say it would be quite reasonable that representations that were an addition to the representations originally made by the claimant would be sent down to the pension officer.  I cannot say that that is the general practice, but if the representations were material I say it would be reasonable to send them.  Do not get away on the details of this thing; let us stick to the principle.  If there is anything wrong in detail, if it does not arise between the Department and the sub-committee, it cannot be very much.  In any case, we cannot arrive at a rectification of anything that might be improved in the machinery by approaching it in the manner in which it has been approached by the Deputy to-day.</P>

      <P>In September, 1928, the Commissioners of Public Works submitted proposals to the Kerry County Council&mdash;based on preliminary inspections only&mdash;for the drainage of the Brick-Cashin district.  The scheme suggested is estimated to cost £115,000, and approximately 93 per cent. of this would have to be contributed by way of free grants by the Government and County Council in order to make the project economic for the occupiers of affected lands.  The Commissioners in-their <Col N="823" /> letter inquired whether the County Council were prepared to contribute about 43 per cent. on the assumption that the Minister would give 50 per cent. of the total actual cost of the scheme.  The County Council have not yet decided to make this contribution, and, until they do so, no further action can be taken by the Commissioners.  It is understood that the Commissioner administering the affairs of the County has the matter under consideration.</P>
