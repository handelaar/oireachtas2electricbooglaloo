      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether in view of the fact that only a small percentage of the money subscribed in South Kerry to the Dáil Internal Loan, 1919-20, has been repaid he will have enquiries held in convenient centres in that area so as to facilitate the taking of evidence and the consequent payment to the subscribers.</P>

      <P>The question of setting up a Tribunal or Committee to inquire locally into the claims of persons who allege that they subscribed to the Dáil Eireann (Internal) Loan, 1919-20, has already been considered more than once.  It was decided, however, that apart from the question of expense involved, investigation by a Tribunal or Committee had many disadvantages and that the system of departmental investigation at present in operation would, on the whole, yield more <Col N="1146" /> satisfactory results.  The total amount of cash received in the Dáil Finance Department from the former Parliamentary constituency of South Kerry was £3,153.  Of this amount £1,118 has been entered in the Primary Register and £1,031 has been repaid.  As regards the balance (£2,035), lists have now been received from collectors and others covering subscriptions amounting to £1,537.  These lists are at present under examination, but the rapidity of further progress in authorising repayment must naturally depend on the extent to which the lists prove to be reliable.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice (1) whether he is aware that within recent months there has been unusual delay in the Central Office of the Land Registry in registering the titles of tenant purchasers to their holdings purchased under the Land Purchase Acts and in completing the registration of dealings with registered lands; (2) to state the number of cases awaiting first registration (a) excluding cases arising under the Land Act, 1923, (b) including cases arising under the Land Act, 1923, (c) the number of dealings with registered land awaiting completion; (3) the cause of the unusual delay, and whether any assurance can be given that steps will be taken within a reasonable time that the work of the Central Office of the Land Registry will be expedited so that the public may be protected in dealing with the titles to such lands.</P>

      <P>The figures asked for are as follow:&mdash;(a) 5,943, (b) 7,736, (c) 2,660.  The delay in so far as it is abnormal has been caused by the non-filling of certain vacancies in the staff pending the putting into force of a complete scheme of reorganisation. This scheme is now ready, and will be put into operation at an early date, whereupon it is anticipated that the work of the office will proceed with due speed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald (for Minister for Justice)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. At the time of the occurrence when the French fishing boat reached Valentia Harbour, the captain was approached by the local police, and, with the aid of an interpreter, the position was discussed.  It then became clear that there was no question of a criminal offence.  The particulars of his boat and his crew were, however, taken and given to Jeremiah Mahony in order that he might be able to take such proceedings as he might be advised.  There is nothing further that my Department could do in the matter.</P>

      <P>This matter has already been receiving consideration in my Department, and it is proposed to issue a circular on the subject to managers and teachers of national schools at an early date. As regards secondary schools, there does not appear to be the same need for giving instruction in view of the age of the pupils, and the fact that many of these schools are boarding schools.  Arrangements will be made, however, to issue copies of the circular to the managers of the day secondary schools in the cities and larger towns.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that there is great dissatisfaction amongst the dairy farmers in the Castleisland-Killorglin area, Co. Kerry, regarding prices paid for milk or butter fat by the Dairy Disposals Board; that suppliers in this district during April, 1930, were charged 4d. per lb. more for butter than they received for butter fat, and that the price paid by the milk suppliers for butter during this month was 38/- per cwt. more than the price received for butter exported to England; if he can state why the Board in this district changed from the butter fat system of payment to the payment per gallon; whether he is prepared to institute an enquiry into the working of the Board in this area, and whether, as the dairy farmers in the Castleisland-Killorglin area are anxious to take over the creameries there which are now operated by the Dairy Disposals Board, he is prepared to facilitate such transfers, <Col N="1149" /> and, if not, if he will state the reasons why.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Hogan) Patrick J. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that there is dissatisfaction amongst the dairy farmers in the Castleisland-Killorglin area, County Kerry, regarding prices paid for milk or butter fat by the Dicksgrove group of creameries controlled by the Dairy Disposals Company.  The price charged for butter to suppliers was fixed for April on the first of that month at 1s. 5d. per pound, which price was somewhat less than the average price at which butter was being sold elsewhere in Ireland on that date by that group of creameries.  The change in the method of payment from butter fat percentage to the gallonage basis was made because it was believed that the majority of the suppliers desired the change.  If there is any widespread demand, arrangements can be made to revert to the basis of butter fat.</P>
      <P>I am not prepared to institute an enquiry into the working of the creameries referred to, but I am informed that the Dairy Disposals Company are prepared to make arrangements to transfer the creameries concerned to the suppliers as soon as the suppliers have made the necessary arrangements to finance the purchase by the issue of shares.</P>

      <P>In eight estates in County Kerry which were purchased by the Estates Commissioners or the Congested Districts Board prior to 1923 the resale proceedings have not yet reached the stage of the holdings being vested in the tenants.  In a number of other such estates, whilst most of the holdings have been vested, residues which present unusual difficulty remain to be vested.  Many of the estates purchased by the Congested Districts Board were held in rundale and the process of rearranging holdings and obtaining the tenants' consent thereto as well as providing additional land for enlargement where required is necessarily long and difficult.  Every effort is being made to complete the resale of these estates as soon as possible, and resale schemes have been prepared for practically all the estates situate in County Kerry.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Kelly and, I think, some other Deputy drew attention to the desirability of giving as long a period as possible in which to have the register properly prepared.  With a view to extending the amount of time at the disposal of the Town Clerk to prepare the register, with the leave of the House I would like to change the date from 15th July to 1st July, 1930.  I think that we will have both the Dublin Bill and this Bill law before 1st July and I want to do away with that unnecessary fortnight as the change will help materially those who will have to prepare the register.</P>

      <P>There will be notices published and applications can be made for votes.  The Town Clerk will have the rate books as his main fall-back.  He can, of course, make any further inquiries that seem to him to be reasonable. He is not confined to his register alone and no doubt he will utilise his experience and apply it in the best way he can in compiling the best register that it is within his power to make.  For the first register the main responsibility will be on people who are being given the franchise to apply to be put on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be possible to take steps to bring to the notice of those who are likely to be on the register the fact that they must make a claim?  The difficulty we foresee is that a small minority read the statutory notices in the newspapers and a much smaller proportion act on them.  The first register will be incomplete in view of the fact that the Town Clerk will be dependent mainly on those who make claims.  Would it not be possible for him to circularise those whom he thinks would be entitled to have their names on the register and to ask them to fill in the forms and supply the necessary information?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that there will be the usual procedure by which notices will be displayed at the post offices and church doors. If there is wide publicity in that way I think we are going as far as we can go.  The alternative is to take either some register that has already been compiled, like the Port and Docks register, and to circulate it, or to circulate all business premises and organisations.  I think, however, that that would be putting unnecessary labour on the staff and entailing unnecessary expense for postage.  With widely circulated notices in the Press and the usual <Col N="1162" /> electoral notices at the post offices and church doors.  I think we would have all the publicity necessary. Then, of course, all the talk there has been on this particular type of iniquitous register will help to draw attention to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister has properly described the register when he called it an &ldquo;iniquitous&rdquo; one.  I would like to know whether it is within the power of the Town Clerk to take from the rate books the names of those who would be qualified by the fact that their names appear on the rate books for business premises, professions and the like.  Would he be empowered to make the register himself if he could, without application being made to him, register such persons, even if there were only 5 per cent. of the people, whether entitled to vote or not, on it?  I think that the Town Clerk would make a conscientious effort to have a proper register, but this House in passing the Bill in a hurried fashion is doing everything possible to make the register fit the title which the Minister has just given to it.</P>

      <P>I am not at all clear that in Section 12 the registration officer must give notice to the person concerned when making an objection to that person being included on the register unless his name appears on the published list.  Sub-section (2) provides that where an objection is made by the registration officer and is not included in the list of objections published the registration officer shall send notice of such objection by post or otherwise.

      <P>No.  There is in all the Electoral Acts a provision that any person who has a claim to be on the register and who is objected to must be informed by the objector of the fact that the objection is being made.

      <P>We object to the Schedule as a whole, but before I proceed to give my reasons for our objection there is a minor matter to which I would like to allude, arising out of Section 9, sub-section 3. Provision is there made to deal with the situation that would arise if the number of candidates nominated did not equal the number of vacancies to be filled.  It provides that the additional vacancies shall be filled by lot from the persons highest at the previous election.  It is a very unlikely contingency, but if there were not enough candidates nominated to fill all the vacancies at the first election, how would the seats be filled?</P>

      <P>We are opposed to the section as a whole on the ground that it provides for carrying out the election by a system of postal voting. We stated our reasons for that objection on the Second Reading debate. Our objection still holds good. We cannot see why these commercial electors should not be required to cast their votes personally in the same way as ordinary electors.  We do not think that the cost of providing necessary machinery to enable them to do that would exceed, even if it were to equal, the cost of providing the machinery for postal voters.  We are strongly opposed to <Col N="1166" /> the giving of a special privilege to a selected class of the community in the city.  I have no doubt whatever that the reason why this particular method of carrying out the election of the commercial members was devised was because the Minister knew &mdash;no matter what he may have stated in the Dáil&mdash;that the persons concerned never did take a very active interest in municipal affairs and will not do so, and that they will not vote unless they can be coaxed to do so.  People who have to be coaxed to vote should be left without votes.  That is my candid opinion, particularly when the body concerned is a municipal body.  The giving of these special privileges we are strongly opposed to and we propose to vote against the schedule.</P>

      <P>There is a question that I forgot to ask when the Bill was in Committee.  It relates to the attendance of candidates at the issue of ballot papers and at the counting of the votes (Section 17).  It is not specifically stated in the section.  I am anxious to know if the word &ldquo;candidate&rdquo; in that connection includes the candidate's agent.  Can the candidate appoint an agent to act for him at the issue of the ballot papers and the counting of the votes?</P>

    <P>(1) Whichever of the following sums is the less in any local financial year:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  one-half of the expenses incurred by Boards of Health in providing meals under such Act, or</P>

      <P>On the Schedule, I beg to move:</P>
      <P>To insert in the appropriate places under the words &ldquo;In the County of Donegal&rdquo; the words &ldquo;Creenasmear, Creeslough, Rosguil, Termon.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not desire to repeat what I said on the Second Reading.  I have put down as amendments to the Schedule the names of four areas at present excluded.  They are, to my own knowledge, areas in which a very large number of poor people reside.  The Creenasmear and Creeslough areas probably comprise the greater number of necessitous children. The Termon district lies in a comparatively well-to-do area, but it is a little, mountainy district where the farms are very small, where the crops ripen very late, and where one has great evidence of poverty.  The same remark applies to the district of Rosguil.  It is a wild district, jutting out into the Atlantic, and it is possibly familiar&mdash;familiar in the distance&mdash;to the visitors to the Rosapenna Hotel.  It is a district populated mostly by very small farmers and fishermen.  It is as wild a district as probably would be found in any part of the Gaeltacht. Deputies who have looked at the map will have observed that this particular area is coloured green, unlike most of the district to which it geographically belongs.  That indicates that the district is almost entirely Irish-speaking.  I have listened and weighed the arguments which the Minister adduced against any extension of the area as settled in the Bill.  I quite realise that his views are shared by a great many people who have more practical knowledge as members of county councils of the probable working of the Act than I have.  Therefore, I do not want to press my views unduly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard this, as I have said before, <Col N="1175" /> merely as the first stage in the extension of the principle of looking after necessitous school children in rural areas.  The first step was taken a great many years ago.  I am glad to say that I had something to do with it in another place.  I was in charge of a Private Member's Bill which was ultimately carried. The purpose of that Bill was to make it possible to feed necessitous school children in our towns.  We have now gone a step further.  We will have to go even further still.  It is for the Minister to consider whether, in the circumstances, the small additions I suggest in my own county are additions which might not meet with his favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister's attitude the last day was that he was not prepared to add to the Schedule or to include any further areas than are already in the Schedule.  Otherwise I would have put in amendments to include areas to which I referred when the Bill was last under consideration.  If the Minister is prepared to consider the inclusion of any further areas in the Schedule, I would ask him to bear in mind the particular areas that I brought to his notice, with the conditions obtaining in which I am sure his Department is quite conversant.</P>

      <P>Ba cheart go mbeadh athas ar an Teachta O Guilidhe ná fuil Portláirge cho bocht leis na h-áiteanna sa sceideál.  I am not prepared to accept the amendment.  I <Col N="1176" /> pointed out on the Second Reading that no matter what line would be drawn in a Bill of this kind there would be cases&mdash;and good cases&mdash; put up for extending it outside this line.  I do not say that this line is a perfect line, but at least it was drawn up after very considerable care, and after consultation amongst officials who have very great experience of the Gaeltacht&mdash;inspectors of the Department of Education, inspectors of the Department of Local Government and inspectors of my own Department.  It was after consultation between these different officials that this line was eventually drawn.  I am satisfied that we took into consideration every relevant matter when we were drawing that line.  The really important point is that it must be the Gaeltacht first. Then, the guiding principles are the getting in of the poorest areas in the Gaeltacht and the areas in which the children have to travel farthest to school.  I am satisfied that the places mentioned in the amendment do not compare with those included in the Schedule in those two respects; that is, poverty and the distance which the children have to travel to school. Deputy Law, and in fact the Tirconaill Deputies generally, should be very pleased with this Bill.  I feel that in my own constituency I will get into very serious trouble because of the number of very poor areas excluded.  I should like, of course, to extend it much further, but I believe that if I made any attempt to do so there would be very considerable trouble in getting the county councils and the county boards of health to agree to the expenditure that would be involved.  Practically three-quarters of Donegal is in the Schedule; there are a few small portions of Kerry; there are only two electoral areas in Cork, and no portion at all of Waterford.</P>

      <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to two places that were mentioned by Deputy Ruttledge of which I have some knowledge.  One of them is Lacken, where the boating disaster took place last year, and I think that the Minister will admit, if it is merely a question of poverty, that this is almost as poor an area as any in the Schedule.  The same applies to Shraheen. The other places mentioned by Deputy Ruttledge I do not know anything about, but I think those two places I have mentioned are as poor as can be found anywhere, and why they have been left out passes my comprehension.  Of course, I realise that the £10,000 that the Government is providing will not do very much when spread over a wide area, and I can quite appreciate the desire of the officials of the Department to restrict the Schedule as much as possible with a view to giving something of that £10,000 to the areas in it.  But in areas like Lacken and Shraheen the people are in a heartbreaking state of poverty, and why those two, at any rate, should be left out I cannot understand.</P>

      <P>If the medical officer of health for a particular area&mdash;for example, Lacken, to which Deputy O'Kelly has referred&mdash;is able to make a substantial case for consideration by the Minister's Department, I think that there should be some method by which additions could be made to the Schedule.  We have had this difficulty before on the Gaeltacht Housing Act, and the very fact, as the Minister has admitted, that there are areas on the border-line <Col N="1178" /> that may have to be included later would mean, in my opinion, that there should be some machinery by which the Minister from time to time could make changes.  We have no proof that the inspectorate of the Land Commission, the Local Government Department, or the Department of Education will have the same knowledge of the general conditions in an area as the medical officers of health, and I think that some arrangement should be made before the Schedule is definitely passed in this form whereby their opinions could be got on the matter.</P>

      <P>I would support the point made by Deputy Derrig.  I think the Minister did take power in the Gaeltacht Housing Act either to add or to take from the Schedule should the necessity arise.  He is taking no such power in this Bill, and, even though facts may be brought to his knowledge which will show that certain areas are more deserving of consideration than some of those in the Schedule, he will be quite powerless to do anything unless he first comes to the House for an amending Bill.  I suggest that he should include a section like that in the Gaeltacht Housing Act which would give him power, if he were satisfied that a case existed, to include a particular area in the Schedule. I do not think there is any reason why he should not take that power.</P>

      <P>The power given in the Gaeltacht Housing Act to extend the Schedule was on a mathematical basis, if one might say so.  It was on the question of putting into the Schedule an area which was found on the 1926 census not to have been Gaeltacht if evidence was brought forward to show that the place had become Gaeltacht.  This is rather a different case.  There is a point as to whether one should have power to do what is suggested in cases where representations were made.  I will look into it to see whether it is desirable, and I might suggest to somebody in the Seanad to bring in an amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not opposed to the Bill, but we think that we ought not to permit it to go through without pointing out some of the dangers which may be associated with the amendment which the Minister proposes in the terms of sub-paragraph (a).  When the original Act was before the Seanad, I think the words which it is now proposed to delete from paragraph (b) of sub-section (3) of Section 61 were then inserted, and they were, in my opinion, prudently inserted, because there is no doubt whatever that there is in this instance an element of danger in investing in long term securities.  There is an element of danger in investing in either long or short term securities, but undoubtedly the risk does increase with the currency of the securities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the reasons which possibly actuates the Minister in this connection is the fact that recently the yield from British short term securities has been very small, almost infinitesimal, and for that reason the fact that one can purchase a British long term security which will give a yield of approximately five per cent. <Col N="1181" /> makes it, from the point of view of a Government which proposes to derive some portion of its revenue from currency, desirable that it should have freedom to invest in long term securities. But, as I said, there is an element of risk, whether the investment is in a long term or a short term security, and that element of risk increases with the length of the term of the security.  There is no absolute certainty in these matters, but the element of time increases the element of risk.  A long term security, even a British Government security which may seem as safe as a house to-day, to-morrow may be worthless.  We have had numerous examples of that within the last two decades.  I do not suppose there was any investor in January, 1914, who thought that the securities of the German Empire would be worthless in January, 1919, but the fact remains that they were.  Similarly those who invested their money in Russian securities in 1914 certainly did not think that they would not be worth the paper they were printed on five or six years later.  I am not suggesting for a moment that the British Government is in such a parlous condition to-day that the securities in which the Minister proposes to invest will be worthless to-morrow, but I have cited these examples to prove the contention I am making&mdash;that the element of risk does increase with the currency of the security.</P>
    <P>With regard to the long term securities in which the Minister desires to empower the Currency Commission to invest, I would point out that the fact that they at present stand above par is due to the conjunction of a number of fortuitous factors which may not occur again. If we consider what the effect of the recent events in India and in Malta on British securities would have been if these events had not been neutralised by other factors, I think most of us would come to the conclusion that British long term securities would be depressed to-day, that they would not be standing above par, and that as against them the British short term <Col N="1182" /> securities, in which up to the present the Currency Commission has had power to invest only, would, I think, be yielding a rather higher rate of interest than the British long term securities would.  That is to say, when a State is passing through a crisis its long term securities, which it may not be called upon to redeem for a prolonged term, and in connection with which the investor naturally has to undergo a considerable amount of risk, the risk that his money may be altogether lost or, at least, that owing to some change in the money market he may find when he tries to realise these investments that his capital has depreciated&mdash;we can understand that the long term Government securities in a crisis may very likely go down.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, that Government, when it comes to the money market for a short term loan, has to pay a correspondingly higher amount, so that if it were not for the fact that there are other circumstances at present operating in the money market which neutralise the effect upon British Government securities of the things now taking place in India and Malta, the probabilities are that the short term securities would be yielding an even higher rate of interest in 1930 than they were in the year 1928 and the early part of 1929.  The two factors which have neutralised the effect of the events in India and Malta are, first of all, the deliberate policy of the British Treasury.  Since the present Chancellor of the Exchequer came into power in Great Britain there has been, I think, on his part or on the part of those who are responsible for financial policy in Great Britain a deliberate restriction of the opportunities for short term investment, the consequence being that the money market in Great Britain has been flooded with an excess of money available for investment in short term security; the effect of which has been to drive down the yield from short term securities, the idea here being to compel this money to invest itself in long term securities so that British securities may appreciate and the way be clear for the new <Col N="1183" /> conversion loan which the authorities on the other side have in mind.  As well as that, this deliberate policy on the part of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer has been reinforced and assisted very much by the monetary depression, which is world-wide. That, of course, has also meant that a considerable volume of funds which otherwise would be invested in industrial long term securities is now being placed on the short term market and again has operated to drive down the rates of interest there.</P>
    <P>But these two factors are purely fortuitous.  These are temporary and will pass and when they do pass the tendency will be I believe so far as the British securities are concerned for short term securities to appreciate and to give a yield more or less similar to that which they were giving in the year 1928-29.  We on these benches realise that it is possibly advisable to give the Currency Commission a discretion in the matter, but while we are giving them discretion and power we would like to know that that discretion and power would be exercised wisely.  We on this side of the House would not like to feel that the acceptance of this amendment would mark a change in the policy which the Currency Commission has hitherto been compelled to follow.</P>
    <P>We would not like to think that they would deliberately resolve that henceforward the major portion of their funds would be invested in long-term securities.  That would be a dangerous policy to pursue.  The yield may be more attractive but the risk is correspondingly greater, and what we have to bear in mind in this connection is not the earning capacity of the assets of the Currency Commission, for, no matter how hard driven the Government may be for revenue, the primary factor in the whole of this problem is not and should not be made by the Government to be the earning capacity of the assets of the Currency Commission or the revenue those assets are going to secure for us.  The primary fundamental factor is the absolute <Col N="1184" /> intrinsic safety of the securities in which the moneys of the Currency Commission are invested.  I think the risk of the short term security is very much less than the risk of the long term securities.  We do hope, while we are not prepared to refuse to the Commission this discretionary power, that the power which we are giving them will not be abused.</P>

      <P>What is running through Deputy MacEntee's speech has been in my head since this Bill was introduced on Wednesday last and he has expressed himself very much better than I could.  The object of the Currency Commission is safety first and it is possible that they may be tempted to put their money in the long term securities, either British or American.  It is not likely that there will be another big war but it is possible.  I do not say it is probable there will be another big war.  I think war loan went down very low during the last big war.  The object of the Currency Commission is really not so much to make profit as to ensure the stability of our own currency.  I do not know how the Minister could safeguard it with the Currency Commission, but he might do something so that they would, first of all, put their money into short dated securities and not be tempted by the possible profit they might get out of long dated securities, I think the Minister might consider these points because it is very important to us that our currency should be stabilised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been under consideration not only recently but before the original Bill was introduced and it is a matter in fact which was given consideration when the Banking Commission was sitting.  The result of the Banking Commission's deliberations on the matter was to make no recommendation limiting the Currency Commission as to its purchase of long term securities.  That is, the Banking Commission was of opinion that this was a matter in which the Currency Commission should be allowed to exercise its discretion. <Col N="1185" /> When the Banking Commission report was under consideration in the Department of Finance as when the original Currency Bill was being drafted we came to the conclusion again that it was a matter in which the Currency Commission should be allowed to exercise its discretion. It is quite true that there are certain risks of depreciation involved in the purchase of long term securities which are not present when short term securities only are held.  I am quite satisfied if the Currency Commission errs at all in this matter it will err on the side of caution.  The constitution of the Currency Commission is such that that will be the inevitable tendency.  If something like a new world war broke out undoubtedly the Currency Commission would find itself faced with difficulties; I think if something of the character of a world war broke out it might very well find itself faced with those difficulties.  Then it can only hold short-term securities.  It might find itself faced with difficulties brought about by lack of stability in British currency if we had such a catastrophe.  I am satisfied that the Currency Commission will so divide its investments that, combined with full consideration of all elements of risk, it will also get the best revenue that it is reasonable for the Currency Commission to aim at getting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were two factors which dictated the particular arrangements which are made in the original Currency Act which is administered by the Currency Commission. One was that we should have parity of sterling, that our currency should be exchangeable for sterling at par for any amount which might be offered, and consequently, instead of backing our currency by gold which would be held in vaults not earning anything, we should hold the securities of Great Britain to which are now added the securities of the United States which would earn money.  That is, while the factor of earning is by no means the primary factor, it was one of the factors which were <Col N="1186" /> taken into account in devising the currency scheme we have in operation, and while every risk must be fully looked to and investments must be so placed that undue risks of any sort are not taken, at the same time it would be unreasonable to continue the restriction which is at present in force and which, if it continues in force, would limit very seriously the earnings which it would be possible to make on the legal tender note.  I think there is absolutely no danger that the Currency Commission is going to avail of the powers now given in any rash way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point possibly which might meet Deputy Murphy's position and also our position.  The Minister, I think, has power to prescribe the form in which the Currency Commission will make its report.  Will he take into consideration the question of taking out under separate heads the amount invested in long-term and short-term securities so that, if necessary, the House might be aware of the form in which the legal tender note has been so invested, and, if necessary, the matter could be raised here?</P>
      <P>There is one other point.  The Minister made reference to the fact that we were working on the gold exchange standard.  While we are not opposing this Bill, we do not wish on this side of the House to be taken as endorsing the decision arrived at by the Currency Commission in that regard and the effect which the Minister has given to that in the currency system.  I believe it would be much safer if we were working on the gold bullion standard and to make up our mind that however we were to make money we would not make it out of gold currency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer again this session to some matters in connection with the administration of some of the Civil Service departments with a view to getting some statement from the Minister as regards future policy.  About twelve months ago I referred to the position occupied by typists and shorthand-typists in the Civil Service. According to the syllabus for the November, 1924, examination, paragraph 7, under the sub-head of &ldquo;Terms and Conditions of Service,&rdquo; says:&mdash;&ldquo;Promotions from typists to shorthand-typists will be made from time to time as the result of examination tests.  Shorthand-typists are eligible for promotion to be superintendent of typists, subject to certain conditions as regards length of service and the possession of suitable educational attainments.  Shorthand-typists are also eligible for promotion to the clerical grade.&rdquo;  Despite the promise indicated in that paragraph, and the inducements held out to candidates for those positions, these promotions have not taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to suggest to the Minister that it is rather unfair and unjust to young persons entering the service to have held out before them prospects of promotion, if and when they give the necessary time for <Col N="1189" /> study in order to advance themselves, and having given that time and study to find themselves kept back and to have all the avenues of promotion in the service banned to them.  The position, as I understand it, is that there are only a few superintendents of typists on the old British scale.  The great majority are on the shorthand-typists' scale with an allowance of five shillings a week as superintendents.  In many cases some of these shorthand-typists are doing superintendent's work without getting the appropriate Civil Service increase.  The custom is, I believe, to give them an increase of five shillings a week while doing this duty, and there are many places where they are only in receipt of three shillings a week extra.  I submit that there should be some regularity in this matter and that they should all receive the scale of salary appropriate to the position of superintendent.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question which I asked some time ago, the Minister for Finance indicated his unwillingness to sanction the appointment of a commission of inquiry into the organisation of the Civil Service.  It is hardly necessary to stress the fact that there is a good deal of dissatisfaction in the Civil Service, particularly among the lower grades.  The Minister also should know that that dissatisfaction is not confined to the lower grades, but exists to a certain extent also in the higher grades, and is also reflected in the Press and among commercial circles in the country.  These are fairly adequate reasons why a commission of inquiry should go into the whole matter so that we can have once and for all a full and free examination as to conditions and promotions in the Service. It is also stated in the Press and other circles&mdash;this is not my suggestion and I do not think it is the suggestion of the lower grades, but it is there and it ought to be grappled with immediately&mdash;that in the upper regions of the Service there is a good deal of inefficiency and waste.  As I say, that is not my statement, but it has gained a good <Col N="1190" /> deal of currency all over the country.</P>
    <P>It would be a good thing for the Government and for the service if this inquiry were initiated and if it sifted the whole matter and thus, if possible, allay suspicions which might not, perhaps, be well-founded.  That feeling of suspicion is, however, there and statements have been made.  I do not say that the Government should initiate inquiries from time to time because of suspicions which might exist and false statements made.  As I say, there is a good deal of suspicion concerning the upper grades of the service and an inquiry would clarify the position by probably allaying the suspicion and giving satisfaction to civil servants themselves about whom this whispering campaign has been going on.  We know that there are a number of anomalies in the Civil Service here, as indeed in all countries.  I think that a good case can be made out for setting up such an inquiry.</P>
    <P>I also suggested about twelve months ago to the Minister that he should make some effort to establish some kind of conciliation machinery to deal with complaints made by the lower grades of the Civil Service. There is, of course, a body known as the Civil Service Representative Council which deals with matters of this character but we find that several grades in the service are not represented on that council.  So far as I can learn, it is attended by representatives of only a very small minority of civil servants.  I understand that that minority has frequently expressed dissatisfaction at the want of proper representation of the lower grades on that body.  Post Office workers, for instance, are not represented on it and the majority of departmental classes are outside the council, which cannot be said to be in any way representative.  This attitude of indifference towards the lower grades on the part of the Finance Department is causing an amount of uneasiness, to use a mild term.  I want to suggest that the Minister would be well-advised to get a thoroughly representative Civil <Col N="1191" /> Service body.  He could call it by any name he chooses.  The word &ldquo;representative&rdquo; is a misnomer because it is not representative and no one knows that better than the Minister himself.</P>
    <P>I suggest that for the benefit of the service, and indeed for the whole State, it would be a good thing to set up this conciliation machinery. I have a great regard for any kind of machinery that would tend to give confidence in the Government.  It is, if you like, a kind of safety valve, and when the lower grades, indeed all the grades, know that they have a thoroughly representative body to which they can bring their grievances and through which they can submit them to the Minister responsible they will appreciate the fact, thus bringing great benefit to the service as a whole.  In asking for such a council we are not asking for anything revolutionary.  A council has existed in some form but it is a misnomer, as I have said, to call it representative.  The Minister should make the council as representative as possible in the hope that certain of these grievances will be remedied, particularly in regard to the question of promotion.</P>
    <P>I have also to advert to the question of the disabilities placed on the lower grades of the service in reaching the top of the tree.  In a young country such as this it is not a good thing to block every avenue of promotion to men or women with their feet on the first rung of the ladder.  There is a tendency, which I regret, and it is regretted by good educationalists in this country, to reserve certain appointments for university graduates.  With all respect to university graduates and university education, some of the greatest men who ruled in the greatest countries of the world never had university education.  After passing a Civil Service examination, their education was really an education based on experience.  The fact that this young Government of ours is introducing a kind of caste arrangement is not at all creditable <Col N="1192" /> to a country which claims to be democratic and all the rest of it. In that paragraph of the syllabus which I have quoted it is really inviting candidates to take up positions within the gift of the Government under false pretences.  Despite these promises held out in that paragraph promotions are not taking place.  I say that I have proved my case that candidates are being invited into the service under false pretences.  Again, what is there in university education that gives a person greater knowledge of Civil Service conditions as against the young man or woman who enters the service via a national school or a Civil Service college?  In ordinary practical affairs the experience gained in a department of State should suffice, as it suffices in other professions.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this ban on promotion should be removed as soon as possible and that a chance should be given to those young people who, owing to economic circumstances, had not the advantage&mdash;if I may so term it&mdash;of university education. Having secured the standard set up at the Civil Service examinations, every avenue of promotion should be allowed, provided the persons concerned are capable of filling the places to which they are to be promoted.</P>
    <P>

    </P>
    <P>Another question that is causing a good deal of agitation in the service is the method of arriving at what is known as the cost-of-living bonus. That undoubtedly wants some overhauling. It is one of these things that should be dealt with by a commission of inquiry or by means of conciliation machinery, which should be set up quickly.  I could easily give you some enlightenment as to what is being done in industry in this connection.  I can speak in regard to one or two industries in which industrial councils have been set up, with useful effect.  Experience has shown that since these councils were set up strikes and locks-out have been avoided and <Col N="1193" /> industrial disturbance obviated. Since this class of council has proved successful on this side and on the other side of the Channel in commercial undertakings, surely they should prove successful if set up under the ægis of the Government or a Government department?  I suggest that the Minister should take these matters into his immediate consideration.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to refer at some length, but it has been discussed here before and I do not care to traverse ground that has been gone over time and again.  The question, to which I will only refer briefly now, relates to butter which was cold-stored during the war period.  I should like to ask the Minister for Finance if he will induce the Department concerned, over which he should have some control, to make representations to the British Government to compensate the many butter merchants in the country who lost a good deal of money.</P>

      <P>I should like to support Deputy Anthony in his remarks regarding the treatment of shorthand typists.  At present, there is a great deal of dissatisfaction amongst that branch of the service. Deputy Anthony, if I understood him correctly, stated that shorthand typists are entitled to promotion to the grade of clerical officers.  Is Deputy Anthony sure he is correct in that?  I understand that the only promotion open to shorthand typists is to the office of superintendent. While the ordinary writing assistant can obtain promotion to the grade of clerical officer, the shorthand typist is not entitled to that promotion. I should like to ask the Minister, in order that I may save the time of the House, whether Deputy Anthony is correct in stating that the shorthand typist is entitled to promotion to the grade of clerical officer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I may take it that they are not in the same position as ordinary writing assistants, that while writing assistants are entitled to promotion to the grade of clerical officer as of right&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the view of the shorthand typists themselves is that they are not entitled to promotion to the grade of clerical officer and that the lower branch of the Service&mdash;the ordinary writing assistants&mdash;are entitled as of right to promotion to the grade of clerical officer.  When Deputy Anthony stated that shorthand typists were entitled to promotion to the grade of clerical officer, I thought he was in error and I still think so.  From <Col N="1198" /> the statement of the Minister, I think the Deputy is in error.  There appears to be some small loophole by which if they go through some devious course they may arrive at the post of clerical officer.  I want to have it made clear by the Minister, in reply, that shorthand typists are entitled to rise to the rank of clerical officer in the same way as are writing assistants.  I understand distinctly from the shorthand typists themselves that they are not entitled to that promotion and that the only promotion they are entitled to is to the office of superintendent. To offer a competent shorthand typist the post of superintendent, by way of promotion, at an extra salary of from 3/- to 5/- per week, is, in my opinion, adding insult to injury.</P>
      <P>Deputy Anthony referred here to the various qualifications of the grades of the Civil Service.  I can speak with some knowledge of the qualifications of the shorthand-typists. I know that the qualifications, educationally and technically, of shorthand-typists are much superior to the qualifications of the ordinary writing assistants, and it appears to me an anomaly that ordinary writing assistants can get promotion to a higher grade of the service when, even according to the statement of the Minister, shorthand-typists are debarred.  It certainly should be put right.  Anybody with any knowledge of the two grades of the service knows that there is a remarkable difference in the standard of examination.  The standard of examination for writing assistants is simply a high-class primary standard and the standard for shorthand-typists is a high-class secondary standard, and, in addition, they also have the qualifications of shorthand and typewriting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another thing that I would like to point out, and that may, perhaps, be unknown to the Minister.  It is that a great many shorthand-typists complain that after they have been typing and doing shorthand work for a number of years their sight is more or less affected and, from a health point of <Col N="1199" /> view, they certainly should be given a change.  There should be some method of promotion for those in that particular grade.  It appears to me an unthinkable proposition that a writing assistant who merely possesses what might be called a primary education should be entitled to promotion to a higher grade while the shorthand-typist who has a secondary education is not.</P>
    <P>Deputy Anthony referred to the educational qualifications of the different grades of the service.  He referred to those possessing a university degree.  I know a great many shorthand-typists who possess a university degree.  I have no personal knowledge of a writing assistant who possesses a university degree.  In fact, university graduates are almost debarred from being writing assistants on the grounds of age, and I think it is only ordinary commonsense that a civil servant possessing a university degree must make a better civil servant than a civil servant who comes out of an ordinary national school.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand how a Deputy with the acumen of Deputy Anthony would ask what advantage a university degree is to a civil servant.  One might as well ask what advantage is a university degree to a member of this House, or to a member of any profession.  The man who has not got a university degree, I must certainly say from my experience, does not make a good professional man.  I can take members of my own family.  I have a lad who has got a primary education and I have a lad who has got a secondary education.  Would I say that the lad possessing the primary certificate has the same standard of knowledge or would be as competent as the lad with the secondary education? The thing is absurd.  There is just the same marked difference between the man having an ordinary secondary education and the man having an ordinary university education.</P>

      <P>Your ruling with respect to what may be dealt with on this Bill puts us in a rather extraordinary position.  It means that the Second Reading is practically of no value at all to the House. After all in connection with an ordinary Bill we have a stage in which we deal with matters that have been discussed in committee and a discussion in committee on finance really amounts to a committee stage. In this particular case we get an opportunity on the Second Stage of this Bill of dealing in a broader way with matters than we are allowed to deal with them on the Estimates themselves.  I think that that view of the matter is not merely borne out by the practice which has obtained hitherto, but it is borne out also by a ruling of the Ceann Comhairle himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a previous occasion he stated that he understood that the matter that is raised on the Second Reading of the Appropriation Bill deals with these matters that have already been discussed in Committee.  He said, in giving his decision, that that was the rule in another place.  I take it he <Col N="1201" /> meant the British House of Commons. The Second Reading was used for the purpose of a general discussion, and the practice there was that the Government Party should be informed in advance by the Opposition what subject is chosen.  I think he desired, for the sake of discussion here, that that practice would be followed as a suitable practice.  The practice that he suggested should not be followed was that of dealing with matters that had not already been discussed, that is, using the Second Stage for taking up matters that had been omitted in the case of the Estimates, but that he regarded a Second Reading of the Appropriation Bill as an occasion in which a big general matter of administration should be dealt with, so that this is exactly in line with his ruling.  We had intended to deal with the question of fisheries, and I think notice was given, through the Whips, to the Ministers that that was the question we wished to discuss, so that they would be prepared to meet the arguments or the demands for information that might be made.  If your ruling is to be what you said, it simply means that we might as well not have this Second Stage of the Appropriation Bill.  Any purpose that would be served by having a Second Reading would be completely lost.  I would respectfully ask that you might take that into account.</P>
    <P>Take my own case.  While we were going to deal with the question of fisheries, I also intended bringing up a matter which I think is a matter of very urgent public importance at present&mdash;that is, the failure of the Government to bring in proposals with respect to the protection of the coach-building industry.  I suppose that would similarly be ruled out of order as not coming within the scope of this Bill.  It is a matter for which we lay blame largely on the Department of Industry and Commerce, for whose purposes we are about to vote a considerable sum here now.</P>

      <P>My own idea would be that if there were matters that Deputies wished to raise on the adjournment the House should remain sitting till, say, the usual hour. When the Dáil is going to disperse for the summer holidays we are not confined on the adjournment to a discussion of half-an-hour.  I think it has been the practice to have discussions of two, three and four hours on the adjournment.</P>

      <P>I desire to support the general appeal that has been made by Deputy Anthony to the Minister for Finance for the removal of certain grievances named by him and which are causing a good deal of discontent in the lower grades of the Civil Service.  I hope that the Minister is not going to be impressed, especially on the question of promotion, by the unimpressive speech delivered upon that matter by Deputy J. J. Byrne.  Deputy J. J. Byrne seems to think that it is quite possible for young men raw from the University to walk into the Education Department, the Board of Works, or the Land Commission, or the Department of Finance and take charge of the supervision of the work and give instructions to individuals working in these Departments who have experience of 20 or 30 years.  I might as well suggest that Deputy J. J. Byrne should go down and act as foreman bricklayer in connection with some building scheme in his constituency.  He would be as competent to act as foreman bricklayer in connection with a building scheme as the young man with a University degree could take charge, for instance, of the untenanted land branch of the Land Commission, of the drainage department of the Public Works, or some section of the Department of Education and give instructions to men of 20 or 30 years' experience.  It is <Col N="1205" /> impossible, and I hope the Minister is not going to be led away by silly suggestions of that kind.</P>
      <P>I think every Deputy will remember, on this question of promotion, that between the setting up of the Provisional Government in 1921 and the Civil Service Commissioners three or four years afterward a very large number of over-aged officials, in some cases with not high educational qualifications, were found very important positions in the service of this State.  That may have been right from the point of view of the Ministry.  On one or two occasions they admitted here that they appointed certain individuals to positions and they were purely political appointments.  I merely make that point in order to show that in that period they were not so much concerned with the necessity for a University degree.  Many men are sitting in high positions in the State without the educational qualifications which, in my opinion, were necessary at the time and are necessary still, and without any of these degrees that we hear so much about from Deputy Byrne and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it was good policy then it is good policy now, both for the State just as for any business concern, to give the higher positions to men with experience of the working of departments.  If you send a university man into the untenanted land section or the land purchase branch of the Land Commission and advise all the staff to go to him for guidance and instruction I dare say he would not know the slightest thing about what was in the files and he would not be in a position to give much guidance or instruction.  Why, therefore, advocate the straightaway appointment from the universities to these positions in preference to giving promotion to the men who posses the knowledge gained by the experience of years?  I hope the Minister will refuse to be impressed by Deputy Byrne's speech.  The Deputy seems to think that the only brainy people in the world are those who walk in the front gate of Trinity College and walk out the back way <Col N="1206" /> without looking at all into the examination room.  It was stated that in the old days you could easily do that and find a B.A., a B.Sc., or an M.A., as the case might be, attached to your back.</P>
    <P>I wish to mention another matter in reference to a question which I raised here a couple of years ago during the consideration of the Estimates. The matter has not been referred to recently.  I admit there has been a slight improvement on the position as it then existed.  I refer to the position of the men employed in the preventive service of the Customs and Excise.  When the Customs and Excise were set up a number of individuals were taken into the service without previous experience and without any educational test.  I am not grumbling at that, but to-day you find in the preventive service two sets of men doing the very same work under different conditions.  You have one body on the established staff, as they call it in the Finance Department, entitled to receive pay when they are on sick leave and possessing other advantages which the unestablished preventive officer does not enjoy at the moment.  A case was brought under my notice quite recently where one man who, to my own knowledge, is as well qualified as any man on the established staff, had to go to hospital and was out for a long time on sick leave as a result of an operation.  After a few weeks he was left without pay and his colleagues had to make up for him the small sum of £3 which he receives as an unestablished preventive officer.</P>
    <P>That state of affairs should be put right.  It is in the interests of the State that men doing the same work should do it under the same conditions. In the particular place I have in mind the men are obliged to work from 5.30 a.m. to 8 o'clock in the evening for £3 per week.  That applies to the unestablished officer.  I suggest seriously that there is something wrong with that branch of the service. It should be put right, and these people should be put on the same conditions provided they are doing the same work.  I believe that <Col N="1207" /> condition of affairs exists on the Border and in the City of Dublin so far as the preventive staff are concerned. Representations have been made to the Revenue Commissioners on several occasions and I appeal to the Minister to call for the files for the purpose of putting right this obvious wrong as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Wolfe Mr. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to the management of the Curragh.  It is governed by two very antiquated Acts passed in 1868 and 1870.  Under those Acts a system of management was set up which is altogether unsuitable these days.  There are a great many interests involved in the Curragh.  On the one hand, we have the racing interests; then we have the possession of the Curragh by the military, and the fact that it is extensively grazed. The Curragh is managed by bailiffs. The government of the Curragh is carried out by the ranger, who is myself, and a deputy-ranger, who is head of the whole thing, and several bailiffs.  I have no control over the deputy-ranger at all.  Certain matters have been brought to my notice which I think require attention, not that there is any particular fault on his part.  The fact is that the whole management of the Curragh wants to be reorganised.  It is not at all up-to-date, and it is very unsatisfactory, from my point of view especially.  If it was only a matter of handing in my resignation that could be done at once, but that <Col N="1208" /> would not make a penny's worth of difference.  Although I am the head of the Curragh the only thing I have control in is the appointment of an under-bailiff.  I am responsible for the doings of the deputy-ranger, but I cannot make him do anything if I happen to differ with him over it. It is a most peculiar state of affairs, and it certainly wants looking into. A good many matters were brought to my attention lately, and people were expressing dissatisfaction in connection with matters arising out of racing and grazing.  I would like the Minister to see if something cannot be done to bring the management of the Curragh up-to-date and put it on a more sensible and reasonable basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Anthony referred to the question of promotions in the Civil Service.  That is a matter that has been dealt with here on more than one occasion.  I do not think people in any grade in the service have really good grounds for complaint.  There has been for a few years a ban on promotions. There have been no promotions into the clerical grade and there have been no promotions from the clerical grade to the executive grade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already explained to the House, that followed the period during which there had been an exceptional number of promotions from the clerical to the executive grade when, except by chance, all the best and the very top of the clerical grade were promoted to the executive grade.  It may have happened that somebody as good as or better than some one promoted was by a mere chance overlooked; but what actually happened during the period was that if there were normal promotions all the best of the clerical grade were promoted.  So many of them have been promoted that, although there have been a few years since promotions were stopped, no person in the clerical grade has a grievance.  A grievance would be there if the ban were to be continued indefinitely because new people would come in view who were good enough for promotion <Col N="1209" /> and if they did not get their chance they would undoubtedly be unjustly treated.  I hope it will not be so very long until it is possible to resume promotions, at any rate on a small scale, from the clerical to the executive grade.  I deny entirely that so far the ban on promotions has been in the nature of an injustice to any person in the clerical grade.</P>
    <P>With regard to promotions into the clerical grade from the grade of writing assistant, as I announced about a year ago, we felt the time had come to make some promotions from writing assistants to the clerical grade.  Within the last week or so I think about a dozen promotions have been made.  No promotions have been made from the shorthand typist grade to the clerical grade.  I think it was Deputy Byrne suggested that if we were making promotions from one or two of these grades to the clerical grade the shorthand typist would have more claim.  I do not think that is so.  In the first instance, large numbers of shorthand typists and typists succeeded within the last few years in entering the clerical grade through the medium of confined examination.  There was quite a considerable number so that very many who a few years ago were shorthand typists or typists are now clerical officers.  The examination, of course, was of a lower standard than would be the case if there were open competition.  Although, perhaps, you may have University graduates amongst the shorthand typists, the general run of the girls entering as writing assistants have a higher standard of education than the girls entering as shorthand typists.  The competition for the writing assistant class has been extraordinarily keen. As a matter of fact, we have got girls whose standard of education was really much higher than was necessary for the work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say if the standard of examination for the ordinary writing assistant is nearly as high as the standard for shorthand typists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The literary tests are about the same standard but, of course, the shorthand typists and typists are tested in typing and shorthand.  Although the standard of the tests set is about the same in the two examinations, girls with much better education on the whole, that is, dealing with the great majority, have entered as writing assistants.  However, it is not intended that there should be a refusal to promote any person from the shorthand typist to the clerical grade.  In former times there were promotions and it is intended that promotions will later on be resumed; but there is no such thing as a right to promotion.  The position is that officers of outstanding merit are from time to time promoted as vacancies occur.  I am not so very anxious to have large numbers of people promoted to the clerical grade at present because, taking the clerical grade as a whole, the quality is rather below the standard as members have entered the clerical grade during recent years as the result of limited examination.  During the European War and after the setting up of the Saorstát, before the Civil Service Commission was established, large numbers of temporary clerical officers were employed. Limited examinations were held to enable these temporary clerical officers to be established, and these examinations were of such a very simple character that great numbers of temporary officers qualified.  On the other hand, as I have already said, there were abnormal promotions from the clerical grade, and large numbers of the best material in that grade were promoted. As the position stands at present, the clerical grade, taking it as a whole, is below the standard of quality we would like to have, and it is desired to have it strengthened by the admission of candidates entering in the ordinary way by an examination appropriate to the clerical grade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not suggested that higher posts in the Civil Service should be reserved for university graduates. <Col N="1211" /> There is no such policy and there is no such intention; but, on the other hand, it is felt that it is necessary to get a certain number of good university graduates into the Civil Service, to provide the machinery for recruiting, year after year, a certain number of people of that standard of education.  It is quite true that you cannot put a university graduate to do work which requires technical knowledge and experience, but, on the other hand, if you are depending entirely for the higher posts on a few people who have entered the Civil Service young and worked their way up you will not find all the material necessary to fill the higher posts, unless you are content with people whose outlook is perhaps rather narrow and who perhaps have grown rather stale during long years of official routine. I think it is very necessary that we should keep an avenue open by which, year after year, university graduates could be recruited. People who rise by promotion from the lower ranks of the Civil Service are eligible for the higher ranks, and many people who have been promoted recently into the higher ranks have not been university graduates. Perhaps you might find amongst those who are not university graduates as good material for any posts as you might find among university graduates.  Deputy Anthony almost talked&mdash;I do not think he meant it&mdash;as if it was almost useless for anyone but university graduates to enter the Civil Service with a view to obtaining the higher posts&mdash; that these posts were reserved to university graduates.</P>

      <P>The grade of junior administrative officer is reserved to university graduates, and that is a grade that is similar to the higher executive grade.  Posts above the higher executive and the junior administrative grades may be recruited from either of these two grades.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not that mean in the long run that a man with a university degree comes into a post with a salary the same as a higher executive officer, who generally gets promotion after twenty or thirty years' service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think his service would be at all as long as that.  It should not be, if he was the kind of man who was likely to make good.  But it does mean that a man cannot be a higher executive officer until he has several years of service.  If he entered as a junior administrative officer he might be promoted within five or ten years.  We have succeeded in getting people of a very high standard as junior executive entrants.  Officers in two grades are equally eligible for a higher post.  It has been suggested that there should be a commission of inquiry, but I do not think there are any grounds for that.  Of course, one hears complaints, and there is usually a measure of dissatisfaction.  If we had no dissatisfaction I think it could only be because our scales were very much in excess of what they ought to be.  I think the position would be extremely unhealthy if there was no dissatisfaction, and I do not think there is any more dissatisfaction than one might expect. I am sure there is a little more than there would have been if no changes in scales had been made.  We have reduced all the scales from those of secretaries of departments down to those of clerical officers, and the fact that these reductions have taken place has undoubtedly led to a greater volume of complaint than would otherwise have been the case. But I do not think that affords any ground for a commission of inquiry. Deputy Anthony suggested that a commission of inquiry would give satisfaction to the lower grades of the Civil Service.  It would only give them satisfaction if the result of the commission's findings was an appreciable increase in salary scales.  We do not think that that could be afforded, and we do not intend to appoint a commission which would <Col N="1213" /> not satisfy those asking for it unless it led to such a result.  With regard to conciliation machinery, if the Civil Service Representative Council is not, in fact, as representative as we would like it to be, that is mainly, if not entirely, the fault of the Civil Service organisations which are not participating in its work.  If they will not participate in its work, I do not know what we can do.</P>
      <P>I feel quite satisfied that the main reason why the different organisations are dissatisfied with its work is simply that conditions are entirely different now from what they were at the time when Whitleyism was inaugurated in England.  When Whitleyism was inaugurated there were conditions of inflation, and big increases of salary were being given to all sorts of grades, and, of course, the conciliation machinery worked very well.  Now the position is not such that we can make substantial concessions, and, of course, practically all the points that are put up &mdash;quite naturally; I am finding no fault with it&mdash;are either for increases in salary scales or adjustments which are equivalent to increases, and as they cannot be met on these things there is naturally great dissatisfaction with the machinery.  I am satisfied that no matter what machinery we put up there would be the same dissatisfaction. This country certainly cannot have any machinery that would give the kind of result that civil servants got from the Whitley Councils when they were set up in England and when enormous increases and re-organisations involving very great increases in expenditure were arranged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what it is that Deputy Anthony suggests is wrong with the system of calculating the cost of living bonus.  I have heard people suggest that the weighting was wrong, but if that is so, it is wrong to the advantage of the civil servant.  If we had the English weighting here the index figure would not be as high as it actually is.  Deputy Byrne talked of the eyesight of shorthand typists suffering.  We have not anything in <Col N="1214" /> the sick leave returns to indicate that.  Deputy Davin asked about the preventive staffs.  I think the established preventive staff got an improvement in their scale a couple of years ago, and so far as the unestablished men are concerned, they must be unestablished because they failed to pass the examination for establishment.  There was an examination a few years ago for established preventive men confined to those who were in the service unestablished. If a man is now unestablished, he must have failed to pass that examination, and if he were treated as temporary clerical officers were treated, instead of being retained as an unestablished officer he would be given something like three months' notice and dispensed with.  I did not look into that matter recently, and I am not sure that I have all the facts present to my mind, but I think the unestablished men have no great grounds for complaint as compared with the temporary clerical officers who failed to pass their examination. They have been well treated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to call for the file for the purpose of looking into this whole question of the unestablished men, from the point of view of endeavouring, as far as it can possibly be done, to see that men who do the same work will receive in or about the same terms and conditions of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I will look up the file, but the Deputy will realise that men may be doing the same work and doing it rather differently.  You may have one man who is very efficient and very good and you may have another man who is barely able to do it.  It might easily be that of those who failed to pass the examination there were some who were just able to do the work and were entitled to be retained but who were not comparable in efficiency with the better educated men who were able to pass the examination.  I put that consideration before the Deputy.</P>

With regard to what Deputy Wolfe mentioned, of course I can see that the position is unsatisfactory from his point of view.  He appears to be the ranger of the Curragh, with all the responsibility but with no power and no salary.  If that is so, it does seem to be a matter that should be adjusted.  I think that is an antiquated survival, but I promise to have the matter looked into and examined.</P>

The Minister also stated that an examination was held some time ago for shorthand typists for promotion to clerical posts.  Has that examination been held in the past five years, and is it the intention to give like facilities to shorthand typists by means of a limited examination in the future?</P>

      <P>I desire to call the attention of the House before this prolonged adjournment takes place to the unsatisfactory condition of the Free State fishing industry. This time last year, when the House was also about to adjourn for the Summer Recess, the Minister for Fisheries told us that he had in preparation a scheme for setting up a sea fisheries association and that steps were being taken to implement <Col N="1219" /> that association legislatively.  We discovered, however, when the Estimates came up for discussion about three months ago, that the sea fisheries organisation had not materialised.  It was pointed out that the amount of money which was granted for fishery development, particularly in the case of sea fisheries, was quite inadequate, even for the restricted service which the Fishery Department is now giving. The amount of money granted last April, when the Vote was passed here was only £9,800, of which only £5,000 was for sea fisheries.</P>
      <P>The total amount allocated for the purposes of developing and establishing the sea-fishing industry during the coming financial year is £5,000.  Last year it was £13,500. There has been a steady decline, as Deputies of all Parties know, in the expenditure made available for this purpose.  In 1925-26 the amount made available was £39,000; in 1929-30 it was £18,000, while this year it is less than £10,000, of which only half goes for sea-fisheries.  It is obvious, therefore, that no steps have been taken to set up a proper organisation in connection with the fishing industry.  I have already called the attention of the House on previous occasions to the fact that the proposals, which the Minister for Fisheries told us twelve months ago he had in hand and which he proposed to bring before the Dáil at an early date, are substantially those recommended by the old Dáil Commission of Inquiry about 1920 or 1921.  Nine or ten years have elapsed since then, but nothing has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go over the whole ground again and repeat all the things that could be and have been said about the Fisheries Department. I would say that it is probably a mistake to be too sympathetic with that Department.  If we are to blame in any way, it is that we have been, if anything, too lenient with the Minister.  He informed us a few months ago that within a week the rules of the association would be <Col N="1220" /> laid on the Table of the House.  I raised the question again a fortnight ago in the hope that some proposal would be forthcoming before the Recess. We are now about to adjourn for four months but there is no mention in the Appropriation Bill which we have just passed of the grant-in-aid which would be necessary to allocate to the sea fisheries association if it took shape in order to enable it to take up its work.  Probably this time next year we will again be in the position in which we were this time twelve months, engaged in discussing what could and should be done for the organisation of Irish fisheries.  There are other matters as well as the organisation of the industry which the Minister promised the House time and again to attend to, but nothing has been done.  The Irish Press is full day after day with reports of raids by foreign trawlers coming into Irish waters.  The Minister apparently does not know where he stands in regard to territorial waters or how he can provide efficient protection for our fishermen.</P>
    <P>All parties have for years impressed on the Minister the importance of improving that protection by increasing the number of cruisers and by providing a number of motor boats, but we have had no indication that that matter has been seriously considered.  The Minister is now in the position, as he said when the Estimate was going through, that he shares responsibility with the other Ministers and he is no longer in the position of saying &ldquo;Blame the Minister for Finance.  He will not give me more money.&rdquo;&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as much control over the Minister for Finance as the Minister for Finance has over me.&rdquo; The Minister has a duty to this House and to the Country.  Deputies of all Parties have not spared themselves in dinning into his ears the necessity of providing protection for Irish fishing boats.</P>
    <P>The other matter to which I want to refer is the question of territorial limits.  The position in regard to <Col N="1221" /> dealing with British trawlers is apparently worse than it was under the British regime.  At that time there were certain bye-laws which permitted Government Departments to take action against British trawlers, even outside the three-mile limit in certain restricted areas around our coast.  In 1927 the Minister stated here that these bye-laws were practically useless, that the British Government paid no attention to them.  Later on it transpired, in connection with the Waterford case, that the French also pay no attention to these bye-laws, or to our agreements or whatever international law defines the territorial limits of the Free State, because we have French boats coming across to protect us against their own fishermen. In this important matter the Minister promised the House again and again that action would be taken.  Three months ago he told us that there was an international conference sitting on the question, and that some good might be expected from it.  There has, however, been absolute silence on the question ever since.  It would be interesting to know from the Minister exactly how much money has been collected in fines as a result of the work of the &ldquo;Muirchu.&rdquo;  It would be interesting to know, but I venture to say that the Minister is not in a position to be able to show, that that vessel is effective, not in raiding and arresting foreign crews, a work which it is doing to the best of its ability, but in seeing that summary fines are imposed on poachers such as would make them desist from their work. It is useless having a vessel trying to guard our fisheries unless we have a law which will enable us, when these people are captured, to have severe fines inflicted and, if necessary, to confiscate their nets.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of Lough Foyle.  This matter, like that of the territorial waters of the Free State, raises the question as to where exactly the Free State fishery bye-laws run in regard to territorial waters. This question is not merely one of sea fisheries but also of inland <Col N="1222" /> fisheries.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has attempted to quench discussion upon it by telling us that, even if Lough Foyle were adjudged to be wholly within Free State territory and that we had complete jurisdiction over it, there would be no justification for the present state of affairs.  He has practically apologised and excused himself over the action of the fishermen, who are simply trying to hold what they are entitled to, to hold the ordinary rights which they have had to fish in these waters from time immemorial. The Minister put aside the question which was put up to him very strongly from these benches concerning people from the Six Counties coming and taking action by force against Free State nationals.  He said that that question did not arise, and he gave the House to understand that he is prepared to accept that if the Foyle and Bann Fishing Company is prepared to originate an action in our courts.  He also says that there is a several fishery there.  On the 21st May, on the adjournment debate here, the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We hold that there is a prima facie case established by long usage over many years in favour of the Irish Society and their lessees, the Foyle and Bann Fishery Company, but that that presumption is fast disappearing. There was a presumption, but that is fast disappearing, owing to the unaccountable reluctance of the Irish Society or their lessees to come into our courts, and if that continues much longer the presumption will have disappeared.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This time last year we were told that the matter was to have attention, and that the Government were taking action.  Last March and April the Minister told us that negotiations were proceeding, that the matter was having the attention of the two Governments, but on the 21st May he comes along and tells us that it is a matter entirely for the courts, although he admits that neither he nor anyone else can induce the people from the Six Counties <Col N="1223" /> to come in and acknowledge the Free State Courts.  In spite of that, he states that the question of territorial waters does not arise, and that, in fact, these people have a presumptive title to this several fishery although they refuse to come before the Free State Courts to prove their title.  Finally, he stated that if the Foyle and Bann Company continued to ignore us, some day the worm will turn.  How long will the present state of affairs continue?  The &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; on last Saturday told us that the disputed waters of the Lough would not be worked until the last week in June, and that by then matters must reach a crisis.  It stated that the two boats which last year patrolled the Lough, and which got into trouble, have since been reduced to one, that it is almost impossible for the Company to find a crew for it, and that even if the crew is found, it will only be able to carry on its work of surveillance under a Civic Guard escort.</P>
    <P>I have no knowledge of the position on the spot, but Donegal Deputies tell me that before a crisis occurs, and trouble breaks out, the Government should force these people to come into the Courts. They should not take up the attitude of waiting for the Foyle and Bann fishery people to come in, and of saying that if they proved their case they would stand behind them. Why would not the Government do in this instance as they did in the case of Lough Erne?  Why not take the bull by the horns and say: &ldquo;The question of your having a several fishery is a question which can only be held by our Courts, and we, as a Government, responsible for those waters and for seeing that our citizens get fair play by being allowed to fish there, will take the initiative, and take you into the Courts.&rdquo; If it is a matter for the Courts, and if negotiations have failed between the Governments, then let the Government show the local people that, even as regards the Courts, they are not going to allow a situation to be created in which the fishermen's <Col N="1224" /> rights will go by default.  The fishermen, if the question goes into the Courts, will not be able to stand the cost, so that the Government should actively intervene in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another matter in connection with fisheries to which careful attention must be given, namely the question of poaching by French trawlers off the southern coast.  The men at Dunmore tell me that the French boats have practically destroyed the spawning beds off the Saltee Islands.  Lately our patrol boat seized their nets but the Frenchmen tried to get them back again.  If that is allowed to continue a serious state of affairs will arise.  While the attention of our patrol boat is devoted to patrolling that portion of the coast the other portions are left undefended.  The Dunmore men say that the Frenchmen are making a haven off Dunmore. They put in there at night and a considerable number of the boats go out raiding the coast in the day time.  I believe the French Government sent some gun-boats of their own across some time ago.  I do not know what the facts of the case were but it was understood that they sent some boats across to investigate the matter.  When they left the coast, the raiders commenced again.  If this sort of thing continues, the attention of the patrol boat will have to be devoted entirely to Dunmore.  If the Frenchmen make up their minds to attack again, you will have regular naval warfare there.  It would be well if representations were made to the French Government to endeavour to prevent their fishermen poaching in our waters.  If it continues, we will be up against a very serious situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Dáil should realise in connection with this question that it is not merely the improvement of the fishing industry that is at stake but the very existence of the industry.  If the present decline continues, if the present emigration of young fishermen continues, there will be no fishing industry left in a very short time.  I <Col N="1225" /> think the Minister will not deny that in Arklow, for instance, which has been so long the chief fishing centre, there are practically no young men left in the industry.  Everybody knows that a fisherman cannot be produced in a year or two.  If the tradition is lost, it is very hard to get the material necessary to man the fishing vessels afterwards.  The Minister himself has admitted on several occasions that there are vast possibilities in this industry.  Speaking here in June, 1926, he made this remark:</P>
      <P>We have been told from the platform and the Press of the fortunes that have been taken from the sea around our coast by foreigners coming along.  I believe that is so, because otherwise they would not come.</P>
      <P>On that occasion, at least, the Minister was convinced that there were fortunes in the fishing industry.  In the same speech, he went on to say:</P>
      <P>One of the most encouraging things about the herring fishery of last year was that in the case of the Downings Bay herring fishery, the fish were sold in the German market for 128/- per barrel, while herrings cured at the same time in Scotland were sold at 68/-, a difference of £3 per barrel.  Our herring is getting a name in the European market.  The Howth and Dunmore herrings last year were of such superior quality that every available curing place in these ports has been booked up by Irish and Scottish curers for the present year.  Already there are very heavy catches reported in Dunmore, with record prices to the fishermen, prices that, I think, were never heard of before&mdash;over 80/- per cran.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the philosophy of the Minister for Agriculture, that we ought to go in for producing things in which we can excel, for producing goods for which we can get a better price than any competitor, there ought to have been a concentration on the herring fisheries, following that statement of the Minister for Fisheries.  Yet we <Col N="1226" /> know that no action whatever has been taken for the development of the fishing industry.  In that connection, the following reference is made in the last Report of the Department of Fisheries in regard to loans issued to fishermen:</P>
    <P>The position of these large loans and the accumulation of heavy arrears has become one of the most serious problems confronting the Department of Fisheries, which is consulting with the Department of Finance in order to find a way out.  The position of hopeless indebtedness under which many of our fishermen are labouring does not create a position favourable to the rapid development of the industry.</P>
    <P>That Report was made early in 1927, and to-day the position remains the same with regard to these loans. The Minister was, apparently, convinced then that the heavy debts of fishermen were retarding the development of the fishing industry, yet nothing whatever has been done during that time.  The conclusion seems obvious, that the Minister for Fisheries would fain do things, that if he had a free hand he could make an active Department of the Department of Fisheries, that he could give a stimulus to the fishing industry, but that the Minister for Finance&mdash; who himself confessed in the House that he does not believe in the future of fisheries&mdash;will not give him any assistance, and will, in fact, counter the efforts of the Minister for Fisheries.  In a position like that, where the members of the Executive Council are divided in their view as to the future of an industry, it is obvious that no progress can be made.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should state before the House dissolves when this new scheme is to be put into operation and what his hopes for it are. A time has come for a national policy on this question of fisheries. Is the concentration to be on the home markets or are things to be allowed to proceed as at present? In the Report to which I have just referred, it is mentioned that one of <Col N="1227" /> the things that prevent the development of a demand for fish within the country is that there is only one big market in Dublin, and that cities like Cork, Limerick and Waterford, having no fish markets, the demand for fish there is not up to the standard that it should be in towns of their size.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his reply, might tell us why his Department has ceased to issue an annual report. When this matter was under discussion some months ago I called attention to the fact that the last report was issued for the years 1923-1925, and that the final sentence of the introduction stated: &ldquo;The report for the year 1926 will be ready for publication before the close of this year.&rdquo;  Is the Minister ashamed to publish another annual report because the records would be so bad? It seems strange that a publication which was being got ready on the 30th of June, 1927, has not yet seen the light.</P>
    <P>These observations concern many thousands of families, and I hope the Minister will be able to make some statement that will give a little hope to those who still believe there is a future for the fisheries and a future for the fishermen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had complaints, again and again, from fishermen on the coast of Wexford about the inaction of the Fishery Department and its failure to protect those men from foreigners.  I do not know whether the French trawlers are more active there than they are on other parts of the coast, but the fishermen around the Hook and Kilmore complain bitterly of the raids that are being made on their territory.  Local fishermen were never known to fish in a place called Slade, in South Wexford, where lobsters were in the habit of breeding.  They knew that if they took the lobsters from that particular area they would be destroying their future livelihood.  The French trawlers have no such qualms.  They came along there many a time in the darkness of the night and took away those young <Col N="1228" /> lobsters, destroying the whole breeding bed of lobsters in that part of Slade.  A similar incident occurred in Kilmore.  Some French trawlers came along and took away both young and old lobsters.  It is said that those young lobsters were taken back to France and released there for the future benefit of French fishermen.</P>
      <P>A certain District Justice said, when those men were brought before him, that there was no use in his fining these trawlers for coming in too close to the coast, because, in the first place, the fine he could inflict was altogether inadequate; and, in the second place, he understood that the French trawlers had an organisation amongst themselves for paying those fines, so that fines were no deterrent whatsoever.  We are also aware that in a recent encounter between the &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; and those French trawlers, the Civic Guards had to go to the rescue of the &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; so that our protection for the Irish fisheries is absolutely ridiculous.  Even a few Civic Guards had to rescue our navy from those French trawlers.  A few days after that occurred, a French battleship came along to wreak vengeance on the Irish navy because it had attempted to interfere with the French trawlers.  The newspapers report that when the Commander of the French battleship found the way things were he went away.  I suppose he felt that the trawlers were able to deal with the matter themselves.</P>
      <P>This state of affairs is going on all over the coast of Wexford from Arklow to the River Barrow.  I am fairly sure the Minister has done nothing effective, so far, to deal with the situation.  I do not know if the Minister has the power, but I think the Minister for External Affairs ought to be able to protect our fisheries and should make a protest to the French authorities as regards their coming within our territorial waters and taking away those lobsters and destroying the lobster beds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fishermen on the River Slaney <Col N="1229" /> and Barrow also feel themselves aggrieved.  One complaint they have is that they, who are trying to earn their livelihood by fishing, are in places not in as good a position as the men who come over here for pleasure&mdash;the men with rods.  The men with rods are allowed to start their fishing earlier and to continue later than the men with nets.  That is typical of the policy of the present Government on all matters&mdash; that the man who goes out for pleasure gets every facility, but the man, like the net fisherman, who is trying to earn a livelihood, is obstructed in every way possible.  On the River Barrow, I have been informed there are many more bailiffs put on duty during the fishing season than there are during the spawning season, the implication being that you cannot trust the fishermen themselves, that they will go out to fish on Sunday, although it is forbidden time, but that it is not so important to guard the spawning salmon against poachers during the spawning season.  The fishermen in that particular area resent very much the attitude of the Department of Fisheries towards them in their general distrust of them, and also in their general neglect of the fishermen's interests in every instance, while at the same time the Department of Fisheries are so very solicitous about the rod men who come along for pleasure.  I do not expect that we are going to get very much satisfaction from the Minister for Fisheries, but we will be at least interested to know whether he will be able to say anything different from what he has said over and over again in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Mr. Mullins Mr. Mullins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Deputy Derrig's demand that before the House adjourns for the long period announced by the President, some indication should be given by the Minister as to whether his Department has or has not any definite policy with regard to the fishing industry.  Listening here to the debates on this matter since I came into the House, one thing strikes me more than any other.  It <Col N="1230" /> is that there is no subject which comes before the House that is obscured by such a smoke-screen as the subject of the Department of Fisheries and its Estimate.  Year after year the same complaints are made, and year after year the same remedies, with slight amendment, are suggested from all parts of the House.  No action seems to be taken. On the last occasion on which the Estimate for the Department of Fisheries was before the House I asked the Minister to state in his concluding speech whether the Government really believed that the fishing industry was worth the attention necessary in order to save it, or whether it was not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask him again before this debate closes to give the House some indication as to his mind on the matter, whether the Government has decided it is a foregone conclusion that nothing can be done to save the remnant of the fishing industry around the Irish coast and if they have decided that whether they intend to introduce legislation amending the Ministers and Secretaries Act and abolishing the Department of Fisheries and thus save an enormous amount of time of this Dáil discussing an industry which does appear at all events as not capable of salvation, or whether the Minister and the Department have decided that the industry can be saved and what steps they propose to take to do it. The complaints made by Deputy Derrig are certainly complaints which could not be in any sense described as unreasonable.  The complaint with regard to the delay in announcing the rules of the Sea Fisheries Co-operative Association is one that I am keenly interested in, coming from a fishing town myself. Some time ago when the tentative proposals were announced with regard to the Sea Fisheries Co-operative Association groups of fishermen from all parts of my constituency approached me with requests for further information in regard to the matter.  I was unable to provide any, and at the present moment if the Dáil adjourns and if no definite statement is made by the Minister <Col N="1231" /> we are going to enter another five months without any definite indication as to whether the fishermen may expect any assistance from the Government or whether they may not.  That Sea Fisheries Co-operative Association when proposed by the Minister was given a pretty good Céad Míle Fáilte in this House. Criticism was very lenient on the last Estimate, and I think in justice to the House and in justice to the fishermen who in all parts of the country are awaiting the result of the Minister's action with interest and anticipation the Minister should give some definite information to this Dáil before it adjourns this evening.</P>
    <P>The matter raised by Deputy Derrig with regard to protection is also one on which we would like a declaration of policy from the Government. Year after year the reply has been given that it was the intention to provide another fishery cruiser. The second fishery cruiser has not yet materialised, and all suggestions with regard to protection, either by way of aeroplane or some other method, have apparently been overlooked or ignored.  If the Minister's Sea Fisheries Co-operative Association is set up, and if the fishing industry is tackled with a will, there is no doubt, in my mind anyhow, that all these efforts will be in vain unless proper protection is given to Irish fishermen within our territorial limits.  Speaking of territorial limits, I notice on the Order Paper to-day a proposal from the Minister for Industry and Commerce with regard to a Convention which he desires the House to ratify.  We had here during the past two or three months Conventions by the dozen.  We had Conventions about poison gas and these other modern methods of warfare which I presume the Irish Free State will not use against anybody except probably a few of ourselves.  We see these Conventions on the Order Paper day after day.  Conferences have been taking place in Geneva, at which our delegates have been present, and we <Col N="1232" /> have the results on the Order Paper. Surely we should have some result from the Conference which was sitting in The Hague with regard to the question of territorial limits.  If we have not some result we should at least get some information from the Minister as to how matters are progressing, whether our delegates have raised the question of our territorial limits, and, if so, with what result.  I suggest that if some statement of policy is not made, and if some hope is not held out that it is intended to tackle this fishing problem quickly, a rule should be added to the Standing Orders of Dáil Eireann to the effect that from this day onwards no further debates shall take place on the matter of the Irish fishing industry, because, to my mind, it is the greatest waste of all the waste of time that this Dáil occupies itself with.</P>

      <P>When the question of the fisheries off the coast of Wexford and Waterford was raised here it became apparent after a time that there were very considerable difficulties, and that it was a matter on which one would rather have kept silent from the national point of view until these difficulties had been cleared up.  To my amazement, some days afterwards, I read a report of a speech made by Deputy McDonogh, in which he attacked some of our speakers for having supported the Irish fishermen as against the French fishermen.</P>

      <P>Whatever might be said for or against the contention at that period it struck me as being extremely unfortunate, when the whole matter was under discussion, and when interests of a more or less national industry were at stake, whatever the merits might have been, that anything should have been said in public until the whole <Col N="1233" /> question about territorial waters had been cleared up.  It certainly discourages the fishermen in Waterford and makes them feel that even in their own Parliament there are people who are not altogether friendly towards their interest and when it comes to action in regard to French boats it certainly has not helped our people.</P>

      <P>I am rather reluctant to intervene in this debate because I am one of the Committee that has been set up to try and develop the fisheries.  It is not a very easy matter to know how to commence. Though I have as much experience, I suppose, as the gentlemen on the opposite benches I would not know how to start.  We will have to go very cautiously and very carefully, or we may waste a good deal of money.  This idea of getting a new protection vessel is all humbug. If you had fifty of them you could not prevent poaching.  The man who wants to poach will poach in the dark.  It is rather a lovely idea to get a sea-plane to go out on dark and blustery nights.  It is ridiculous and nonsensical.</P>
      <P>Then there was the question of fishermen coming over to this coast and being philanthropic in bringing small seized lobsters over to France. It is a wonder that there would not be some commonsense or, some idea of what is reasonable and right.  Of course the gentlemen on the opposite benches do not know anything about it.  It is like a good many of the statements that are made in this House.  They have one eye on the reporters' gallery and the other eye on the ballot boxes.  It is for that purpose a great deal of the talk that we listen to here is indulged in.</P>

      <P>On last Friday I handed in a question that I intended to put to the Minister for Lands and Fisheries in regard to the destruction that trawlers are doing off the Inish-owen coast.  I find that the question is not on the Order Paper.  It was intended to have it on to-morrow but, of course, the Dáil will not be sitting to-morrow.  These trawlers are still carrying on their operations. <Col N="1234" /> Since handing in the question last Friday I have found that there are men belonging to the district who are piloting these trawlers around Glengad Head.  There was a theft of lobster pots on the night of the 7th June last and some of the men from whom the lobster pots were stolen and who are being deprived of their living by the operation of these trawlers, were fraternising with the two local fellows who were piloting the trawlers when they came ashore on Sunday, the 8th June.  That is the position of affairs in that part of the country.  There is no public spirit amongst the people who are being deprived of their living by these Fleetwood and Grimbsy trawlers.  What protection do they deserve when they receive these men with open arms?</P>

      <P>Deputy Derrig has said that nothing has been done in connection with the formation of the Association since I made my speech on the Estimate.  That, of course, is not so.  The directors of the new Association have met.  The rules of an association of that kind are very involved.  I understand that they take a great deal of preparation, but I am informed that they have been submitted to the Registrar for Friendly Societies and that he has given provisional assent to them. They have not yet been submitted to him for formal approval.  As far as I know the directors are meeting again to-morrow and the fact that no legislation has been brought in in the meantime will not prevent a great deal of preliminary work from being done.  In fact, a great deal of the preliminary work of the Association has already been done.  It will continue to be done without legislation. The Society, I hope, will be registered in the very near future, now that the rules have been put in final shape.  There is the question, of course, as I pointed out on the Estimates and as Deputy Derrig has said, that money was not provided for a whole year in the Estimate for this year because of the fact that we are anticipating that there will have to be a supplementary estimate for the Association.  We hope to have <Col N="1235" /> sufficient funds in the hands of the Department to enable the Association to carry on pending the passing by the House of that supplementary estimate.  The rules will be laid on the Table with that supplementary estimate and they can then be discussed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moore talked of the very happy position that we were in in 1924, when our herrings of the previous herring season had fetched 128/- in the German market as against 68/- for Scottish herrings. He said that it was a great pity that we did not do something&mdash;I am not quite sure what he meant&mdash;to further that particular thing that was selling so well for us.  Of course the difficulty was that the herrings ceased to come over in the quality or the quantity that they came in those years.  I do not know exactly what one could do to improve that thing.  Legislation will not make the herrings good, and no legislation will improve the quantity of the herrings.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moore also said that nothing had been done in connection with the position of the fishermen who received loans in the past which they had not been able to repay.  The Deputy must at least admit that the persons who owed these moneys have not been put in any worse position, but, in fact, something has been done in the sense that a committee has been for several months going into each individual case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our intention originally was to bring in legislation on cut-and-dried lines, cutting down, by a certain amount, loans given from 1919 to 1923.  It was found that in practice that would not be satisfactory.  Certain persons outside the line who were very badly hit could not have their liabilities reduced at all and certain persons who came within it would not really be deserving cases. That particular plan was, therefore, abandoned and the idea was adopted instead of having each case considered on its merits; that is, where there were outstanding arrears of a loan that case was investigated by a <Col N="1236" /> Departmental Committee, including a representative of my own Department and two representing the Department of Finance.  There were about 1,000 cases to be investigated. They have practically finished their work now, and the report ought to be ready soon.  They have dealt with the vast majority of the cases, and I understand that in a great many there will be a writing down of the liability to the borrower.  In a great many other cases there will be no writing down whatever.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been said, and will continue to be said, about the damage done by encroaching trawlers.  Some Deputies, and many people outside, are frequently mixing up the encroachment by French lobster boats and French trawlers. French trawlers, so far as I know, do not come to this coast at all.  The French lobster boats come and they fish well within the three-mile limit. In order to fish at all they have to fish right on the rocks and near the shore.  As far as possible, they are being prevented and are constantly being fined.  The fine may be considered too small, but I doubt that. I understand that the position of the exchange is against the Frenchman and, as a result, the fine is very considerable and is a great deterrent. Besides that, there is power to seize gear and pots aboard the lobster boat found fishing illegally.</P>
    <P>The bye-laws that Deputy Derrig referred to are of no concern in connection with the French lobster boats.  In fact, the bye-laws never had any effect except as against British trawlers.  Of course the British Government, when they were here, were able to enforce matters outside what are ordinarily accepted as territorial waters.  They had the power to impose penalties on their own subjects.  Some of the legal officers of the Crown on the other side at one period said that the extra-territorial bye-laws which existed prior to the Treaty continued to exist.  Other legal authorities have, I understand, given a contrary opinion.  Apparently, lawyers differ on these matters.  The position is not clear as to whether these extraterritorial <Col N="1237" /> bye-laws are or are not enforceable at the moment.  There is then the question of what are generally accepted as territorial waters; there is the three-mile limit.  A representative of the Department was at the Hague and the question of territorial waters was discussed. Arising out of the discussions there, we sent on certain things to the Attorney-General for his advice as to what steps should be taken by us. That matter is being put into shape.</P>

      <P>I could not say.  The Hague Conference is not over so very long.  It is only a matter of six or seven weeks since they returned from the Hague.  It is since that time the matter was submitted to the Attorney-General.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of territorial waters was raised and, arising out of the discussion there, we had to send forward certain questions for advice to the Attorney-General. Deputy Derrig has misled himself somewhat with regard to the position in Lough Foyle.  He said something about forcing the Irish Society to take action in our courts. Personally, I would like to know how we are going to force them. The Deputy mentioned the Lough Erne case as a case in which we had done something of the kind.  The Attorney-General did not, in fact, take the initiative in the Lough Erne case.  What happened there is exactly the same as what happened in the Lough Foyle case in its initial stages.  The Lough Erne Fishery Company prosecuted fishermen for fishing in what they called their several fisheries.  The cases were brought before a District Justice. The solicitor for the fishermen raised the question of title, and the District Justice found that there was a bona fide question of title involved and therefore he had no jurisdiction. The next thing that happened was <Col N="1238" /> that the Lough Erne Fishery Company proceeded in the High Court to get a mandamus against the District Justice forcing him to try the case.  As far as I remember, the High Court upheld the District Justice and said there was a bona fide question of title involved.</P>
      <P>What we want is that the Irish Society should do the same thing. They went as far as proceeding against several fishermen in Moville for fishing on what they considered was their several fishery on the Foyle.  The question of title was raised and the District Justice said there was one involved and he had no jurisdiction.  But the Irish Society has not proceeded for the mandamus.  I would like to know how we are going to force them to proceed.  The Deputy said we could, but I do not see that we can.  The point about the Attorney-General entering into the other case was this: He entered in order to protect the general public.  He associated himself with the fishermen&mdash;I forget the particular legal term.  The Attorney-General came in only when the Erne Fishery Company took the case further than the Irish Society have taken their case.  He could not come in until that same stage would arise in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use in overstating the case for the fishermen.  If they have a right, well and good, I would welcome its establishment; but, as the Minister for External Affairs pointed out some time ago, it would appear on the face of it that there is a several fishery there, and there have been certain legal decisions in the past establishing the title of the Irish Society.  The Foyle and Bann Fishery Company, who are mostly mentioned in this case, are only the lessees of the Irish Society who have this charter.  There is no use in overstating the case for the fishermen and saying that they have this right from time immemorial.  In fact, they only started to exercise this right about 1922, and that is not from time immemorial.  We made representations in the direction that the Irish Society should proceed in our courts.  It is a very simple <Col N="1239" /> matter for them.  Of course, there would be a considerable expenditure involved by proceeding for a mandamus, and probably that is what has frightened them off.  It has cost the Erne Fishery Company several thousands already and the case is not finished.  There is an appeal to the Supreme Court.  The Irish Society could certainly proceed by way of injunction pending the establishment of the title, and I have no doubt if they could establish a prima facie case that injunction would be given.  However, they have not so far taken these steps, but we are not without hope that they will.</P>
    <P>Except from what I saw in the question Deputy White has put, I have not heard of any stealing of lobster pots in that particular area. I heard reports very many times in the past that there are people from that area who are members of the crews of Fleetwood and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;Grimsby trawling boats.  Undoubtedly the local knowledge of these men would make the position very serious on that north Donegal coast.  I think, as Deputy White pointed out, that if there was a certain amount of public spirit shown by the persons who are supposed to be suffering such as the Glencar fishermen are stated to be, when they come back to their homes the iniquity of their ways would be pointed out to them by persons living there, and then I think they would not be so likely to come home so often.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWhite" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I made a suggestion to them quite recently which I am not going to repeat here.  It is for the fishermen to decide whether they will act on my suggestion.  There were lobster pots stolen on the Thursday <Col N="1240" /> and the Friday nights of the week ending the 7th June by the Fleetwood and the Grimbsy trawlers. I understand also that the local boats with licences fishing for salmon on the previous night were interfered with.  I suggest that the Minister should, if at all possible, send the cruiser around at once to investigate the complaints and see how matters stand.  It seems to be a rather serious thing for these fellows to interfere with the local salmon fishermen who hold licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no complaint beyond what has now been mentioned by Deputy White; I had no complaint about the stealing of lobster pots until it was mentioned in the Deputy's question.  Deputy Ryan made a suggestion that the Department is treating the rod men more favourably than the net men.  On nearly all the rivers there is a different close season for rods and nets and surely the Deputy will not suggest that the rod is as formidable a weapon as the net for killing fish. The net season is invariably shorter than the rod season and there are certain close seasons, such as the weekly close season, that apply to nets and that do not apply to rods. You have both legislation and bye-laws governing the close season for nets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOReilly" hpid="Mr. T. O'Reilly Mr. T. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Minister reconcile that statement with the fact that a net operates on 1st January in Waterford and rods could not operate there until 1st February?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As a general rule there is more restriction on net men than on rod men because the net is a far more potent killer of fish than the rod.  On some rivers scientific investigation has shown that the fish run earlier.  Then you have certain rivers open much earlier than others for nets.  In some cases they open earlier for rods than nets and in other cases they open earlier for nets as against rods.  Considerable information has been obtained as a result of local inquiries where evidence can be had from existing fishermen.  The investigations <Col N="1241" /> are held by persons with scientific knowledge.</P>
      <P>It is not, of course, correct to say that any differentiation is made by the Department between one set of fishermen and another.  Whenever there is a demand for an inquiry into a grievance that inquiry is almost invariably given.  If I understood the Deputy rightly, I think he was complaining that there was a certain number of bailiffs on the river.  Certain bailiffs are appointed, both for the close season and the open season, on all rivers by the fishery conservators for the area.  I doubt very much whether it is true that there are more bailiffs during the open season than there are during the close season in any given area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt it.  The Deputy will admit that there must be bailiffs, that people have not yet reached&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The demand of the fishermen is for bailiffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  I thought the Deputy was complaining that there had been certain places which the bailiffs were watching closely to see that the weekly close season had not been infringed.  There are five whole days in each week during which fish can be caught by nets. If rivers are to have any chance for fish to pass up, apart altogether from sport, and a certain number must spawn, if you do not have two full days in which fish can run freely up an estuary without being netted, rivers will very quickly deteriorate, because the amount of spawning fish will not be sufficient to keep up the supply.  That is held by those who are experienced in these matters.  I do not think the Deputy would suggest that we should neglect altogether the value of our rod fishing. That is a great attraction to visiting tourists.  There are very many tourists of a particularly desirable type, the type who spend a considerable amount of money, who come to this country solely for <Col N="1242" /> angling.  I do not think the Deputy would suggest that we should discourage them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but we should not starve the fishermen for their sakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>But if we keep the week open from Monday morning until the following Monday morning we will starve the fishermen, because the rivers will be depleted of fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fishermen have not asked for that either.  Their contention was that there were more bailiffs on during the fishing season than during the close season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make inquiries into that.  I doubt very much if there have been more bailiffs on during the open season than during the close season.  At any rate, the advice that the Department gives&mdash; and normally it is what conservators do&mdash;is that additional bailiffs should be employed each year during the annual close season, that is, during the spawning season.  I do not know of any district where they do not employ an additional number of bailiffs during the annual close season. All these things come up to me annually, and I am not aware that there is any fishery district which does not ask for sanction for the appointment of extra bailiffs during the annual close season.  I will make inquiries to see if there is anything in the point.</P>

      <P>The less they know about a thing the more talk some people have about it.  That is <Col N="1243" /> my experience.  I have heard wonderful speeches made here for a very long time which amounted in the end to very little.  This is a very difficult subject.  The fishing industry here is going through a transitional stage, and whether there are to be power boats, sailing boats, or auxiliary boats is a matter for the committee to consider.  When materials&mdash;nets, ropes, and everything concerned&mdash;are so dear, you must go cautiously and without too much hurry about it.  Another difficulty is that during the Great War a number of men along the coast went into the Navy and were lost, and a number have gone to America, so that there is considerable difficulty in getting crews, and I am afraid that in certain areas men will have to be imported to teach the people how to fish again.  They are settling down and commencing their work now, but what sort of boats would suit them best is a matter on which I would scarely like to offer an opinion.</P>

      <P>I never said any such thing.  This is a co-operative association to do certain things that were formerly done by the Department, and if possible to develop them.  It will mean that instead of the Department looking after the giving of loans for boats and gear the Association will be in a position to give these loans on a man's own security.  The real effectiveness will be that the Co-operative Association will now provide the loan on the man's own security, without getting any sureties, and that they will handle the man's catches until the loan is repaid.  If the fisherman gets a loan from the Association it will have the disposal of his catch until the loan is repaid.  It will fall on him week by week instead of his having to pay half-yearly instalments, which he was rarely able to pay.  Now he will pay according to his catches&mdash;in a bad season less and in a good season more.  Under its <Col N="1246" /> rules the Association will have power to develop the home market as far as it can be developed.  But one must remember that the possibilities of the home market in regard to fish are rather limited.  It is idle for people to say that we are a great fish-eating people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>When we heard there was going to be an adjournment this week we thought it right to bring forward as a matter of urgency this question of the delay in bringing in proposals dealing with the protection of the coach building industry and that it should be mentioned in that way.  The Ceann Comhairle said that that could not be brought up under Standing Order 57.  Accordingly this is the only opportunity we have of dealing with it at present although we will not have what we would like to have, an opportunity of having a definite vote on it except in connection with the adjournment of the Dáil.  It seems to us it shows a want of consideration by the Ministry to propose to adjourn the Dáil over a period of five months when we have an important industry like the coach building industry <Col N="1249" /> practically on its last legs because of the inaction of the Ministry in connection with this question of a tariff or protection for the industry.</P>
      <P>The facts of the industry have been put before the House on more than one occasion.  The demand for protection of that industry was made back in 1926 and it was referred to the Tariff Commission in 1927. Now the Commissioners had three years to consider that application and the information we got was that this report was practically ready. But this Ministry that has been so careless about this industry proposes now that we should adjourn and leave this industry to suffer a further period of five months of loss and uncertainty without taking any action on it.  Most of the members of the Dáil remember the facts put before them for this industry.  It was pointed out that it was an industry in which we had the advantage of having a number of skilled workers, that it was an industry which was able to compete with imported articles as far as price is concerned, particularly motor bodies, and that the only reason why protection was necessary was because of the fact of the selling organisation across the water where the complete car is pushed to such an extent that the people who buy here do not realise that in buying the foreign body they are unnecessarily exporting Irish money and giving employment to the stranger.  We have the advantage then of having skilled workers.  We have the advantage of being able to get something like 42 per cent., I think, of the materials that are needed here at home.  I think that the census of production in 1926 showed that the value of the products was over £1,000,000 and that about 42 per cent. of that were obtainable at home and had not to be imported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the Irish point of view it has the further advantage that of all industries, next to the building industry, the greatest proportion of money is spent on wages.  Fifty per cent. practically of the money spent in providing the article is spent in wages: but notwithstanding the <Col N="1250" /> fact that it has been estimated that something like 2,000 extra workers would be employed in the industry and that it could be used to produce our requirements, we have this thing hanging over for a period of three years without any action having been taken.  I suppose they will tell us that they had to wait for the Report of the Tariff Commission.  It seems to us, at any rate, that of all the applications that should be dealt with quickly this was one, that this long period was not necessary at all, and that the Ministry ought in a case like that, if there is an altogether unreasonable delay in the Tariff Commission, to take action themselves. We are losing these skilled workmen.  We are losing the wages. We are importing cars into this country, the bodies of which could be made at home, to such an extent that we quoted from a British motor trade journal to the effect that we were the best customer of British cars.  The Australians were the best customers of chassis.  The purchase of these cars involved here an annual loss of £600,000 by comparison with the Australians.  These facts have all been put before the House already, and any person looking at these facts and considering the loss we are suffering should be against the attitude of the Ministry in proposing the adjournment of this House for a period of five months when we are told there is a Report practically ready.</P>
    <P>That is the information I have, at any rate, that this Report is practically ready.  I would like to know what justification the Ministers have for adjourning the House for this continued period without having this Report before it.  I do not think there is any member here who wants to see our skilled workmen going away.  I do not think there is anyone who wants to see this loss of wealth occurring to Ireland when there is a way to prevent it. Again, it is not like some of the other industries where there would be an additional cost on the poor man.  Applicants for the tariff have held that they can produce as cheap as the British catalogued <Col N="1251" /> prices, particularly in the case of bus bodies and so on.  The Ministry's whole attitude in respect to this in the past has been certainly, to use the least strong expression I can, very culpable.  They have allowed these motor bodies at the time when we were getting in these British cars to flood the country to saturation point, and consequently allowed Irish money to be exported in buying articles which could be produced at home.  Our attitude is&mdash;we intend opposing the adjournment if for this reason only, on the ground that there are a number of urgent matters that should be brought forward and particularly this matter of dealing with the question of the tariff and protection for the coach building industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy de Valera that there appears to be no genuine explanation recently given to this House for the delay on the part of the Tariff Commission or the Ministry in introducing this Report. On the last occasion, when the matter was raised by Deputy Lemass or some other Deputy from those benches the Minister explained that the time of the members of the Tariff Commission had been taken up to a great extent in connection with the work of the Grain Inquiry.  I know nothing of any activities of members of the Tariff Commission in connection with that particular matter for the last three months.  At any rate, seeing that the case submitted by those associated with the coach-building industry was submitted to the Tariff Commission so far back as 1926 I think the question of bringing in a Report on that matter should have been completed before they gave any further public time to the work.  I am not sure whether it will be necessary for the House to meet again to deal with any business which may be sent back from the Seanad, but I would urge the Minister if he is going to insist on an adjournment to-night without doing something in the matter raised by Deputy de Valera that he will, if we are called together again, see <Col N="1252" /> to it that in the meantime this Commission will bring in the Report and that this House will have the necessary means taken to give effect to this Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the Reports of the Tariff Commission in regard to wrapping paper and to coach-building are nearly ready. When they are presented they will be considered by the Executive Council. If they are positive reports the Dáil may take it that the Executive Council will prepare proposals for <Col N="1253" /> carrying them into effect.  If the reports are along the line that would require and permit of immediate action, the Executive Council can arrange to have the Dáil reassemble for the specific business of dealing with any proposal that may arise out of the reports of the Tariff Commission on these matters.  The Executive Council, if the case seems to warrant it, will not hesitate to move the Ceann Comhairle to have the House summoned to deal with such matters.  I expect that certain amendments will be made to Bills that are now before the Seanad, and consequently it will be necessary to summon the House to deal with Seanad amendments.  I do not know whether the reports of the Tariff Commission on these matters will have been presented and considered before such meeting takes place, but even if any matter that may arise out of them cannot be dealt with when we are considering the Seanad amendments to Bills now before them, there is no reason why the House should not be summoned to meet on some day convenient to consider business of this nature.  We recognise that if there are positive unanimous reports from the Tariff Commission on these matters it would not be reasonable to delay action until the 19th November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we take that as a definite assurance, that if the Tariff Commission submits recommendations in favour of a duty on imported vehicles the Executive Council will act accordingly by coming to the Dáil?  It has been the practice of the Executive Council to act on such recommendations and presumably that will be followed in this case.  Can we take it from the Minister that if the Tariff Commission, say, within the next fortnight, submits positive recommendations which will require financial resolutions to implement them, the Dáil will be summoned to pass such resolutions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may take it that if we get a unanimous, positive report we will not delay <Col N="1254" /> in dealing with it.  We have so far never got reports which were not in the main unanimous and, consequently, we had no great difficulty in dealing with them.  If we got reports that were not unanimous the Executive Council might have difficulty in making up their minds but, as I say, we have not yet got a report that was not in the main unanimous.  If on this occasion we also get positive reports, we will not wait until the 19th November to put them into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will realise that the position in the coach-building industry is critical.  If a report is submitted recommending a tariff and if the Executive Council delay putting it into operation until the 19th November, it is very likely that the industry would be in a very critical condition.  I would urge on the Ministry to take immediate action because they will have to choose between letting the industry die straight away or giving it immediate protection.  To postpone that protection until November would be practically useless to the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister on many occasions when replying to complaints of this kind gave as a reason for the delay the other important duties which the members of the Commission have to perform.  It was first suggested here some years ago that the work of the Tariff Commission is sufficiently important to justify relieving the three individuals <Col N="1255" /> concerned of the work they have to do as heads of Government Departments. In view of the explanation given by the Minister on this matter and also that given in connection with the grain and other inquiries, I think that the time has arrived when the House would be justified in having these individuals relieved of their other duties so as to enable them to finish whatever work is required to be cleared up.</P>

      <P>I would like to see the Minister for Justice present in the Dáil just now as I want to put before him some matters concerned with his Department.  In view of the long adjournment and of the possibility of a general election in the meantime, it would be well if I put before the House some facts which came into my possession during the recent by-election concerning the policy of the Minister in allowing the Gárda Síochána to be used as election agents.  In the village of Newtownforbes on Friday last, when I arrived about half-past eight in the morning, I found three Cumann na nGaedheal cars drawn up outside the barracks, and the Guards putting up Cumann na nGaedheal posters. &ldquo;Vote 1 Delaney.&rdquo;  I did not see <Col N="1256" /> any Fianna Fáil or Labour cars there.  As I understood from the Minister for Justice and from other Ministers that the Guards are the servants of the people and not of any particular party, I went into the barracks and I asked the sergeant whether that was part of their duty, and he said that they were just obliging Cumann na nGaedheal.  I then went to another part of the barracks and found one of the Guards making paste.  I asked the sergeant to make a note of it.  He pulled down the day-book and did so.  But he said that he did not think it was any harm.  Afterwards the superintendent told me that the sergeant was wrong in allowing the barracks to be used as a Cumann na nGaedheal bill-posting establishment.  I suppose similar incidents happened in other places.  Throughout the day there was an organised body of blackguards, several of them were Free State Army pensioners, and they used every possible means of trying to prevent Fianna Fáil supporters from exercising the franchise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is part of their duty.  After the incident at the barracks, they took up a hostile attitude towards us, and tried to run us out of the place, but they did not succeed. On at least half-a-dozen occasions we had to draw the attention of the Guards to the fact that voters were intimidated, and though they said that they would put these people in the barracks they did not do so, and these people did not refrain from intimidating voters.  It seems to me that there are no proper regulations governing the conduct of Guards on polling days.  I called the attention of the presiding officer to the fact that voters were not allowed to vote freely.  He said that he had no jurisdiction outside the booth, and neither had the Guards who were on duty inside.  I never saw such black guardism as was carried on there from morning until night.  Some of the decent supporters of Cumann <Col N="1257" /> na nGaedheal came to me and apologised for the action of these blackguards.</P>
      <P>I handed in a question to the Minister last Monday in which I asked him whether he was aware that the Gárda Síochána station at Newtownforbes, Co. Longford, was used as a bill-posting establishment on behalf of Cumann na nGaedheal, that Guards were engaged in posting bills at the barracks in the interests of that Party, and, further, whether any instructions were issued by the Minister's Department instructing the Guards to assist the Cumann na nGaedheal Party during the election. The Guards were powerless to deal with the blackguardism that was carried on.  In fact, they seemed to be afraid.  Owing to their intimate associations with these people they were all one.  We used to hear the cry at elections about our being all one now, but it seems to me that the Gárda and Cumann na nGaedheal were all one on this occasion and co-operated to try and return the Cumann na nGaedheal candidate.</P>

      <P>Bearing out Deputy Allen's statements, there are a number of incidents in connection with the by-election and the conduct of the Guards to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention. We would like to know, in view of other by-lections or general elections, whether it is Cumann na nGaedheal or the Civic Guard, or both, we have to fight.  We were able to fight both of them at the last election, but we want to know where we stand.  I want to know how many people in Westmeath have licences to carry arms.  How many people in Rathowen Civic Guard area are entitled to carry revolvers? On June 9th in the district of Streete a Mrs. Parker was awakened by people shouting &ldquo;Up Delaney.&rdquo;  She got up and these people continued to shout.  She shouted &ldquo;Up Geoghegan&rdquo; and they fired shots.  The shots may have been fired at her or in the air.  I have here one of the cases which dropped outside her gate from an <Col N="1258" /> automatic pistol.  She is prepared to identify the ear that was outside her house at 1 a.m. as belonging to ex-Commandant Conway of the Free State Army.  He was an election agent for Cumann na nGaedheal and is in receipt of a pension of £150 from the State.  This gentleman on the night of the 13th June returned from Mullingar with three Gárdaí in his car and stopped at the village of Ballinalack at the house of Michael Mullin about midnight.  He called Mullin out and asked him whether he was the man who reported him to Geoghegan for tearing down his bills.  He was tearing down bills a few nights previously, and when Mr. Geoghegan's car came up, Conway, like the brave warrior he is, drove away.  He said, taking a revolver from his hip-pocket, that he would riddle him.  Those in the car told him to move on and the driver of the car moved on.</P>

    <P>On the night of the 14th June, a number of youths were celebrating the Fianna Fáil victory at the cross-roads in Lismacaffrey.  They had a bonfire some yards from the road, where bonfires had been made from time immemorial.  The sergeant of Coole Barracks&mdash;Sergeant O'Halloran&mdash;came down with a number of Guards, who drew their batons, rushed the crowd and batoned them. When the crowd stood their ground, the Guards used the most obscene and abusive language, in the presence of women, and the sergeant, while frothing from the mouth, told them that he was as good a politician as they were.  On the night of the 12th June, I had occasion to go into Castlepollard Barracks to get a 'phone call.  I often got a 'phone call there before and paid for it when I could not get a call at the Post Office.  Other people do that, too.  I found there the two personating agents of Cumann na nGaedheal and the local C.I.D. officer, with the register in his hand.  They and the local Guards were going over the register.  They got a bit of a shock when I went in and they were put into another room.  For a week before the election, it was noticed that there <Col N="1259" /> was feverish activity on the part of the local Gárda with their cars.  As soon as the election was over they ceased going round, and up to a week previous to the election we did not notice that feverish activity.  We were credibly informed that they were acting as agents for Cumann na nGaedheal, that they were bill-stickers for them.  I had direct proof when I walked into the barracks and saw the two personation agents in their midst.  At Clonmellon, they put up the canvasser who was sent out there from Cumann na nGaedheal headquarters.  They accompanied Deputy Batt O'Connor through the streets of Clonmellon and they warned the publicans to be neutral in the election.  Had they any right to do that?  At Ballinalee, on the morning of the election, the Cumann na nGaedheal car or lorry drew up.  Mrs. Killane, widow of the late Deputy, was witness to what I state now, and Frank Gormley, a man who distinguished himself in the Tan war, saw the Guards moving out the forms and placing them on the Cumann na nGaedheal lorry.  On the night of the 14th, when the local people were celebrating the victory, people in plain clothes rushed from the barracks, batoned them, and two men had to be treated by the local doctor, while there was no such occurrence when there were similar bonfires in similar places after the Sligo-Leitrim election.</P>
    <P>During the voting at Streete polling booth there was an ex-Captain Moore with two guns in his breeches pockets.  This brave fellow, who had his hands in his breeches pockets, was accompanied by two other people who, he announced, were army men.  They were using obscene and filthy language and staggering about challenging people to fight.  It was only when our people went to defend themselves that the Guards eventually came in between them.  I wonder if the Fianna Fáil supporter had walked up with two guns in his pocket to a polling booth on the 13th June would the Guards stand idly by and listen to him using all sorts of intimidation, threats and abusive <Col N="1260" /> language?  When we reported to the County Superintendent of the Guards a number of these affairs, and when the local sergeant at Rothowen barracks went to Mrs. Parker to investigate what happened, he went threatening and frightening the woman.  What could we expect when the local Cumann na nGaedheal meeting on the Thursday night previous was held at that barracks and when those who were at that meeting adjourned into the barracks after the meeting.  I could give instance after instance to show how this splendid, so-called impartial police force acted.  You would get better treatment from a police force in a British protectorate.  There is no use in telling us about their impartiality or about their being unarmed when they can be accompanied around by ex-National Army men armed with guns and threatening every decent person in Westmeath.</P>
    <P>You talk about the gun bullies from your platforms.  We know damn well where the gun bullies are now, and we give you your answer. As I said in the beginning, I have investigated these cases&mdash;every one of them&mdash;and those people who are affected are prepared to go before any tribunal and prove that everything I have stated here is right.  We want to know whether this force is a branch of the Cumann na nGaedheal organisation or whether it is a police force.  If it is a branch of the Cumann na nGaedheal organisation it is up to Cumann na nGaedheal to maintain it.  It is not for the Exchequer of this country, which is contributed to by every citizen, to pay a partisan police force, which is there principally to maintain a certain political party in office. We ask the Minister to investigate these matters and not give us the answer that we always get&mdash;a blank denial&mdash;in view of the evidence we have regarding their actions in the by-election.</P>

      <P>The statements which the House has just heard from Deputies Allen and Kennedy are very serious, and I want the <Col N="1261" /> Minister for Justice to deal with them in a serious way.  It has been the practice here in the past, when accusations of partial conduct were brought against the Guards, for the Minister for Justice to deal with them as if they were brought in a spirit of fun, without any serious intentions behind them.  He cannot possibly deal with the statements which have now been made in that way.  We, in the past, produced in the House details of cases in which members of the Guards acted on behalf of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party at the General Election of 1927.  Definite examples of similar partisan actions on the part of the Guards have been given here this evening.  The incident at Newtownforbes was witnessed by a number of Deputies in this House and cannot be denied.  The persons concerned in the other incidents mentioned by Deputy Kennedy are all available and all prepared to stand for the truth of his statement at any tribunal that may be established to investigate these happenings.  As Deputy Kennedy has said, the Civic Guard force is maintained by the people of the country irrespective of party.  The tax collector does not ask a man whether he is a supporter of Cumann na nGaedheal or Fianna Fáil when he is collecting his taxes. The burden of maintaining the Guards is shared equally, and the Guards should, therefore, be above party and exist for the purpose of maintaining law and order, and for that only.  It appears, however, that they have allowed themselves to be used as the appendage of a political party.  I have no doubt whatever that they have found themselves in that position in consequence of the direct incitement given them by the Minister for Justice on many occasions in this House.  The Minister has always treated the Civic Guard as if it should be an appendage of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party. We know that the Cumann na nGaedheal Party was able in the recent by-election in North Dublin City to go to police headquarters and get in police headquarters documents which existed there, and <Col N="1262" /> which had not been made available to the public, which were published for the first time in the form of propaganda against Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>These documents were furnished to the Cumann na nGaedheal organisation.  The Minister apparently thinks that not merely the Guards but the entire machinery of his office should be placed at the service of the political organisation to which he belongs.  He seems to think that that machinery is established here for the sole purpose of keeping himself in office.  The people of Longford-Westmeath showed what they thought of the manner in which he was fulfilling his office and the people of Ireland will do it again.  No matter how the Minister may abuse his powers, the result will be the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many statements were made in this House and outside it about gun bullies.  The names of gun bullies have been given to the Minister here this evening.  Definite examples of gun bullyism have been produced and we want to know what the Minister is going to do about them.  If the Minister is going to do nothing regarding these men who have been engaged in these acts of blackguardism, then I ask him to shut up about gun bullies.  Here we have men paid by the State, paid by the money of the taxpayers, parading with guns in their possession, firing shots at peaceful people, intimidating citizens from exercising the rights of the franchise and the Minister, whose duty it is to suppress such <Col N="1263" /> blackguardism, appears to think that it is all right so long as it helps the candidate of his party to victory. The Minister is, I think, more responsible than any other individual in this country for any instability that may exist in the political life of the Free State at the moment.  He is more responsible than anyone else for whatever danger or violent action may occur in the future.  Time and again, cases have been brought here of provocative action by the Guards&mdash;action designed to lead to a breach of the peace.  The Minister never took any steps whatever to prevent a repetition of such action. He always justified it and gloried in it and held up the Guard who committed an assault as a good Guard. Deputies in this House know that what I am saying is true.  We had even a Deputy of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party some time ago producing the details of an incident&mdash; a non-political incident&mdash;in which the Guards had acted in a provocative and intimidatory manner.  The Minister's attitude to that case was the same as his attitude to the cases produced by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">

      <P>I say when a Cumann na nGaedheal Deputy comes here with signed statements concerning violent action by the Guards, it is the duty of the Minister to investigate that charge.  The Minister refused to carry out that investigation asked for here.  Here are cases in Longford-Westmeath, cases in which chapter and verse have been given. Is the Minister going to do in this matter as he did in the others&mdash;sit <Col N="1264" /> still and smile, with his hands in his pockets&mdash;or will his answer be that he will take such steps as are necessary to ensure that such cases will not occur again?  Here are Guards who have committed illegalities, who have broken their trust. It is the duty of the Minister to clear them out of the force if he wants that force to have any respect amongst decent people.</P>

      <P>I would not have intervened in this discussion were it not that a Deputy's name on our side of the House has been mentioned.  It has been said that Deputy O'Connor had the assistance of Guards at a place called Clonmellon.  I was at Clonmellon from Wednesday until the Sunday morning and I had not the assistance of any Guard. Deputy O'Connor is not in the House and his name is mentioned.  I was there all the time and my name was not mentioned because I am here. In that place or anywhere I was I had no connection with the Guards, and they did not come near us.  The Guards were absolutely impartial. I am not in a position to speak for other places and I am not going to speak of places of which I have no personal knowledge.  As regards the place I have personal knowledge of the statement is absolutely untrue. There was no interference in any way by the Guards.  As regards the question of interference with booths, it would probably be well to make a regulation keeping away all these mobilised forces from booths.  I have seen fifteen or twenty people at a booth intimidating everybody there.  It is a case that if we take a leaf out of other people's books it must be condemned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot, of course, contradict the accusations made against the Gárda Síochána by Deputies Allen and Kennedy, but I can tell of my own experience in the town of Longford and the town of Mullingar.  In both of these places I saw the Gárda Síochána carrying out their duties in the ordinary way. I saw no interference with any person or any party during my time there.  Of course, I do not doubt at all that Deputy Kennedy has given an account as it was given to him of certain events.  I am not at all disputing that fact, but I am giving my own personal experience, and the experience I had in two general elections in Cork City go to show that the Guards have not interfered with any party.  I will go further and say that it is a good job that the Gárda Síochána were outside the polling booths, because were it not for that fact I believe there would have been a good deal of personation. It is all very fine to suggest that the Gárda Síochána are over-stepping their proper duties in regulating crowds or perhaps ejecting an interrupter. The ejection of an interrupter frequently obviates a breach of the peace.  I have seen at election time where a Gárda intervened and removed an obstructionist.  I think in that he is really doing his duty. In fact, I would consider that he failed in his duty if he did not remove a person who was there for the sole purpose of causing a breach of the peace.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving unbiassed information.  I have got assistance from the Gárda Síochána. Members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party have got assistance when required, and the same thing, I think, is true of the Fianna Fáil <Col N="1266" /> Party.  I am speaking of my own personal experience.  I cannot say anything as to what occurred at Clonmellon and those other places mentioned by Deputy Kennedy. There is no use making an indictment of the Gárda Síochána as a whole.  It may be that one or two members of the force were overzealous in the discharge of their duties.  It may be perhaps that they had certain Party leanings.  I am giving my own experience, and that is the reason why I rose. General statements are all right, but they cannot be taken as a condemnation of the force as a whole.  Considering the excitement of election times and the fact that they are mostly young men, and that some of them have been through a very severe time during the Civil War and during the Anglo-Irish War, I think that their action is not one worthy of condemnation.  Rather is the reverse true.  I know that on occasions that I know of they have done their duty as peace officers, and no more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that anybody on any side of the House will object to the Gárda Síochána doing their duty.  They have a duty to perform at election times as well as other times.  As Deputy Anthony said, at election times it is quite possible that in the excitement and heat of a well-contested election you will get people noisy and excited.  Sometimes their temper is ruffled.  If the Gárda are there to prevent a disturbance and keep the peace nobody on these benches will object.  In fact we would be glad to see them doing their duty impartially.  But the cases that have been referred to here by Deputy Kennedy and Deputy Allen and other cases referred to by Deputy Lemass show that, at any rate, in the particular cases the Gárda did not do their duty impartially. What surprises me is, seeing the countenance that is given to disgraceful <Col N="1267" /> actions by the Gárda, uniformed and un-uniformed, by the Minister for Justice and other Ministers, that they have not been worse in a great many other cases.  That is what I think will astonish most of us.  As Deputy Anthony said, many of them have not a great many years' experience, and in view of the shameful encouragement given to them by Ministers to act as Cumann na nGaedheal agents, to be the police of a political party, it is surprising to me that the Minister has not succeeded in getting more of them to do the work of paid agents that some of them unfortunately have allowed themselves to be drawn into doing.  I am nearly certain that you will not get an inquiry from the Minister because the Minister himself is the person impeached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He is the person directly responsible. He has given more encouragement to blackguardism in the police force than any other individual could do.  Of course, it comes worse from him than from anybody else. He has given personal encouragement in every way, by word and act, so far as he could do as Minister for Justice.  Gun-bullyism has been mentioned. As Deputy Lemass said charges of that kind have been fired off Cumann na nGaedheal platforms at people on our side.  We are used to this old trick to try to fasten on to other people the names that really belong to your own side.  The Minister knows very well that if anybody showed the shadow of a gun or if there was a shadow of a gunman on the Republican side&mdash;on the Fianna Fáil side&mdash;he would very soon find himself in hot water.  If there was, in the course of that by-election, any one individual on the Fianna Fáil side who attempted intimidation or was successful at intimidation&mdash;and there were C.I.D. men enough at every meeting I attended&mdash;where there were Ministers speaking there were two or three car loads of C.I.D. men protecting the Ministers&mdash;he would have got himself into hot water very quickly.  We have definite evidence <Col N="1268" /> here.  I take it so far as Deputies Allen and Kennedy are concerned their statements will not be contested. I take it they are honourable men.  They would not have mentioned names unless they were satisfied themselves that their statements were absolutely reliable.  They have given the Minister definite evidence of gun-bullyism with which we are all acquainted here, and we know for certain that there will be no inquiry. These men will be brought to headquarters or their superintendents will be brought to headquarters and clapped on the back, and when it comes to the distribution of good conduct medals these men of the Cumann na nGaedheal Civic Guard Force will get promotion and medals.  Gun-bullyism of that kind is going on, not alone at elections, but in the streets of Dublin almost every day.</P>
    <P>I have had evidence of it even from supporters of Cumann na nGaedheal.  One gentleman who was a member of the Dáil when the Treaty was under discussion came to me recently and told me that he had been a witness of the behaviour of the C.I.D.&mdash;the gun-bullies of the Minister for Justice.  These men have half murdered innocent people against whom there was no crime recorded except that they held Republican opinions and were supporters of the Republican movement, either in the form of Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin or any other branch of Republicanism.  That kind of thing is going on every day of the week in the City of Dublin, under the nose of every citizen, in the centre of the streets.  Incidents that were brought under my notice happened in Trinity Street.  They happen frequently and they are a disgrace.  Decent citizens are dragged along sometimes by the heels.  Their arms are twisted and sometimes their clothes are torn. That has happened day after day for weeks, merely because these respectable citizens are suspected of being Republicans.  No charge has ever been made against them and they are treated in that disgraceful fashion by these gentlemen who are the favourites, the elite of the un-uniformed <Col N="1269" /> body of the Gárda Síochána. I want to say that we do not charge all the Gárdaí with behaving in that fashion.  But there is behaviour by a certain element in the Gárda at election times and at other times of the year that the Minister should stop if he was there really as Minister for Justice and not as the instrument of a political Party.  He is so partisan in his attitude that he thinks, as Deputy Lemass said, that the Department of Justice is above all things else and that it is the mainstay of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party. That is his chief job and he does it to the best of his ability.  I want to mention particularly that fact of the maltreatment of decent citizens. This House is fairly acquainted with the fact and when it does happen there are instructions by the Minister that the Press has no right to mention these things.  Reports have been sent to the Press by impartial people. Letters have been written to the Press, but they are told that they must not refer to these matters although they do happen.  The Minister for Justice either personally or through his Department instructs the Press not to mention those things because they might injure the reputation, if it could be injured, of the Minister for Justice in his impartiality.</P>
    <P>I think it is a disgraceful misuse of public funds, funds that are subscribed by all classes of people, to use the Department of Justice as a machine for the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  Whatever other Government follows&mdash;and that will be bound to happen some day&mdash;I hope that it will not follow the bad example set to it, more particularly by the present Minister for Justice. I hope that whatever Ministry follows, it will endeavour to set an example of what an impartial Ministry, especially as regards the Department of Justice, ought to be.</P>
    <P>Another matter I want to refer to is the treatment of prisoners.  Three months ago I raised the question of the treatment of two prisoners, Sweeney and McGuinness.  The Minister replied that these men were not in solitary confinement.  My <Col N="1270" /> information then was, and now is, that despite the denial of the Minister&mdash;it was a diplomatic denial &mdash;these men are in solitary confinement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">

      <P>I am told that Aidan Sweeney and Patrick McGuinness have been nine months in solitary confinement, and George Mooney since the date of his trial in December last.  Close confinement is having a really bad effect on Mooney, and his relations are very anxious about him.  Then there is the case of the two men in Maryboro'.  Hogan is suffering from tuberculosis.  I am told he was recommended for release by the prison doctor two years ago, and I will be glad if the Minister can deny that he is in bad health and is suffering from tuberculosis. As regards the case of Hogan, I think it is really political victimisation that is keeping the man in jail.  The crime alleged against him and for which he was convicted and sentenced, happened in times when the country was not in a normal condition.  Many things happened at that time that ought not to have happened; many things happened in different parts of the city and the Free State area that we are all sorry happened.</P>

      <P>Things were done by Republicans, and I know in some cases the members of the I.R.A. during that period did things for which they honestly believed they had an order.  Some men are in jail now for doing things that they believed firmly they had orders to do from their superior officers in the I.R.A.  They are in jail in England and some are in jail in the Free State even still.  A good many years have passed and we think the time has come when these things ought to be forgotten.  The men who committed the crimes alleged against them committed them, we believe, sincerely and honestly believing they were acting on orders.  We do not want to stand over any case where these men <Col N="1271" /> did not honestly and sincerely believe they were carrying out orders.  We do not want to stand over anything that was really criminal.  The cases we mention do not come within that category.  We believe that the men acted in the belief that they were carrying out instructions from their superior officers.  Hogan's is one of these cases.  We believe that Hogan is in very bad health, is tubercular, and naturally imprisonment will not help to prolong his life.  I have been told, whether it is correct or not, that Hogan was recommended for release two years ago because of his health.  Whether he was or not we think that the time for an amnesty for these men, Hogan and Con Healy, has more than arrived.</P>

      <P>McGuinness and Sweeney were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment for being in possession of arms.  On this subject I have more than once put it to the Minister for Finance that he ought to bear in mind his own advice in other years.  There might be some hope that the Minister for Justice would be impartial, but his colleagues in the Ministry could not be impartial.  There might be some hope that he would be impartial in the case of men carrying arms.  You have over there members of a Ministry who have been preaching this doctrine of carrying arms for years to the young men of the country. Their words are on record and are quoted every day.  They have encouraged young men to carry arms. You cannot expect these men to be impartial, but perhaps the Minister for Justice might, seeing that he did not preach the doctrine of getting arms how and where you could and on all occasions.  He did not preach that; he did not preach physical force; we cannot accuse him of that. Therefore, he ought to bear in mind these words:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1272" /> The iron of slavery is so driven into our souls that few of us think it a disgrace, a clear mark of degradation, to be unarmed. Courage and a hankering after weapons we have, but if we are content to rest at that where do we differ from those who are unarmed from choice and shudder at the sight of steel?  For our manhood's sake we must not merely deplore our condition, but must sweat and starve till each has a gun and can shoot to kill.&mdash; Ernest Blythe.</P>
    <P>When you have doctrines of that kind preached year after year and put in print over the signature of the present Vice-President&mdash;he was not then Vice-President&mdash;what can you expect from the young men?  Is it fair or is it square dealing to have on the one side a man who is responsible for preaching a doctrine of that kind and printing it, and then condemning men as a Minister of the Free State for acting on his advice? He preached it; these young men are carrying out what he preached and they are suffering long terms of imprisonment.  That is not fair. The Minister must and ought to be the first person to come here to plead for them.  He should tell the House that he is partly responsible for these young men's doings.  The Vice-President ought to be the individual to come to the House and plead for these men.  Instead of that he encourages the Minister for Justice to be as cold, indifferent and harsh as he can be in keeping these young men in solitary confinement in prison for long terms.</P>
    <P>These young men are not criminals. They believed in that doctrine as the Minister for Finance probably did believe in it once. They believed they were doing right and they believed they were practising the good citizenship that the Vice-President taught them at one time.  They were acting on his advice and were doing a good citizen's work.  Therefore they are not criminals. They are in the view of the Minister for Justice misguided, but not being criminals they ought not <Col N="1273" /> to be treated as criminals and ought not to be made consort with criminals. Young Sweeney was made consort in the tailors' shop with at least one man who was guilty of most heinous crimes&mdash;guilty of crimes that could not be mentioned in this House.  That is not good enough if the Minister for Finance, the Vice-President of the Free State, preaches this doctrine off public platforms and through the public Press.  He did that not so long ago and these young men endeavoured to put the gospel that he taught so enthusiastically into practice, and we now know how they are treated by him and by his colleagues.  These men have suffered more than enough.  It would come with bad grace from the present Ministry to keep them any longer, as they sometimes have to do, in solitary confinement and consorting with the lowest criminals in the land.</P>

      <P>There is another matter to which I would like to refer. There are a number of important Bills that were promised and that ought to have been in the House during the last twelve months.  One is the Town Tenants Bill.  The Minister promised its introduction over and over again.  The last time the matter was raised he repudiated his promise, and now he can give no date for the introduction of the Bill. That is not square dealing&mdash;running away from a promise in that manner. It is not treating the public fairly. Amongst the other Bills promised were a Bill on Co-operation, a Clean Milk Bill, a Fisheries Bill, a Road Traffic Bill, a Dublin Transport Bill, an Insurance Bill, a Merchandise Marks Bill, a Minerals Bill, a Workmen's Compensation Bill and several others.  That is not by any means a complete list.  The House is going to <Col N="1274" /> adjourn for twenty-two weeks while Bills of that kind are waiting to be dealt with.  Above all, I think the Town Tenants Bill is the most urgent.  If the Minister had any honesty in him he should have acted on his promise.  We are adjourning for five months after doing 48 days work.  We are now going to adjourn for 154 days.  In 1929 we did 69 days' work and this year we have sat only 48 days.</P>

      <P>I will do my share of the talking, and some of it does not seem to be too agreeable for people on the other side.  They do not like to listen to what I have to say.  The things I said about Mr. Blythe, Minister for Finance, will long be remembered to him and his subsequent actions will be remembered too.  These young men are suffering in jail, and the fact that they have to suffer because of the gospel he taught will lie on the Minister's conscience.  Whether he recognises the fact now or not, all this will lie on the conscience of the Minister for Finance.  It will give him many sleepless nights, as it ought to, when he thinks of those young men who lie, some of them in solitary confinement, and others who are forced to consort with low-class criminals.  The Minister for Justice should certainly have an uneasy conscience and many an uneasy night.  I hope that until these young men are treated with some humanity, that will be so.  It is an unjust thing to the country to adjourn for 22 weeks after doing only 48 days' work, while so much of the State's urgent work remains to be attended to.</P>

      <P>It has been reported to me that in my absence Deputy Kennedy said that during the election campaign, whilst canvassing at Clonmellon, I was accompanied <Col N="1275" /> by Civic Guards, helping me in the canvass.  If the Deputy has made that statement, I wish to deny it, and to say that there is not a word of truth in it.  It is rather unfair to attack the Civic Guards, who are public servants, and it is very unfair for members of Fianna Fáil to be so hostile to the Civic Guards, and, above all, for Deputy Kennedy to make such a glaring statement of that kind without investigating it.  If Deputy Kennedy asked me I would have told him.  I want to deny it emphatically; there is not a word of truth in it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Little inquired whether the members of this Party were prepared to support the demand for an inquiry into the incidents referred to by Deputies Kennedy and Allen.  Certainly we are prepared to support the demand for an inquiry, but we are not prepared to admit the guilt of those who have been charged before the inquiry has concluded. That was the gist of the unfortunate speech which was made by Deputy O'Kelly.  He seemed to assume that every demand for an inquiry would be refused.  I had occasion&mdash;and Deputy Lemass knows something about this case&mdash;within the last twelve months to convey to the Minister a very serious complaint which I had received from a part of my constituency against certain Guards for having been involved in a particular incident.  I went to the office of the Minister and I asked him what he proposed to do in connection with this very serious allegation. An inquiry was held and I am perfectly satisfied that the Guards, who were very seriously dealt with as a result of that inquiry, if they wish to remain in the police any longer&mdash; those who are left&mdash;will not commit the same offence again.</P>

I am not going to associate myself with a demand for an inquiry and then laugh when an inquiry is not held.  Deputy Kennedy is a representative of the constituency, and I agree that the charges he has made &mdash;and they are serious charges&mdash;are certainly sufficient to justify an inquiry. I believe that the overwhelming majority of the Guards, as distinct from the C.I.D., are a self-respecting, decent body of men, and it is not right that any Deputy should condemn the overwhelming majority of Guards for the sins of the few.  The charges are serious and justify an inquiry, and I hope that in the interests of the impartial administration of justice and of all concerned, and for guidance in cases of this kind that an inquiry will be set up and that Deputy Kennedy and the other people who make these charges will get an opportunity of proving them.</P>

      <P>I suppose it does not matter.  In any case it shakes any little faith I may have had in Deputy O'Connor as to his genuineness in dealing with a matter of this kind.  It discredits what he has already said.  He is not willing to submit these things to an impartial inquiry.  Sometimes inquiries were made, and in some cases Guards have been condemned, but in other cases&mdash;very important cases&mdash;inquiries were not made.  We are entitled to have an inquiry into the conduct of the Guards during this election.  We took up the attitude, on all the Estimates under the control of the Minister for Justice, of trying as far as possible to give the greatest possible credit to the Guards as a general body, with a view to creating a feeling in the country of really constitutional government, to treat the Guards as if they were impartial, to give them credit for being impartial, and in dealing with all these Votes we strictly confined ourselves to administration and almost ignored the political action of the administration in some cases.  We tried to create that atmosphere in order to give the Minister and his Department an opportunity of responding, <Col N="1278" /> but they have not responded.  They have simply taken advantage of our attitude, simply made us out to be so many fools for having given them credit for anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the statements that have been made on this side, and I will continue to believe them until an inquiry is held.  I feel very indignant about this, because I think it is a very important thing that we should be able to place the Guards in a position of absolute impartiality, and I do not believe they would do these things unless they got orders. They themselves would infinitely prefer to be in a position of dignity and to act as impartial officials. They have sufficient national feeling to want to be impartial, and if it were not for orders from headquarters I should say that they would choose to act and conduct themselves properly.  We have already had the contrast brought out between what should be the attitude of the Minister for Justice and what is the attitude of the Minister for Finance.  After all, the Minister for Justice has had a long legal training and he ought at least to understand what constitutional administration is. He ought to be able to appreciate it as well as the London magistrate, Mr. Cairns, who recently visited this country and who was astounded at the disgrace of having policemen armed in the North.  I wonder what he would say if he saw the men with arms in the Twenty-six Counties?  He went so far as to characterise the Northern administration as resembling that of a Balkan State.  He said that Ireland was divided into two States, one a Free State and the other a Balkan State.  If he had the experience that we have had I think he would say that Ireland was divided into two Balkan States.  But one cannot blame the Minister for Finance.  After all, he was brought up in a school of thought which is thoroughly unconstitutional.  He is constitutionally unconstitutional, and whether he is dealing with people who owe income tax or with people like George Gilmore, they are all outlaws to him if they do not comply with the law as he wants it complied <Col N="1279" /> with.  As I have mentioned the name of George Gilmore I may say that my information about him is that he is still being persecuted and treated with violence.  If there is any evidence that he is guilty of any crime he should be tried by the ordinary law.</P>

      <P>If statements like that are to be made by Deputies without inquiry impugning the honesty and integrity of the Civic Guard, and then inquiries are to be made which are to involve this country in a great deal of expense, when we on this side of the House are asked to stand behind the holding of such an inquiry, we state we will not, and that we shall stand behind the refusal of the Minister for Justice, and we hope he will refuse, to hold an inquiry.</P>

      <Col N="1282" /> I listened with a great deal of attention to Deputy Seán T. O'Kelly. He made a lot of statements as far as the Longford-Westmeath election is concerned that, to my own personal knowledge, were not based upon truth.  One statement he made was, there was no intimidation by the followers of Fianna Fáil, that there were C.I.D. men present at every meeting, and that if any misconduct took place they would soon find themselves in jail.  I see in the back benches of Fianna Fáil the Official Whip who witnessed what took place.  I was present at a certain meeting, and I want to say that as far as my experience is concerned the grossest intimidation was carried out by the followers who supported the victor in this election.  In that particular area, Ballymahon, there were three different speakers.</P>

      <P>I suppose when we are in good humour it is no harm to go back on the meetings held at a bye-election, but while I do not want to interfere with Deputy Byrne, there is nobody in the House responsible to the House for the alleged misconduct of supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party in the bye-election.  Deputy Boland cannot be made responsible, because he is Whip of the Party, and what we are discussing now, I gather somewhat vaguely, is the conduct of the Gárda Síochána or certain members of it.</P>

      <P>I have endeavoured to keep as closely to the question as the Deputies on the other side.  Certain statements and allegations have been made from the opposite side which I happen to be in a position to repudiate from my own personal knowledge and experience.  I think in the interests of common justice the House ought to be informed of what did occur.  When Deputy O'Kelly says there was no intimidation at this election, and alleges that the Civic Guard acted in a certain fashion, as certain followers of our Party are concerned, it is only right to say that I have been through the constituency from Athlone to Mullingar, Mullingar to Longford, <Col N="1283" /> and Longford to Ballymahon, and I saw nothing but the greatest impartiality displayed by the Civic Guards who were present.  What happened when one went into the area where the Opposition was strong and where there were no Civic Guards?  What reception did one get?</P>

If Deputy Little wants to meet me at any time I am able to meet him.  I want to say this, as far as the Civic Guards are concerned, and the mere interference and interruption of the official Opposition will not prevent me from saying it, that were it not for the Civic Guards I sigh to think what would have happened in the Longford-Westmeath election.

There were many meetings at which there were neither C.I.D. nor Civic Guards, and I happened to be unfortunate <Col N="1284" /> enough to attend some of these meetings.  There was no intimidation carried on by the followers of the Opposition in the Westmeath-Longford election!  Is it intimidation to get round a motor car to tear the doors open and threaten to break the glass on the part of people who were wearing the badge of James Geoghegan on their coats?</P>

As far as statements made in this House are concerned, the Civic Guards have played a decent and honourable part in the election.  I can say that from experience, and testify to that fact.  When statements have been made about a certain man in a certain area, and when that particular man was not within twenty miles of that particular district, I think in common decency the people who made that statement ought to withdraw it.  If all the other statements made by Deputy Kennedy are as true as this statement about Clonmellon, I have no hesitation in asking the Minister to hold an enquiry, and if the Minister holds an enquiry I will have no hesitation in going into the division lobby behind him.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister concludes I wish to say that I do not wish to carry on this debate in a partisan way, but I have heard the Civic Guards commended and the administration of the Civic Guards commended.  About the force in general I have nothing to say.  As far as my experience goes I did not notice that they were unfair or partisan in any way.  At the same time, however, the House has got to remember that responsible Deputies here have borne testimony that they themselves were eye-witnesses of certain occurrences which indicated that the Guards were acting in a partisan way during this election.  Servants of the State, no matter what branch they belong to, whether they belong to the civil or police administration, or the Army, must stand aloof from all parties, and even if there were only one instance of partisan conduct on the part of the Guards, or any responsible officer of the Guards, during the course of this election, that one instance was one instance too many and it should not be condoned by any section in this House.  It should not be condoned even by the most enthusiastic supporters <Col N="1286" /> of the Minister for Justice. Every section in this House alike ought to unite in condemning and in stigmatising as unconstitutional and unlawful partisan conduct on the part of the Guards, particularly at election time.  If we are going to have any confidence in the administration of this State, if the Guards are going to have any help or assistance from the civilian population in discharging their duty, above all things they must make clear to the civilian population, no matter how we are divided as far as political parties are concerned, that they have no hand, act or part with either. They may have their own sympathies and political feelings, but they must be careful to keep these things locked up in their own breasts, and unless the House unites in laying down that principle we are not going to have in the Civic Guards that confidence which, as I said before, will allow them to discharge their difficult duties.  We have had a number of instances in the country in which it would seem, so far as ordinary crime is concerned, that the Guards are not getting the co-operation of the civilian population.  I could refer the House to the Stradbally case, in which the Guards have been cut off from the civilian population and do not seem to have the normal assistance they should have in that case.</P>

      <P>I am referring to the manner in which the acts which the Guards had done deprived them of the assistance which they should have had in the normal way.  I noticed when Deputies Allen, Kennedy, Kelly and Mullen were speaking that the Minister regarded it as a sort of a joke.  It is no joke if the Guards believe that under a certain Government they can do certain illegal acts without any fear of reprehension or any fear of punishment, then you may be certain that when that Government goes out they are going to serve the succeeding <Col N="1287" /> Government and do similar acts in the same way.  We are going to have the Guards acting as janissaries of the Government for the time being, whatever that Government may be. We are going to have established in this country a police force with the same sort of tradition as the police forces of Chicago and New York.</P>

      <P>As I was saying, if we are going to have the police force in this country permeated with the same sort of spirit which we are told permeates the police forces in New York and Chicago, we certainly do not want to see that.  We hear of attempts made by citizens in those cities in America to clear up the force and put its administration on a sound basis.  We are starting off practically as an infant State and we do not know how it is going to develop, but we on this side of the House hope that it is going to function as a sovereign independent State.  At any rate, as regards the administration of the police force, we are anxious to have it started on the fundamental principle that it will be above all things impartial and that, even if any one member of the Civic Guards conducts himself in a way that would appear to have even a tinge of partiality, such conduct should be stigmatised as unjustifiable and unworthy of the force. Responsible Deputies on this side of the House have borne testimony that they themselves have been eye-witnesses of certain things.  No matter on what side of the House Deputies sit they cannot allow such statements to go disregarded in future, especially when they have been made by responsible Deputies. The only way in which the Minister can meet such statements is to have an inquiry such as we advocate set up.  If the Guards are innocent and <Col N="1288" /> if these things have not been done, the Minister has nothing to fear from such inquiry, whereas, if the Guards have been guilty of these things, the sooner the results of such inquiry are brought home and the sooner the Minister says to these Guards: &ldquo;We will not tolerate this; you have to get out of the force,&rdquo; the better it will be for the community and the country as a whole.  Apart from whatever feelings you may have, whether you belong to Fianna Fáil or Cumann na nGaedheal, you are bound to demand from the Minister the setting up of an inquiry which will investigate the serious charges made in this House.</P>

He is a very prominent member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  If the Minister is willing to accept it, I will be very glad to supply the information.</P>

      <P>I am not referring to Deputy Esmonde.  He was very concise.  Deputy MacEntee is the Deputy to whom I refer.  I would like to deal with the smaller matters first as they will take up less time.  First of all, as regards the Town Tenants Bill.  Deputy O'Kelly seems to have misunderstood me, unless I misunderstood him.  I did <Col N="1289" /> not say that a Town Tenants Bill would not be introduced.  On the contrary, I said that it was my intention to introduce a Town Tenants Bill.  I said I would not, because I might not be able to, tie myself down to an exact time-table and I mentioned no specific date for its introduction. I stated definitely that I am going to introduce a Town Tenants Bill.  So much for that matter. Deputy O'Kelly also talked about other Bills which he said should be introduced, and he and Deputy Corry lamented over the great length of the adjournment which we are going to have.  I must frankly confess that I have not seen among the Party opposite this evening that woebegone attitude which I would naturally anticipate from people who are being torn away from this Assembly in which they desire to spend their whole time legislating.  I expected that they would be more melancholy but, frankly, I have never seen them so hilarious as this evening.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Kelly alleges that two prisoners are being kept in solitary confinement. I have told him over and over again that they are not being kept in solitary confinement.  They are not only free to take exercise and do work but they have been actually urged to adopt that course and have refused to leave their cells.  Knowing these facts, Deputy O'Kelly gets up here and says that these two young men are being kept in solitary confinement.  That appears to me to be almost a breach of privilege of this House and, certainly, it is not that fair and straightforward dealing with facts that one would expect from a member on the Front Opposition Bench.  I would certainly expect rather a higher standard of conduct than that.</P>

      <P>They are bound to obey the ordinary prison discipline.  Deputy O'Kelly went on to deal with Con Healy and Hogan and said that Hogan cannot leave his cell and is in bad health.  I think it highly probable that Hogan is in bad health and is injuring his health by refusing to take exercise and to leave his cell.  I think that that is quite likely but Hogan, like everyone else, must, when in prison, obey the rules.  I suppose that Deputies opposite say that he is not guilty of any moral crime, but the crime of which he was found guilty and for which he was sentenced to death was the crime of wilful murder.  Deputy O'Kelly said that that was during very difficult times and that the period in which that crime was committed and the circumstances under which it took place should be taken into account in considering his release.  I quite agree, but there are other things that you must take into consideration.  One is that you have Hogan completely unrepentant in prison and vowing vengeance on all classes of people.  I would not feel justified, while Hogan is in his present state of mind, in releasing him and sending him back to his native district.  That is the reason that I would not feel justified in taking that course.  Deputy O'Kelly also said that an amnesty should also be extended to Con Healy.  Healy has been a comparatively short time in prison.  I do not think that he has been in prison a year.</P>

That was not done in 1923 or 1924.  It was done later.  Does the Deputy think that that is a serious thing?  Is there moral guilt behind a man who fires at the Guards with intent?  Is Con Healy to be treated as a hero because he fires at Guards and serves a term of imprisonment?  Is not that what Deputy O'Kelly is doing?

For that reason the Ceann Comhairle has always endeavoured to keep the names of individual prisoners or others out of debate.  If Deputy O'Kelly mentions the name of a prisoner, and says that he ought to be released, the Minister must be allowed to give his reasons for not doing what he is asked to do.

Unauthorised men who carry arms in this country for the purpose of creating disturbance, men who carry arms and bombs for the purpose of destroying life or property are, according to him, not to be treated as criminals.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just explaining to Deputies opposite when I was interrupted that when Mr. Blythe wrote a certain class of article there was a certain political situation in this country.  The Irish people, or the people of this State, had not elected their own Government&mdash;a sovereign Government&mdash;to carry on the affairs of the country as directed by the people of the country. I say there are people in this country who are entitled to carry arms.  The people who are entitled to carry arms in this country are the people whose duty it is to preserve the freedom and liberty of this country&mdash;the National Army.  Those are the people who are entitled to carry arms.  I say it is a criminal thing&mdash;to use the Deputy's own phrase&mdash;for Deputy O'Kelly and for Deputy Brady and other Deputies to urge, as they are urging by their speeches here, another class of young men to take up arms and use those arms against the existing State.</P>

      <P>That is the only conclusion that any sane man could draw from the speech made by Deputy Brady or from the speech made by Deputy O'Kelly. Either those young men who have those weapons for the purpose of upsetting ordered conditions in this <Col N="1297" /> country are right or they are wrong. Deputies opposite say they are right. If they say they are wrong, then the only course for Deputies opposite is, instead of praising them, to get up and denounce them.  Deputies opposite will not get up and denounce them because they have not the moral courage to denounce them.  I should like to see Deputy O'Kelly screwing up his courage to the sticking point and denouncing the gunmen.  Good Lord, no.</P>

      <P>I should like to hear Deputy O'Kelly denouncing Con Healy and the others. Now, I will come on to something else which the Deputy said.  I think Deputy O'Kelly said one of the meanest things that have ever been said in this House.  I can stand a good deal, but I do think that this was very unfair.  There are men in the Civic Guard who have done tremendously brave acts.  These men have risked their lives on various occasions in order to save other lives.  The Deputy suggested that those men who got the Scott Medals did not get them for acts of courage, but got them because they had bullied people.  He said that it was not because those men had done deeds of courage that they were presented with medals by me on the only occasion on which I do present medals, but because they were gunmen. That is most unfair.</P>

      <P>The Deputy talked about the Guards being gun bullies and about their attacking persons like Mr. George Gilmore and others of that type.  He called the Guards gun-bullies and all that.  But quite unconsciously he gave the key to the whole of his speech in one wonderful phrase he used&mdash;&ldquo;People were anxious to fasten on other people a name that rightly belongs to the other side.&rdquo; That is it, of course.  The Deputy's sympathies are all with those persons who wish to go about with the gun and the bomb to take life and destroy property.  He thinks that the best way to help those is by attacking the Civic Guards.  We heard a lot about Gilmore.  When Mr. Gilmore was recently fined for assaulting the Guards, I did not hear any Deputy on the opposite side denounce Mr. Gilmore.  He was found guilty and fined for assaulting the Guards.  Nobody on the other side finds fault with Mr. Gilmore for assaulting the Guards.  On the other hand, when Mr. Gilmore brings a charge which is proven to be false against the Guards and the Guards are acquitted by the verdict of a jury, the Deputies on the opposite side, such is their malignity and partiality&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Those civil proceedings failed.  Yet nothing will satisfy Deputies opposite. The charge is still brought against the Guard.  Nothing will satisfy Deputies on the other side that the Guards are innocent, and yet they suggest that they themselves should be taken seriously.</P>

    <P>I will come down to the specific charges which were made here by Deputy Allen and Deputy Kennedy. As far as some of the charges by Deputy Kennedy are concerned, they have been answered by Deputy Gorey.  As far as the charge of revolver shots being fired outside the house of Mrs. Parker is concerned, the Deputy said that the Guards had been there investigating that case. Of course, they would go there to investigate the case.  He asked how many people in Rathowen were entitled to carry revolvers.  How on earth could I tell him?  I never heard a word about these charges until a moment ago.  I could not answer a question like that.  If I received notice I could deal with it. Deputy Allen said he saw Guards posting up notices.  He said that he had sent in notice to my Department <Col N="1301" /> of a question that he intended to ask.  Personally, it did not come under my observation.</P>

      <P>It is an explanation if you like.  The Minister has tried to make deductions from the heat I displayed some time ago, for which I apologise to the Chair.  He classed a friend of mine as a dangerous criminal.  I know that he is no such thing, and I think there is some excuse for becoming heated.  I think it will be within the recollection of most Deputies that there was a debate on this matter about two and a half years ago.  I remember charging the Government with never having allowed the Civil War to <Col N="1303" /> cease.  I told them that there were at that moment on the run certain people who were being hunted day and night.</P>

      <P>There is a matter that I wish to raise in this particular debate.  Deputy Boland got up because a friend of his was called a criminal.  He lost his temper and offended the dignity of this House, but a Deputy in this House has been called a murderer by another Deputy, and there has been no attempt on the part of that Deputy who called that name either to withdraw or apologise to the Chair.  I must raise that matter later on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>On that occasion I drew the attention of the House to the fact that there were certain men in this country who had never been allowed to return to their homes. This particular man, Con Healy, was one of these.  A certain charge was supposed to be hanging over him. He was hunted in his own district and the Guards or alleged Guards, because I draw a very clear distinction between the uniformed Guards and these people, said that if they <Col N="1304" /> got him they would kill him.  They did not mean to catch him at all. Con Healy is a spirited man who fought all through the trouble.  He is a human being.  He was hounded down and undoubtedly he did carry a gun.  The proof that he was no criminal is that he was sheltered for two years by the people in his own district.  That certainly was a tribute to him.  I believe he did fire when these people came after him in the belief that he was going to be killed.  We are told that he is a dangerous criminal because he did that.  What I would like to draw the Minister's attention to is that the original charge for which he was supposed to be sought was never brought against him.  He was simply charged with having fired, after notice was conveyed to the people who had sheltered him that he was going to be killed.  I submit in these circumstances there is a case for investigating the position of Con Healy.  He did not fire to kill.  He did not hit anybody and I am sure he was glad he did not hit them.  I think it is a case that should be inquired into, and I do not see what the Cumann na nGaedheal Party hope to gain by trying to prove that I or any other member of this Party stand for murder in this country. Murder has been denounced here time after time by the Leader of our Party.  There is no man in this Party afraid to denounce murder and well the Minister knows it.  I would ask the Minister or any member of the Government Party what he hopes to gain by trying to prove that this Party stands for murder and assassination.  This man was caught and sentenced to ten years.  He has served about two years.  I think it is certainly a case for reopening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that this Dáil is about to adjourn for a very long period and that we may <Col N="1305" /> expect a Report from the Grain Commission in a short time I would like to get an assurance from the Minister that this House will be called together to consider that Report.  The Dáil is adjourning till November and by that time the harvest will have been sold for what can be got for it.  The Report of the Commission and the decision of this House upon it might very well affect the price that the farmers will get for their harvest and I think it is very important that the House should be called together when the Report is issued.</P>
      <P>I would also like an assurance from the Minister with regard to the decision of the De-rating Commission. I do not know how long more that is going to sit.  It has been sitting for a long period and we hope soon to get some results from it.  If the farming community have to enter into competition with their fellow-farmers across the Border who do not pay rates we do not know how long they will be able to exist. I think it is a very serious thing that this House should adjourn for five months without having the Reports from these Commissions before them and coming to some decision upon them.</P>
      <P>In view of the present precarious condition of the butter industry I think that is another matter on which some very definite decision should be come to by the Minister.  I think it is an outrage in a country like this that is depending practically altogether on the agricultural industry that the House should remain without sitting for five months when the farming industry is in this condition. We should have some definite idea as to when the Commissions are expected to conclude their sittings and get an assurance that the House will be called together to consider the Reports of the Commissions.</P>

I do so particularly <Col N="1306" /> for the reason that Deputy Corry would be in a position of bankruptcy if we had not de-rating within the next twelve months, because he gave promises to the ratepayers of Westmeath that if they elected Geoghegan and did not get de-rating within twelve months he would pay the rates himself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">

      <P>It is a fact that Deputy Corry offered to take me around in his car.  I would make a plea to the Minister that he would consider the position of Deputy Corry because he made a promise, I think in some cases in writing, that if we had not de-rating inside of twelve months he would pay the rates himself.  I wish the Minister would consider that aspect of the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Clery Mr. Clery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clery</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind, of all the unreasonable things that have been done in the past year, to adjourn the Dáil for a period of five months is the most unreasonable.  I can see no excuse whatever for the proposal to adjourn this Dáil for a period of five months.  Surely those of us who are most anxious for holidays should be satisfied with three months.  I do not see why even Deputy Gorey could not be satisfied with three months' holidays after the very few days on which we have met this year.  The Government were recently defeated by a vote in this House on a very important question, and they were defeated the other day by a very decisive majority in two counties out of the twenty-six comprising the Free State.  Immediately after that defeat, instead of settling down to work in an endeavour to make some amends to the people for what they have done <Col N="1307" /> they come here and propose to adjourn for five months.  I think that proposal will be received with very great disgust by Cumann na nGaedheal supporters throughout the country.  We have representing Mayo the Chairman of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  I cannot understand why he should want the Dáil to adjourn for five months without having dealt with any of the very many questions a discussion on which was promised by Ministers. What do they want five months' holidays for?  Is it to tour around Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, we have to realise that Cumann na nGaedheal Ministers are more interested in the affairs of other nations and in the affairs of the British Empire than in the affairs of the people of the Twenty-six Counties.  The worst point of all is that you find the Chairman of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, who comes from my own county, and the T.D.s who talk about representing farmers are in agreement with him, deciding now that we must have a holiday for five months after a very short session, having done practically nothing as far as the people are concerned. How they can defend that attitude I do not know.  Nobody objects to a holiday, but surely three months should be sufficient for any Deputy, if not too much.  In order to give our Ministers a chance of parading Europe as Ministers of the Free State&mdash;Ambassadors, mar dheadh&mdash;we must let them have a five months' holiday.  They want to settle the affairs of other nations abroad; while at home they have got their walking papers but will not take them decently.  If taking such a long holiday is merely to give the President time to recuperate, I say that we can get on without him.  We have got on for months without him, and why can we not get on now without him?  The De-rating Commission will carry on for a little while, and every other Commission will carry on the bluff for a little <Col N="1308" /> while and even the Cumann na nGaedheal T.D.s will carry on the bluff.  The Town Tenants Bill and the Fisheries Bill are now to be put aside for five months.  We are to have no opportunity of forcing the Minister to take some action.  The whole thing is disgraceful and I am ashamed of the Cumann na nGaedheal T.D.s, some of whom I had respect for, agreeing to this holiday for five months when three months would be quite sufficient.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the two points raised by Deputy Corry, I could not undertake, on the receipt of the Commission's report on graingrowing, to call the Dáil together. That matter is not at all similar to an investigation in connection with tariffs.  If a tariff were recommended the Dáil would be called together, because the legislation required would be perfectly simple legislation which could be drafted within a day or two.  If the Grain Commission reported in favour of action, a rather complicated type of legislation would be required, and there would be, in fact, no possibility of calling Deputies together, no matter how much desire for haste there would be; there would be no possibility of calling the Dáil together to deal with the matter within the period of the Recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The De-rating Commission is pushing ahead as rapidly as possible with its work.  I cannot tell when it will report, but in any case if there were to be legislation following that report the legislation would be complicated, and it would be extremely difficult to draft it.  In my opinion anything like de-rating would involve in this country a recasting of the entire system of local government, and would be much more complicated than they have in Great Britain.  With regard to the points raised by Deputy Clery, they are the usual thing that we have heard on many occasions from Opposition Deputies when the Dáil is about to adjourn for a lengthy period.  The Deputies who made protests are generally as anxious as <Col N="1309" /> anybody else that an adjournment should take place, but yet they have to make those statements.</P>
