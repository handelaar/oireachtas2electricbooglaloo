      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to make clear my main point of criticism on this Vote I would draw the attention of the House to two separate items, namely, sub-head B and sub-head G. Sub-head B devotes public money to the purpose of paying State prosecutors, and sub-head G provides payment for the defence of public officials.  Now, obviously, there is here a certain conflict of interest.  In the legal profession when there is a conflict of interest a lawyer is not allowed to take up a case from both sides.  No lawyer, except in a very peculiar kind of case where there is consent, is allowed to instruct counsel on two sides of a case.  The reasons for that are perfectly obvious.  Here we had cases where the Government was, upon the one hand, employing counsel to appear for the prosecution <Col N="332" /> of public officials, and on the other hand was also employing those who were to defend the public officials. This wrong system ceased to be merely an abstract question in the case of George Gilmore.  The old practice was different.  Formerly, the Crown would allow a person who was instigating the prosecution of a public official to employ his own solicitor and counsel, even though the State would have to pay the costs afterwards.  That is not the system now, and we have strong reasons for objecting to the present system being adopted, whereby, as in this case, the Government employ their own counsel and so on.  In the case of Mr. Gilmore, he employed in the court of first instance his own counsel, but when it came to the higher court it was the State took control of the whole case, and the final result of the case was in the opposite direction to the tendency there had been on the prima facie evidence.  The result was extremely unsatisfactory.  Evidence was given that certain members of the Guards had been instructed to arrest Mr. Gilmore every time they saw him.  The result of that action has been that Mr. Gilmore is still being persecuted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to follow that matter any further, for it does not arise on this particular Vote.  What does arise is the very wrong method adopted by the Department of appointing those who will act on behalf of persons taking such actions as George Gilmore had to take.  Under those circumstances it really leaves the general public with the impression that a man who takes action which develops into proceedings involving a prosecution has no chance of getting justice, because the person who is acting on his behalf is the person who is going to suffer most, not merely financially, but because it means a direct attack on the higher policy of Government.  This is not merely a question of serious principle, but a question which is going to arise frequently in the course of the next year, and the Government anticipate that, because whereas last year they estimated for only £200 being spent under this <Col N="333" /> particular sub-head of defence of officials for next year they have fixed the sum at £800.  Of course they are aware that proceedings are pending in several cases against them.  There were other cases of a civil nature where damages amounting to £245 were obtained before a jury.  I take it that the actual damages are not paid by the State but the law costs involved.  I do not know who pays the damages. I suppose the individuals are obliged to pay, and I do not know if the individuals are always a good mark. I think if the State is paying one it might as well pay the other at the same time.  In any case, from the Estimate it is anticipated that a much larger sum will be spent under this sub-head during the coming year.  In view of the issue that is going to be raised again and again I suggest to the Department in order that respect for the law may be established that they should act in as impartial a manner as they are capable of, and whoever is called into a case by a client in the first instance should be allowed to act throughout the case, or anybody whom the client chooses.  There is nothing revolutionary about that. In fact it is the other system that is revolutionary, and that system is not one which was in vogue in this country before under the Crown.  The present practice was not the practice according to English law, and it is not the practice in England today. I do not suggest that because it is English it is good, but certainly the old system is far better and smacked less of a tyranny than the present system.</P>
    <P>The only other criticism I would make with regard to this Vote applies to sub-head A, which refers to the draftsman.  There has been a certain amount of delay in this House in the matter of draftsmanship. Drafting facilities have not been given to various members of this House who wish to draft Bills, and the result is that severe criticism has been made of Bills introduced by individual members, and even by Parties. I suggest it would be wise <Col N="334" /> economy to spend a little more money and have a second principal draftsman. It is not conceivable that there is not at the Irish Bar another man of equal capacity and equal brains who would be able to pick up a skill of proper draftsmanship in a very short time equal to the skill which is possessed by the present draftsman. No one questions his skill or ability, but there is only one chief draftsman and every Bill must pass under his supervision.  As he is an extremely conscientious man he is unwilling to let anything pass that he has not supervised, and the result is that if he happens to be on a holiday legislation is held up.  At all times it is impossible for members of the House to have expert advice and assistance except by special permission of the draftsman.</P>
    <P>I would suggest, therefore, to the Minister that it would be far better, and would really be an economy of the time of the House, if Bills were ready sooner.  There is an amount of legislation pending, and there are short Bills which individual Deputies could introduce if they had the opportunity of getting the expert advice of the draftsman.  It is no use going to the ordinary counsel, no matter how skilled he is, because the Government adhere to the methods of the Parliamentary draftsman, and they wish their legislation to be uniform in technique, and although you may get very learned information upon the phraseology of a Bill, still it will have to be subject to severe criticism later on, and that, I submit, is a waste of time.  It would be far better to have a second draftsman, and in that way to facilitate Deputies in the work which to many of us gives most satisfaction, namely, constructive Parliamentary work apart from all political controversy.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will look into these two questions, but especially it is a matter of public policy that the greatest amount of independence should be left to those professional persons employed for the purpose of prosecuting public officials and that there should be the least amount of interference between <Col N="335" /> the client and the professional persons employed.  After all, when the State employs counsel in this way, naturally the person originating the action and the witnesses will not have the same confidence, will not speak with the same frankness; there will be a feeling that they are talking to the counsel for the defence rather than to the counsel for the prosecution.  This is an extremely serious matter.  If the Government would take up a proper line on this question, it would do a considerable amount to make the public feel that the Government are trying to act in an impartial manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that one of the sub-heads of this Vote is for the defence of public officials, and in that connection I should like to remind the House that when the nomination for the Minister for Justice was before us for approval I pointed out that certain illegalities which were then being committed against a certain section of the population on account of their political views, and which were subsequently condoned by a vote of this House, were not likely always to be confined to one political element in the community. I did not expect that the warning which I then gave would subsequently get such ample confirmation as has been afforded by a case recently before the courts.  In a case heard in the High Courts last Wednesday the facts were that two men had been arrested in Tralee, were kept in barracks for 48 hours without being brought before a peace commissioner, and eventually, when brought before a district justice, both were discharged.  The men naturally sought redress for the imprisonment to which they had been subjected and they accordingly took an action against the Chief Superintendent for false imprisonment.  The Circuit Court Judge, having heard the evidence, awarded damages in the case of one of the men against the Superintendent and dismissed the other case.  An appeal was taken on behalf of both parties to the suit. The Superintendent appealed to the <Col N="336" /> High Court against the damages awarded against him, the man who had been refused redress by the Circuit Court Judge likewise appealed. With what result?  Two Judges of the High Court decided that the Chief Superintendent in this matter had acted illegally, had acted in violation of the liberty of the subject, and dismissed the Superintendent's appeal in the one case, and granted the complainants' appeal in the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not an isolated case.  It happens to be a recent one.  We have had other instances of similar actions being brought against Civic Guards or against Superintendents, and in almost every case the officials of the State have been mulcted in damages by the Courts of the State.  I ask the Minister for Finance will part of the moneys to be voted under sub-head G go to defray the costs awarded against the Chief Superintendent in this matter?  As I said, the State cannot hope to confine its illegalities always to one section of the community.  If Republicans are to be subjected to unlawful attack and imprisonment, we may be quite certain that the instruments of the State in carrying out this vile policy &mdash;there is no other way in which it can be stigmatised&mdash;are not going to confine these illegalities always to the Republican element among us. Disorder breeds disorder and the ambit of disorder tends always to extend.  The position now is that, so far as I can see, Civic Guards, particularly the responsible officers seem to regard themselves in their respective districts as so many Turkish pashas, pashas of three tails&mdash;the absolute rulers and arbiters of the community&mdash;and that, I put it to the Dáil, is entirely due to the fact that the majority Party in this House have condoned and connived at illegal proceedings when such proceedings have been directed against one element of the State.  You cannot hope to wash your hands of responsibility. Men who are prepared to uphold the Minister for Justice in the action and the proceedings which he took in relation to certain Republican <Col N="337" /> prisoners are blameworthy and culpable so far as the proceedings of the Civic Guards and Superintendent towards these men in Tralee are concerned. We cannot have it both ways.  We have either to stand for even-handed administration of the law and an impartial preservation of the public peace so far as all elements of the community are concerned or else we have to make up our minds that henceforward we are not going to have law and order but anarchy in the country.  Because the moneys voted under sub-head G will be used to condone and indemnify the Chief Superintendent in Tralee against the consequences which will fall upon him for the illegal arrest and imprisonment of these men, I ask the House to reject this Vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the plea made here for an increase in the staff in the draftsman's office. It is I think a very undesirable state of affairs that there should be a large number of important measures, the urgency of which is admitted by all parties, which cannot be proceeded with because of the congestion in this particular office.  As the Minister for Finance is aware, the Minister for Industry and Commerce stated yesterday that certain Bills designed to give effect to recommendations submitted by the Food Prices Tribunal, by the Industrial Insurance Committee, by the Workmen's Compensation Committee and other bodies are fully prepared, as far as his office is concerned, but cannot be proceeded with because the arrangements in the draftsman's office do not permit of it.  I do not think it would be impossible to procure additional assistance for the chief draftsman which would enable the work of the office to be speeded up.  It is very unsatisfactory that abuses existing in the present social order, to which attention was drawn by tribunals and committees, in many cases over four years ago, still remain unrectified because of the inadequate staffing of this particular branch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="338" /> I also want to support the case made by Deputy Ruttledge and by Deputy Little for the alteration of the system of conducting public prosecutions. Deputy Ruttledge urged that there should be a number of recognised public prosecutors to whom would be given the work of conducting these prosecutions when they arise.  At present State briefs are given out to a number of different counsel, and I have no doubt whatever that that particular practice is being used, not altogether, but to some slight extent, for the purpose of political bribery.  Counsel who exercise political influence have been made adherents of the Government Party by the fact that they get occasional briefs from State solicitors. The danger that arises from such a state of affairs was very strongly emphasised by the Gilmore case, to which Deputy Little has made reference. As Deputies will remember, this individual took an action against certain members of the Civic Guard for assault.  The District Justice returned the members of the Civic Guard concerned for trial to the Circuit Court.  Counsel appointed by the State to conduct the prosecution, I am informed, did not examine the witnesses for the prosecution, did not cross-examine the witnesses for the defence, did not address the jury, even at the conclusion of the evidence, and consequently the members of the Civic Guard were acquitted.</P>
    <P>It may be a good thing, from the Government point of view, to have members of the Civic Guard acquitted of certain charges in that manner, but I cannot believe they, themselves, are of the opinion that by doing so they are going to increase public respect for the Force or public confidence in the manner in which justice is administered.</P>
    <P>The Estimate under sub-head G for the expenses of defending public officials for the coming year is four times the Estimate for last year.  Are we to take it that the Minister for Finance believes that officials of the Civic Guard and other public officials <Col N="339" /> are going to be brought into court and charged with illegal acts this year to an extent four times greater than last year?  Possibly, of course, the increased Estimate is required for the purpose of paying fines inflicted upon members of the Guards during last year.  Whether that is so or not I do not know, but I think when we have had a number of cases in court of members of the police having been convicted of illegal acts we ought to have a much clearer indication than given to us heretofore that the Government realise the gravity of the situation and intend to take steps to ensure that these things will not occur again.</P>
    <P>Deputy Little said that fines imposed upon members of the Civic Guard in this manner should be paid by the State.  I personally agree with that view.  The members of the Civic Guard concerned in each case defended themselves by saying that they were obeying the orders of their superior officers.  These superior officers in turn were obeying the instructions they received from the Minister for Justice, and he in turn was obeying the instructions he got from the Executive Council.  The responsibility for putting the Executive Council in power is on the electorate, and the electorate therefore should be compelled to foot the bill when the illegal acts of the Executive Council result in this additional charge being imposed.  I hope, however, that the increased bill, which the Minister anticipates will be submitted to the people this year, is not in consequence of any decision of the Executive Council to increase the illegal acts which are to be committed by officials under their control.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support my colleagues in their demands for some explanation of Government policy in this matter.  On Wednesday night last Deputy Brady raised a question of the detention of an individual who had already been detained three months in prison and was ultimately discharged and his <Col N="340" /> character vindicated.  It appears that in spite of the fact that the person involved was a man of the highest character in the district and was believed by his employer to be a trustworthy person and that there was nothing whatever locally to show that was a person of criminal tendencies, nevertheless the Civic Guard took it upon themselves to arrest him.  The Minister for Justice put it to us that the Civic Guard have a certain responsibility in making investigations in these matters, and very often have difficulties. It is, undoubtedly, very often hard for the officers charged with the preservation of the peace to make such investigations as they consider necessary without trespassing in some degree upon the liberty of the subject.  Nevertheless I think that the law must be upheld, and no matter how humble the individual concerned may be.  It is no consolation to him to find that at the end of the whole thing he is set at liberty.  But there is no recompense, and there cannot be any, for the slur which has been cast upon his character and the inconvenience or loss that he has been put to.  Therefore we take the matter seriously, and we say that an end should be put to that kind of thing.  Across the water there has been a big campaign on this matter, and it appears necessary at this stage to have definitely stated what the functions of police officers in the Free State are in this matter of the detention of prisoners.</P>

      <P>I suggest that it arises <Col N="341" /> in this way: If the rules governing actions of the Guards are of a very clear nature, this Department will be protected under that sub-head where it has to pay for cases against the officials.

      <P>It would have arisen on the Vote for the Gárda Síochána, and I think it was discussed on that; but this is merely a question whether there should be a sub-head in the Vote&mdash;sub-head G &mdash;for the defence of public officials. That sub-head does not involve the question of the payment of damages awarded against public officials; it is merely for the legal defence of these officials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling. I support Deputy MacEntee, and I would be very glad if the Minister would tell me what exactly is the policy in regard to this matter.  The question that Deputy Little raised is also one of importance.  In certain cases against public officials for wrongful detention, where the plaintiffs had the advantage of independent counsel, who were employed by them personally, they secured verdicts. In other cases&mdash;I know that it is not an argument&mdash;that the plaintiffs were not in the ordinary way supported by their counsel; I have no complaint to make of the counsel as such&mdash;I agree with Deputy Little that the policy of employing counsel who are ordinarily employed as State counsel in such <Col N="342" /> cases is not doing justice by the plaintiffs, that when a counsel and a solicitor are employed to defend a man they ought to continue the case, and that you ought to have a position in which a plaintiff is able to say, I think with some justice, that a case which had begun satisfactorily in the lower court was lost in the upper court by reason of the fact that the counsel that he himself would have selected was not allowed to plead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of points have been raised on this Estimate which perhaps were hardly proper to it.  The first point I will deal with is with reference to the draftsman's office.  It is true that there has been from time to time a certain delay in the introduction of Bills through congestion in the draftsman's office, but I am afraid that the employment of additional staff would not relieve that congestion to the extent that Deputies think, because there has always been a complaint from the draftsman's office that the difficulty of completing Bills was that Departments often had not thought out the instructions adequately before sending them down to the draftsman's office, and the congestion that does exist in that office enables the Attorney-General and the draftsman more readily to return instructions to Departments for further consideration prior to proceeding with the drafting.  If there were a larger staff I am afraid that we might have many more conferences between representatives of the staff and Departments, and that there would not be a very great amount of increased speed in the drafting of Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that there is a good case for having a draftsman available for private Deputies.  The only kind of Bill that can really be suitably handled by a private Deputy is a Bill of a very simple character in which, even if there are drafting errors, they can be quite easily amended in the House by Ministerial amendments.  The real difficulty about the production of Bills is not the actual drafting at all, and the <Col N="343" /> time is not taken up with the actual drafting; the time is required in the framing of full and adequate instructions, which reflect a full examination, an examination in which all points of view have, as far as possible, been taken into account.  It will easily be seen that a private Deputy cannot possibly have an examination conducted on which instructions for a Bill can properly be framed.  Just as in the case of Government Bills, it is practically impossible for a Department to frame adequate instructions.  Even when the Bill seems to concern that Department alone, it will generally be found that when the draft of instructions is circulated to other Departments, factors that are at first apparently quite remote from the purpose of the Bill have to be taken into account.  No single Department can really see the reactions of such a Bill&mdash;I am talking of a Bill of an important character, not of the simple one-clause type of amending Bill&mdash;and therefore I think that if a draftsman were provided for private Deputies, it would simply mean that the House would be congested with a mass of Bills which were not in a fit state to be brought before it. When one really examines it, I do not think there is anything in that plea.</P>
    <P>So far as the draftsman's office is concerned, there are a couple of assistants.  Recently one assistant draftsman was transferred for legal work to the Department of External Affairs, and his successor, of course, has not yet got into his stride.  There have been suggestions from time to time from Departments for the employment of additional staff in the draftsman's office, but personally I was never quite satisfied that that was absolutely necessary, or that from the employment of additional help there the output they were looking for would be obtained.  It may be that further help will ultimately be granted, but I am fairly satisfied that only a part of the cause of the delays arises through the comparatively small number of people available <Col N="344" /> for drafting, and that as a matter of fact if a Department could fully make up its mind as to what exactly it wants before it sends down instructions the present staff would be able to do the work.  Unfortunately, very often when a Department sees a draft which is produced as a result of its instructions it finds that other things have to be added and that changes have to be made.</P>
    <P>With regard to having prosecutors chosen from a panel instead of having one or two men in charge of the work of prosecuting, from a financial point of view I do not think there is anything in it.  I do not know, for instance, that if Deputy Ruttledge sent all his briefs to one junior counsel and one senior counsel he would find that he gets the work done for his clients at a cut rate.  The fee would be marked on every brief, and I do not think it would make any difference in the cost whether the briefs go to one barrister or another.  On the whole I do not think it is a healthy position to have, as it were, the whole Bar in a position to defend prisoners and to have one or two members of the Bar with experience in prosecuting. I think it would be healthier to have prosecuting regarded as much the normal duty that would fall to barristers as defending prisoners.</P>
    <P>The account in sub-head D is very largely by way of refunds to county councils for witnesses' expenses and matters of that kind.</P>
    <P>With regard to the defence of public officials, we have to take into account the fact that there is a minority, whether it is small or large, that does not accept the existing constitutional position, that there is a minority, whether small or large, that challenges the existence of the State, and that there is a tendency to attack the police by way of litigation which we would have no experience of but for the existence of that minority.  If there were no attack on the State, and if there were no special tendency to try to devise prosecutions simply for the purpose <Col N="345" /> of hampering and, if possible, intimidating the police, we might have a different attitude in regard to the defence of public officials from what we have at the present time.  But we feel that where, say, a Civic Guard acts bona fide and without malice he should not be perhaps mulcted in a considerable sum because of some mere technical error, and we do, therefore, defend Civic Guards in cases in which there was no impropriety of conduct on their part, even although the Civic Guards might be found to have been guilty of some technical error.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if it is the judge trying the case or the Minister for Justice who is to decide whether impropriety has been committed or not?  It seems to us that the question is generally settled in advance by the Minister.</P>

      <P>Very often the judge would not feel called upon to pronounce upon any point other than the exact point before him&mdash;that is, the strict legality or otherwise of some particular act.  We would have to take into account whether a policeman acted bona fide and without malice, simply for the purpose of discharging his duty in the prevention of crime and the preservation of peace and order.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course there are illegalities which are not crimes. That is something in the nature of the obvious.  Reference was made to a case which was in the courts the other day.  I would not be too sure about that case; I have no official information about it whatever; but I think that that appeal was brought for the purpose of having the law on the matter definitely determined.  I have the impression that there was a certain view of the law upon which the Civic Guards acted, and that that has been definitely challenged, That is, with regard to the right of detention.  An appeal was brought to the High Court on behalf of the superintendent for the purpose of <Col N="346" /> having the law definitely determined. If that is so, then that is undoubtedly a case in which it would be proper to pay the expenses of the superintendent.  If it is definitely decided that the decision of the High Court settles the matter, and if there is to be no appeal to the Supreme Court, then the law having been determined, the police will officially act in accordance with the law as so definitely determined, unless it should be altered at some future date.  It does not follow when you are dealing with cases that have a political character that the decision of the court disposes of every aspect of the matter.  There were certain cases recently in Dublin where damages were awarded against members of the police, and where, on the evidence before the court, they were properly awarded against the police, but the Government was not in a position to bring into court witnesses who might have been brought in if they had been ordinary cases without any political character.  That is, when there is, whether it is small or large, a criminal revolutionary conspiracy in existence, it is not possible for the State to put into the witness-box all the people who could give evidence in regard to that conspiracy, or, to put it quite bluntly, if there is anybody who gives special information about such a conspiracy it would in certain cases be extremely dangerous to that man to put him into the witness-box.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know there have been cases where people in very ordinary small prosecutions have gone into the witness-box and testified and have afterwards been attacked.  The position, therefore, is that while it could not be proved in a court for these reasons that the police had sufficient grounds for the action they took, the Government is quite satisfied that they had, in fact, sufficient grounds. That is, those who gave instructions to the police, or those who gave instructions to the actual officers who instructed the individual policeman, had information and had evidence which, if it could have been brought <Col N="347" /> into court, or if the people available to give it could be brought into court, would have enabled the police who were sued, and against whom damages were awarded, to have justified their actions in their entirety. But as long as you have men conspiring to use violence against the State there are going to be difficulties of that kind, difficulties both for the actual carrying out of their duties by the police and difficulties for those who instruct them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister on that point whether he does not consider that the State should appear to be, and should be, as impartial as possible in these actions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to say that where you are dealing with a case such as that of Mr. Gilmore, I certainly believe that the position is different in his case, and in regard to any prosecution brought by him, from a prosecution brought by an ordinary citizen who would allege that a Civic Guard had made some attack on him.  I am quite clear that I would not facilitate Mr. Gilmore, or anybody who was pursuing his particular line, in using the court as a platform for a particular style of propaganda.  I believe that when a man has been returned for trial it is the duty of the State to see that he is impartially prosecuted.  I was not in court and I do not know the details of this trial to which the Deputy refers, but I have no doubt that the counsel who were employed in that case carried out the prosecution in a proper manner, that they asked all the questions which it was proper for a prosecutor to ask, and took all the steps which it was right for men charged with the responsibility with which they were charged, to take, in order to enable the court to come to a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that the dissatisfaction with the counsel who were prosecuting in that case was not due to any failure on their part to do their full duty in the matter, but simply because they would not indulge in the propagandist tirades which some people would have liked.  I do not <Col N="348" /> know who the counsel were, but I am satisfied that the attack which has been made on them, without mentioning their names, is an unjustifiable attack, and I am satisfied that any members of the Bar who accepted briefs to act in this matter acted in good faith and did their duty fully and fairly.  I am quite satisfied that the dissatisfaction with them is only an illustration of the protests against not allowing somebody who may have been chosen by Mr. Gilmore to appear, and simply reflects disappointment that the trial was conducted purely as a prosecution and not as a sort of propagandist stunt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of personal explanation, I wish to say that the matter I tried to emphasise entirely was that the State places itself in an impossible position when it does not allow the plaintiff in a case like that to choose his own counsel.  No matter what happens afterwards, whether the counsel employed does his best or not, the position is a wrong one; it is fundamentally a wrong position, as fundamentally wrong as if a solicitor in a case sent instructions to the counsel on conflicting sides and acts on both sides himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I know nothing about the case; I did not read the report of it with any great care.  I paid no special attention to it.  I am perfectly satisfied that the counsel who accepted the brief to carry out the prosecution carried it out properly and without any desire to save or to prevent the conviction of those whom they were prosecuting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Little said that something <Col N="349" /> or another puts the State in an impossible position.  That is practically what I have been saying.  Where you have a secret conspiracy for overturning the State by violence you do create, in certain respects, an impossible position, and you cannot deal with cases arising out of such a conspiracy as you would deal with ordinary criminal offences by individuals against their neighbours or against society generally.  You must take care that you are not going to allow the public money to be used, not to right any wrong and not to punish somebody who committed an offence, but simply to create propaganda for those who are attacking the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state whether, when circulars are issued, any instructions are given to the Gárdaí afterwards with a view to avoiding the committing of offences which may involve the State in further damages and expenses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that, following any prosecution in which a point of law has to be determined one way or another, any circulars are sent out.  There may be, but in any case the matters come to the knowledge of the Civic Guards, and they will be acted upon by them.  A Civic Guard is not going to put himself in the position of appearing before the court if it has been made clear that the law is against him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to cases such as the Dublin cases, in which damages were awarded in civil actions, the Deputy <Col N="350" /> will remember that the process of harrying those who were suspected with good reason of being engaged in a conspiracy against the State began at a time when an attack was made on jurors and witnesses.  It was preventive harrying and it has been successful.  Possibly it will not be necessary to continue it to the extent to which it has been carried on.  But, if there should be information that would indicate that it is necessary, then everything that can be done within the law in that respect will be done and, if sufficient cannot be done within the law to prevent a recurrence of attacks on jurors and witnesses, then suitable amendments will be brought into the law.  Policemen will not be instructed to do anything that is illegal.  They will not even be instructed to do something which, though it may be legal, would result in their finding themselves in court without the possibility of proving that what they did was, in fact, legal and correct.  That was the position in which the men in the civil actions found themselves in Dublin.  What they did was perfectly correct, but they were not in a position to prove it because they were dealing with a criminal conspiracy.  We would not ordinarily put a policeman in that position.  We would not ask him to do something which, although it was perfectly correct, might lead to his appearing as having done something illegal.  It is a matter of general policy.  It is not a matter, in that particular case, of rigid principle.  I and everybody must see that every defeat of those people who are inclined to use violence weakens them and that the mere lapse of time tends very quickly to reduce the possibility of a recurrence of serious violence.</P>

      <P>We have had so much discussion on education recently it is unnecessary to say much on this Vote.  Universities, of course, are autonomous.  That is as it should be, I presume, although I have heard ideas expressed by University men themselves that they wished that in certain cases there were powers to remove from a Professorial Chair anyone who, for one reason or another, is not fit to occupy it. However, I am not for a moment saying that Universities should not be autonomous.  It is rather invidious to refer to any professor in these Universities, but we have heard the President of the Executive Council state that the policy of the Government is frankly protectionist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a Chair of Economics in the National University which is frankly free trade.  I do not know if the Dáil has control over that, but it is a matter to which, I presume, it is no harm to refer here.  As I say, that Chair is frankly free trade, and such economic theories, of course, would naturally be spread to captains of industry and leaders of political life throughout the country after a while.  We have also references here to the orientation of education in secondary schools.  The same might be said of the universities. Oliver Wendell Holmes said on one occasion that it took three generations away from the soil to make a gentleman.  That idea, I am afraid, prevails to a certain extent in both of our universities, so that the Vote for dairying and agricultural <Col N="354" /> science, as well as the money given to Cork by way of special grant, are to be commended for that reason.  We should like to see the idea abroad that it is as dignified to be a farmer as to be a professional man.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree.  We would like to see the best brains of this country go into industry and agriculture and to spread the idea that the duffer of the family should not be left on the farm.  We should put our best brains into farming, which is our chief industry.  The universities can do something in that respect.  I would like if we were told something as to what has been done in Galway College for the Gaelicisation of education there since a grant of £28,000 was made last year.  Perhaps the period may be too short to show results.  I do not know if Deputy Professor Tierney would agree with me in that, but he spoke of subjects which you could not teach through the medium of Irish. I noticed recently in the Press that a professor had been appointed in Cork to teach mathematics through the medium of Irish.  Unless higher education can be imparted through the medium of Irish I do not see much future for the language.  It must be put on a level with English, not merely in lip service in the Dáil and elsewhere, but in actual fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Universities are inclined to hide their light under a bushel in many respects so that very often you do not know exactly what they are doing.  You can, of course, get information by writing to registrars and by looking up certain books, but the public would like to know what universities are doing in the way of research and culture generally.  If such information were collated for the benefit of the public it would be a good thing.  Trinity College does not come under this Vote.  I believe that it raised the standard of Irish in modern language groups in recent years.  You can get information of that kind by careful inquiry, but these are things which the public should know.  While it may not be <Col N="355" /> the Minister's duty, a hint to the universities may not be amiss that they should let us know what they are doing in the various Faculties.</P>

I merely desire to make a remark about Deputy Fahy's opening words.  I agree entirely that a university should be autonomous and I think that Deputy Fahy gave us the strongest evidence of the wisdom and importance of that when he proceeded to criticise the teaching of some particular professor.  I think it would be lamentable if anything were said here to prevent any professor teaching any subject according to his lights.  Whether it is from one angle or another, provided he gives instruction to the best of his lights and ability, it would be a sad day when political influence was brought to bear in this House to coerce him in his teaching.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing that is to be commended in this Vote &mdash;the sum of money set apart for the Agricultural Science College in Cork.  I would like to see, if it were possible, another agricultural science college in this country, recognising as I do the value of that industry to the country.  I think that Deputy Fahy struck a note here to-day which should have a very useful moral.  Agriculture has been looked upon as the Cinderella of industry in this country for many years, but I am glad to learn that there is some sign of an awakening interest and pride in the profession of agriculture. What Ford's industry has done in Cork&mdash;namely, to kill a lot of the shoneenism, which made a lot <Col N="356" /> of people ashamed to be seen with black hands and black faces&mdash;I hope the grants for agricultural science will do for the agriculturist in this country, namely, to make him proud of his profession of agriculture and proud of his labour.</P>
      <P>I do not think that sufficient thought has been given to all that is taken out of the land in this country. The Church, the Law and Medicine are mainly recruited from the agricultural community.  It takes so many hundred pounds to make a man a lawyer, so many hundred pounds to make him a doctor, so many hundred pounds to make him a priest or a parson, and all that money comes out of the land.  The remarkable thing about it is that whilst this five or six hundred pounds is set aside to educate a lawyer, a priest or parson, and the same for a doctor&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, he is not worth it.  We find that the practice in this country is, that having set apart all that money to educate one of the sons for one or other of the professions, the attitude in relation to the son who is going to succeed his father in possession of the farm is: &ldquo;Johnny will not want any education; he is going to get the farm&rdquo;&mdash;all the time forgetting that the science of agriculture is as great a science as that practised by either the lawyer or the doctor.  I am not going to say anything about the priest or the parson lest I might get these people on my shoulders, but I do think it is time that we in this country should wake up to a full sense of the realities and that we should do more for agriculture in the way of promoting agricultural science.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had a lot of clamour in this country&mdash;I do not want to say much in that vein, because it might be said that I was speaking to the people of Longford-Westmeath, and not to the Dáil here&mdash;about things that do not really matter.  Here we have something concrete which is for the good of the country.  Whatever <Col N="357" /> may be said about the Minister for Agriculture, he has established a lasting monument to his name in establishing an Agricultural Science College in Cork.  That is one thing that will be remembered for him perhaps when the achievements of other people in the Dáil will be forgotten. I do hope that the headline he has set in that direction, and the fillip he has given to agriculture, in the way of agricultural science, will be followed in other parts of the country.</P>

      <P>I quite agree with Deputy Anthony that, viewed as a commercial investment, the £1,500 spent in educating a doctor is badly spent, especially if he selects his own country to live in.  I do not know any sum of money or so much hard work that receives such a bad return.</P>

      <P>I believe we have too many doctors qualifying.  I do not say that from any trade union motives.  I do not want to regulate the output, but 15 per cent. of the doctors qualifying in Ireland would make up the wear and tear of the profession in this country.  The great majority, say 90 or 85 per cent., have to go to English-speaking countries to make their living, and certainly if they are animated by the idea of making a decent profit they will leave Ireland altogether.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fahy suggests that in the Universities more use should be made of Irish as a medium for teaching other subjects.  Let us take medicine as an instance.  Apart from there being no scientific terminology in Irish, the doctor who receives his scientific education through the medium of Irish has to go for a living either to the front or the rear. If he goes to England or to America he will be under the handicap that he has been taught through the medium of Irish.  Already there is a prejudice against Irish doctors owing to the mistaken idea in England that they are being taught their medical subjects at present through the medium of Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the suggestion that it <Col N="358" /> would be advisable, especially where county scholarships are concerned, that the scholarships should be carmarked for some subjects and some degrees that would be of benefit to the country.  I do not think that the expenditure on many of the scholarships can be justified.  I am informed that the students who get those scholarships frequently go through their university career on the ordinary pass examination.  That is an abuse of public money, because if public money is to be expended on university education it should be to tap the higher order of intellect and it is not fair to the country that the money should be expended simply in the way of giving a man a livelihood with the ordinary pass.</P>
    <P>I think when students take up agriculture as a pursuit, if they limited all their time to the Munster Institute or to the Albert College, it would be much better than going through the university courses and taking out a university diploma. They would have a practical knowledge if they confined themselves to the Albert College or to the Munster College and that would be very much better than a diploma.  Students who get diplomas for public posts or for the Civil Service are very indifferently paid, and there is no great inducement for young men to take up agriculture as a career.  My idea is that the farm is the best place to give a student that training and not the university.  If students were confined to the constituent colleges they would be better employed there than in reading for a degree at the university, simply by doing the practical work.  If the scholarships in agriculture were given to the constituent colleges of the university they would be much better expended.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is here as well as the Minister for Education, because I think if there is one side on which University activity requires to be related more closely to the needs of the nation it is upon the side of industry and commerce. After all, it has been said, and I think everyone agrees with it <Col N="359" /> now, that it is no use in carrying all one's eggs in one basket.  While agriculture has been highly developed in this country and a great deal done for it, as has been pointed out by Deputy Anthony, somehow or other we want to find the missing link between the product of the University and the ultimate use of that product.  The whole system is distorted.  There is a lack&mdash;I will not press it too far&mdash;of the principle that education should be aimed at developing the individual for the needs of the nation.  Certainly it should be related to the needs of the nation.  It is not so done at present. As Deputy Dr. Hennessy has pointed out, 15 per cent. of the doctors that leave the University from year to year are required in the country and the rest are for export, so it may be said as a criticism of our education system that it is largely for the purposes of export.  That applies not only to our doctors, but also to a good many of our scientists and our engineers.  Some means should be found, and only the State can find it, of influencing the whole of education so that the money spent by the State upon education will be for the purpose of developing the prosperity and the strength of the State not merely in material ways, but otherwise. Agriculture is well dealt with, but what seems to be lacking is some check upon the number of people who are allowed to go for some of the professions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other countries there is a certain check upon that, because it does not do to flood a profession.  It is bad for the profession.  We have had the example in the old days&mdash;I think some slight change has been made&mdash; of the number of barristers in the country, with the result that a considerable number of them had extremely little to do.  There was no work for them to do.  There should be some check upon the total, and also some connecting link, so that the younger brains should be educated for the purpose of being exploited for new industries in the country.  I do not think the task is impossible. <Col N="360" /> I hope the Minister for Education and the Minister for Industry and Commerce will be able to produce, in due time, some sort of scheme by which we will be able to say the best brains of this country are going to go into the reproductive industries in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not follow the logic of Deputy Fahy's argument, because he started off with the platitude that the universities were autonomous, and after that sapient remark, and that that was the way it should be, he then went on to say that we had in one of the colleges of the University a frankly free trade professor of economics.  It is hard to make out whether he was pleading against an autonomous university having control over professorial ideas or marking that as one of the evil results following from the autonomous situation.  If we take it that people are to be judged on their views, and that those views are to be related to the political views of the particular party that is in governmental control at the moment, we are going to have the peculiar situation in the whole university system of professors being dismissed as new parties come into power.  I wonder what change, for instance, would be made in the professorship of ethics if a certain party came into power.  I certainly think we would have a great many people who might be appointed to the Chair of Metaphysics, and whether their views would go down with any sort of solemnity through university halls, when they were announced, I do not know.  The most astonished man tomorrow in this country will be the present professor for political economy in University College, Dublin, when he hears that he has been described as a frankly free trade professor.  I can imagine nobody more astonished than he is going to be.  I think, unfortunately, that Deputy Fahy is not too well acquainted with the university system and was speaking without an appreciation of the true facts, but we will leave these people to answer for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="361" /> Deputy Fahy is very keen on the University advertising its work in order that it should be known.  I wonder had he anything in his mind, any special point on which he knew work was being done in the University to which he regretted there was not more publicity being given. There is a tremendous amount of research of a scholarly type being done up and down through the country in the different universities and it is nearly all advertised but it is done in the proper way.  Scientific journals contain records of everything that is done.  Medical journals contain records of everything that is being done in that line.  On the other subjects certain records are being kept as a rule.  As far as the National University is concerned a simple request to the Registrar in Merrion Square would bring a list of theses that have been published from time to time on work that has been done in a variety of ways.  I do not think there is any necessity to go further into that point.  I think the Deputy will find that he can get all he wants if he makes application for them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Little thinks we should develop the individual for the needs of the nation or in the interests of the nation.  I was wondering was that just the ordinary platitude. The Deputy goes on to state that the Minister for Education and myself are to draft a plan which will put a check on the numbers that are going into the different professions.  For instance he stated that we have too many doctors, that they were mainly for export and that our scientists and engineers were mainly for export. He might have added that a considerable number of the products of one of the affiliated colleges of the National University on the clerical side were largely for export, the invisible return for which we certainly do not get counting in our adverse trade balance.  But what are we to do to put a check to that?  Does he mean some sort of licensing system akin to the system that used to be said to be in this city with regard to plasterers, that you could never become a plasterer if you were not the <Col N="362" /> son of a plasterer?  Hereafter people may only become solicitors if their fathers have been solicitors; the same for doctors and the same for barristers. You will get into a really rigid system.  There is a fairly good check at the moment on students, the check being the prospects of the profession they are taking.  Remember the situation has altered completely with regard to engineering.  There has hardly been an engineer qualified in any of the universities in the last three or four years who has not found work in this country and not merely those who have just qualified but a considerable number of engineering men who have gone abroad have been brought back.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of permanent employment.  Permanent employment has been found for most of the engineers who have come out in the last two or three years.  There is a certain small number of people who are engaged on the civil side of the Shannon works overbalancing the vast number of people getting employment on the electrical and mechanical side of that particular scheme, sufficient to absorb most of the people who have been there. Similarly with regard to the younger scientist.  There is a better appreciation of the value of the scientific man, the man with the Science Degree as an aid to industry, and industrial concerns in the country are beginning to find it to their advantage to get help from men who are trained scientifically.  They are coming more and more into use, but there is still an export of some of those people.  If these people are not going to be let follow their own natural bent and become doctors, scientists and clergymen what are we going to do with them?  Deputy Little wants them to be put into reproductive industries.</P>

    <P>This particular office is really carrying on an expiring service.  As land purchase proceeds the quit rents are being redeemed, and as they have to be redeemed under the Land Act the main work of the staff of the Quit Rent Office at present is dealing with the material that comes from the Land Commission to-day in connection with the redemption of quit rents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has described this office as an office which is carrying on an expiring service and therefore an expiring department.  Nevertheless, it is one of those extraordinary organisms which seem to grow greedier in their old age, because though the Department is dying and the service is expiring, nevertheless the cost of it is increasing.  In the last year, 1929-30, it was £4,080.  This year it is £4,146, so after all, apparently, the Department is not so near the solution as the Minister would suggest.  The Minister stated that the principal purpose of this office was the redemption of quit rents.  I would like to know if it does any other work.  I am particularly interested in that connection, because on one occasion I had the hardihood, in order that I might be able to deal with the Estimate, to address a letter to the head of this Department asking him what this Department did, and he replied to me that he was not allowed to tell me.  I wonder would the Minister be good enough to tell the Dáil what the Department does? Apart altogether from any function it may have in relation to quit rents, has it any other function?  It might be well that the mysterious activities of the Department should be cleared up.  Year after year it has appeared on the Estimates, and sums of money have been voted.  I have been looking up the debates back to 1923 and <Col N="365" /> have not been able to discover anything that would cast a light upon the activities of the Department.  I think before the Dáil passes the Estimate we should have from the Minister some explanation as to the purpose for which this money has been spent.</P>

I think they have some small duties in connection with foreshore rights, but the real work of the quit rent office is what may be called Land Commission work.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The small variation this year is due first to the fact that the grant for the Royal Irish Academy is down by £200.  There was an addition of £200 in that particular amount last year for the purpose of paying part of the expenses of the visit of Professor Thurneysem.  Then there is an increase in the grant to the Irish Folklore Institute.  The Irish Folklore Institute has been established for the purpose of having carried on in a more regular and systematic way the work of collecting, recording and publishing Irish folklore. That particular work is work that is urgent in this sense, that anything which is not done within the next <Col N="367" /> few years will be impossible to do. Considerable collections had been made by individuals and by bodies like the Gaelic League, but these were lost or destroyed between 1920 and 1921, and then nothing serious was done until 1927, when the Folklore Society of Ireland, as it was called, was established.  It has had collected a considerable quantity of folklore, parts of which have been printed in the Society's journal.  It is necessary that there should be some more permanent type of body which would be able actually to house the collections, and not merely issue a journal, but issue quantities of folklore in annual or quarterly volumes, as the case might be, a body which would be able to have these collections properly edited with commentaries. The Folklore Institute will be controlled by a council of several members, of whom three will be appointed by the Irish Studies Committee of the Royal Irish Academy, with three members of the Folklore Society, which has a considerable membership of seven or eight hundred, and another member appointed by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know from the Minister, arising out of the grants given to the society mentioned under sub-head A, what particular service this society renders in return for this grant.  Why does the Minister feel it incumbent upon him and the Government to recommend this grant to the Dáil? We all remember that a little over a year ago this society took a very partisan attitude in regard to a legislative proposal then before this House, and in the course of the discussion I gathered that it was not representative at all of the whole body of the solicitors' profession in the country.  I gather that a considerable number of practising solicitors are not members of the society, and for that reason, since it obviously only represents some members of the profession, it does not command the general confidence and adherence of the whole body of the solicitors' profession, it is a question <Col N="368" /> whether it is a fit subject for a grant like this.  Under sub-head B the grant to the National Theatre Society, Ltd., is presumably a grant-in-aid to the expenses of the Abbey Theatre.  I note that, apart from that particular enterprise, there is another theatre which has been established in Dublin recently, and which from the point of view of dramatic art is doing work of a very substantial and praiseworthy nature. It would seem to me that possibly there might be an allocation of the total amount of this grant as between these two bodies.</P>
      <P>There is a feeling in certain circles in Dublin that the Abbey has been getting rather into a rut, and that unless one happens to belong to a certain clique or element there is very little chance of one's plays being accepted.  I do not say that is my opinion, but it is the sort of feeling that prevails amongst a good many of the play-going community in Dublin.  On the other hand, there is a feeling that the Gate Theatre has broken new ground, and has done a good deal to make those who take an interest in the drama in Dublin aware of the general trend of dramatic development elsewhere. For that reason, possibly, the Minister might consider&mdash;I cannot, in view of the general financial position of the country, make a plea for an increased grant under this subhead&mdash;whether the new body to which I have referred should not receive some part of the assistance which the State gives towards the development of the drama as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to sub-head D&mdash;Research Grants to Students&mdash;I would be glad to know from the Minister whether the full amount voted under that sub-head was utilised during the year 1929-30.  I ask the question simply for the purpose of getting information. I do not want to make any criticism with regard to the amount.  Under sub-head E&mdash; Salaries, Wages and Allowances in connection with the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, and Estate Duty Appeals under the Finance (1909-10) Act, <Col N="369" /> 1910&mdash;I notice that a salary of £1,500, inclusive, is provided for the referee.  I would like to know how many appeals were taken to that officer under the 1910 and 1919 Acts, and whether in that connection any fees are chargeable to the applicants. I would also like to know whether there is any prospect of getting an appropriation-in-aid in respect of that particular service.  It would seem to me, in the case of appeals going before the referee, that those carrying the appeals and losing them should at least bear some part of the expense which the State incurs in the hearing of the appeals. I would be glad to have some information from the Minister as to the number of appeals carried to this particular officer in respect of the Finance Act of 1909 and the Acquisition of Land Act, 1919, and, if so, what has been the result of the appeals.  It may be that the Minister is not in a position to give me the information now, but it seems to me, in connection with a lot of these Acts which have been taken over from the British, as well as in connection with a lot of the services carried on under the old regime and taken over, it is very questionable whether the State or the taxpayers are getting value for the money that is expended on them.  For that reason I would like if, in connection with this particular sub-head, the Minister would give me some more detailed information than is to be found in the Estimates.</P>

      <P>I would like to have some information from the Minister with regard to the grant of £1,000 which, under sub-head C, it is proposed to give as a grant-in-aid towards the expenses of the Royal Zoological Society of Ireland. In view of the fact that the members of this House, and particularly of the other House, have become so humanitarian, I do not think that the Dáil should be asked to vote this money for the purpose of keeping the wild animals confined to the narrow limits of their present dominion.  I think they should be <Col N="370" /> sent back to their native regions. I do not think money should be spent on a purpose like this.</P>

There are no details given in connection with this grant-in-aid, but I suppose part of it would be applied to cover the salary of one permanent guide.  I suggest&mdash; I can only speak from what experts say&mdash;that there appears to be a great danger of the remnants of folklore in the country still being lost. As the Minister has said these remnants of folklore will require to be captured within this generation. Folklore is carried on through ordinary popular tradition and through the medium of the Irish language, and it is extremely important that it should be collected at once.  If the Institute is going to pay any attention at all to this work then it ought to be done properly and even if a few hundred pounds more had to be given for that purpose I suggest it would be a wise economy to vote that extra sum, and get all the material that is available collected as rapidly as possible.  No one is going to devote serious attention to work for which they are not receiving a living wage. Work of this kind calls for the exercise of a certain amount of critical skill.  A certain amount of training and capacity is required to do this work properly.  I suggest that the Vote be increased by at least a few hundred pounds more.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee asked about the grant for the Incorporated Law Society.  The grant is by way of assisting the Society to meet the expenses in carrying out its disciplinary duties, which were imposed by the Solicitors (Ireland) Act, 1898.  The amount which is voted is roughly about two-thirds of the expenses incurred by the Society in carrying out these duties.  The <Col N="371" /> Society is, as the Deputy has stated, a voluntary body, to which solicitors may or may not belong, as they choose.  Nevertheless, this voluntary body is charged with the responsibility of keeping the register, and the responsibility for taking certain action where there has been misbehaviour on the part of a solicitor, and which may require his removal from the roll of the Society.  Therefore, the Society is carrying out duties which are useful, not only to its own members, but are of value to the public.  It is carrying out duties which are for the protection of the public, and consequently there seems to be a case for continuing the grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to the grant to the National Theatre Society, there is this difference between the Abbey Theatre and the Gate Theatre, that the Abbey Theatre is precluded from playing modern English drama.  It can only produce plays by Irish authors, or plays which, I think, were written before the year 1800 in English, and plays which are translated from the works of European authors.  There is a considerable number of plays which, under its patent, the Abbey Theatre is not entitled to perform.  The Gate Theatre has the choice of any play that it chooses.  The object of those who have established the Gate Theatre is to give the public of Dublin the opportunity of seeing plays they otherwise would not see, and seeing them produced in a highly capable and artistic manner.  It has no special responsibility for the encouragement of drama relating to Ireland. I do not say that the Gate Theatre will not provide a stimulus for writers.  I think it is most likely it will.  I also think it cannot be denied that the directors of the Abbey Theatre have in recent years made a few unfortunate mistakes in regard to the selection of plays submitted, and which well merited production. They were refused production, but I do not know that any institution which has been in existence for a considerable time will not make some errors, and I would not be inclined to take the grant, or any part <Col N="372" /> of it, from the Abbey Theatre, because, in my view, plays were rejected which ought to have been accepted.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the work of the Gate Theatre will be good for the Abbey Theatre.  Undoubtedly it is a fact that the work of the Abbey Theatre has made it possible for an institution like the Gate Theatre to be established, because without it there would not have been the actors or an interest in acting.  For instance, a few years ago it enabled the Drama League, from which in a sense the Gate Theatre arose, to be carried on.  I think a lesser sum than £1,000 would not be of very much assistance to an institution such as the Abbey Theatre.  My own personal view would be against giving any additional money for the encouragement of drama in English.  If any additional money is to be provided at any future time for the encouragement of the writing or production of plays I think it ought to be given for the writing and production of plays in Irish.</P>
    <P>With regard to the research grant, the total amount of the grant under the sub-head last year was allocated, but certain students may have found employment and not earned the full grant.  I cannot at the moment tell the Deputy whether the full amount allocated was expended, but if it was not expended it would be due to some of the students having ceased carrying on research work and having entered into some employment. With regard to the final sub-head to which Deputy MacEntee referred, if the Deputy will address a Parliamentary question to me with regard to the number of cases heard I would deal with the matter.  This much I will say, that the work carried out by this official is of a judicial nature, especially in cases where big sums may be involved, and it is not work one could have done very cheaply.  Deputy Doyle asked a question which was not inappropriate in regard to the Zoological Society.  I think the people here are not as bad yet as the people in <Col N="373" /> Great Britain, where owing to the operations of the Society for the prevention of Cruelty to Animals it has become almost impossible to feed the animals in the Zoo as they ought to be fed lest the public should be shocked.  Here at any rate the animals are not likely to die from unsuitable feeding as the result of the intervention of people imbued with an excess of humanitarian feeling.</P>
    <P>With reference to the Folklore Institute, I do not think it is proposed to employ any full-time person. For the present the work of the Society will be directed by Mr. De Largy, who is a member of the staff of University College, Dublin.  He has had special training in folk lore work and is very interested in it. He has done a great deal of folk lore work.  Mr. De Largy will be assisted by voluntary effort.  After all, collection can best be done by great numbers of people who will work during their holiday periods on special excursions rather than by one or two people who might be specially employed as collectors and recorders.  It may be that in some instances some assistance will be given by way of meeting expenses to people who will carry out this work of recording, but I do not think the work that has to be done could be done on the basis of paid labour.  When the institute has been at work a year or two, and we will see what the needs are, and what can be done with the present sum, and whether or not it would be desirable to allocate a further amount.</P>

      <P>The Minister may have greater faith in human nature than I have, but I think its activity will come to an end, if not its utility. Deputies on this side of the House are opposed to the granting of money to keep the Seanad as at present constituted in existence.  The more experience we have of the working of the present Parliamentary system here the more convinced we are that this £22,830 which it is proposed to take this year for Seanad Eireann will be wasted.  The Seanad has become very largely a reproduction of the Dáil, and the same considerations that enter into the making of decisions here enter into the making of decisions there. Questions are discussed and decided by the elected representatives of the people from various angles.  They are again discussed from the same <Col N="375" /> angles by other representatives not directly elected by the people, in the Second Chamber.  The number of occasions upon which serious flaws have been found in Bills which passed through the Dáil has been very few.  Deputies will not be able to indicate more than one or two occasions upon which amendments of any serious import came back to them from the Seanad to Bills passed here.  We think that the money now being spent in providing the salaries, allowances and travelling expenses of members of that body could be much more usefully expended in remitting taxation or in increasing some one or other of the existing social services.  We ask the Dáil to support the reduction of this particular sub-head by the amount indicated in the amendment, and by doing so to give expression to its agreement with the views which I have advanced.</P>
      <P>We are also of opinion that the membership of this Chamber could be reduced without in any way impairing its efficiency or ability to deal with the business which comes before it.  I am aware that under the Constitution there will be an automatic reduction in the number of Deputies prior to the next general election, but that reduction cannot possibly exclude more than ten or twelve from the present number.  In our opinion, we could effectively reduce the membership of the Dáil by at least one-third.</P>

      <P>That is not likely to happen.  As a matter of fact, the one-third who would disappear in that case would be the one-third who will disappear at the general election in any case.  The reason why we want <Col N="376" /> to have a vote in connection with the Estimate is because we think money is being wasted on the Oireachtas.  The cost of maintaining the machinery of government could be substantially reduced and the efficiency of the machine increased in the process.</P>
      <P>There is just another matter to which I want to make reference.  A committee consisting of members of the Dáil and Seanad took into consideration during the year, amongst other matters, the matter of travelling expenses.  The committee was not satisfied that an adequate effort had been made by the Department of Finance to secure that full travelling facilities would be provided for Deputies or that the cost of the existing travelling facilities would be lowered.  Up to quite recently, the State was paying full first-class fares for Deputies and Senators travelling to and from their constituencies to Dublin.  Recently there has been some reduction granted by the railway company, but the committee was of opinion, in the first instance, that Deputies should be given travelling facilities not merely to their own constituency, but in their own constituency, and some members of the committee were of opinion that they should be given general travelling facilities through out the country.  Some members of the committee, particularly some members associated with the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, were very strongly of the view that these increased facilities could be secured without any increase in the total cost if a serious effort were made by the Department of Finance to secure them.  The viewpoint of those who advocated the increased travelling facilities was that Deputies come here not merely as representatives of particular counties, but to deal with the business of the country as a whole, and that the vote of one Deputy has as much effect in arriving at a decision as the vote of another Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a matter arises here concerning Haulbowline dockyards, or the Shannon scheme, or the flooding of <Col N="377" /> rivers in the West, or the electrical development of the Erne, or any similar matter, Deputies not familiar with the problem might find it necessary to pay a personal visit to the place concerned for the purpose of carrying out an inspection, and satisfying themselves that certain proposals submitted to the Dáil were good ones.  Deputies making visits of that kind would be doing public work arising out of their duties as Deputies, and they should not be required to pay their own travelling expenses.  That view was favourably considered by the committee, which was representative of all parties and of the Seanad, which was not so directly concerned, however, and a certain recommendation was made.  I should like to know if the Minister has given that recommendation any consideration, and if it is proposed to take any action in the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputies on this side of the House are also of opinion that the staff of the Oireachtas appears to be very large, and they are not convinced that the work required to be done necessitates a staff of the size at present provided.  I do not know who is responsible for determining what staff is required to carry on the work of the Oireachtas, and I should like to know if the Minister has ever given the matter his own consideration. We would not wish to see the efficiency of the staff impaired in any way, and if economies would result in any diminution in the services available we would not be prepared to advocate them, but we do think that economy could be effected without impairing the efficiency of the staff, if a serious effort were made to do so.</P>
    <P>These are all the matters I wish to refer to, except to raise an objection to the voting of £250 as a grant to the Empire Parliamentary Association. I cannot see what possible benefit can come to the people of this country by the fact that we expend this £250 per year in maintaining the Empire Parliamentary Association. That money is certainly wasted, and if it were devoted even to the purpose <Col N="378" /> of giving employment to one family in Dublin it would be much better spent than in this particular manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with Deputy Lemass in opposing sub-head C of this Estimate.  I voted before for the reduction of salaries of members of the Seanad and, to be consistent, I am bound to vote against this Estimate.  In the present position of the country economy is essential, and while it might be suspected, in view of the by-election which is coming on, that Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches were trying to indulge in a little propaganda, I, as one who represents a large section of the community detached from both Parties, think that the cost in connection with the Seanad is more than this country can bear.  I agree with Deputy Lemass that there should be a reduction in the membership of the Seanad and the Dáil.  However, that is a matter for future legislation, but I think the time has arrived when serious effort should be made to reduce the cost of both the Dáil and the Seanad.</P>
      <P>As I said on several occasions, we are simply a poor country.  We are not the great people we are supposed to be.  We are no better and no worse than other people.  I know there are at present in this country thousands of people on the verge of starvation.  I, also, know there are thousands of farmers who, notwithstanding all that has been said about university education in connection with agricultural industry, find it very hard to live.  We want in this country legislation dealing with the ordinary people, and for the benefit of the ordinary people in the country.</P>

      <P>I certainly agree with Deputy Lemass that every pound that could be saved should be saved.  He referred to the £250 voted for the Empire Parliamentary Association.  There again we are aping after other countries trying to copy them in things which are no use to this country.  It would be better if we looked after our own people here.  I certainly say there could be a saving in both the Dáil and Seanad of £27,000 a year.  The cost of the Dáil and Seanad, both in salaries and travelling expenses, is somewhere in the neighbourhood of £87,000 per annum.  Between £27,000 and £29,000 of that money could be saved, and that amount would provide employment for many of our people, at present unemployed.</P>
      <P>I know this Vote will pass because there is a majority in favour of it, but the time will come when Deputies will have to face the people of this country.  They will have to face them at the next general election and, then, some awkward questions will be asked as to why they voted these sums of money and did not try to effect economies.  It may be that the people have not the opportunity at the moment for enforcing their views, but the time will come when they will have that opportunity.  I believe it would be well Deputies should recognise the fact that it is the people who count and that their duty is to the people.  We are sent here to carry out, as far as possible, duties entrusted to us and one of these duties is to see that public monies are spent to the best advantage. As a member of this House I believe that the monies that are being voted, especially in connection with the Seanad, could be more usefully employed in other ways.  I shall, therefore, vote for the reduction of this Estimate.</P>

I should like to know if people employed in that way are full-time and whether it is in keeping with the dignity of this assembly and the Oireachtas generally, of which we hear a good deal occasionally, that people should be employed at that rate of wage.  I notice that the same rate obtains for an attendant in another part of the House and I should like to have some information on that point.  At least we ought to give an example here to employers in the country, generally, and if we demand full time service from people we should pay them something approximate to what would be necessary to enable them to live.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity that Deputy Sheehy's transcendental eloquence is not availed of in a venue where it would be more appreciated. I support Deputy Lemass's demand that the Government should make some effort to effect economies under sub-head C.  I need not go into the arguments in favour of that course, because they were discussed rather fully when, by a majority of two votes, a Bill to effect a considerable reduction in Senators' allowances was defeated.  If that measure had been left to a free vote of the House and if members of the Government Party had been allowed to express themselves freely upon it I have no doubt that it would have been carried. In any case, the fact that sixty votes were registered in favour of it was a clear indication to the Ministry that there is a strong opinion in the country, which is reflected in the Dáil, that economies could be effected under this heading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has now an opportunity to state whether the Government intends to take any steps in this matter, or whether they will allow this sub-head to stand as it is this year.  Apart from political and bye-election necessities, I hope that the Minister will be able to give us some assurance that this matter will have the serious attention that I think all Deputies are really anxious it should have.  If he does not do that, perhaps he will bear in mind Deputy Coburn's warning, that even if all goes well in the bye-election, there is still a general election to be faced, and that the <Col N="382" /> people will then probably have something to say on the question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that it is very difficult to discuss this question at all and remain in order, because we are not, I suppose, allowed to talk for or against legislation on an estimate, although Deputy Lemass succeeded in asking for legislation. The numbers of members and the amount of payment are determined by legislation, so that there is no alternative for the Government but to present the Estimate as it stands, and I think there is no real alternative for the Dáil but to pass it. If the Dáil does not want to have this expenditure it should amend the law.</P>
      <P>I do not profess to regard the present system of electing the Seanad as an ideal system, but it is very hard to find the ideal system, especially, I think, in the present state of affairs politically.  It might be, if we could get parties to look at it in a calmer and in a more impartial way than the question of the Seanad has yet been looked at, that a better method of electing the Seanad could be discovered.  However, the great majority of countries have second chambers, and I am satisfied that these countries are not entirely mistaken in the notion that there is real value in a second chamber as a balancing chamber, and in certain circumstances as a delaying chamber &mdash;something that will prevent the elected House from rushing ahead in heat or in party passion with a proposal which would not really have the approval of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of travelling expenses, it is impossible to get all sorts of extra travelling facilities without extra charge, and I am sure that the Deputy who advocated it is quite well aware of that.  The railways have given certain concessions which they had refused to give for a long time.  They gave these concessions, not as a result of pressure from the Department of Finance, but as a result of the pressure of the competition of the 'buses, and if we had not had that change in circumstances I believe that it would have remained impossible to obtain concessions <Col N="383" /> from them.  If a majority of Deputies want all sorts of additional travelling expenses, undoubtedly they can be provided, but they can only be provided at extra cost. I do not think that these extra travelling facilities that are being asked for would be justified, more particularly the sort that would be involved in enabling Deputies to take trips to Haulbowline or other places to see things for themselves.  As a matter of fact, unless a Deputy were an engineer he would not be a bit wiser after visiting Haulbowline than before, and I do not think that we could accept the view at all that Deputies would be better able to discharge their duties, or better able to decide things that would be put before them, as a result of taking excursions all over the country.</P>
    <P>With regard to travelling within Deputies' constituencies, the case against the suggestion is not as clear, but, on the other hand, I think it would be possible to have a very great increase in expenditure there, so great as not to be justified by the benefits that would be obtained.  It would be impossible, I think, to check that expenditure in any way, and some of it would be entirely frivolous, as I think would be the expenditure on these excursions on the part of Deputies, in order that they might see things for themselves.  I went three times to see the Shannon scheme in operation, but I am not now better qualified to vote on anything in connection with that scheme as a result of anything I saw, and I think that is the position generally.</P>
    <P>The staff required is really decided upon by the Ceann Comhairle in consultation with the Department of Finance.  On many occasions the requirements of the House have been reviewed, and it would be impossible to reduce the staff without reducing the service which is available.  As a matter of fact, the service available is not a matter of mere convenience to Deputies; it is often of real consequence to the work of the House, because if the staff work of the House were badly done the legislative results which would be achieved <Col N="384" /> might be defective in many instances, and I think to attempt to cut down the staff beyond what the Ceann Comhairle and the representative of the Department of Finance on various occasions found to be necessary would not be wise.</P>
    <P>The amount voted to the Empire Parliamentary Association results in the provision of the Journal of the Association for members of the Dáil. I think that money is well spent. Perhaps some Deputies may not be willing to read anything of that nature which they receive, and, of course, as far as they are concerned, the expenditure is wasted.  If you have a Deputy who will take up that line almost any expenditure aiming at helping him to discharge his duties efficiently would be wasted. I think it will be found useful to Deputies who read it, and that the information and the suggestions in it will enable them to do their duty in this House better than otherwise would be the case.</P>

      <P>In connection with the purchase of books&mdash;this is really a matter for the Ceann Comhairle&mdash;it seems that insufficient attention is being paid to books dealing with the history of this country, and having special reference to it.  There is a tendency to devote all the money which is at the librarian's disposal to books dealing with procedure and such matters, which, no doubt, are very important, but a definite effort should be made to have all the really <Col N="385" /> valuable works dealing with Irish history and antiquities in the library, as well as modern publications.  As a matter of fact, some of the periodicals, while they may convey information to Deputies as ordinary readers, are practically useless to them as a help in carrying out their duties efficiently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House are opposed to this Vote, because we are not satisfied that the money is expended on services to the whole people of the State.  We are not satisfied that the political ends of a certain Party are not served solely by the expenditure of this money.  We are not certain that the money is used to procure information which is essential to the defence of the State against the possibility of external aggression.  We feel that the main portion of this money is spent for the loathsome purpose of <Col N="388" /> corrupting our own people and destroying that trust amongst our own citizens upon which alone the safety and security of the State can be rightly based.  Last year, in defending this Estimate to the House, the Minister denied that any part of it had been used for the purpose of suborning by agents provocateurs. But in that case the Minister must think that the public memory is very short, because we must remember that in the course of a public inquiry one witness afterwards admitted to be an agent of this State, and in receipt of Government pay, had to acknowledge in cross-examination that he had suggested raids upon certain Government and other offices, and had incited others to take part in them, and was himself the head and front of a conspiracy of lawlessness and disorder.  I know that the exigencies of modern government, of all governments in all times have compelled them to buy information from people who had the trust and confidence of others.  I would like to be sure that so far as this Vote is concerned the main and chief purpose of it would be the purchase&mdash; since it must be done&mdash;of information rather from those who are in the service of other governments, external to this State, than from citizens and members of our own community. We do not think, as a matter of fact, that it is necessary to spend any part of this money in bribing our own citizens.  If the Government's declaration as to its own excellence, of the benefits and advantages derived by the people over whom it rules, be true, surely the loyalty of the citizens to the State would be such that they would of their own accord communicate to the State and to those who are charged with the duty of preserving law and order in the country, any knowledge they might have, anything which would be likely to subvert the Government or to interrupt the peaceful advancement of this State towards the prosperity which the Government dangles before us as an inducement to continue our support of them.</P>

      <P>What I did applaud in the Deputy's remarks was his public statement in this House that it is the duty of every citizen in the State to support the continuance of the Government's policy for the preservation of peace and order and, I think he said, their efforts to put down lawlessness and disorder.</P>

      <P>I said that if the assertions and declarations of the Government were true, then without doubt the loyalty of the people would be such that they would communicate to the Government anything that might tend to be subversive of law and order.  The unfortunate thing about it is that the assertions of the Government are not true; that the people have not that respect for them which, in ordinary circumstances and under a different Government, would prevail; that the people do not regard this Government as their friend; that they think of it as something that has to be endured more or less like purgatory, until a time comes when they will be released from their sufferings.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, they do.  The real point in connection with this Vote is that the expenditure is unnecessary.  If this Government had the trust and confidence of the majority of the people it would not, so far as our own people are concerned, be necessary to spend this money.  So far as external powers are concerned I do not think it is necessary to expend it either.  I do not think in the Government's view that it should be necessary to expend it.  According to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance, we are common associates within the great Commonwealth of Nations, bound to stand by each other, defend each other and uphold each other against all aggression; bound in loyalty to the one Crown and the one Throne, and surely the Minister for Finance is not going to tell the House that of this £10,000 which he asks he requires a large sum in order that he may corrupt the loyal subjects of that Crown and of that Throne to which he has given his first allegiance.  I do not believe the Minister has that in mind at all.  It is precisely because I do not feel this money is going to be spent in endeavouring to secure that forewarning which is forearming against attack from an external source that I have come to the conclusion that it is to be used, as I have said, to corrupt our own people, our citizens generally.  For that reason it is an unworthy object, one to which public money should not be devoted. <Col N="391" /> and I hope, therefore, that the Dáil will reject the Vote.</P>
