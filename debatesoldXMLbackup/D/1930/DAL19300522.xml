      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if it is the intention of the Electricity Supply Board to acquire for the purpose of the Shannon Scheme the premises of the City Wheel Works, Dublin; and, if so, if he will state what steps are being taken by his Department to ensure that no person at present employed in these works will lose his employment.</P>

      <P>Reliable information on the matter referred to in the question can be secured only by direct application to the Electricity Supply Board.  Such information as I have does not lead me to the conclusion that it is the intention of the Electricity Supply Board to acquire the City Wheel Works premises.  The second part of the question does not therefore arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware (a) that a section of the railway in the Arigna Valley has been removed by the Great Southern Railway Company, and that its removal is a drawback to the future possibilities of the mines in that area; (b) if he will state whether the railway company contemplate a reduction of service on the railway from Ballinamore to Drumshambo, and if he is aware that any reduction of the present service would <Col N="2300" /> seriously injure the interests of the locality above mentioned, and whether he will see that no such reduction will occur.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that the rails on the upper portion of the Arigna Valley Railway, which was absorbed by the Great Southern Railways Company in accordance with Section 2 (2) of the Railways Act, 1924, are being lifted.  This portion of the line has been derelict, no traffic having passed over it for some years, and there would not appear to be any justification for saddling users of other parts of the Great Southern system with the cost of its continued maintenance.</P>
      <P>The possible reduction of services on the railway between Ballinamore and Drumshambo or elsewhere, is a matter primarily within the discretion of the railway company and one over which I have no control.  I understand, however, that what the railway company has under examination is the possible substitution of road for railway services, but that would involve legal formalities which would afford an opportunity for considering local interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Minister's answer to the first part of the question, I take it he is satisfied that the future possible development of the Arigna Valley is so small a practicable proposition that he considers the retention of the railway there would no longer be of any service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The lifting of the railway line has not been undertaken in view of any statement relative to the possibility of development hereafter.  That matter could be looked into when the time comes. The reason underlying the lifting of the rails is because the line has been derelict for so many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not part of the Minister's duty to investigate the possibility of future development there and to see that the line is not taken away in view of its future use?  Its removal is a serious handicap.</P>

      <P>This is really a matter that is entirely within the control of the railway authorities.  I have no discretion to interfere.  The only thing that I might do, if development of the district seemed to be immediate, would be to draw attention to the fact that the railway company might have to relay the line.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>Public money was expended to a very considerable extent in connection with this line recently and surely it is not a matter that should be lightly treated by the Minister.  It is a serious drawback to any future development in the Arigna Valley.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state (a) what number of credit societies was operating in the area of Saorstát Eireann in 1920; (b) what number is operating at the present time; (c) how many of such societies have failed during the period 1920-1930; (d) the number of depositors in societies that failed; (e) the amount on deposit in societies that failed; (f) what percentage of deposit was lost thereby; (g) whether he will take any steps to compensate depositors, or, if he has done so, what is their nature.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume this question relates to Agricultural Cooperative Credit Societies registered under the Friendly Societies Acts. (a) The number of such societies registered at the end of 1921 was 112. Figures in respect of Saorstát Eireann for 1920 are not available. (b) The number of such societies registered at the end of 1929 was 119.  (c) In the interval the registry of 53 of these societies was cancelled and one other society was ordered by the Court to be wound up.  It is probable that a considerable proportion of the societies whose registry was cancelled had failed, but precise information is not available, (d), (e), (f) Figures are not available to enable me to answer <Col N="2302" /> these parts of the question.  (g) I have no statutory power or duty to compensate depositors in societies of this character which have not been successful in their operations, and I am not aware of any reason why exceptional treatment should be accorded by way of compensation to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Vaughan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that the furnishing of Kanturk Hospital was paid for out of the rates collected from the ratepayers of Kanturk Rural Districts, notwithstanding the fact that an award was made for the erection and furnishing of hospital buildings, etc., as compensation for the burning of the old Kanturk Workhouse and Hospital; and if he will state why the furnishing of the new hospital was not paid for out of the award; and if he is further aware that the destroyed furniture, etc., of the old workhouse and hospital was included in the compensation claim.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would appear to be misinformed on the matters referred to in the question.  The Kanturk Hospital was furnished at the expense of the ratepayers of the North Cork County public assistance district, and not of the Kanturk rural district.  A grant was made by the Minister for Finance of approximately £18,000 for the building of the hospital.  The Minister for Finance refused to give a grant towards its furnishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielVaughan" hpid="Mr. Vaughan Mr. Vaughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Vaughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state if compensation for the destruction of the furniture was paid? <Col N="2303" /> The award was made, and I would like to know why the building only was reconstructed but no effort was made to replace the furniture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no award made in this case at all.  It lay with the State to make a claim for compensation in respect of the building.  It lay with the local board of guardians to make a claim in respect of the furniture.  There is no information that any claim was made by the local authority in respect of furniture that may have been in the premises at the time of its destruction.  A claim for compensation was originated by the State for the building.  That claim was withdrawn and the matter was subsequently settled to the extent of £18,000.  There was an arrangement with the Minister for Finance and £18,000 was given for the building of the hospital.  Representations were made to the Minister for Finance about the furniture, but in consideration of the fact that the State was giving £18,000 compensation for the destruction of the building it was felt that the local people ought to supply the furniture, and the charge came on the North Cork Board of Assistance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to propose the amendment standing in my name:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to the present the Dáil has not refused to provide any money that was asked for by the Land Commission, and, time after time, Deputies from all Parties have expressed themselves agreeable to provide any further finances that might be required or any further staff that might be required to enable the work of the Land Commission to proceed with more expedition and to be done as quickly as we all wish that it should.  We were told last year that there was a considerable slackening off in some branches of the work, and that, owing to the necessity for vesting tenanted land, a great deal of work in the untenanted land section had to be left over.  Furthermore, we were told that there had been an accumulation of business in that branch, and I have been told that the Land Commission <Col N="2306" /> finds itself blocked in its dealings with untenanted land.  If we are to understand from that that the staff of the Land Commission is absolutely inadequate to carry out the work that was laid before them in 1923 when the Land Act was passed, and when it was suggested, and I think understood, that all outstanding questions of land purchase would be well on the way to solution at the end of five years, then the House should have some clear explanation about it.</P>
    <P>Year after year we are providing enormous sums of money for the Land Commission and the most that we can hear, in return for this expenditure, is that the Land Commission is just barely managing to avoid further accumulations of work.  The work is piling up on them, they say, and the staff is absolutely incapable of dispatching it with any greater expedition.  For that reason I think some further explanation is necessary, and I have put down this amendment.  The total cost of the Land Commission is £750,000.  Of this, £60,000 is for Gaeltacht housing; £211,000 is for the improvement of estates, and £230,000 is for salaries, wages and allowances.  I think it cannot be said, in view of the last figure, that the Land Commission is in any way understaffed. What the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary have to show the House is what value the country is getting for this expenditure.  Is it that the Land Commission was taken over as an effete Department and that it was found absolutely impossible to reorganise it so as to deal with the new situation; that there was the old procedure there, and that the old red tape methods were there, and that the present Ministry have been quite unable to grapple with them?  Have they, instead of trying reorganisation, tried to carry on with impossible machinery?</P>
    <P>The amount allowed for travelling expenses, £32,000, would seem to indicate that officials are given every facility for travelling and that no stint whatever is made in the generous provision given for allowing them to go about the country <Col N="2307" /> and carry out their work.  Although, as I have said, I believe that most of the work in connection with the vesting of land is a legal matter and does not require any great travelling, nevertheless I have not objected to the extraordinarily large amount paid for travelling expenses.  We were told that it is absolutely necessary that officials should be able to go about the country to investigate rights of way, water rights, boundaries, turbary and various other matters of that description.  I think, however, that the expenditure is out of all proportion to the value we get.</P>
    <P>Further down in the Estimate we see that £12,000 in sub-head K is to be advanced to meet deficiencies in income from untenanted land.  That is to say, the taxpayer is expected to subsidise the holding up of untenanted land by the Land Commission, land which they are setting.  In that way we are subsidising the holding up of schemes which should result in the planting of population, whether they be uneconomic holders, landless men or the sons of farmers. We are holding up that by granting that subsidy.  We are also paying under sub-head I £21,000 towards the settlement of Land Committee cases.  These were cases where land was taken over under the old Sinn Fein courts.  I had expected that after so many years, no matter how involved and intricate these cases were, they would by this time have disappeared from the Estimates. Apparently, however, they have still not been dealt with.  That is proof, in my opinion, that the work of the Land Commission is not proceeding with the expedition with which it should proceed.</P>
    <P>As regards the Gaeltacht housing grants, the position is that we on this side of the House have no information as to how the Act is working. We would like the Parliamentary Secretary when replying to give some indication as to the amount of money expended already, the programme that is likely to be carried out during the coming year, and when he expects that the total <Col N="2308" /> amount that was intended by this House to be spent on housing in the Gaeltacht&mdash;namely, a quarter of a million&mdash;will be expended.  On page 233 there is a footnote stating that allowance is made to the economic geologist attached to the Department of Industry and Commerce for acting as an expert adviser in connection with mineral rights.  I would be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary would tell us what the position is in regard to mineral rights.  I think that under a particular Act the Land Commission have been granted certain powers to deal with the question of mineral rights.  As a promise has been given to set this whole question in order, I would be glad to know what the Land Commission are doing in that matter.</P>
    <P>I put down a question to the Parliamentary Secretary asking him to state the total amount of money which tenants are paying as payments in lieu of rent.  The House is familiar with the fact that before tenants are vested under the Acts 1923-27 they are paying what is called payment in lieu of rent.  That, however, is of no advantage to them, in so far as no reduction is made in the ultimate purchase price which the tenant has to pay.  No reduction is made either in regard to sinking fund or interest on principal by these payments.  The tenant can go on paying money in lieu of rent year after year and for many years. At the end of that time, when the Land Commission sees fit to vest him, he has to begin to pay all over again for 68½ years until he clears off the purchase price.  In the year 1928-9 the tenants in this way paid £898,000, of which £756,000 went to the landlords.  Therefore the landlords or their representatives lost nothing.  Their rights were safeguarded under the Act.  The Land Commission lost nothing either, because they were paid the expense of collecting, which came to something over £20,000.</P>
    <P>It is a most remarkable thing that the Minister for Finance has found this a most profitable transaction&mdash; this business of holding up the vesting <Col N="2309" /> of land which, if it were carried out, would actually mean a burden on the State.  In so far as the State should finance the transaction, provide the land bonds, pay a contribution of 10 per cent. on purchase, instead of having to provide that and having to bear any burden in the carrying out of the work in connection with land purchase and the vesting of tenants, the State actually gains on the delay.  Therefore it is quite clear, from the point of view of the Minister for Finance and, I fear, from the point of view of the Land Commission, that there is strong financial reason that instead of hurrying up this matter they should delay it as much as possible. In the year 1928-9 £132,000 was paid in income tax, so that tenants, as well as paying the landlords and the cost of collecting, have also been paying the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Since the 1923 Act was passed I find that the total payments by the tenants up to the latest available date came to nearly £6,000,000, of which four and three-quarter million may be said to have gone to the landlords and about £1,200,000 in income tax to the State.  Thus, while farmers all over the country are complaining about the delay in vesting and the burdens of annuities which fall on them, in addition to many other burdens, they are, in fact, subsidising the Minister for Finance and his income tax officials and paying over this huge sum of money.  We have often urged that reduction.  I do not care whether it can be made by vesting the tenants and carrying out the legal processes which are said to be necessary or whether, as in the North, the Government say to the farmers &ldquo;whenever we vest you we will see that you will get value for the money paid; we will recoup you for the payments made so that you will not be in the position of paying £900,000 a year for so many years and that all that money, so far as you are concerned, is a dead loss.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are 90,000 tenants involved in that.  I ask the House whether <Col N="2310" /> they are satisfied that that state of affairs should continue.  There may be a slight reduction every year from this time forward if, as we are told, the Land Commission is going to concentrate on this aspect of the matter, and there may be reductions in the amount paid in lieu of rent, but there will be an increase in the number of tenants vested and paying annuities and who are in the position of knowing that every payment they make is helping to clear off the debt and that after a certain time they will become owners of the land.  It is proceeding very slowly. Although there has been an improvement last year, the total number of holdings vested came to 4,500.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>In a reply given to me by the Parliamentary Secretary he stated that during the year ending 31st March, 1930, 2,781 judicial tenancies and 1,786 non-judicial tenancies were vested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is under the Act of 1923.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>That makes a total of 4,567.  That is under the Land Act of 1923.  Further down we learn that the total number remaining to be vested is 47,000 judicial and 32,000 non-judicial tenants, and of these, 7,540 judicial and 8,186 non-judicial have been provisionally gazetted prior to vesting.  In spite of the improvement, the fact is that vesting is likely to go on for twenty years even if no fresh work accumulates. If the Land Commission simply deals from this time forward with the number of judicial and non-judicial tenants who remain to be vested it seems to me at the present rate of progress it will take a generation. It was stated that the Land Commission&mdash;and I tried to make allowance for that fact&mdash;was clogged with the amount of work in the untenanted land section.  There has been a definite slackening off in <Col N="2311" /> that section in various ways, and I hold that the work of vesting should proceed more quickly.</P>
      <P>If we take it from another point of view and ask ourselves how much money has been issued in land bonds every year, representing the total amount of the proceedings which the Land Commission has in hands, we will find that the amount falls very far short of that issued during the old regime.  Under the 1903 Act, I think it was, it was definitely arranged that between five and six million pounds should be floated every year.  According to the 1928-1929 accounts of the Land Commission the total amount floated up to the end of the financial year came to £5,700,000.  The total amount that will be necessary to complete the work has been stated to be over £30,000,000&mdash;some say £33,000,000. At the rate of one and a half million issued every year, obviously it would also take a generation to complete the work.</P>

      <P>I am afraid the Deputy is quoting the wrong figures. Since 1903 over £12,000,000 has been issued in land bonds.  If the Deputy will refer to my statement he will see that.</P>

      <P>I am looking at page 12 of the Land Commission Accounts for 1928-9, Land Purchase Account No. 3; Land Acts, 1923 to 1927, Advance Account; 4½ per cent. bonds issued by the Land Commission, £5,700,000, up to the 31st March, 1929.  For the year under review the amount is £1,670,000.  If there is a mistake I submit the mistake is in the accounts.  If the Parliamentary Secretary can show me that a great deal more land bonds have been issued than is stated here I shall be very glad.  In any case it would be well if the House were acquainted with the exact procedure.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has referred to the land bonds issued under the Land Act of 1923.  The actual figures for the issue of land bonds under the Acts of 1923, 1903, and 1909 up to the 31st March, 1929, <Col N="2312" /> was £12,000,000 odd.  The figure which the Deputy has quoted refers to the issue of land bonds under the Act of 1923.</P>

      <P>In any case it was stated in 1923 that it would take £30,000,000 to complete the work of land purchase.  My figures may be incorrect in so far as they represent only the amount issued under the 1923 Act.  If the figure of £12,000,000 given by the Parliamentary Secretary is correct, are we to understand that the amount remaining to complete land purchase is £18,000,000? I want to know whether there is any obligation on the Department of Finance, or whoever is responsible to restrict the issue of land bonds. I know that the issue must have cognisance of money market conditions and the price of land, but, generally speaking, I think the House will be glad to have an assurance that there is no other obligation, that the Ministry have full power to issue whatever bonds they think fit, and that there is no obligation on them to put a limit to their issue.</P>
      <P>It was stated that the vesting of land could not be carried out in the way we suggested.  It could not be carried out because, according to the Minister for Agriculture, it is an impossible condition, and the present state of affairs, by which tenants paid in the last financial year under review, £854,000, by which they are not going to get credit for that amount and are not going to get the reduction which they would get if they were vested, is liable to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that if the Land Commission were in earnest that they could get over this matter under the various Land Acts.  For example under the 1923 Act, Section 29, sub-section (4) there is a provision in regard to retained holdings. A holding might be taken over as a retained holding by the Land Commission and the standard <Col N="2313" /> purchase annuity fixed there and then, as far as I can understand from the Section, and subsequently the vesting could take place.  It speaks of the standard purchase annuity being paid from the appointed day until the gale day next after the vesting of the holding or until such time as the Land Commission may carry out an apportionment or variation therein.  That is to say there is a provision for holding the land in the first instance, fixing the standard purchase annuity and afterwards arranging certain legal matters or certain modifications which the Land Commission want to carry out.</P>
    <P>Under the 1897 Act, it seems to me that the Land Commission have power, as was suggested from this side of the House, to put on the vesting order certain reservations or conditions, provided it was understood by them that these reservations and conditions were accepted by the tenant purchaser and that subject to such reservations the Land Commission could issue the vesting order upon which these reservations or exceptions were set out.  Section 34 sub-section (2) of the 1896 Act states that the vesting order may declare that the sale is subject to or free from particular rights or appurtenances.</P>
    <P>Are we to understand, as has been suggested to me, that under the compulsory powers granted to the Land Commission under the 1923 Act, procedure is liable to be slower than it was heretofore, that because heretofore certain obligations were placed on the landlord, while now everything is done for the landlord at the expense of the tenant or the State, that there has been a slowing down, that far more work is necessary by the Land Commission and is not done&mdash;I am not blaming them for that&mdash;but owing to these circumstances it is not done so efficiently, and that it is more troublesome and more detailed?  It seems extraordinary that procedure should be slower under compulsory powers, where it was intended the work should be done quickly and not be <Col N="2314" /> left hanging over.  If that is so I submit the House should open up the whole matter of land purchase, and should cut out the loopholes and the various provisions under the Acts that have been passed by the House, by which certain people or certain interests are holding up this work.</P>
    <P>I submit, therefore, that the work of vesting is not proceeding with the rapidity with which it should, and that if the explanation so often given, even if it is a true explanation, that arrangements have to be made to find out about the boundaries and other things is right, it is quite clear from the estimate there is sufficient staff to deal with that matter, and that that ought not to be any excuse.  There is no reason why, if the original intentions of the House were carried out, all untenanted land should be taken over on a certain date, that more progress should not be made in that respect.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties the Land Commission has to deal with is the increased prices fixed on the land by the Judicial Commissioner.  From certain figures supplied to me, it appears that the total prices originally fixed in certain cases which were ultimately brought before him on appeal amounted to £896,000, which he raised to £962,000, representing an increase of £66,000, or nearly 7½ per cent.  Although this was a serious burden on the tenants &mdash;since the Land Commission sends down expert valuers who put decent prices on land, and they must have mainly in view whether the land at those prices will be an economic proposition for those who have to live on it&mdash;nevertheless the Land Commission proceeded in all these cases and gave the benefit of the doubt to the vendors, and except in one or two small cases proceeded with the work and paid a higher price.  When that is so, and when the landlord or the owner can go to the Land Commission under different sections of the Act and hold up the work, even when it is the settled policy of the Government, I <Col N="2315" /> submit that it is unfair, on the other hand, to have the position that tenants who are entitled to be vested for many years past are being mulcted in large sums of money every year.</P>
    <P>I have a number of cases in my own constituency in which I made repeated application to the Land Commission to deal with the problem of groups of congests or uneconomic holders.  I have an advertisement here in connection with a ranch called the Cloghna ranch, consisting of &ldquo;250 acres of excellent grazing, to be let in suitable divisions of from seventy to forty acres each.&rdquo;  That land is being let by the Land Commission for many years, and long before I came into this House Deputy Doyle was asking why it was not being distributed amongst the neighbouring uneconomical holders.  After all the trouble we have taken to try to get this land divided amongst the people, the House is asked to subsidise that state of affairs and to continue to have this land let to people who can well afford to get a living in some other way and to keep it from people who need it, or even if they got the land making them pay five or six times the price they would have to pay if they were placed on the land as the ultimate occupiers.</P>
    <P>Since the 1923 Act was passed, according to their figures, the Land Commission in County Carlow has only dealt with Committee cases which were handed over from the old Sinn Féin administration.  I give it credit for carrying out that work successfully and for giving general satisfaction, but after so many years I ask, could it not be possible to have done a little more than to bring to an end what was begun in 1920 and 1921?  The only other cases besides that of Kelletstown, Moyle and Duckettsgrove are two representing 571 acres.  That is the only new work that the Land Commission has done in County Carlow, where there are large numbers of landless men, uneconomic <Col N="2316" /> holders and labourers, who have a good knowledge of agriculture and who in many cases are prepared to put up some kind of security that they will work the land properly if they get it.  That county is one of the most industrious in the Free State, yet the only new work that the Land Commission has done to satisfy the requirements of these people is to take over 571 acres.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughALaw" hpid="Mr. Law Mr. Law">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Law</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal with certain specific cases in my own district. I do not make any apology to the House for saying a few words on this matter, because, while I deprecate in a general way the bringing of particular cases to its notice, excluding the more general subjects, I think, at the particular stage which our land operations have reached, there is really very little use in the enunciation of general principles.  We have long ago agreed that tenanted land is to be transferred as quickly as possible from the landlord to the occupiers. We are all in perfect agreement that where there is unoccupied untenanted land suitable for division it should be divided as quickly and as equitably as possible.  We are naturally impatient of delay and each of us thinks of our own particular cases.  I believe only those who are actually dealing with a particular estate can possibly be in a position to know what the difficulties are, and in a great many of the cases in which undue delay is alleged and in which undue delay seems, to the outsider, to occur it will be found that it was unavoidable.  It is quite impossible so complicated is the whole business to deal with the transfer of the land in the summary manner in which some of us, in our desire to see a particular business got through quickly, are inclined sometimes to imagine it should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to follow Deputy Derrig into those general considerations which he has raised.  I really only want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to deal with a couple of matters which interest my own constituency somewhat seriously.  In <Col N="2317" /> the first place, I would very much like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us what has been the result of the experiments in the reclamation of waste land carried out in County Donegal.  I have been told that these experiments have been highly successful. I am informed that in one case&mdash;I think it is the Rose O'Donnell Estate&mdash;it has been found possible, at much less expense than has hitherto been experienced, to convert bog land into land suitable for carrying very good crops.  If that is so, I think it would be very encouraging to the House, and it would mean this, that while unlimited developments are not possible in that direction, very great developments are possible throughout the Gaeltacht.  I do not think that the Parliamentary Secretary has dealt with that, but I think it would be of interest to the House if he would state in some detail what has actually occurred there.  If the experiments have been as successful as I have been led to believe they are I would like him to tell us what further developments the Land Commission have in mind, in Co. Donegal or elsewhere. About a year ago I brought to the Parliamentary Secretary's attention suggestions for reclamation in other parts of the county, particularly in the very poor district of Bloody Foreland.  I would be very glad to know whether these representations have received consideration and whether any developments are pending in these districts.</P>
    <P>Another matter with which I want to deal is again typical of our problems, in the congested districts particularly, and that is the distribution of the land of the Stewart-Bam Estate, particularly what is known as the Ards Demesne.  I think it is generally recognised in the district that the distribution, as far as it has gone, has been a very fair and reasonable one.  But the Parliamentary Secretary will, I am sure, agree with me that it is very undesirable to leave any loose ends, and in that case there are, to my knowledge, a number of people&mdash;labourers on the estate, landless men, and uneconomic holders&mdash;whose claims are quite <Col N="2318" /> as strong as were those of any of the people who have already been accommodated with land.</P>
    <P>I know perfectly well that you cannot put a quart into a pint pot, that if you have got only a certain number of acres to distribute you cannot put more than a certain number of people on them, but in this case it happens, that the lands that have been distributed are not the whole of the lands available.  I will not trouble the House with details; the Parliamentary Secretary is perfectly well aware of the facts. There is a good deal of anxiety, to put it no further, in the district with regard to this matter.  The Parliamentary Secretary has in his control certain lands the ultimate fate of which has not yet been finally decided, and I would like him to give us here a definite assurance that the situation will not be prejudiced, and that these people who are looking for the land, and whose claims are good claims, will not be estopped by anything that the Land Commission either has done or will do until a good deal further consideration has been given to the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Clery Mr. Clery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clery</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Derrig has proposed that this Estimate be referred back.  I think the majority of Deputies, if they have the courage of their convictions, will at least admit that it should be referred back, for many reasons.  The Parliamentary Secretary made a very convincing case, as far as figures are concerned, when introducing it.  I am prepared to admit that at once.  We all know that figures can prove anything, and if I were in the position&mdash;it would be a happy position&mdash;that I had no practical experience of the working of the Land Commission, or if I came from a county in which congestion was very little known, I would have been more or less convinced from the Parliamentary Secretary's case that the Land Commission had done its duty.  But anyone who knows the conditions as they exist in the congested counties in the West of Ireland, or in any other part of the country, will certainly realise that the Land Commission <Col N="2319" /> has made no appreciable progress since this Estimate was before us last year.  As regards the acquisition and division of land or the vesting of holdings no appreciable progress has been made in Mayo since the Estimate was before us last year, and I am anxious, in order that the Land Commission should realise the dissatisfaction that there is, that the majority of Deputies should vote for referring back the Estimate.</P>
      <P>I will give a number of instances where, although pressure has been brought to bear on the Land Commission for three or four years or longer, the position has remained unchanged. In 1927, and on several occasions since, questions have been asked in the Dáil and letters have been written to the Land Commission urging that a number of farms in North Mayo be taken over and divided amongst local congests.  In practically every case the position, as far as the congests are concerned, still remains the same as it was in 1927.  To show how ridiculous this position is I will give an instance. There is a farm of about 200 acres in a very congested district in East Mayo near Charlestown.  In 1927 a question was asked here as to when the Land Commission was prepared to acquire that land for distribution. It was again raised last September, and again last week, and on each occasion the Parliamentary Secretary's answer was practically the same&mdash;that inquiries were being instituted&mdash;but there was a slight advance last week, when he said that now they were aware of the price demanded by the present occupier of the land and the matter was being considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also three or four small farms in the Bohola district, in East Mayo, I think one of the worst districts so far as congestion and the rundale system is concerned. Questions were raised about this place in 1927, again in 1929, and again last week, and with the exception of the statement that the Land Commission was going to take action <Col N="2320" /> at the earliest possible moment to acquire these farms for distribution, very little advance has been made in that case.  The same thing applies to farms in other parts of East Mayo.  For instance, in the very congested district of Killasser a small farm was acquired by the Land Commission some time ago.  On account of the congestion there the people even went so far as to request the Land Commission, if they could not distribute the land amongst the local congests, at least to set it to them in conacre until such time as they had a scheme prepared for its distribution.  The Land Commission did not give any effect to that request, the land is still untenanted, and the people in the districts surrounding the farm have to live under the same hard conditions.  Were it not for the fact that they are migratory labourers and go to England for a period every year they would not be able to exist at all.</P>
    <P>It is the existing state of affairs in these congested districts which the Land Commission have not taken into consideration. If the Land Commission, or the Government, who are mainly responsible, or the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, who are primarily responsible for the policy of the different Departments were interested in the welfare of the people of those districts and understood the harsh conditions under which they have to live, they would deal with this problem of congestion in the West in a more expeditious way. They seem to be satisfied to go on in the old humdrum fashion and they never realise that the congests there, who are always waiting for something to be done for them, have to live under very harsh conditions. There are estates, for instance, in the Gaeltacht area of Mayo and, with the exception of two estates, the Carter and the O'Reilly Estates, that have been acquired recently, nothing else has been done.  Our experience is that when the Land Commission acquire an estate they take up a considerable amount of time before they are able to produce a <Col N="2321" /> scheme for the vesting of the tenants or, what is more important, produce proposals for the migration of people in congested districts.</P>
    <P>There is also in this Gaeltacht area the urgent problem of the islanders of Inniskee.  I hold that this should not be treated more or less as a local question.  In 1927 an official of the Land Commission visited the islanders and made certain promises to them.  I have here a note in the matter which I received from one of the islanders from which I should like to read an extract.  The reason that I am going into these particular cases is that I am convinced after the few years I have spent here that the majority of Deputies have very little or no knowledge of the conditions existing in congested areas in the West.  There are Deputies from counties here that could be described as ranching counties&mdash;in fact, there are rancher Deputies here&mdash; and although they may be sympathetic enough with the claims of the people in the congested areas they have little or no knowledge of the conditions as they exist in the West. When we ask that the Land Commission Estimate be referred back, we do so for a very good reason.  Therefore I mention cases of this kind so that Deputies from areas where they know nothing of congestion, and where the ordinary farm perhaps might be 200 acres in extent, would realise that the position as far as we in the West are concerned is serious. This letter states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The islanders are willing to give the Land Commission plenty of time to build houses, say, two or three years.  What they desire is to have the land striped for them so that they will be able to build little houses during the summer. All we want is to get ashore before next winter.  I cannot describe the feelings of the islanders owing to the way their case has been put back.  After the disaster of October, 1927, a Mr. Ross of the Fishery Board visited the place and told the people that if they wanted to leave the island the Government <Col N="2322" /> would give them land and houses ashore.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The writer goes on to state: &ldquo;We have no shops, no priest, no doctor, no nothing on the island.&rdquo;  When we consider the very harsh winter we have had, with storms and all that, and know that in these islands the people for considerable periods&mdash; one time for six weeks&mdash;could not go ashore and had to live on whatever they had laid in, and that they had no doctor, priest or nurse on the island, we can understand the anxiety of these people to get ashore, as they were promised by the Land Commission they would be able to do when the land on the O'Reilly estate had been acquired.  They are so anxious to be brought ashore before the coming winter that they are prepared to build huts to live in on the mainland and let the Land Commission in the ordinary course of events go ahead with the building of houses or make some arrangement for them to do it.  According to what the Parliamentary Secretary stated last week, no advance has been made as far as these islanders are concerned.  They are preparing a scheme, of course, but they have been doing that for years as far as some other estates are concerned.</P>
    <P>The same thing may be said as to a large number of estates in the Erris area.  In fact in the Lackin district the occupier of the Rathfran lands has been negotiating with the Land Commission since 1927 for their sale.  Prior to that even the case had been taken up by the Land Commission.  The people in that district, who live under the most disgraceful conditions, are still hoping that the Land Commission will do something for them.  I could mention at least a dozen cases where owners of land in North Mayo are anxious to dispose of it to the Land Commission.  There may be some difficulty about the price, but these people are anxious to get land in other areas and leave the farms they own at present for the relief of congestion. For the past year nothing has been done in that whole district except that negotiations have been <Col N="2323" /> carried on by the Land Commission. With the exception of acquiring the O'Reilly and Carton estates nothing in the way of improving land on estates has been carried out, nothing in the way of division of land has been done in that district, which is one of the worst districts in Ireland as far as congestion goes.</P>
    <P>In order to emphasise that this is a very live question in Mayo I shall read a resolution passed unanimously by the Mayo County Council on the 22nd March this year.  The majority of the members of that County Council have Cumann na nGaedheal views and the Chairman is a member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  This is the resolution which they passed:</P>
    <P>That this council views with grave concern the delay which has occurred in the provision of land in other counties for the migration of large landholders in Mayo, so that the lands of the latter may become immediately available for the relief of congestion.</P>
    <P>That the Government be requested to put into force the compulsory powers vested in them in this connection.</P>
    <P>That a copy of this resolution be sent to President Cosgrave, the Minister for Lands and Fisheries, and to each of the County T.D.s.</P>
    <P>Surely when the County Council went to the extent of taking up this question and placing their views before President Cosgrave, the Minister for Lands and Fisheries and the T.D.s., they realised that it was a very live question.  Prior to this of course when we raised the question about the division of land Cumann na nGaedheal members said that we simply wanted to have a &ldquo;grouse&rdquo; against the Government, but when we find the Mayo County Council, on which there is a majority of Cumann na nGaedheal members, and at least three Cumann na nGaedheal T.D.s, passing a resolution of that kind condemning the Land Commission it shows that it is not we alone that <Col N="2324" /> are dissatisfied in connection with this question.  In fact, whenever the few existing Cumann na nGaedheal branches in Mayo come together once in a while, it is to pass a resolution condemning the Land Commission.  If the Parliamentary Secretary does not believe that, he can come with me any time, if we are allowed in, and listen to the resolutions being passed.</P>
    <P>There is another serious matter which I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to throw some light upon and that is the question of the Castle Hill estate, Crossmolina.  This matter has been raised here on a few occasions.  In Castle Hill there are 700 acres in a demesne.  The owner of these lands was brought before the Land Commission.  Some time ago the case came before the Judicial Commissioner and a decision was given that this Mr. Walsh was entitled to hold the demesne and that the congests in the surrounding parishes were entitled to no portion of the land.  But the fact remains that, with the exception of 65 acres, practically all the Castle Hill Demesne was got as a result of evictions carried out in that area from 1846 to 1890.  These are comparatively recent events.  There were over 55 families evicted on that estate.  There was no such thing as a ranch or a farm in that particular district until the individual who was owner at the time evicted all those people and laid out his beautiful demesne.  The wall surrounding that demesne to-day is composed, for the most part, of materials from the houses that were knocked down following the eviction of the people.  I have a very complete account of that event here, and reading it over I find that at least ten of the people who were evicted&mdash;this was as late as 1890&mdash;died on the roadside, having been thrown out of their holdings by the predecessor of the present holder.  It may be said that this is more or less a question of sentiment. But if it is, what blame can be attached to the descendants of those people who died upon the roadside and who to-day are making strong claims upon the Land Commission <Col N="2325" /> that the whole question of the land on the Castle Hill Estate should be re-opened.  Their case is that when the present occupier of that land was brought before the Judicial Commissioner it was his case only that was heard.  If that is not correct, then it is for the Parliamentary Secretary, or somebody else, to give the House the other point of view.  I believe if the case for the congests and the people whose grandfathers were evicted, and the general case of congestion in that particular area, was heard before the Judicial Commissioner, his decision would have been entirely different.</P>
    <P>A number of public meetings have been held in the past year in this particular district.  These meetings were held by the people in general; they were not political meetings I am glad to say; they were presided over by the local clergy, and resolutions were passed and forwarded to the Land Commission stating the case and asking that the question should be re-opened.  Further, a few months ago, a resolution passed by a meeting presided over by the local curate, in the absence of the parish priest, called upon all Teachtaí for the county to take a united stand upon this question and in the event of no satisfaction being given that they should in a body vote for the rejection of the Land Commission Estimate.  I trust Deputies from Mayo will remember that fact when this Vote is taken.  There are many other things I could say about this particular case but I think, as the resolution and the papers have been forwarded to the Parliamentary Secretary, at least on one occasion, he understands the case and I need not emphasise it any further.</P>
    <P>The question of vesting has been mentioned.  I think that the question of delay in vesting of holdings is perhaps a greater injustice to the tenant farmers than is the handing over of the land annuities.  I have heard of a case where an estate was vested 17 years ago.  One particular tenant was not vested at that time but the fault was not his.  His holding was quite all right, the <Col N="2326" /> boundary was correct and so was everything else.  All along he has been demanding that his holding should be vested, but it was only when he refused to pay rent two years ago that the Land Commission took notice of his case.  This was in Kiltimagh district and his holding was vested after that.  He paid rent for the last 17 years and it is only now he starts to pay the purchase price of his holding.  I know a number of estates in Mayo where you have individuals whose neighbours' holdings were vested as far back as 1913 while their lands are not yet vested.  They have applied to the Land Commission time and again to have their holdings vested but no heed has been given in these particular cases.  That will mean that when their neighbours have paid their annuities and have their holdings free, these people who have not yet been vested will have 20 years further to go to pay off the annuities.  The money paid in the meantime has never been considered. It goes into the coffers of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>That matter has never been taken up seriously by the Land Commission. If it were, outstanding cases would have been given some attention some time or other.  The slovenliness of the Land Commission is what I object to.  If the Land Commission carried on with a little of the go and efficiency of the Congested Districts Board I think we would not have much fault to find with it. Of course, the Parliamentary Secretary can give us figures showing that they have vested so much land since the Congested Districts Board went out of existence.  Figures can prove anything, but it is quite evident to me that there is some delay and no anxiety on the part of the Land Commission or the Parliamentary Secretary to right matters.  I was reading quite recently the speech made by the Parliamentary Secretary when introducing this Estimate last year.  He then said, &ldquo;If the Land Commission were staffed entirely by temporary forces, without restriction as to numbers, it <Col N="2327" /> might be possible to make quicker progress with the completion of its main work, but where a large staff of permanent and experienced officers are involved the State must take notice of the danger of being left with a greater number of such officers on its hands than can be fully provided with work for the full period of their permanent service.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a statement that I would like some explanation of.  Are we to take it that the work of the Land Commission has been in general hampered because you have a staff of permanent officials and because they are permanent and pensionable you must guarantee that they will have work for the rest of their natural lives?  I can draw no other conclusion from the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary, and if I am wrong I shall be glad to be corrected by him.  I think that the position is such that it is not fair to a number of the harder worked officials of the Land Commission.  I know a number of inspectors are fully occupied and giving their full time. They have no easy time at all, and I think it is rather hard upon them that because another part of the Department happens to be overstaffed you must hamper work in order that those people should be continued in their jobs.  I would like some light upon that subject. That seems to be the most reasonable statement as to the easy-going methods of the Land Commission, and since it comes from official sources I take it it must be the true one.</P>
    <P>There are a good many other matters which I could go into, but they are simply local questions dealing with estates, delays in vesting, and things of that kind.  I will not bother going into them now.  The question at the moment is that we are anxious, in the interests of the Land Commission itself and in the interests of the people in the congested districts in particular, that a majority of the members of this House would vote for the amendment to have this Estimate referred back.  I am convinced that if numbers of Cumann <Col N="2328" /> na nGaedheal Deputies take heed of what has been told them by the the members of their own Cumann na nGaedheal branches and by their own friends that, in the interests of their supporters, they will vote for the amendment to have this Estimate referred back for reconsideration.</P>

      <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary is replying, I hope he will tell us the cause of the delay in vesting the following estates in South Mayo: The de Clifford, taken over in 1913; the Lucan, taken over in 1913; the Sligo, taken over in 1914; the Lynch Blosse, taken over in 1908; the Lord Dillon, taken over in 1915; the Brabazon, taken over in 1915; the Monica Lynch, taken over in 1915; and the Jordan (Cloonmore), taken over in 1917.  Let us take, for example, the case of a tenant on the de Clifford estate whose rent is £10.  Since that estate was taken over he has paid, in the intervening 17 years, £170 interest in lieu of rent.  If that estate were vested to-morrow the tenant would have to pay an annuity for 68½ years.  That would be equal to 85 years' purchase.  I think some steps should be taken by this House and by the Parliamentary Secretary to see that the Land Commission is not allowed in future to defraud tenants by holding up the vesting of these estates.  That deprives them of the benefits of from ten to fifteen years' purchase of their holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the acquisition of land in South Mayo, I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will tell us the cause of the delay in taking over certain grazing ranches there which I will mention.  There is a grazing ranch held by Messrs.  McCarton Brothers at Hollymount containing 800 acres.  There is acute congestion in the parishes of Kilcommon and Crossboyne which could be relieved if that ranch was taken over. Then there is the Castlemacgarrett demesne of over 1,600 acres which, if acquired, would enable relief to be given to tenants in possession of uneconomic holdings in the electoral divisions of Ballindine, Kilvine, <Col N="2329" /> Caraun and Claremorris.  Their valuation is under £5.  During the last four or five years the Land Commission have promised that they would acquire that demesne, but so far nothing has been done.  In the parish of Islandeady, between Castlebar and Westport, there are over 100 tenants whose valuation is under £5.  There is a large grazing ranch in the centre of that parish at Green hill held by a gentleman named Mr. Matthew Fahy.  Mr. Fahy states that on several occasions, during the last four or five years, he has offered this farm to the Land Commission either for exchange or purchase, but the Land Commission have not taken over the farm.  They have done nothing in connection with it.  I would like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary what are the intentions of the Land Commission in respect to this farm.  I might mention that the Mayo County Council, at a recent meeting, unanimously passed a resolution asking the Land Commission to acquire this farm of Mr. Fahy's. I suppose the county council got the usual stereotyped reply, stating that the matter would receive attention.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission are well aware of the acute congestion that exists in the parishes of Balla, Mayo and Kiltimagh.  Within three miles of the parish of Balla 3,000 acres are held in grazing.  The lands are known as a grazing ranch. The lands in question are held by Mr. McEllin who has 800 acres, and Mr. James Cowan who has 750 acres. Resolutions, petitions and memorials have been sent to the Land Commission during the last five years asking them to acquire these lands, but so far nothing has been done.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would tell us the number of times that the farms held by Messrs. McEllin and Cowan were inspected during the last three years, and with what result.  There is a large farm held by Mrs. Cummins, of Galway, which surrounds the town of Shrule. This is a large grazing ranch.  During the last three or four years resolutions and petitions have been sent <Col N="2330" /> to the Land Commission asking them to take over this farm so that something might be done for the poor unfortunate town tenants in Shrule and the uneconomic holders in that locality.  Their valuation would probably be about £2.  Still nothing has been done.  Promises have been given, but that is all.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will see that the Land Commission will speed up the acquisition of land.  If not, there is one thing that will happen, and that is that local pressure will be brought to bear which will compel them to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support Deputy Derrig's amendment that this Estimate be referred back.  Last year we had several flowery promises from the Parliamentary Secretary that he would expedite the vesting of holdings, but these flowery promises are like other promises that we get from the Departments here&mdash;they are remarkable only in the breaking of them.  I have before me the Parliamentary Secretary's own report dealing with the vesting of holdings in the last twelve months.  I have, side by side with it, the statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary himself last year on the vesting of holdings. In his opening statement on this Vote last year he said that 110 holdings were vested under the 1903 and 1909 Acts, that 5,100 purchasers had been dealt with under the estates previously purchased by the Estates Commissioners and the Congested Districts Board.  He also stated that under the 1923 and 1927 Acts 3,785 holdings had been vested.  That gives a total of 8,995 holdings vested.  The total this year, as given in the report before me, is 9,217.  In addition to that supposed enormous increase we have a statement made as to the number of holdings in process of acquisition or in process of being vested.  I do not know how many changes or extended processes there are in this special Department, but comparing last year with this year we find that there has only been an increase of 222 holdings vested this year.  I do not by any <Col N="2331" /> means consider that satisfactory.  I do not think that the Parliamentary Secretary himself can consider it very satisfactory.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Steps have also been taken in this connection,&rdquo; according to the Parliamentary Secretary's Report, volume 29, No. 2, page 221, &ldquo;to strengthen the staff engaged in the office of the Land Commission and special efforts are being made to expedite the rate of vesting during the coming year.&rdquo;  And the total increase is 222 holdings.  No doubt he has occasion to be proud.  There are still about 90,000 holdings waiting to be vested.  According to the Parliamentary Secretary's own figures, 79,000 holdings still remained to be vested under the Land Acts of 1923 and 1927.  At the present rate of proceeding I do not know how many holdings are waiting to be vested under other Acts.  I wish the Parliamentary Secretary would tell us how many holdings like those described by Deputy Nally are waiting to be vested, and regarding which there have been agreements from 1915 to 1918.  It would be interesting to know how many of those unfortunate tenants are still waiting to be vested, and if the reason why these unfortunate tenants are paying interest in lieu of rent from 1915 to 1930 is in order that the Minister for Finance might collect his income-tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We might be told there is a question of title involved.  If that is so and the landlords have not the proper title to the holdings, why should the Land Commission collect the interest in lieu of rent from the tenants?  Under what right or title do they collect it?  If the landlord has not title to show why should he get the rent?  If there is a doubt in the matter why should not the tenant get the benefit of it?  Instead of that we have an enormous sum collected year after year as interest in lieu of rent.  Fancy the unfortunate tenant having, as Deputy Nally says to pay from 1915 to 1930 interest in lieu of rent for a holding to which perhaps he has more title than anybody in existence.  He surely <Col N="2332" /> has, for I am certain there is no holding waiting to be vested from 1915 to 1930 if the landlord's title is valid.  Why should the tenant pay rent in such a case? I wish I had a landlord with a title that was not valid, for I am sure he would not get one halfpenny from me.  That a so-called Government Department turns around and collects rent off those unfortunate tenants is nothing more nor less than a scandal.  I have heard the argument put up that it is because of trouble about the validity of title that the delay is caused.  If there is any other reason for the delay I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will state it here, and that he will give some reason why these unfortunate tenants should be waiting for the vesting of their holdings from 1915 to 1930.</P>
    <P>I think it is an extraordinary thing that Deputy Nally, who has been here from 1922 to 1930, has been voting every year in favour of the Land Commission Vote while this condition of affairs continues to exist in his constituency.  I think Deputy Nally should now realise the position, and that until he puts his foot down and shows that he has the courage of his convictions and votes against the Estimate this condition of affairs will continue.  I hope he will have the courage of his convictions to-day.  I was wondering why this delay was caused until I heard Deputy Derrig's statement to-day and I looked into those figures, and I found that last year £132,714 was handed over to the Minister for Finance of the amount collected from the unfortunate tenants as interest in lieu of rent.  I think it is a scandalous and shameful state of affairs that the reason why a Government Department should hold up the vesting of holdings is in order that the Finance Department might derive revenue as a consequence from all the unvested tenants from whom he is collecting, and that the landlords' agents in that Department of his should be kept busy with an interest in the non-vesting of holdings. Then we had the extraordinary statement made by Deputy Derrig <Col N="2333" /> of the number of appeals lodged against the prices fixed by the Land Commission Department and the result with regard to them.  I have before me a statement made by Deputy Hassett last year when he dealt with this matter very exhaustively. I quote from the Parliamentary Debate Volume 29, page 684. He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Another thing I have to complain of is the high price which has been given for land by the Land Commission in the last few years&mdash;prices out of all proportion to what the future tenants can pay.  We have able Land Commission inspectors going down to the country, men with fifteen or twenty years' experience, valuing and inspecting these ranches which the Land Commission is proposing to take over.  They inspect every field, dig up the soil, take into consideration everything on that land, its suitability for holdings, and so on, and what do we find?  Generally the owner of that land, if he thinks the price does not suit him, comes up here to our friend in the Land Courts and appeals against the price, and our friend in the Land Courts generally allows him twenty per cent. to thirty per cent. in addition to the price which the experienced men who inspected the land had found is the price which the tenants to whom this land is to be distributed can afford to pay.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I gave the Parliamentary Secretary a few instances from my own constituency of the condition of affairs that existed there, and I mentioned the particulars of estates something on the same lines that Deputy Clery did a few minutes ago where unfortunate tenants were thrown out on the roadside to die and the estates were afterwards taken over by the Land Commission at three or four times their actual value and tenants put into them. The best tenants in them are after five years now owing two years' arrears.  The result will be that some future Government will have <Col N="2334" /> to send down its inspectors again to re-value the estate and fix a rent that the tenants should and can pay, and the taxpayers of the Free State will have to make up the balance whilst the landlords will have gone off with the loot.  A Department that acts like the Land Commission has acted is not acting in the interests of the people of this country, and a Department that acts in that way should not have any Vote passed for it in this House.  In respect of 200 appeals lodged before the famous Judicial Commissioner the price fixed by the Land Commission&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not criticising the decision of the Judicial Commissioner. I am criticising the Department which, after the price of these lands has been increased by £66,000, took over these lands from the gentleman who was going off with the loot and divided them up amongst the unfortunate tenants, and makes them pay £66,000 more than in the judgment of the Land Commission inspectors they should pay.  The Land Commission, after sending down their inspectors to value these lands, paid £66,000 more for the lands than their inspectors valued them at.  I think that is a greater indictment than the indictment of any judicial commissioner. I think the Land Commission Department which works on those lines are actually creating another land trouble in this country. That is what it will amount to, another land problem to be solved in order that some body of gentlemen might walk off with £66,000 more than the true value of the land.  I think the Department that is carrying on in that way does not deserve the confidence or the vote of this House.  As I stated, we had hoped that some hastening would be made during the last twelve months in the vesting of holdings.  I now realise that any further appeal to the Land Commission Department is hopeless. I realise that those unfortunate tenants that the Land Commission has are to be kept for the next twenty years paying interest in lieu of rent.  They are going to be kept hanging up between heaven and earth, so to speak, for the next twenty years without any single reduction to which they are actually and legally entitled being given to them.  Those tenants are entitled to the ten per cent. reduction.  This House, in its wisdom or otherwise, passed an Act compelling them to purchase, and this House has its remedy.  This House can turn down this Vote to-day and can compel that <Col N="2337" /> Department to do its duty if it wishes.</P>
      <P>I hope Deputy Nally will have the courage of his convictions seeing the hopelessness of his case.  Deputy Nally has come in here from 1922 to 1930 and has voted every year in favour of this Vote.  Still he comes up in 1930 and states that a large number of estates in his constituency have been dragged out from 1915, some of them paying interest in lieu of rent.  I think it is Deputy Nally's bounden duty to vote in favour of this Estimate being referred back.  I hope he will have the courage of his convictions and that those Deputies who spoke here last year, Deputy Hassett, Deputy Nolan and others, who attacked the Land Commission and who have had no reason since to make one statement in favour of that body will vote against the Department's Estimate. I know they cannot make a statement in favour of it to-day and I think it is their duty to vote in favour of this Vote being referred back.  I think it is the particular duty of the Farmers' Party in this House who at least are supposed to represent the farmers here, to vote in favour of Deputy Derrig's amendment that this Vote be referred back.</P>
      <P>Deputy Heffernan in his speech last year made some extraordinary statement.  I do not intend to follow them up to-day very much but if a representative of the farmers in this House considers that the only land that should be divided up is the land alluded to by Deputy Hugh Law a while ago, the reclaimed bogs, and that the real good land should be kept for the bullock, then God help the farmers he represents.  I hope he will for once in this House represent the farming community and that he will for once vote that this Estimate be referred back, that he will do some portion of his duty towards the unfortunate unvested tenants.  After all he has his duty in that respect and if this land which he claims was divided up with his assistance in the County Tipperary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I hope that Deputy Heffernan will always get his vote. Then we have the question of the untenanted land.  We had statements from Deputy Nally here to-day with regard to other large areas, apparently in County Mayo, that are still untenanted, and this House is asked to-day to give a subsidy of £12,000 in order that the grazier to whom that untenanted land is being parcelled out may enjoy it in comfort at a low rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is a loss of £12,000 each year on this land which is being held by the Land Commission how can they expect the unfortunate tenants to support families on 30 or 40 acres and pay rent and rates for it?  This loss of £12,000 bears out my claim to-day that the Land Commission has acquired land at £66,000 over the true value.  After all, where is the use of having a Land Commission inspector to value land if he is not able to value it?  A Land Commission inspector valued the land and the Land Commission afterwards, apparently in their generosity towards these gentlemen, who in the words of Deputy Clery threw the <Col N="2340" /> tenants out on the roadside to die, decided to hand over £66,000 of public money in addition to the sum that their inspectors valued the land for and they come here and look for £12,000 to make up a deficiency in the untenanted land which is remaining in their hands.  There is one cure for the Land Commission Department, I hope they will get that cure here to-day.  If this House has the courage of its convictions. they will get that cure.  If it has not the courage of its convictions I hope that the people will deal with this House some day when they get a chance.</P>

      <P>(West Cork): I rise to support the Vote on behalf of the Land Commission.  I was astonished in following the speech of the last Deputy, that he made no allusion whatsoever to the gallant work that we had accomplished in the past 50 years to bring this land question into its present happy position.  I wish to remind him that it was in the eighties the great battle was fought and won that vested the land of Ireland in the occupier.  In 1870 the first Land Bill was passed.  It was only to give compensation for disturbance.  In 1881 that gallant and brave leader Charles Stewart Parnell and his brave lieutenants, Dillon, Davitt and Biggar&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to remind Deputy Corry of why we are discussing here to-day the question of land tenure in Ireland.  Those leaders that I quoted wrung from an unwilling Parliament on the other side a Land Act that secured the tenant farmers of Ireland in their holdings. <Col N="2341" /> This Act of 1881 won the three F's, fixity of tenure, fair rents, and the right to free sale.  After that was won it was inevitable that land purchase should follow, and it did follow.  The Ashbourne Act came on and it did great work.  Then we had the Wyndham Act, and the Act of 1924 put the coping stone on the great work that fixed the Irish tenant farmers in their holdings.  Can it be possible that to-day we are going to block by any means the great activities of the Land Commission?  I have listened with the most careful attention to the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary.  Any fair-minded Deputy would say that he must be overwhelmed with work.  I have often seen Deputies on the other side marching in procession to the Land Commission offices.  What took them there if the Land Commission was not doing some good on behalf of the State?  Why would they go there if it was hopeless for them to wring anything out of the Land Commission or its officers?  I myself come up from a congested district, and no one can say that in the last two and a half years I went to the Land Commission whining or demanding anything. I only went there on two occasions when I had legitimate grievances and they received every attention.  I would ask Deputies in all solemnity not to be dragging politices into this vital question of sending back the Irish people to the soil.  That is the occupation that the Land Commission have at the present time.  Deputy Corry, I am sure, was not alive in my time, but he was represented in the great battle that we fought to save the homesteads over the people's heads.  That was a time when you could show heroism. It was not by talking, but by standing up against the rack renting landlords, the crowbar brigade, and the battering ram.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am proud I have lived to the winter of my life to bear testimony to the grand and gallant leaders of the Land League days.  I claim them all as friends.  I was loyal to them.  I stood by their side till the last landlord handed in his gun. What more could an Irishman do. <Col N="2342" /> To-day a landlord is as scarce as a white blackbird.  He can be met no longer in the 26 Counties or in the 32 Counties.  After all that we are here to-day discussing our own work.  It may be slow, but I appeal to you, Deputies, as young men, to be broad-minded. Do not be too narrow and do not be attempting to take political advantages simply because the Land Commission are not operating at a more rapid rate. It is your duty to line up behind them and assist them rather than criticise.  If you have any solid grievances, place them before the Land Commission, and if they do not give you satisfaction you have every opportunity to bring your grievance forward in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is one matter in regard to which we would be justified in asking the support of Deputies for this proposal to refer the Estimate back for reconsideration, it is the complete absence of any effort on the part of the Land Commission to deal with congests in every part of the country, but more particularly in the West of Ireland. I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to state what efforts, if any, the Land Commission have made to deal with the congests in Leitrim.  Can he give us the number of people dealt with by the Land Commission under the plan for the relief of congestion?  Can he give us the number of persons who were taken from Leitrim, and who were transplanted to other parts of the country?  Can he say what number of comparatively large landowners have been taken out of Leitrim and transferred to other parts of the country with the object of leaving farms available for the relief of congestion?  The Minister for Agriculture has stated his policy with regard to an economic holding, and he has advocated the creation of 200 acre farms.  I do not assume that that will be considered an economic policy from the agricultural standpoint.  While we may disagree with the extreme opinion of the Minister for Agriculture as to what constitutes an economic farm, <Col N="2343" /> we have to bear in mind the other extreme, the dire state of congestion which is an important factor, and which constitutes a problem that will have to be solved at some time by the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that the problem of congestion is of national importance and, to be dealt with properly, it must be viewed from a wide national aspect.  It is more or less on the same lines as the slum problem in the City of Dublin. That was dealt with from a national point of view, and I think the problem of the congests should be similarly tackled by making any charge involved upon the nation as a whole.  There is a certain discrepancy between what it costs to erect a decent standard of house and the economic rent that can be secured for that house; there is a discrepancy in the amount involved.  In the case of the city slums the State was asked to make good the discrepancy. There should be a somewhat similar procedure in dealing with congestion.  There is no use in attempting to deal with the matter from the purely economic standpoint. There is no use in merely acquiring land where it is available, distributing it amongst the tenants, and expecting that such distribution will result in bringing in the amount of money expended on the whole transaction.  That is the attitude usually taken up by the Land Commission, and it is because of that they have made no serious attempt to deal with the congest problem in the West.  I know that the Land Commission will point out that in these areas there are no ranches, no very extensive farms to be taken over and, therefore, like Pontius Pilate, they immediately wash their hands of any further responsibility. Were the land there the question would long ago be dealt with according to the Land Commission, and they proclaim that it is not their fault that there are no ranches available.  That is the attitude of people who have not seriously tackled this question. I am quite satisfied that if <Col N="2344" /> there were plenty of ranches there, extensive grazing farms, in all probability there would be no congestion.</P>
    <P>The scarcity of land is given as an excuse by the Land Commission, but I say there is ample land available. There is at the present time a slump in the price of land that has no parallel within the last half century. Unless we are to assume that conditions are becoming worse in the agricultural line, we must hope that land has reached the bottom price. There are numbers of farmers who have been endeavouring to sell their land for years and they cannot get a purchaser.  Now is the time for the Land Commission to take over farms at the current prices and thus facilitate the farmers who are anxious to sell.  They could then convert the land, which is the only land available, for the purpose of relieving congestion.</P>
    <P>I know it will be said that if the Land Commission purchase the land at the current price, any overhead charges due by way of annuities will have to be made up in the price for the tenant when the lands are subdivided. That price will be prohibitive. That is what I had in mind when I mentioned that this matter would have to be dealt with from the national standpoint.  It is a national question, and it will have to be solved by the nation taking its share of responsibility.  I think it is the duty of the nation to deal with the slum conditions in the farming community.  The Land Commission have on hands numbers of farms in the congested areas and in other parts of the country that they have been offering for sale for years.  In many cases annuities have accumulated through no fault on the part of the owner.  The Land Commission have been put to the expense of advertising these farms and paying agents, and the result of the whole thing is that no buyer comes forward.  The Land Commission point to that as an undesirable state of affairs.  They hold that land should be a commercial asset, negotiable, and should be made bear its due responsibilities.  In the ordinary <Col N="2345" /> way the Land Commission would be met with no opposition when offering a farm for sale, but at the present time, because underneath it is felt there is a large measure of injustice, opposition exists.  The methods of the Land Commission might very well be compared with the methods of the gombeen man or the moneylenders; they could be compared to the methods of men who have tricky and shady ways in all their dealings.</P>
    <P>Take the case of farms advertised by the Land Commission for sale because of the owners falling into arrears.  The Land Commission are prepared to accept any offer that will meet the amount of arrears due. They leave out the fact that the owner has purchased the farm a number of years back and has paid his annuities, thereby redeeming a certain portion of the charge which the Land Commission has against the land.  If these people, through no fault of their own, find themselves embarrassed and in such a position that they cannot pay their land annuities, I ask is it just that the Land Commission should sell them out and sell out these men's entire interest for the balance of the debt?  Would it not be more just for the Land Commission to pay the owner of the land the redemption value of what he had paid off in that farm in the shape of annuities and give him some reasonable compensation? In that way the Land Commission will acquire a just and reasonable control over the land and there will be no objection to their selling that land for the relief of congests in the congested districts. These are lines that are available, practical and advisable, and this is the view they should have before them.  They have the means to carry out these things if they want to. Along these lines they can at least show their sincerity in an attempt to deal in some way with the problem of congestion in the West of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The carrying out of schemes of this sort or making any departure means a large expenditure of money. The Land Commission cannot make <Col N="2346" /> the charge that in any way they have been cribbed in the matter of finance for any needed expenditure. I have heard no Party in this House ever condemn the Land Commission for excessive expenditure where that money has been spent in any reasonable way.  I know cases where condemnation has been levied against them and where the expenditure they carried out was not justifiable. That condemnation was justifiable. That condemnation was only in cases where the Land Commission had used public moneys for purposes other than in the public interest&mdash;where they have used money for Party purposes.  In such cases the Land Commission has been condemned.  The Land Commission has only to come forward to this House and make application to carry out the necessary work of the relief of this congestion along the lines that I suggest are workable, or on any other lines that they consider advisable and I am sure this House will put no difficulties in the way of granting them the amount of money that will be needed to bring about, to some extent, an improvement in the conditions of these people.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of discussion here to-day on the question of the delay investing the land. That is the trouble all over the country.  It is a matter on which we have heard fair criticism from all sides of this House.  With almost everything connected with Land Commission work we have heard what is rather fair criticism.  But especially so in this matter of vesting. It is a pity that greater speed has not been used in vesting those lands and saving the farmers of the country that very excessive charge resulting from the system of interest in lieu of rent.  I think, too, that the Land Commission should endeavour to keep their promises to the people and in that respect I must complain that many promises made by the Land Commission on some estates in my locality have been promises that have never been honoured.  It is true that these promises were made prior to the Big <Col N="2347" /> War.  As a result of the Big War I know that certain promises and certain services were cut off by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>At that time the Land Commission regarded the cutting off of these services and the postponement of the carrying out of these promises as temporary.  At any rate promises were made to tenants on various estates on Leitrim as to the improvement of their holdings and these promises have not been kept by the Land Commission.  In consequence of that there is still, in my opinion, a debt due to these people by the Land Commission.  They made promises to these tenants and they have not yet carried them out.  The conditions then existing according to the Land Commission justified advances to these tenants for improvements. These promises, as I have said already, have not been kept. The Land Commission in that matter cannot be relieved of what they considered was their duty at the time. There are a number of people in the County Leitrim, and in one estate in particular, who can produce positive evidence of promises of money made by the Land Commission towards improvements to be carried out to their holdings.  These promises where made by the Land Commission inspectors. I consider these promises should be redeemed by the Land Commission.  At the time there were difficulties which prevented the Land Commission carrying out these full schemes of work.</P>
    <P>I am also aware that when land is being distributed there are in most cases complaints that unfair methods are being used.  I am fully aware of the difficulties in most parts of the country in some of the congested areas about the division of any land that is available there, and, at the same time, to divide it so as to give satisfaction to the community generally. I say that because the demand for land is so much in excess of what is available that it is quite beyond human nature almost to give satisfaction.  For that reason I am very slow to make charges in the <Col N="2348" /> matter, but I do know after investigation, that in some cases there has been very unfair discrimination and the work of distribution has not been in comformity with what would be the national viewpoint on these matters.  It has been generally held, and, I am convinced, with justification, that perhaps the Minister responsible and the Parliamentary Secretary ought to be sympathised with in that connection, inasmuch as most of the official work done by the Department is in the hands of officials who are very unfavourable, as they represent a type of landlordism and represent tyranny of the worst sort.  Unfortunately, I am afraid that those are the forces that are making the Land Commission to-day so very unpopular with the community generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some matters arising out of this Vote on which I would like to say a few words.  There is, first, the question of the Gaeltacht Housing Act.  Deputy Derrig asked for information on the matter, and I, too, would like to have some information as to the progress that is being made, if indeed any progress is being made, in putting this Gaeltacht Housing Act into operation.  We know that there were hundreds, possibly thousands, of applicants for grants under the Gaeltacht Housing Act.  After a considerable time forms of application were issued. After a considerable time, too, these forms of application were filled.  It is a little difficult to fill them, as they were all issued in Irish.  These forms have been sent to the Land Commission.  I think most of them where sent about February and March. Since that time, so far as we know, nothing has been done.  I learned on inquiry that four inspectors were being appointed, or, in fact, were about to be appointed, to examine these claims.  I should like to say on that matter, that in my opinion four inspectors are not at all sufficient to deal with the work that is to be done. It will take four men a very long time indeed before they are in a position to make any grants.  I would <Col N="2349" /> like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary how soon he expects the grants will be available for the building of houses under the Gaeltacht scheme. When the Bill was going through the Houses we all anticipated that at least some of the work would be done this summer, but as things appear now, it would seem that the chance of the money being available for building operations this summer is very small indeed.  I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will give us some indication of the progress that is being made, and tell us how soon applicants can expect their claims to be examined, in what order they will be examined, what districts will be taken first, what type of applicant will first be considered, and how soon he expects money to be made available under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Clery, I think, referred to the cases of the non-vesting of tenants whose holdings were taken over in some cases so far back as 1914 and 1915.  Like Deputy Clery, I know some of these cases, and I cannot understand what is the cause of the delay.  I know one particular case, and I have been endeavouring since 1926 or 1927 to induce the Land Commission to settle up a few tenants on a particular estate, and to vest their holdings.  After some considerable time and a good deal of investigation on the part of the Department and their inspectors, they prepared a scheme and vested two of the tenants, but there are still three or four tenants in the same position as that in which they were in 1913.  I think that the matter will be brought to a head very soon, because one or two tenants, in despair, refused to pay further annuities in the hope that that will be one of the weapons that will bring the Land Commission to a sense of responsibility and get them to act. Generally, that has the effect of getting the Land Commission to take notice of a tenant when he refuses to pay rent any longer.  In regard to the particular type of case about which I should like to have a statement from the Parliamentary Secretary, there are many holders who, for one reason or another, have <Col N="2350" /> allowed their arrears of annuities to accumulate.  Decrees have been got against them, a seizure of their stock has been made, and for all practical purposes, the land is derelict.  They cannot set the land because, if stock is put upon it, it will be liable to seizure.</P>
    <P>I do not know what, if any, arrangement the Land Commission makes in such cases to allow the land to be used, or whether it is their policy or practice to leave a farm derelict and make it so that the tenant, not being able to use the land himself, can take no steps to put in a crop or to stock it.  I have been asked by more than one person what is the policy and practice of the Land Commission in regard to this particular type of case, because unfortunately there are quite a number of these cases all over the country.  It is not good for the country as a whole, just as it is not good for the tenant, that these farms should be left derelict and unproductive. I do not know whether it is a fact that the Land Commission by their regulations do that, whether their regulations have that effect, but a statement from the Parliamentary Secretary will have the effect of clarifying the position.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Clery that if one were to judge by figures alone, as quoted by the Parliamentary Secretary, one would get the impression that very great progress indeed was being made, but certainly that does not square with one's own personal experience.  I would bear out what Deputy Clery has said in that respect, and especially what Deputy Nally has said in regard to the list of estates which he quoted, in what might be termed his annual speech on the Land Commission.  Like Deputy Corry, I hope that Deputy Nally will mark his displeasure with the Land Commission over its delays in dealing with those estates in his constituency by taking the one consistent action which is open to him, namely, voting for this Estimate to be referred back.  I have, however, my doubts on that point.</P>
    <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to give some indication as <Col N="2351" /> to how what I might call the outside work of the Land Commission keeps pace with the inside work, whether there is any clogging from one side to the other, whether the officials inside are able to keep pace with the work done by the outside staff, or vice versa, or whether there is complete co-ordination between the two.  One hears statements from one side or the other that at one time the outside staff cannot go ahead because the indoor staff is unable to keep pace with them, while a contrary opinion is often expressed on the other side.  We would like to have some light on that aspect of the Land Commission's activities. Deputy Derrig referred to the good work done by the Land Commission in regard to cases in Carlow where the land was taken over by co-operative committees in 1920, in the Sinn Fein days.  He said that they had carried out the work there to the general satisfaction of all concerned, and he gave them credit for the work they had done.  I regret, however, to say that my experience in regard to one particular case does not coincide with that of Deputy Derrig.</P>
    <P>As every effort has been exhausted to induce the Land Commission to revise the work they have done in this particular case to which I wish to refer, I feel there is no option left to me but to bring the matter before the Dáil.  The Parliamentary Secretary is well acquainted with the case to which I refer, because I have brought it to his notice more than once.  It is on the border of my constituency, and to me and a great many others the action of the Land Commission appears to have been rather extraordinary.  It occurred in the case of the McDonnell estate at Headford.  Very briefly I will recite the facts.  This estate, which comprised practically all the town of Headford and 600 acres of demesne land in the neighbourhood, was purchased in 1920 by a society called the Killursa Co-operative Farming Society.  There were about thirty members, about a third of the tenants, all of them shopkeepers and <Col N="2352" /> traders in the town, and some of them had large farms.  Several of them were not tenants on the estate. The land and houses in the town were valued for about £12,000, and the Land Bank advanced a sum of about that amount.  The members subscribed a certain amount, but the amount they subscribed, in proportion to the value of the land, appears to me to have been ridiculously small&mdash;only £750.  Thirteen tenants became guarantors for the balance of the necessary deposit&mdash;namely, one-fourth.</P>
    <P>In 1922 several of the houses in the town were sold to tenants, houses of a total value of £4,500 and in some cases&mdash;and this is particularly to be noted in view of what happened afterwards&mdash;the purchase price was as high as 17 years' purchase. The purchasers felt that it was to their advantage to buy the houses, firstly, in order to help to provide the sum necessary to be lodged in connection with the estate, and secondly, they felt that they would be compensated for the high price they were paying by the fact that they would get divisions of land later on.  The Land Commission took over this estate in 1925. They paid £10,691 to the Land Bank, and although house property of the value of £4,500 and other assets had been disposed of, including some valuable timber, the mortgage had been reduced only by £2,500 up to 1925.</P>
    <P>It would appear from the information at my disposal and from all the particulars available, that the Land Commission did not, as it was bound to do and as one would expect it to have done, make any proper investigation whatever into the constitution and working of the Killursa Land Society either then or subsequently. There have been all kinds of allegations as to irregularities, want of compliance with statutory regulations, irregular audits or no audits whatever.  All these have been alleged&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In any case there is evidence that the rules of the Society were not complied with. There is evidence that their accounts were not audited for four years. There is evidence that they were audited and that the auditor signed them with reservations.  There was that evidence in any case.  The question of the division of the estate came up and in 1926 a memorial was sent to the Land Commission asking that their inspectors should visit the estate and take over the division of the land themselves.  I dare say that was done because of the dissatisfaction that existed in regard to the general working of the Society.  It appears that the Land Commission Inspector visited the place at the time, and he gave something in the way of a verbal promise to the tenants that the Land Commission would take over the division of the estate.  There is, however, a more definite statement than that, because at that time I was asked to interest myself in the matter, and I wrote to the Land Commission.  That was in January, 1927, and I got this reply from the Land Commission:</P>
      <P Just="Right">Department of Lands and Agriculture, Dublin.</P>
      <P Just="Right">8/1/'27.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Chara,&mdash;In reply to your letter of the 6th instant, with enclosure, regarding lands purchased by Killursa Co-operative Farming Society at Headford, I have to inform you that these lands, having been purchased by this Society, through the assistance of the National Land Bank, have become vested in the Land Commission under the provisions of the Land Act, 1923.  Several representations have been made here and to the Land Commission regarding the security deposit and the division of the lands.  The provisions of the Land Act, 1923, with reference to security deposits <Col N="2354" /> are to be amended and extended by the provisions of the Land Bill at present before the Dáil in a preliminary stage, and when these provisions will have been enacted the deposit of this Society will be dealt with as shall be provided.</P>
    <P>Here is the important part of it:</P>
    <P>As to the division of the lands, it was open to the Society, had they then thought fit, to have made division of the lands before vesting in the Land Commission. Probably such division was not feasible, but now that the lands are vested in the Land Commission, no division can be made except by the Land Commission, and no member of the Society nor any other person has power or authority to make a division of the land.  Representations may be submitted, or schemes proposed, and the Land Commission will consider them, but will not be bound to adopt any schemes or allotments not framed by themselves.</P>
    <P>That letter was addressed to me from the Department of Lands and Agriculture in January, 1927. Despite that very definite statement the Land Commission asked the Society to draw up a scheme.  I will just read a short paragraph from a letter from one of the people concerned, stating what did happen.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Committee thereupon (after being directed to draw up a scheme) convened after two hours' notice, a meeting of the shareholders or depositors and about eight or ten of the other tenants, at which their solicitor's managing clerk read out a long document giving Mr. H. P. McClory, a Galway engineer, certain powers in regard to the preparation of a map, etc.  This document was signed by all present, but none of the signatories outside a few members of the Committee can say definitely what Mr. McClory's powers actually were to be.  This plan was sent to the Land Commission, <Col N="2355" /> and subsequently two of their inspectors visited the estate.  The only local investigation made by these inspectors was to receive a small deputation.  Very extensive alterations were made in Mr. McClory's original plan as a result.  These alterations were made entirely at the expense of the tenants, other than recognised members of the Society, who by paying large sums for their dwelling-houses, had enabled the Society to stave off early collapse.</P>
    <P>As a result the division was made in this form: 24 members of the Society got 428 acres, 29 non-shareholders got 120 acres, 7 congests from an adjoining estate got 30 acres each and there was a grazing division for cows from the town of 30 or 40 acres.  In that way the whole 600 acres were disposed of. That scheme of division excited very grave dissatisfaction&mdash;so much so that fifty tenants headed by the local clergy, sent a memorial to the Land Commission in February, 1929.  I do not want to read this memorial. It is a lengthy one and it sets out in great detail the objections which the local tenants had to the scheme of division which had been accepted by the Land Commission, although it was stated in the letter addressed to me that no division could be made except by the Land Commission themselves.  The Land Commission would not, I feel certain, be responsible for the scheme of division which was eventually made and which has now been sanctioned by them, if they had divided the land themselves.  I do not believe any official of the Land Commission would be responsible for the kind of scheme that was eventually drawn up.</P>
    <P>Just to show the opinion that was held in the locality I will read resolutions that were passed at a Cumann na nGaedheal meeting in the neighbourhood some time in March and published in the local papers.  They are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2356" /> That this general meeting of the Headford Branch of Cumann na. nGaedheal sympathise with and fully support the claims of the tenants who have addressed a memorial to the Minister for Lands relative to the allotment of holdings in the Headford demesne estate on the 12th February.</P>
    <P>That we emphatically repudiate the claim of the committee of the Killursa Co-operative Farming Society, who do not represent one-third of the tenants, to be the sole authority in regard to the distribution of holdings.</P>
    <P>That we regard the scheme of allotment sponsored by them as an attempt to frustrate the whole purpose of the Land Act of 1923 and a gross betrayal of the general body of tenants.</P>
    <P>That approval of such a scheme, if persevered in by the Land Commission, will result in seriously discrediting the Government and be a source of danger to the public peace.</P>
    <P>There is undoubtedly a feeling in that district that the Land Commission have been guilty of grave dereliction of duty in the matter because as things have turned out, large shopkeepers in the town of Headford, many of whom have big farms already, have succeeded in getting big divisions of this farm, while others who had at least an equal claim have been put off with three, four or five acres of indifferent land.  I do not believe that the Land Commission, if they had the division of the farm, would have dreamt of making such an inequitable division as has been made.  The attitude of the Land Commission is set out in letters from them.  It is summed up in this way:</P>
    <P>As the Society were the real owners of the lands and as there had been no default in payment of the purchase annuity, the Land Commission did not wish to interfere with the Society in their scheme for distribution of the lands, nor had they any power to do so, provided the Land Commission <Col N="2357" /> were satisfied that the prices placed on the divisions were fair, and that the proposed repurchasers were solvent persons, able to work their plots and pay the purchase annuities.</P>
    <P>The part I dispute is where they say they have no power to interfere.  The tenants got legal advice from an eminent lawyer, Mr. Lavery, K.C., who gave quite a contrary opinion as to the power of the Land Commission in these matters.  It would be very strange indeed if the Land Commission, which is paying out a large amount of public money, could have no say whatever if the simple condition that there was a fair price put on the land were carried out&mdash; that in other words it did not matter who got the land, whether they were deserving of it or not, they would have no voice whatsoever, and would not insist on having a voice in the division of it, in these circumstances.  I think that is an attitude that cannot be maintained. It cannot be held that the Land Commission have no responsibility. Public money is being expended, and steps should be taken to see that the division was equitable.  I certainly think that this is a case where there ought to be further action taken by the Land Commission.  I think it is a case they should have interfered in, and that they should have taken over the division of the land.  There is now at least a strong claim that those tenants who purchased at what would now seem to be exorbitant prices, should get some consideration.</P>
    <P>It may be said that these men put their money into the land and took certain risks, that they have got back any money they put down with five per cent. interest, and are at no loss.  I repeat that the Society's affairs did not get the investigation they should have got.  Various allegations have been made not only regarding the sale of the timber to which I referred but to the sale at practically a quarter of its value of the tolls and customs of the town of Headford.  That took place since <Col N="2358" /> the land was vested in the Land Commission.  In all its aspects, this appears to me to be eminently a case where there ought to be a very full public investigation of the facts. From the information at my disposal there is very grave discontent, and in the words of the resolution passed at the Cumann na nGaedheal meeting&mdash;and they are not revolutionaries&mdash;it is a source of danger and a menace to the public peace. While that state of affairs exists I think it is the duty of the Land Commission to hold something in the nature of a public inquiry or investigation into the whole question of the working of this Society.  Unless that is done I fear that the prophecy of the local Cumann na nGaedheal branch will be only too true, and that there will be disturbances, owing to the extreme dissatisfaction that exists because of the failure of the Land Commission to do what, in all circumstances, they were bound to do, namely, to see that where public money was being paid there was an equitable distribution of the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJamesCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with those who complain about the slowness of the Land Commission in vesting lands. There are a couple of estates in County Cavan&mdash;the Farnham and the Maxwell estates&mdash;in connection with which there is no possible doubt about the landlord's title, and I think that the schedules of these lands will probably be among the first to be lodged in the county, if not in the Twenty-six Counties.  I think it is about time that something was done for the tenants on these estates so that they would be relieved of the extra charges which they have to bear.  Another question with which I would like to deal is the division of lands, but I will approach it in a different way from the way it has been approached by other Deputies.  We have been working at this since 1923, and I think it is about time for some decision to be come to as to what lands are to be divided and what are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not making a plea for the non-division of land; I would simply <Col N="2359" /> like to ascertain what lands are to be divided.  Perhaps I might go a little further and divide that request into three heads.  I would first of all make (a) those lands which the Land Commission intend to divide; I would make (b) those lands which it is doubtful will be divided or not, and under (c) I would put those lands which will not be divided.  If this were done it would relieve the Land Commission of a good deal of trouble.  It would relieve their inspectors from going round to lands from year to year and making reports, first of all that they are not suitable for division, then on the next visit that some of them might be divided, and finally that all the land could be divided.  It would save a good deal of expense if some division could be made in that way, and it would allow people to deal in land.  Take the case of a small farmer who made some money during the war.  He may be waiting to see how the country develops, and he might like to buy a farm for one of his sons.  But before he does that he has to make certain that the farm he wishes to buy, which is probably part of an estate, will not be taken from him afterwards.  I think that this difficulty is responsible for a good deal of our emigration, because if the young men could get a guarantee that they would not be disturbed if they purchased land, I think that a number of them would settle down at home instead of emigrating.</P>
    <P>There is another point also with which I would like to deal but which I cannot approach directly because I am afraid of being ruled out of order.  I would not try to approach it at all, because it refers to another Department, except that I got a promise from that Department which has not been fulfilled up to the present.  Unfortunately the Vote of that Department has been passed, and consequently I want to raise the matter on this Vote.  The Land Commission are issuing civil bills against several people that I know who are unable to pay their annuities.  The people know that the land is there, <Col N="2360" /> but for a great part of the year they never see it; it is covered with water and they have no hope whatever of getting anything out of it.  Their crops and their hay are covered, and it is impossible to get at them.  I think that the Land Commission should approach the Board of Works to see if something can be done for these people, because it is unreasonable to expect them to pay rent for land which they see for only about three or four months of the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with most other Deputies, I want to refer to the question of the vesting of lands.  Some time ago I asked the Parliamentary Secretary if he was in a position to estimate roughly the loss that farmers incurred through the delay in vesting land.  He told me that he would not do any such thing, and I partly knew he would not, because it would be a very difficult problem.  A number of things have to be taken into account in these cases, one of the most important of them being that any sort of fixity of tenure does not exist during that period, and on account of that uncertainty farmers cannot make any attempt to improve their land. It is not likely that men will improve land that does not really belong to them, and the result is that there is increased unemployment and a decrease in the productive capacity of the land.  Several reasons have been given to me as to why this vesting is not done, among them being the difficulty of having all the equities properly satisfied.  I am not so sure about that, and I am almost forced to suggest that there are other reasons.  One of these other reasons would be that in most cases when small holdings are vested in the tenants the income tax ceases.  That is one of the reasons that I could suggest, but the reason that is given is that the equities cannot be satisfied. The satisfying of these equities must, in a number of cases, be a very difficult, cumbersome and expensive process, because I could name certain farmers who have been waiting for more than seven years to be vested. If the legal people have been hunting <Col N="2361" /> all round the world for seven years and have not found the people who have claims on that land, I think they should be written off and the tenants vested.  There are other farms that have been bought out under the 1923 Act, large farms on which a good deal of labour could be employed, the owners of which possess capital, and are willing to develop their land, but they will not make any attempt to develop, improve or drain it as long as this uncertainty exists.</P>
      <P>I think, with Deputy Cole, that it would be very advisable if the Land Commission would tell these people at once whether they were going to retain their land or whether they are going to vest them, but to have them hanging in that uncertain position adds a great deal to the discontent that prevails, and I must admit that a great deal of discontent does exist around this question of the division of land.  That has been brought about mainly by the great promises that were made some years ago.  We were told that the 1923 Land Act was automatic, that it would steam-roll everything, that the difficulties would disappear like snow, and people were led to expect great things.  What is really the result after all these promises?  In the beginning we had landlords. Because they exacted too high rents they had to appoint others to take their places, and they appointed agents.  The agents carried on the same principle; they failed, and then the Government took action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that if a little more common sense is not applied, a little more of an effort made to estimate what exactly are the conditions under which tenants have to work to-day, some other method of collecting these rents will have to be adopted.  It is certainly very hard for a tenant, who gets no assistance whatsoever from the Land Commission. Formerly an occasional landlord was perhaps a little kindhearted and gave assistance of some kind, but there is no assistance now. After the second instalment is due proceedings are taken, the State Solicitor gets control of the business. <Col N="2362" /> and instead of owing, say, £10, the unfortunate tenant finds that he owes £12 or £13, because costs are added on to cripple, disappoint and discourage him.  I should like to know what salary the State Solicitor has, or if he has to depend altogether on what he can knock out of these cases.</P>
    <P>Another point to which I would like to refer is the method of dividing up these lands.  The Land Commission have a very difficult duty to perform in the collection of rent, and it would be very advisable when they start to divide lands that they would do so in such a way as would give the tenant every facility for paying the rent.  After all, that should be done.  But what do we find in a number of cases?  I can mention estates in County Meath that were divided a couple of years ago, and the method of division was one of the most extraordinary things that I have ever come across.  I do not know what the reason for it was, and I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to suggest some reason. This was the case of an estate in which the landlord had provided houses for his workers, which were well built and sanitary, and each had a garden.  When the land came to be divided a few of the tenants who had houses and gardens got land near their houses.  Some of them did not. One of them got land at least a mile away from his holding.  A farm opposite his house was given to a tenant who came from another district and who had to build a house on it.  One would imagine that it would be much more equitable, suitable and reasonable that that particular tenant should have got a farm alongside his own house and garden.  What is the result?  His garden is too small to keep a cow, and if he attempts to keep one it has to travel a distance of one mile every morning and one mile back in the evening, and in the summer time it has to travel four miles per day.</P>
    <P>The next point is that these are small farms and that no profit can be got out of them except by tillage. <Col N="2363" /> How is this man to carry on tillage? If he starts to carry manure with the aid of a donkey to that land which is a mile away when will he have fourteen acres, or seven acres, or even one acre tilled?  It is most unreasonable.  The other man who came from outside and built a new house is engaged altogether in the rearing of pure-bred fowl and naturally it was his wish to be separated from others who had got fowl.  The fact is that they put him alongside other houses and he has the greatest difficulty and has to go to a good deal of expense to keep his fowl separated from those of his neighbours.</P>
    <P>Another case I came across is that of an uneconomic holder with one and a half acres.  His house may be thatched, but it is a good house. I take it that that man is legally an uneconomic holder and that the intention under the Land Act is that he should get a farm of land at some future time.  What happened in that case?  A farm of land at the back of his house was given to another tenant and the boundary fence runs so close to the back of the house that he has to trespass in order to thatch it. That is a senseless proceeding.  It may look very well on paper, but it is not business.</P>
    <P>The next question I want to refer to is that of bogs.  There are two or three very large bogs in my constituency and turf production brings in a great deal of money in districts where there are large bogs, so that there is no unemployment and no poverty.  We know that the value placed on the bogs of this country is something like £5,000,000 per year. It is stated that in some districts these bogs are to be divided up amongst different holders.  I think that is unfair.  Where there is a big bog it should be held and a warden appointed for the benefit of the poor of the locality.  Timber has been used up to a very large extent and in some districts there is a sort of famine in timber.  Coal is out of the question for these people and, as I say, a great deal of employment is given by turf cutting.  I believe <Col N="2364" /> that the Land Commission should retain these bogs for the benefit of the poor in these particular localities.</P>
    <P>Another matter I want to refer to is that of roads made through estates, principally under the 1903 Land Act.  This may be outside the province of the Land Commission, but it is more or less connected with their duties.  In most cases these roads join two main roads.  These roads were made through what are known as ranch lands.  A few houses were built on these lands, but in the majority of cases no houses have since been built on them.  The roads, which cost a good deal, and for which, I dare say, the tenants are still paying, are derelict.  No attempt is made to repair them.  They are all-important, and if we ever turn to tillage it is still more important that we should make an effort to keep them in repair.  The county council will not take them on except they are put into a perfect state of repair.  The tenants on the estates cannot be got to agree to put them repair.  I admit that this is a problem, but the Land Commission should consider the question and see if some solution cannot be found for it, because it is a calamity and a national loss to see these roads gradually falling into disrepair. Some of them are almost beyond repair. If tillage becomes more general, as it must in time on these small farms, these roads will be absolutely indispensable.  Cattle can travel over most of these roads but agricultural produce requires better roads for transport.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig referred to the question of mineral rights.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has promised to introduce a Bill to regularise the position in regard to minerals.  I have had a good many inquiries on this point, but there does not seem to be any definite arrangement made up to the present beyond the promise given.  I am not an authority on minerals, but people who presume to be authorities, and who do know something about minerals, seem most anxious to get certain facilities or certain rights for <Col N="2365" /> the purpose of discovering if certain lands contain any minerals.  Steps should be taken as soon as possible to deal with this matter, because these people must have some ground for believing that a definite supply of minerals is to be found.  Even if the minerals are not found, people of the neighbourhood would have the advantage of the employment given.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will tell us something definite about the question of vesting, which is causing a lot of agitation and uneasiness.  As I pointed out, other things are involved in it, such as the question of credit. Farmers are afraid to attempt any new projects until they are certain that the land will be in their possession.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOReilly" hpid="Mr. T. O'Reilly Mr. T. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all satisfied that this Department is doing all that it could do or one-half of what it should have done in the vesting of land, in the improving and making of roads to turbary, in the proper protection of land from floods by repairing breaches in embankments when they occurred, and in other cases by the deepening of rivers.  In my part of the country, the vesting of land is going on very slowly.  I know cases where land was purchased 19 years ago and still remains unvested.  That does not show very much sign of progress. There are also cases of people who are paying in annuities for bogs, but who cannot go to those bogs or make use of them because there are no roads to them.  It should be the duty of the Land Commission to see that these roads are made for the poor people who pay rent for the bogs.  As to the flooding of land, there are some instances down my way.  I know a case where a breach was made in an embankment in October, 1927, that is two and a half years ago, and a farm consisting of 44 Irish acres of land had 30 of these acres flooded.  The tide comes in upon them and they are under the sea.  The lady who owns that land is supposed to pay an annuity of £57 for the remaining 14 Irish acres <Col N="2366" /> available for agricultural purposes. I think it is a shame that this breach in that particular embankment was not made up, and the land saved from being flooded.  It is not fair to this woman who is the owner, and to other poor people to be asked to take upon themselves the burden of seeing that the farms are not ruined because of these floods.</P>
      <P>There is also the case of the small rivers.  Where an expenditure of £100 or £150 would deepen them and save the country round about from being flooded.  I know the case of one particular river&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Now, with regard to the Gaeltacht Housing Act, I went to the trouble to make out the number of electoral divisions to which this Act applies.  I find that it applies to 658 electoral divisions. Out of that number there are 120 reserved for special treatment that <Col N="2367" /> are supposed to get three-fifths of the grants.  Three-fifths of £60,000 would be £36,000, leaving £24,000 available for the remaining electoral divisions.  If you take 120 from 658 you get 538, and if you divide £24,000 by 538 divisions you will get, on the average for each electoral division, the handsome sum of £44 12s. 2d.  That would not go far towards the solution of the housing problem in the Gaeltacht when there is only £44 on an average for each of the remaining electoral divisions. £44 is about one-fourth of the amount supposed to be necessary to build a new house, so that, in other words, for every four electoral divisions there is only as much money available as would build one new house.</P>
      <P>I think, although I suppose this is not the time to say it, that the amount available should be multiplied by four, considering that in the last five years over one-and-a-half millions of money was voted in grants to people who could themselves build houses and did build houses.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there are cases of farmers, portions of whose land has been taken from them by the sea, and I think it is a great injustice to those people that they should be charged the full rent.  I know the case of a couple of farmers who have had <Col N="2368" /> each about three acres of land taken away by the sea.  They have written to the Department, but could get no satisfaction.  I think the rents should be reduced in such circumstances. These people should not be paying rent for what they have not got.  I should like to know what the Parliamentary Secretary will have to say when he comes to make his reply upon this matter as well as upon the bog roads and the making up of embankments in which breaches have been made by the sea.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillianRKent" hpid="Mr. Kent Mr. Kent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kent</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this amendment that this huge Estimate should be referred back for reconsideration. In doing so I consider that there should be huge savings effected in the Department of the Land Commission.  When I look through the Estimates I find under sub-head A&mdash;&ldquo;Salaries, Wages and Allowances&rdquo;&mdash;the salaries for the Commissioners amount to £5,200, with bonuses of £700.  I consider that a Commissioner who is paid £1,500 a year has quite a sufficient salary without adding to it a bonus. In the Secretariat and Registry Branch I find the cost is £7,796, and that there is a bonus of £2,110.  Under Establishment, including stationery, messengers, etc., there is a bonus of £3,940 on salaries of £10,221.  In the Accountant's Branch there is a bonus of £5,600 on a total for salaries of £17,709.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the collection branch the bonuses are £16,736 out of a total of £46,630.  In the case of the purchase and the resales branch the bonus amounts to £15,300.  Going through the Estimate, one finds that there is a total sum of nearly £50,000 a year given by way of bonus to highly-paid officials in the Land Commission. That is an enormous sum to be giving by way of bonus to highly-paid officials when we consider the present economic state of the country and the deplorable position in which farmers find themselves. To pay their rents and rates the farmers of the country are largely dependent on what they can make from the harvest.  In the case of last year's harvest there was practically <Col N="2369" /> no market for two-thirds of the grain that was offered for sale.  They were compelled to sell their oats at the very low price that was offered. Those who purchased the oats from them could find no market for it, with the result that for the coming harvest there will be no market at all.  The price of butter has dropped so much that it scarcely pays for the labour that has to be employed to milk the cows.  All that the creameries are offering is threepence per gallon for the milk.  I think that it is about time that in every branch of the Government service economy and retrenchment were carried out.</P>
    <P>The Dáil, I think, would be establishing a good precedent if it referred back this Estimate and insisted on doing away with the payment of bonus to these highly-paid officials in the Land Commission.  I think that the officials in that Department should move more cautiously and wisely when negotiating for the purchase of untenanted land in the future.  A few years ago they sent Commissioners of the landlord type all over the country who gave the landlords the price they asked for their untenanted land.  The result of that has been that the tenants who have been put in possession of these lands are to-day unable to pay their annuities or their rates. They are unable to pay what they owe to the shopkeepers or to give a living to their families.  At the present time the farmers would want their land free of rent and rates in order that they might be enabled to give a decent living to their families and pay a decent wage to the men working for them.  For that reason, I ask every farmer-Deputy to vote for this amendment.</P>
    <P>If they do I believe that a huge sum of money can be saved in the Land Commission Department and I hope that the same thing will follow in the case of other Departments. There is no doubt but that the cost of maintaining these highly paid officials in Government Departments has helped largely to reduce the farming community to their present <Col N="2370" /> state.  If something is not done soon to relieve the present situation, the farmers of this country will soon become a bankrupt and down-and-out people.</P>

I do so because of the statement made last night by the Parliamentary Secretary with regard to the great work which he claimed is being done by the Land Commission. I have brought to the notice of the Land Commission the condition of affairs that exist with regard to a number of estates in the County Tipperary.  Except in very few cases, I have got no reply in connection with them.  I want to refer now to the estate of Captain Charles Moore.  This is known as the Lattin estate.  Negotiations in connection with it have been going on during the last three years.  Mr. Nicko J. Green holds the estate in his own right.  This estate is grazed by the cattle of another rancher who holds extensive tracts of land all over the south.  In order to escape seizure of his cattle for bank debts, he had them removed from the lands during the night.  In the village of Lattin there are from eighteen to twenty families.  These people have neither space for a cow nor grass for a goat.  Some of them have to go near three miles for milk.  The small farmers around there have to take meadowing two and three miles away.  I would like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary what steps the Land Commission propose to take to have these lands broken up and divided amongst the uneconomic holders and landless men of the district.</P>

They have set the grass of it for the last two years. There are ten families in this estate and they have to pay from £3 to £4 an acre for conacre.  If the estate <Col N="2371" /> were divided up amongst them they would only have to pay the rent and rates.  It seems to me that the policy of the Land Commission is to take every half-penny from these poor people before the land is divided up and given to them.  I would also like to know what steps the Parliamentary Secretary is taking with regard to the Armitage estate in North Tipperary.  I wrote to the Land Commission on two or three occassions with regard to that estate. I would like to read for the House the following memorial which has been addressed to the Land Commission in connection with the estate of the late Mr. W. Bagwell Purefoy. The memorial is in the following terms:</P>
      <P>We, the undersigned, uneconomic holders in the immediate vicinity of, and formerly tenants on the above estate, desire to bring under your notice the fact that two outside farms on the estate, aggregating 104 acres 1 rood and 29 perches, S.M., in area, are being offered for sale by auction in Tipperary town on Saturday, May 31st, and as this land is urgently needed to relieve much local congestion, we appeal to the I.L.C. to get immediately into touch with the owners for the purpose of acquiring this land for division. Within a mile of the estate there are upwards of forty uneconomic holders, and withing a mile of these farms there are thirty small holdings varying in valuation from £2 10s. to £19, and averaging about £10.  On the next leaf we append the names, acreage and valuation, as a proof of the intense congestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the undersigned are hard working and industrious.  Their lands are overstocked, many going two or even three miles for conacre, grazing and meadowing.  All are prepared to pay a reasonable rent for additional land, and we are confident that the lands can be acquired by the Irish Land Commission at such a price as to leave <Col N="2372" /> the rent an economic one.  The applicants pay their annuities and rates regularly.</P>
    <P>Some of those lands were cleared within the last century, and in many cases the descendants of the evicted tenants are the present applicants.  The applicants are in a position to provide any additional stock that may be necessary if their holdings be extended, and some are prepared to exchange so as to facilitate the work of the Irish Land Commission.</P>
    <P>We would, therefore, respectfully request you to get into communication with the owners without delay and to give directions to your local inspectors to deal with the matter as one of special urgency.</P>
    <P>I would like to know what steps the Parliamentary Secretary proposes to take in connection with this place which is going to be sold by auction.  We are told by some of the Government spokesmen that we have turned the corner.  They also tell us that the policy of the Government has been a pronounced success. I do not think the farmers of the country can have any use for generalities of that kind when they see their capital, if they have any, vanishing year by year, and when they see their bank overdrafts expanding in alarming proportions. Farmers find that while the prices they are getting for their cattle and crops are not more than the 1914 prices, there has been an enormous increase in the price of the things they have to buy. In the case of oats, for instance, the newspapers quote the price at 12/- per barrel.  The fact is that oats is not bringing at the present time more than 10/- per barrel, which is a hopelessly uneconomic price.  It is time that this aspect of the question was considered seriously. Steps should be taken to give them protection for what they produce side by side with protection for what they consume.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to deal immediately with the estates I have <Col N="2373" /> now brought to his notice, and see that they are taken over by the Land Commission and divided up amongst the uneconomic holders and the landless people in the districts mentioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the case made for sending back this Vote is sufficiently strong and would justify the House in passing the amendment. Last evening the Parliamentary Secretary gave us an elaborate array of figures about land taken over and vested by the Land Commission.  We know what the process is in regard to vesting.  It is something like a surveyor driving along 1,000 miles of road to see if it wanted to be tarred.  I happen to know that a provisional list of estates for vesting was published in my county some years ago, but they are no nearer to being vested now than they were then, and I am sure that in five years' time the position will be the same. In March the Parliamentary Secretary told me that 11,216 holdings of tenanted land had been vested, comprising over 427,000 acres, and that there were 2,435,000 acres yet to be vested. At that rate it would take about 50 years to vest all the holdings.  The rent unpurchased tenants are paying for land amounts to £1,000,000, and at least one-third of that land is non-judicial. In many cases it is entitled to far more than a 10 per cent. reduction. At the very least £150,000 a year is taken out of the farmers' pockets owing to the inability of the Land Commission to do the work allotted to them under the 1923 Act. An Act was passed in 1923 by this House, and the farmers were led to believe by the then Minister for Lands and Agriculture that all the land would be vested in five years. There is not one-eighth of the land yet vested, and I suppose the vesting will proceed on the Kathleen Mavourneen system&mdash;the vesting may not be for years and it may never be vested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The state of affairs in my county is worse than in many other counties.  Up to a month ago only 62 small estates <Col N="2374" /> were vested, and in these there were only two or three holdings.  There are 243 estates yet to be vested, and there are 86,000 acres of tenanted land not vested.  Since I came into the Dáil I have accompanied deputations to the Parliamentary Secretary with other Deputies in connection with the Portsmouth estate, near Enniscorthy.  All the tenants on this estate are non-judicial, and as the land is rented as town park they are paying £3 or £4 per acre for it.  The Parliamentary Secretary promised that that would be taken out of the order of priority.  It has not been vested.  It must be an awful ordeal to take anything out of the order of priority.  There were also several deputations in connection with the George estate.  That estate is beside the sea-coast, and, as the Parliamentary Secretary is aware, the land is under water practically the whole of the twelve months.  Owing to the neglect of the drainage system on the estate by the landlord the land is under flood.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary also promised some months ago that that estate would be taken out of the order of priority, but it has not been taken out of it yet.  The tenants on that estate came to me on several occasions and asked would they pay any more rent, and I advised them to pay in the hope that something would be done for them.  The next time I will advise them to pay no more rent, for nothing will be done. Then there is the Bryan estate.  An inspector from the Land Commission visited the estate and he found several farms under two feet of water, so that he could not get into the houses.  That was on 29th June, 1928.  In the case of one holding, the man left it and went to Australia, and because his brother stayed in the house&mdash;I do not know how he got into it&mdash;the Land Commission processed him for the rent of the holding, notwithstanding the fact they were aware the land is under water.  The Parliamentary Secretary also promised, two years ago, that estate would be taken out of the order of priority, but I suppose it is still in priority.  I also wish to refer <Col N="2375" /> to another matter in my constituency with which I am concerned, and that is the drainage of the Inch river.  Last year the Land Commission undertook to erect a fence right beside the sea-coast where the river enters the sea, as the silting of the sand blocked the river and flooded the land.  Farmers who would benefit by drainage undertook to pay the cost.  In June, last year, I think, the work was undertaken by the engineers of the Land Commission. Certain piles were secured for the purpose of putting up this fence.  It seems to me the person in charge knew nothing about pile driving, good or bad.  They were large piles about 15 or 16 feet long.  He got the loan of a pile driver after considerable delay, but no one knew how to work it.  The piles were put down two feet when they started to split, and to get out of the difficulty they got a cross-cut saw and sawed them off.  They spent £200 or £300 putting up the fence, but the piles were put only two feet into the sand.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is trying to be humorous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Not a bit.  I wrote to the Parliamentary Secretary four months ago about this.  What I am stating is a fact, and the Parliamentary Secretary can find out the truth about it.  I do not make statements for the purpose of being humorous. In October, a slight storm swept the whole thing away.  That is not the really humorous part of it.  It has still to come.  About January when the whole wooden structure was swept away the Civic Guards, acting I suppose upon orders, started to raid the houses of farmers about two miles south of this particular place looking for the timber that had been swept out to sea and which they thought would come to land again two miles further south.  If they had looked into the matter they would have found out that when the timber was swept out to sea the wind was blowing in the opposite direction, and that would have saved them <Col N="2376" /> trouble.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will deal with the Portsmouth and George Estates.</P>
      <P>It is time something was done about the flooding of the lands on the George estate.  Many other matters under this Vote have been dealt with by other Deputies. In view of the fact that there are two and a half million acres of untenanted land yet to be vested I do not think the House should pass this Vote, but should express dissatisfaction at the way the Land Commission has been carried on and pass Deputy Derrig's motion to refer it back for reconsideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielCorkery" hpid="Mr. Corkery Mr. Corkery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corkery</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal case I have to refer to is one I have referred to every year while in this House on this Estimate.  Three years ago I referred to the Mount Massey estate, and twelve months afterwards I was informed a portion of this estate was to be taken over for distribution amongst the tenants living on the estate.  Two years have passed and we have heard nothing about it since.  The Land Commission seem to be very slow in dividing a small portion of this land amongst the tenants who are unemployed, most of them, for nearly nine months in the year.  They are badly off and a small portion of land would be useful.  It would keep them working for a time and help them to live. They have had to live for two or three years without it.  I do not know how long more it will be for the Land Commission to take it into their heads to divide up this portion of land.  The Land Commission are very slow when it comes to helping the people, but they have been fairly quick in other ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance if a farmer sends out his rent a month late it is sent back to him and he is told he must pay through a solicitor, and the solicitor will charge 10/- for sending it on again.  It is first sent back and the solicitor must get 10/- to send it on. It is rumoured that some of these State solicitors are making as much as £5,000 a year.  I do not know whether they are making it all <Col N="2377" /> through working for the Land Commission, but we hear rumours that they are making £5,000 a year and that their job is better than one in the Cabinet.  The Land Commission are quick enough when it comes to helping the solicitors, but when it is a case of helping the landless men it takes them years.  In the Mount Massey estate there is an agitation going on for over twenty years.  I hope 1930 will see the end of it.  I would like to say something also about the evicted tenants.  Very little, if anything, is being done for the evicted tenants.  Though everybody says something about them during election and other times, still they do not seem to get anywhere.  I hope some little thing will be done for these people also in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>If land could be acquired in just the same way as you purchase a horse or a cow I have no doubt it would be quite an easy matter to placate Deputies like Deputy Clery, Deputy Nally and other Deputies who are complaining of the slowness of the Land Commission in distributing land.  After all Deputies should realise at this stage that land can only be acquired in this country in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Land Code, that the owner has his rights as well as the tenant who is looking for the land, that the equities and the merits of every case have got to be taken into consideration and that, generally speaking, the processes that have to be gone through before land finally passes into the hands of the Land Commission for distribution are rather lengthy and involved.  Taking everything into consideration I think that the Land Commission is acquiring land to-day as fast as it is possible for them to acquire it under normal conditions, and I do not think it is likely that the rate at which land is being acquired and distributed at the moment can very well be increased except by a large increase of staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past year we distributed something like 50,000 acres of land, and the allottees who were placed in possession of that land are <Col N="2378" /> in a stronger position, at all events so far as security goes, than the allottees placed in possession of land distributed during the three or four years previous to that because of the fact that the allottees we gave land to during the last year were placed in possession of it on purchase agreements whereas the allottees given land in previous years are in only on temporary agreements.  Deputy Derrig referred to the fact that the Land Commission seemed to be proceeding more slowly this year than I gave Deputies to anticipate from my statement in the Dáil last year, and he went on to attribute that to the fact that the staff of the Land Commission was inadequate to deal with the huge amount of work on hands at the moment.  I am glad the Deputy has made that statement because he will probably recall that in a discussion on the estimates, I think it was two years ago, he said quite definitely and quite explicitly that he felt then that the Land Commission staff was too large and that it should be reduced to more reasonable proportions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I should make it quite clear that I have no reason to believe that they have not an adequate staff, but in justice to the Land Commission it is no harm to say that they say that themselves. Whether it is true or not I cannot say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Deputy is in favour of increasing the staff of the Land Commission for the purpose of enabling them to carry on the work of land distribution at an even faster rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible for me to answer the Deputy that if the Land Commission increased their staff they could increase the rate of progress in vesting lands and this applies to certain other sections of the Land Commission work as well, but so far as the vesting of land is concerned it is very necessary that you should have a properly trained staff for the purpose of dealing with that particular <Col N="2379" /> work.  It takes quite a long time to train a staff for that purpose and consequently it would mean that certain men who had experience of that particular work might have to be transferred from the particular duties they are engaged on to the vesting section.  This is a purely Departmental matter however and will be arranged departmentally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy referred at some length to the fact that in this year's Estimates provision is made for £12,000 to meet a deficiency in income derived from untenanted land. The Deputy will remember that two years ago a Supplementary Estimate was introduced to make good a deficiency extending over a period of years.  I think the amount of the deficiency was £25,000, and I think I pointed out quite clearly that the deficiency was only a temporary one, and the amount asked for in this Estimate of £12,000 is only intended to provide for the period between the gale day and the dividend day for the period of two months, from November to January and May to July, and when the untenanted land is vested in the tenants the money will be recouped to the Land Commission that it does not represent a loss and could not under any circumstances be regarded as a loss to the State.  I want to make that position quite clear.  The whole of the £12,000, however, is not intended to cover the loss in income on the land between the dividend day and the gale day.  A very small percentage of it is intended also to cover the losses on the working of these lands during a very short period, the losses in respect to herds' wages, rates, and so on.  At the present time it is the policy of the Land Commission to divide the land in the shortest possible time after possession of it has been taken.  This loss in respect of untenanted land has been reduced considerably during the past few years, and it is very likely that during the coming years the loss will be still further reduced. However, I want to make it perfectly clear that the loss is only a temporary one, and that on the vesting <Col N="2380" /> of these lands the loss will be recouped to the Land Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only a question of adjustment of the accounts, a question of the tenants paying on the 1st November instead of the 1st January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>It represents no loss at all to the tenants, except that the tenants are paying from 1st January and 1st July, and on vesting it will be on the 1st November and 1st May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is two months. Will they get credit for it in six or seven years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  It does not alter the position as far as the tenants are concerned at all.  It means simply changing the date of payment from one date to another. In the meantime the money must be paid by the Land Commission. Deputy Derrig next referred to the Land Bank and Committee cases.  I appreciate the tribute he paid to the Land Commission for the manner in which they carried out the distribution of Committee lands in County Carlow.  He went on to complain of delay in dealing with the balance of Land Bank and Committee lands.  I did state, as a matter of fact, in the Estimates discussion last year, that I hoped to have all the Land Bank cases dealt with before the end of this financial year.  It has not been possible for the Land Commission to dispose of all Land Bank cases during the past financial year.  There are seven of these still outstanding <Col N="2381" /> and it may be some months before these cases are finally disposed of. Above all things, it is very difficult to adjust the finances, of which, in many cases, there are no accurate records available.  The accounts, in the majority of cases, were very badly kept by the trustees or members of the Committee who were responsible for the management of them.  In some instances it was almost impossible to get information from the solicitors who were acting on behalf of the trustees or committees, and in other cases it was very hard to get information from the members or trustees themselves.  For these reasons the Land Commission has experienced exceptional difficulty in dealing with these estates.  However, as I stated, it is hoped that during the present financial year that at least all the Land Bank estates will be dissolved and a good proportion of the balance of the Committee cases.</P>
      <P>In connection with the Gaeltacht Housing Act, I stated when introducing this Estimate that 9,000 applications had been received so far.  Four inspectors have been appointed to carry out the provisions of this Act and to carry out the necessary inspectorial work in the country and are at the present moment engaged in sorting out these applications and selecting what, in their opinion, and in the opinion of the Land Commission, are the most deserving ones.  Probably on Monday next inspectors will go to the country to carry out inspection on the spot.  I was asked when the grants would be made available.  The grants are likely to be available in the course of the next few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Derrig referred to the footnote at the end of the Estimate relating to the salary paid to the Economic Geologist.  He asked me to explain to him the law relating to mines and minerals.  I think if the Deputy will refer to page 27 of the annual report for last year he will find a very clear explanation of the present position of the Land Commission with regard to the acquisition of mining and mineral rights.  At the present time, as the <Col N="2382" /> Deputy knows, mining and mineral rights are vested in the State, and the position, so far as the Land Commission is concerned, is that until the Oireachtas prescribes the manner in which these mineral rights are to be disposed of, they have no power to deal with them.  I understand that at the moment the introduction of a Mines and Minerals Bill is under consideration&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the Land Commission any power under Act of Parliament to make borings and all that kind of thing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at the moment, in view of clause 11 of the Constitution, which I think defines the position clearly with regard to mineral rights and mining rights.  At all events, the view of the Land Commission is that they have no rights in that respect until their duties with regard to the question of mines and minerals are clearly defined.  That can only be done by an Act of the Oireachtas, and, as I stated, such an Act is in contemplation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Derrig went on to deal with a reply which I gave to a question of his yesterday referring to the amount of money collected from tenants in respect of payments in lieu of rent.  From that he made what appeared to me to be the very extraordinary deduction, that it appeared to be in the interests of the Department of Finance to keep the tenants making payments in lieu of rent as long as possible, because of the fact that the Department collected a certain amount of income tax each year.  The position is, as I made it quite clear to the Deputy in my reply, that out of the gross sum paid in lieu of rent to vendors or their agents, the income tax due by them must be deducted before payment is made.  If the land had been vested the individuals themselves would naturally pay their proportions to the income tax authorities, but whilst these payments in lieu of rent are being made to the owners, it is the duty of the Land Commission to deduct the amount due in respect of income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2383" /> That is absolutely no charge whatsoever on the tenants who are making these payments in lieu of rent.  Income tax is deducted from the amount due to the vendors or the agents acting on behalf of the owners.  The issue of Land Bonds naturally depends on the amount of land we purchase in a particular year.  That amount varies to a certain extent each year.  It may be that in a particular year a greater area of land is acquired than in other years, and naturally there would then be a greater issue of Land Bonds.  The issue depends entirely on the amount of land that the Land Commission can deal with in any one year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Law wanted to know what has been the result of the reclamation experiment carried out in the Rosses area in Donegal.  The experiment, from the Land Commission point of view, has been a success, and it is contemplated at the moment to carry out similar experiments in other parts of Donegal.  Reclamation work is, of course, a very costly business.  At the present time we are carrying out several schemes of reclamation in various parts of the country.  One very large scheme was carried out in Connemara very recently, and though a rather costly scheme it has been successful. Similar schemes have been carried out in various parts of Mayo. The Mayo schemes are not so costly for the reason that we had not to build houses.  The reclamation schemes that are being carried out are more or less in the nature of an experiment, as we are endeavouring to ascertain on what lines it is possible to carry out reclamation work on a larger scale with the minimum of cost and maximum of advantage to the State.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clery referred to the resolution received from the Mayo County Council with regard to the delays in carrying out the migration of a number of large farmers from the County Mayo.  We realise that <Col N="2384" /> there are at the moment a certain number of large farmers in Mayo who are prepared to migrate from that county and who are willing to take land in exchange in Meath, Dublin, Kildare or Westmeath.  The difficulty is to acquire land to which these people are willing to migrate. Migration at the moment is held up for the reason that we have no land available for these migrants.</P>
    <P>During the past twelve months we have migrated twenty large farmers, and I am glad to say that all these migrants are very pleased with the change, and they are, so far, making good in their new environment. In Mayo the problem is a peculiarly complicated one for the reason that not only is it necessary to migrate large farmers elsewhere, but it is also necessary to carry out migration in the county itself&mdash;that is, migration from one portion of the county to another, or migration from one estate to another.  The difficulty in Mayo, and to a lesser extent in Galway and to a certain extent in Kerry and Donegal, is that in order to relieve congestion in these counties it is necessary, first, to acquire additional land, and in the second place, it is necessary to do away with the existing rundale lettings on many estates.  The difficulty we encounter very frequently in Mayo is the difficulty of getting the tenants to agree to give up their rundale lettings.  Deputy Clery referred a short time ago to the fact that there are numbers of tenants on estates bought out fifteen or twenty years ago, and that their holdings are not yet vested.  The delay is, in many cases, due to the fact that these tenants are not yet prepared to abandon their rundale lettings for the purpose of enabling the Land Commission to carry out a scheme of rearrangement of their holdings. On at least three estates that I know of at the moment the proceedings are held up and the vesting of these holdings is delayed because the tenants will now allow the Land Commission to carry out a scheme of rearrangement of their holdings.  In other cases vesting is delayed because <Col N="2385" /> it is necessary for the Land Commission to acquire additional land in order to give the tenants an addition to their holdings and at the same time to carry out some small scheme of rearrangement.</P>
    <P>In Mayo the position is peculiarly complicated.  While the Land Act of 1929 has undoubtedly given us additional powers in certain respects, I am afraid those powers are not altogether adequate for the purpose of enabling us to carry out rearrangements and re-adjustments on many estates at a reasonably rapid rate.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the difficulties with regard to vesting on many occasions in the course of debates on Estimates, and I do not think it is necessary for me to go into these difficulties again to-day.  The Land Act of 1929 was passed through the Dáil last July and, of course, it is yet too soon to experience any great advantage from the operations of that measure.  During the present financial year we do expect to experience considerable advantages from the Act.  Although the figures which I gave the House last night relating to vesting may not show a very great advance on the previous year, nevertheless a great deal of preliminary work has been done; a great deal more preliminary work leading up to the vesting of land was done last financial year than was done for many years previously. This work, taken in conjunction with the advantages which the Land Commission will enjoy from the 1929 Land Act will result, I anticipate, in a very substantial increase in the figures next year.</P>
    <P>I must confess that I could not follow Deputy Maguire at all.  He gave me the impression of one who is anxious that the defaulting annuitants should be compensated for leaving their holdings.  However, I will not pursue this point, as he is not present.  In some cases the Land Commission, when they cannot dispose of these holdings, take over the management of them themselves.  They are doing that <Col N="2386" /> in very few cases; I do not think there are more than half a dozen altogether. They let the land in grazing until such time as they recoup themselves for the arrears of Land Commission annuities.  In a few other cases proceedings are taken by the Land Commission in order to reacquire the lands.  At all events very little is done yet in that direction, because we are simply trying to reduce the arrears that accumulated during the last five or six years. Deputy O'Reilly referred to embankments on certain estates in Kerry, and he complained that tenants have to pay annuities to the Land Commission when their lands were flooded.  The impression I got from the particulars he mentioned was that there was a direct sale between the owner and the tenant, and the tenant undertook the responsibility for maintaining the embankment.</P>
    <P>In the majority of cases the tenants are responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of embankments. It is unfortunate that in many parts of the country the tenants have not recognised their responsibility, with the result that breaches have occurred and portions of their land have been flooded.  In other cases there was a certain sum of money deducted from the purchase money.  It was invested by the Land Commission, and out of the income derived money is being spent by local trustees on the upkeep of embankments on certain estates.  In some cases the money set aside for the purpose of maintaining embankments is entirely inadequate, and, if the embankments are to be properly maintained and strengthened so as to resist the tides, money may have to be made available from some other source for the purpose of supplementing the income from the trustee fund.</P>

      <P>Of course, I do not know the position at the moment.  I assume the tenant is responsible in <Col N="2387" /> that case for the maintenance of her portion of the embankment, and I assume there are a number of other tenants interested in the maintenance of the embankment as well as the lady you mentioned.  It appears to me that she is liable for the upkeep of her particular portion.  I would be inclined to think that in that case there was a direct sale between the owner and the tenants, and in such cases the tenants assumed responsibility for the upkeep and maintenance of embankments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to delay the House long, as the Army has been very considerably discussed on other occasions since Christmas last. It will be seen that the Estimate is much the same as last year.  That is to say, last year we got down to within the figure indicated as the normal figure for Army expenditure some years previously.  We are quite satisfied that we will continue within that figure.  The variation in the sub-heads allows for the natural fluctuation indicated by the differing needs of one year over another.  The biggest change naturally is in relation to the Reserve.  It will be remembered that last year we added a new branch to the Army in the way of a Volunteer Reserve.  The &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B&rdquo; Reserve continued to grow.  That explains the increase in that sub-head.  I think that it is the biggest increase there is.  As the Army College will be opening shortly we have found it necessary to put down a larger sum for military educational courses, as it may be necessary from time to time to send specially selected officers abroad to learn certain matters in regard to the more technical side of their profession.  The equitation side of the Army has been enlarged, so that we now propose to have our team competing in various countries at horse shows.  Already, I think, as the House knows, they have been very successful in the shows in which they competed last year. There have been no new developments in the Army.  The House seemed to show a certain curiosity about the development of the Volunteer Reserve.  During July and other months of the summer between 700 and 800 Volunteers will be undergoing training in various camps in the country.  As the Army has been very much discussed since Christmas and as the Estimate speaks for itself, I do not know of any other matter which is of particular interest to the House.</P>

      <P>As the Minister for Defence says, the policy of the Government in relation to the Army has been pretty fully discussed this year.  I do not think that anything that we may say here to-day would be likely to alter that policy.  We have already stated what we think of the Government expenditure of this huge sum, a total amounting to £1,789,000.  We do not believe that <Col N="2391" /> the country gets value for the money expended in this direction, and we propose to vote against the Estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister whether it is his intention or policy to allow the cadets of the O.T.C. to specialise in any particular branch of military activity. I understand that a large number of cadets are particularly interested in one branch of the Army and are anxious to be drafted into that particular section, the technical section. I do not know whether the Minister would be prepared to allow them to do so.  With regard to the sub-head which was referred to last year, that in connection with a sum of £10 for assistance to civil aviation, I understand that the Minister for Defence is not the Minister responsible for the development of civil aviation, and I presume that if I do not go into that matter on this Vote we will be entitled to discuss it on the Vote of the Department of Industry and Commerce, because the Minister for Industry and Commerce is, I understand, responsible for the development of civil aviation.  The only reason that I raise this now is because there is no mention in the Estimates of the Ministry for Industry and Commerce of any sum being voted to the development of civil aviation.</P>

      <P>As to the question that Deputy Esmonde put to me about the O.T.C. and special services, naturally when a man joins the Volunteers as a cadet, his first training will be in the more fundamental things connected with the military profession, that is to say, more infantry training.  We are prepared to allow them to specialise within certain limits.  We have also to take into consideration the methods of their training.  Their training is mostly in the evenings and they have only a fortnight or three weeks fulltime training in the summer, but within the limits of possibilities they will be allowed to act for one service more than another.</P>

      <P>This matter has also been very exhaustively discussed this year on the Act that I introduced earlier in the year.  The Estimate is £45,000 below that of last year.  That <Col N="2395" /> is due to the fact that as we come to the end of the consideration of the cases presented for pensions it becomes less necessary to make provision for arrears.  Under the Army Pensions Acts of 1923 and 1927, almost all the claims have now been heard, with the exception of certain claims that require very protracted investigation, and, as Deputies know, the claims under the Military Service Pensions Act of 1924 ceased to be heard some two and a half years ago.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase under the headings Salaries, Wages and Allowances and Travelling Expenses shown in this Estimate is apparent rather than real.  The figures when the Estimate was before the House last year were under sub-head A, £75,780, and under Travelling £6,570.  During the year certain officers retired, and it was necessary to fill their places by officers seconded from other Departments. The cost of these officers was on the Estimate of the other Departments last year, and now the cost appears back.  The figures were changed to the reduced figures here only when the Supplementary Estimate was introduced in the early part of this year and when it was <Col N="2399" /> clear that the money would not be expended.  There is an error in printing in sub-head F.2, where the increase should read £6,600 and not £16,600.</P>

      <P>Last year, and the year before, I and other Deputies raised a question on this Vote as to the expense of the head office, and in particular in regard to the number of Commissioners. The Minister, who appeared to appreciate the fact that the office, from that point of view, was probably a bit top-heavy, agreed that something might be done to find another post for one, or maybe even two, of the Commissioners. I wonder if the Minister has given any consideration to that matter during the last twelve months, and if he now sees any way of reducing the overhead cost, which is very heavy.  In my opinion, it is too heavy for the services the Department gives.  I believe that one Commissioner would be sufficient.  Even though one of the other two Commissioners is what might be described as a technical Commissioner, being a medical officer, I believe work might be found for him in some other Department.  I think the Department could be run without such a technical adviser.  There are other medical men in the service who, when a medical question arises, could be got to give advice to the Department. I should like to call the Minister's attention to this matter once more, as I think two of the three Commissioners could be dispensed with.  We do not want to incur the extra expense of sending them out on pension, but it should be possible for the Minister, in consultation with other members of the Ministry, to find in some other Department, perhaps in his own Department, employment that would be suitable for one, if not two, of what might be called the junior Commissioners, or even perhaps for some of the other officials who, in my opinion, are too numerous.</P>

      <P>There is a matter I should like to bring to the Minister's attention.  There must be, all over the country, a very large number of people who have been contributing to national health insurance since it was established, and who never had anything from it.  I know quite a number of such people who have never got any benefit, and probably never will.  I am sure that a good many of the societies must have a very large sum of money accumulating owing to cases of that kind.  It seems to me that when these people arrive at the age of seventy, and no longer have to contribute to national health insurance, and, in a great many cases, are more or less compelled to take the old age pension, it would be a very good thing if some bonus were paid to them.  The State contributes to this.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the Commissioners, the Deputy, I think, understands that I am quite at one with him on that matter.  The matter did get my further consideration recently.  It will be remembered that when dealing with the National Health Insurance Act of 1929 I gave some kind of undertaking with regard to legislation for the amalgamation of approved societies.  That matter has been engaging my attention since, and I was rather unwilling <Col N="2401" /> to tamper with the present form of the Commission until we had arrived at some definite conclusion in regard to the lines on which the amalgamation of the societies might go.  The question of the amalgamation of societies is under consideration between myself and the Commissioners, and certain interchanges of opinion and discussions have taken place between the Commissioners and the advisory committee representing the approved societies.  I am not able to say that it has gone beyond that stage at present, because there are a limited number of ways in which we can bring about a certain amount of amalgamation of societies, and the selection of one or other of these ways will require a certain amount of further thought before we can venture to say that any one of them would be the best. I have been delayed in dealing with the question of the Commissioners for the reason that I do not like to tamper with them until we have come to some conclusion on the other matter.</P>
      <P>With regard to the general overhead cost of the National Health Insurance Department it has to be borne in mind that the Department performs outdoor inspection for the Department of Industry and Commerce in connection with unemployment insurance, and that the cost of that work is estimated to be about £13,000.  A further reduction of staff will, I think, be possible when presenting the estimates next year, arising out of the passing of the National Health Insurance Act of 1929.  It may be possible to reduce the staff by about thirteen in different classes.  As to the number of societies, I think I gave the figure before as sixty-six.  However, I have not the figure in mind just now, but I could have it conveyed to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the proposal that Deputy Wolfe makes is outside the present scheme, we have to bear in mind that if anything has to be introduced like that it means legislation, and it means reviewing the finances of the whole scheme.  It is worth <Col N="2402" /> while remarking that the contributions paid by employers and employees for the year 1923 amounted to £425,017, and that for the year 1929 the partly estimated figure is £552,000, an increase of approximately 29.7.  When we come to consider the benefits paid, we find that the total expenditure on benefits in 1923 was £439,337, and that the estimated expenditure for the year 1929 is £716,000, or an increase of 62.7 per cent. over 1923 as compared with an increase of 29.7 in respect of contributions from employers and employees.  So that if there was at any particular time a margin in the insurance fund for giving gratuities to persons at 70 years of age, it is clear that there is no such margin now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJamesCraig" hpid="Sir James Craig Sir James Craig">
      <NameTxt>Sir James Craig</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to find that the Minister has seen it right to endeavour to reduce administration expenses.  Attention has been repeatedly called to the very high administration expenses of this office compared with the amount of money that goes through the office.  The figures at the present moment are over £83,000 spent in administration, and the Government part of the money that they put through their hands is only £225,000.  Of course, I admit there is a great deal more money to be dealt with than appears there.  I want to know if the Minister will kindly tell me whether there is any improvement as far as approved societies are concerned, in making hospital treatment an additional benefit.  I have complained here on several occasions in connection with approved societies, that while some of them were quite willing and had adopted this method of paying hospitals for treatment at least 25/- a week, which covers half of the total expenses, some of the larger ones and the ones that seem to be very well off indeed refuse to make hospital treatment an additional benefit. I want to know from the Minister if there has been any improvement in the past year in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point which is rather confusing, namely, medical <Col N="2403" /> certification and district medical referees.  The amount is £4,600 for the present year, and £36,872 for the previous year.  I have not been able to satisfy myself as to why this great reduction has occurred.  If one looks one finds the explanation in item G: &ldquo;The expenses of providing medical certificates of sickness owing to the absence of medical benefit in Saorstát Eireann in accordance with a scheme prepared by the Insurance Commission with the approval of the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;  There was an Estimate of £13,000 for the previous year.  I take it that amount was not used.  I think the Minister ought to explain to us what is the meaning of that great reduction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrThomasHennessy" hpid="Dr. Hennessy Dr. Hennessy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hennessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know if the Minister, following the example of Northern Ireland, has any intention of including medical benefit under the Insurance Acts. There is a Bill at present going through the Northern Parliament making provision for medical benefits.  Dispensary doctors are not adversely affected by that Bill.  They retain their present salaries and their pension rights are not interfered with at all.  Here in the Saorstát there are the same reasons for medical benefits, and the only justification for keeping them out is the alleged medical service we have&mdash;the Poor Law Medical Service&mdash;which caters for insured people.  A very large proportion of insured people who receive medical treatment under the Medical Charities Act receive it by the abuse of the Medical Charities Act.  They have also in Northern Ireland changed the whole face of it by defining what a poor person is under the Medical Charities Act.  In Northern Ireland a servant in receipt of £20 a year, with board and lodgings, is not considered eligible for treatment under the Medical Charities Act.  It is different in the Free State, where we have workers who could easily pay 1d. a week for medical benefits, treated as poor persons. Moreover, the whole thing is aggravated by the very bad treatment poor law medical officers receive, <Col N="2404" /> especially in the cities.  In Dublin they are amongst the worst paid in Ireland, and the Poor Law Commissioners who have received applications to improve their position have turned them down.</P>
      <P>I should also like to ask the Minister, in connection with the reduction on the administration side of the Insurance Acts, why he allowed the reduction in the certification grant last year to be put to the credit of this reduction.  That was taken out of the pockets of the Poor Law Medical Officers in rural Ireland, who are only receiving a capitation fee of 2/- and 2/6 for that certification, varying according to density of population.  That already has proved a very small remuneration, and a justification, it appears, for the reduction in the certification grant was that the cost of administration of medical certification in accordance with the dispensary area instead of the county area was more expensive.  Anybody who knows anything about medical certification knows the county area is simply quite an impossible basis on which to distribute certification money.  The Minister knows all about that already.  I hope he will give instructions to the National Health Commissioners to cease making the reductions that they made last year.  It is a thoroughly dishonest proceeding, and I can characterise it by no other term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Sir James Craig, I should point out that under the National Health Insurance Act, 1929, Insurance Committees dealing with sanatorium benefit are abolished.  Sanatorium benefit was taken off as a charge from National Insurance funds, and medical certification was made a charge upon the funds of the societies instead of voting money from the State.  So that medical certification proper will be a charge in future upon National Health Approved Societies' funds.  The figure of £4,600 is the figure for the getting of second medical opinion, which will continue to be borne as a State charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to what Deputy Hennessy <Col N="2405" /> said, the deduction of £800 is a deduction under, I think, Section 22 or 29 of the National Health Insurance Act of 1929, whereby the Minister is empowered to make this deduction. I do not think the Deputy will ask me to argue the case of the distribution of the certification money on a dispensary basis as against a county basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrThomasHennessy" hpid="Dr. Hennessy Dr. Hennessy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hennessy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reduction that I am concerned with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It costs more to distribute these moneys in accordance with the wishes of the medical certifiers than it would cost if the money was distributed in the more equitable way that appeals to the Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have undertaken to meet the wishes of the medical certifiers in the matter, but the National Health Insurance Act, 1929, gives authority for the recovery of the additional cost.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Sir James Craig on the question he asked in regard to hospital benefits, I have not yet come across the total number of societies.  I think the figures are 65 societies and nineteen branches.  Under the general heading of additional benefits there has been an increase. In cash value there has been an increase of from £3,315 in 1923 to £33,000 in 1929.  As regards the form of these benefits, the non-cash additional benefits are as follows: dental benefit 47 societies.  19 branches; hospital, etc., benefits, 39 societies, 15 branches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJamesCraig" hpid="Sir. James Craig Sir. James Craig">
      <NameTxt>Sir. James Craig</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>You might say fifty per cent. of the societies and the great majority of the branches. Optical benefits 29 societies and 18 branches; for the provision of medical and surgical appliances, seven societies and sixteen branches.  The granting of hospital benefits to members as well as the granting of additional benefits generally depends <Col N="2406" /> on the amount of surplus that each society has at the present moment. The third valuation of approved societies is being gone on with now. In view of the figures that I have quoted with regard to the increase in general expenditure on benefits, as compared with contributions, I do not know whether the next valuation will show that the societies are in a stronger position than they were when the second valuation was carried out.  The extent to which they are weak or strong will depend on whether the additional societies can afford to give hospital benefits or not.  It is a question of money. I take it the societies are rather willing to give all the benefit they can, but perhaps they concentrate more on the dental benefit, and I think there is something to be said for that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in this Estimate arises out of the fact that during the end of last year and the beginning of this year patients in the asylum from Northern Ireland were transferred from it by the Government of Northern Ireland, the numbers being sixteen males and four females.  Deputies will see on page 153 of the Estimates that the repayment from the Government of Northern Ireland last year was <Col N="2407" /> £2,560.  We lose that now as an appropriation-in-aid.  There is a nett increase of £1,669, but Deputies will understand that with 116 patients now as against 136 when the patients of Northern Ireland were in the asylum, it has not been possible to reduce the overhead costs in the same proportion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is not much that can be said on this Estimate. While we realise that the nett increase arises from the fact the Minister states, that patients from the Six-County area have been transferred to some institution in that area, nevertheless we feel that the Estimate for this institution appears to be too high.  The Minister has stated that the number of patients now in the institution is 116.  The figure in the Estimates is 118.  These 116 patients are costing us over £15,000.  That figure seems to us to be too high.  The number of officials given for this year is 58, and the number of patients 116.  That means one official for every two patients. Even though we realise that an institution of this kind is of necessity bound to be costly, that the cost of the upkeep of the patients in it is bound to be costly, nevertheless it appears to us to be rather too high a figure to have 58 officials for 116 patients.  To my mind, £15,000 a year is too much for an institution such as this to cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one of the institutions that was taken over, and we realise that a number of the officials there are probably of long standing.  I suppose that in due course some of them will be going out on pension, and so on, and in that way the number may be reduced.  This year the figure is 58 and last year it was 61.  Probably the transfer of the patients to the Six-County area may account for that reduction, but it appears to us that there is room for a further reduction. Perhaps the Minister is as keen on a reduction as any of us, but it is no harm to emphasise the fact that this is a costly institution and that if anything can be done to reduce the number of officials&mdash;the <Col N="2408" /> present number seems to be too great for the number of patients to be cared for&mdash;and thereby reduce the cost of the institution, it would be of advantage to the taxpayer in general.</P>
    <P>There is an item of £386 to which I would like to refer.  £386 is not such a great lot in a nation's expenses or revenues&mdash;or half a nation's, or two-thirds of a nation, or whatever we are&mdash;but it is the figure that appears here in connection with the farm and garden.  I do not know anything about the farm or garden at Dundrum, but if there is anything like a decent farm there, and if there is a live competent steward in charge, there is in the institution, taking the inmates and the officials together, a good market for what is produced in the farm and garden. In the case of some other institutions that I know&mdash;institutions.  I admit, with a much larger number of officials and inmates than this&mdash;they make their farm pay.  I wonder if it would be possible to have this item of £386 wiped out?  I do not know whether it is put down as an annual subsidy for the farm and garden, but if it is I think it might be wiped out. That is a suggestion that, I think, the Minister might consider.</P>

      <P>If Deputy O'Kelly turns to the appropriations-in-aid he will find that the income from the farm and garden is put down at £595, so that if you deduct their cost from that you will find that the farm and garden are bringing in a net income of over £200 a year.</P>

I cannot speak of the range of advertisements the asylum might enter into.  I fully appreciate the general point made by Deputy O'Kelly.  I can only say that you have a particular <Col N="2409" /> class of patient being dealt with in the Dundrum Asylum, which is a rather elaborate institution.  I do not know that there is any other way of reducing the cost per head of inmates except by taking them out of the present institution and dealing with them in some other way.  The question of economy has been engaging the attention both of the officers of the asylum and of the Department, and I think they are coming to the conclusion that a further reduction can hardly be brought about while the present institution is being used for the housing of the 116 patients.  Pending a change, I do not think that economies can be effected.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,298 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1931, for Charges connected with Hospitals and Infirmaries, including sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The only change in this Estimate from last year is the change in respect of the amount payable to the Cork Street Fever Hospital.  The net deficit in the Cork Street Fever Hospital for the current year is estimated to be £1,382.  For that reason the amount of the grant, which last year was £2,170, is reduced in the present Estimate to £1,400, so that the amount of the grant will be approximately the amount of the anticipated deficit.</P>

      <P>This Vote, although representing a comparatively small sum, is a very valuable Vote from the point of view of the hospitals in doing good work.  It is a Vote on which one should take a serious view.  It will be remembered that on the debate on the Hospitals Sweepstakes Bill the question was raised that, whether owing to its charter or rules, the Master of the Rotunda Hospital cannot be a member of the Church of the majority of the Irish people.  The Master of that Hospital must be a Protestant. There has been a very curious instance lately where a very distinguished doctor was made a Master of the hospital, but before being appointed to the mastership he had to change his religion.  I am referring to a person of whom Deputy Sir James Craig is thinking.  Such is the absurdity of the rules.  I think it is most inconsistent, and an extraordinary thing, that we should be voting money here to a hospital which takes up an attitude that is reminiscent of the penal laws.  It is a question of status.  A Catholic in this country is at least as good as his neighbour, and, if you like, no better, but that in any big public institution which is getting a sum of money from the public purse there should be a ban on professional men of the majority religion of the country is grossly offensive, I suggest, to the citizens of the country and the Government.  In order to show our attitude on this matter we propose to vote against this particular Estimate.  I think there is another hospital besides the Rotunda to which the same objection would apply, but as I do not happen to have the details in regard to it I do not propose to go into the matter. There may be, in fact, a third such hospital.  I am perfectly certain as regards the Rotunda.  We raised the question before, as Deputy Sir James Craig knows, when the Hospitals Bill was before us, as we thought the matter was sufficiently important to have it discussed at that time.  We consider that the proper way is that all appointments as regards <Col N="2411" /> the medical profession should be made on merit only, and not on any other basis, and that no one should be excluded on other grounds, which should be considered extraneous to the profession.  I think there are excellent reasons for opposing this Vote.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Little that it appears very absurd that in this year of 1930 the Rotunda Lying-in Hospital should have any provisions against the appointment of anybody on account of his religious belief, to the position of Master, and that it should at the same time be granted moneys from State funds.  I see that the estimated income of the Rotunda Lying-in Hospital, exclusive of the parliamentary grant, is £11,269, and the estimated expenditure £12,341, showing a deficiency of income of £1,072.  I would like to know whether the estimated income includes the amount of fees paid by students to attend that hospital. I take it on the average 50 or 60 students attend that hospital from different countries, and they pay about £12 or £13 per month&mdash;I do not know what it is now but it was that at one time&mdash;and that would amount to about £600 a month, which would mean a very big sum in the year.  This money, I take it, is being paid in salary to the Master of the Hospital, and I take it that apart from the great amount of practice that comes to him from the honour of being Master of the Hospital, and the experience and reputation he would gain from being Master, he would be in receipt of the very big sum of about £5,000 a year from students' fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see that the Coombe Lying-in Hospital is in receipt of £200 a year. As far as I know, there is nothing in the rules or regulations debarring one from the mastership of that hospital on account of his religious beliefs, but I think there should be a question raised by the Minister as to the method of appointment to the mastership of both these hospitals. They are run, as far as I know, by <Col N="2412" /> governors, that is, by four or five people who have no responsibility to the public, and they can appoint whom they like to these positions.  I think that the Minister should query these appointments and the right of a certain clique or coterie of people to make these appointments.  The salary is by far double and treble that which any Minister in this House is earning.  I think, before money should be granted from any public fund here, that these appointments should be looked into and that the method of election or selection of masters in these hospitals should be seen to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke on this subject before.  The last time I spoke on it there was one aspect of it that had not occurred to me in connection with the question of the hospitals to which grants are paid on this Vote.  After I had spoken on it a medical man, a friend of mine, raised a point with me that I had not adverted to.  I do not know whether the Minister could give us any information on the point, but perhaps if he cannot now he might look into it. The Vote is small.  This year it is just £1,200.  It is not so much the cost of the Vote, but there arises, as was said here over and over again, a matter of principle with regard to it.  These grants made to these various hospitals are made by reason of old Acts of Parliament as is set out here, &ldquo;recommended for grants by a Committee of the House of Commons in 1854 and by the Commission of 1855.&rdquo;  None of us here wants to do anything that would be unfair or improper or would put these hospitals in a position which would prevent them doing the exceedingly good work that most of these hospitals, possibly all of them, are doing in the City of Dublin.  Why the matter was raised here before by any of us is that it is putting these hospitals in a favoured position in comparison with similar institutions in Dublin and elsewhere.  There are other hospitals that probably are equally badly in need of help from the national Exchequer and they get nothing.  We put it to the Minister <Col N="2413" /> last year that if these donations are to be continued, the question of similar treatment for similar institutions in the City of Dublin ought to be raised by the Minister himself.  Probably many of the hospitals, if not all of them, that are doing similar work and that I, at any rate, have in mind that could do with similar donations, were not in existence at all when these donations were agreed upon by the British House of Commons. We are continuing the practice. It is, of course, a good practice to support hospitals that are doing good public work as long as we can afford to do it.  Again we want to emphasise the unfairness of it to other institutions that are equally needy.</P>
      <P>There is one other aspect of the matter that, as I say, was put to me, and it is this: that so far as the staffing of a number of these hospitals is concerned, the professional men coming from the National University do not get a fair show.  On the staffs of almost all of these hospitals if you are not a graduate of Trinity College you get little or no show.  That is not fair.  When that was put to me I said to the individual who told me that he should give me documentary proof, and he brought me, at the time, a list, first, of all the committees of control of these hospitals and then of the staffs of these hospitals.  I know that in some of them his statement was not correct that the men from the National University did not get a fair show, but his statement was correct in so far as the majority of hospitals on this list was concerned. I was supplied with the list &mdash;I have not it by me now, but I can get it&mdash;of those who were responsible for the nominations and appointments, and also a list of the staffs, and judging by the results as shown to me, it would appear that the National University graduates did not get a fair show as far as appointments were concerned in a number of these hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are supporting these hospitals by public grants, we ought to insist on fairness all round.  We do not want to be unfair to anyone.  We <Col N="2414" /> do not want to take appointments from anybody unless on merit, but I think if there were a free and open field and no favouritism that the National men would certainly, under these conditions, have got a greater number of appointments than they seem to have got in the list shown to me of the staffs of a number of these hospitals.  I think this is a matter which ought to be gone into, and if it can be shown that there is discrimination, not on the grounds of religion alone, because there are a good many Catholics in Trinity College, but on the grounds of being a graduate of one University or another, we ought not to subsidise any hospital on those conditions.</P>

      <P>The Richmond, Whitworth and Hardwicke.  I did not intend to intervene in this debate because with Deputy O'Kelly I have felt at times that it was perhaps a little unfair that certain hospitals should be getting Government grants and others not.  I think all will agree that it would seem to be fairer if this money were divided equally in proportion to the amount of work that the hospitals did.  Before going any further I wish to say that as far as my own connection with hospitals is concerned, I was a student in the Coombe Hospital.  I have no connection whatever with the Rotunda Hospital and therefore, anything I say in this matter is not based on any partiality.  I think before we withdraw a grant of this nature that we ought to make further inquiries. The statement Deputy Little made came upon me as an absolute surprise. I may be living in a hut or in a queer part of the world, but I never heard that it was necessary that a change of religion should take place before the gentleman who now occupies the position he has obtained it.  I want to go further and say that as far as an inquiry is concerned if there is in the Charter of the Rotunda Hospital a provision prohibiting the election of any gentleman who holds a particular religious view, I think it is time that that <Col N="2415" /> Charter should be changed.  I say that quite deliberately.  If the hospital expects to get a Government grant I think it ought to throw its positions open to everybody.  I have been a considerable number of years in the Dáil and I have most consistently as far as I know preached the doctrine of the best man for the position.  I do not think anyone can charge me with having any other view than that.  I believe that it is right that the best man should get it.  I am not going to enter into any discussion with Deputy O'Kelly as to the respective merits of the National University as against Trinity College.</P>

I would be a poor type of man if I did not.  As far as I am concerned, I want to see fair play all round, but I do think it would be rather unfair to the Rotunda Hospital at the present moment to withdraw this grant without giving them an opportunity of explaining what the position is, because I have been assured that there is no such provision in the Charter.  I may be wrongly informed on that matter.  I should like to be assured that such is the case.  I should also like to be assured that the statement made by Deputy O'Kelly is the case.  If that is so I think it is a very serious matter indeed.  I am sure he did not make such a serious statement as that without having good grounds to go on.  All I can say is that I know nothing about it.  I do not think it would be quite fair to the hospital at the present moment to withdraw this grant without giving them an opportunity of considering the position.</P>

      <P>This Vote has been discussed on very many occasions and I have persistently said that my attitude to the distribution of this money is based on this: If we take the amount of money that is proposed to be voted, £12,150&mdash; originally it was £15,850&mdash;there are a certain number of hospitals whose economy, as I have said before, has been built around the reception of these grants, from a time dating back to 1854.  We are told that the value of money has reduced since pre-war days.  What the change in value of money has been between 1855 and 1930 I do not know, but there has been a steady increase in the real value of the amount of money to these hospitals.  I stated that I am unwilling to interfere with the economy of hospitals that are doing a very considerable amount of public service, particularly to the poorer classes, and which have definitely shown a deficit.  For the last few years the finances of these hospitals have been very carefully examined by officers of the Department. Deputies will perhaps remember that last year a reduction was made of £2,600.  The grant was reduced from £7,600 to £5,000 in the case of the House of Industry hospitals, <Col N="2417" /> and last year also the grant to Cork Street Fever Hospital was reduced from £2,500 to £2,170.  There is a further reduction of £770 this year to £1,400, because by an examination of the accounts the Department has satisfied itself that the deficit is reduced to that particular amount.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other hospitals, the Department has satisfied itself that there is a deficit facing them for the coming year that is not less than the amount that was voted here as a grant.  I am asked to question this £700 to the Rotunda Lying-in Hospital on certain grounds.  I have heard these grounds stated for the first time, as I have heard a charge of favouring one particular set of medicals as against another for the first time.  I do not think that I ought to take any cognisance of these statements.  I take it that they are from well-wishers of these hospitals and well-wishers of those people who receive benefits from them, and I do certainly suggest if there is anything wrong in the Charter of any of these hospitals or in the general attitude of their Governors to one particular class of individuals or another that there are better ways of approaching the matter than in discussing it on this Vote.</P>

Because we take an attitude of caution it is suggested that our information is not correct and that we have not tried to get the proper information.

      <P>I do not know that it is necessary to say very much with regard to this Bill before it passes out of our control.  It is a very different Bill from the one that was introduced here.  I will not say every section, but most of the <Col N="2421" /> sections in it as originally introduced have been materially altered, so much so that the Bill that we are now asked to give a Fifth Reading to is a very different measure and a better measure in many respects. Even though it has been improved as a result of the severe criticism that the original Bill met with from all sides of the House, and though the Minister was constrained to bow to that criticism and to bring in shoals of amendments, nevertheless we are not satisfied with the Bill that is now before us; we are not satisfied that we would be prepared to vote for it as a satisfactory measure.  Even though the Minister has met many of the criticisms, there are still points in the Bill that make it an undesirable Bill and one that I could not vote for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of these principal sections&mdash; one of the principles embodied in the Bill&mdash;is the section that deals with the commercial register.  The idea of embodying, I will not say a new principle, because it is not a new principle but a revival of an old principle, in the Bill, is such a reactionary proposition to have enshrined in a Bill in these days one might say of progressive democracy as to be a strange one.  It means that those who have been talking now for quite a number of years about trusting the people, bowing to the will of the people and endeavouring to carry out the wishes of the majority of the people, as a Government, in so far as the ordinary citizens of Dublin are concerned do not trust the people with the management of their own affairs.  When they raise up a class, when they raise up a section, and that section happens to be the wealthiest section of the community, and give them an undue voice in the control and management of the city's affairs, they do not trust the people.  The idea enshrined in a commercial register is one that, to my mind, should not be in the Bill.  It is one that is the antithesis of democratic rule.  It is giving into the hands of a minority a power and control that they ought not to have and that will not, in my humble judgment, make for the <Col N="2422" /> better government of the City.  The City's affairs, in so far as these people are being given special powers by the number of votes they are being given&mdash;in some cases as many as six or seven votes is given to one individual&mdash;will not be adequately looked after.  What will be looked after are the interests of a class and the interests of wealthy people and not the interests of the city as a whole.  That is what the extra power given by the Ministry under this Bill is endeavouring to secure.  It is the introduction of a principle that will, in my opinion, have far-reaching effects which will not be for the benefit nor the welfare of the body of common citizens.</P>
    <P>That is a grave blot on the Bill. It is an injustice to the City. It is the setting up of a principle that probably will be spread and brought into operation in other municipalities inside the Twenty-six Counties.  As such, we certainly are hostile to it and we will use whatever influence or votes we have in this House or outside it to defeat it. As long as that principle is enshrined in this Bill we certainly cannot be satisfied with it and we will use every opportunity of voting against it.  It is not any harm to repeat what was said here before&mdash;this principle is giving control of the city into the hands of the men with the big bank balances.  It is only natural that legislation of that kind would come from the Ministry opposite. After all, they have to remember those who put them in power and who are keeping them in power.  If they do not march to the tune of the big bank balances they will not be very long in power.  It is, therefore, easy to understand why legislation including and embodying such undemocratic proposals, such reactionary and antiquated proposals, should be contained in this Bill reconstituting the municipality of the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, we object to the Bill on other grounds that we made manifest on the Second Reading. We made manifest some of them at any rate.  One of them is the question of the setting up of the <Col N="2423" /> southern coastal borough.  In our view, the area included in that borough, so far as the Bill has gone, should have been included within the bounds of the municipality of Dublin.  We endeavoured to have our views put into effect and, of course, we were beaten, but so long as that principle of the separate borough is in the Bill, and even if it were only for that reason alone, we regard the Bill as unsatisfactory and will vote against it.</P>
    <P>I, personally, am not satisfied that the principle embodied in the suggestion of the City Manager is going to make for improvement in the control of the city or the working of the municipality.  I believe that it could and would have been worked just as well under the old arrangement.  You have had city managers, three of them, in control now for six years, to this very month, and I do not know that there would be many&mdash;there would be some, unquestionably&mdash;taking the city as a whole, who, if it were possible to put the question by a referendum or otherwise, would agree that the city has been better managed in the last six years than in any period of six years over a stretch of twenty or thirty years previously under the old City Council.  There was one chief man whom, I suppose, you would call the City Manager, who had complete control, so far as the Minister for Local Government could give him control, with no one to criticise him, and with the whole Press at his back because of the nature of his appointment.  Because the City Council was wiped out you had the whole Press of the city praising the work of the Commissioners, particularly the Chief Commissioner.  I cannot see that they effected any improvement that could not have been effected equally well if the old municipality got the same spoon-feeding from the National Exchequer as the three gentlemen nominated by the Ministry.</P>

Without going into the past, I think I can refer to the Commissioners in this way:- I can say that it is evident that the Ministry had no confidence in these men, that they tried them for six years and found them wanting. Were there ever men who got better opportunities?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it is set out in the Bill, I think in Section 38, that <Col N="2426" /> Gerald Sherlock is to be appointed City Manager, and I will leave the inference to the House.  Why was not somebody else appointed, somebody who perhaps had greater opportunities for control than the gentleman who is named in the Bill? I am sure that the Ministry searched to find somebody.  Probably they searched their own Department. They lit, however, upon a gentleman I have known for a long time.  I am sure that if anybody will try hard to be a success in that office he will try hard and be conscientious.  I know, however, that wires were pulled and that people who thought that they had great influence and that they were pets with the Department, pulled all the wires they could to get the appointment which was given to Gerald Sherlock&mdash;people who were petted and patted on the back and who were told that they were the greatest men in local government for generations.  So the daily Press used to say, and so used the Minister, but when the appointment came to be made not one of them was appointed.  The Ministry had to go back to an official who had been in the service of the old Dublin Corporation, a good official, and they had to pass over all their own pets, who had previously been appointed without knowledge and experience, at good salaries to do work which citizens were prepared to do for nothing.  All the pets and marionettes were dropped, and an old official of the Dublin Corporation had to be called into service.  That is worthy of comment, anyway.  There are other reasons why, in my opinion, this Bill should not pass, but I will not bother the House with them now.  Those are just one or two of the comments which I wished to make, and I hope that the boosters in the daily Press of the marionettes of the Custom House, who had been appointed by the Ministry to run the city, will remember what the Ministry thought of them when it came to the appointment of a City Manager.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister concludes I would like to say a few <Col N="2427" /> words to the House in support of Deputy O'Kelly's proposition that the Bill should be rejected on the Fifth Stage.  It is the last opportunity the Dáil will have of examining the proposals for the future local government of Dublin.  Although the Bill has been improved in this House, it is, in my opinion, not sufficiently good to justify its passage now.  We have examined the Bill in great detail during the past three or four weeks.  It will be a good thing to stand back from it now and look at the result of our work to see if we have improved it sufficiently to justify its adoption.  This Bill was a very dirty little orphan when the Minister for Local Government introduced it to the House, and although we have washed its face, wiped its nose and curled its hair, I do not think we have sufficiently improved its appearance to make us very anxious to adopt it.  Undoubtedly as a result of the amendments which have been forced into the Bill by the Dáil, it now contains what it did not contain when the Minister first produced it&mdash;a workable system of municipal government. That improvement has been mainly effected by giving the Council increased powers of control over the Manager.  The Bill, however, still contains a number of anomalies which will, I am convinced, necessitate a revising Bill after a very few years' experience of its working.  It is very undesirable that the statute on which the government of the capital city of Ireland is based should have to be amended at all, much less amended as frequently as this statute, I am convinced, will have to be amended if the Bill passes this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system of managerial control which it embodies, although sound in theory, has been so applied as to prove almost unworkable in practice. I know that the Minister for Local Government is not open to conviction in this matter.  He was not open to conviction on the Cork Bill either. He forced the Cork City Management Bill through the Dáil by the <Col N="2428" /> use of his automatic majority, and within twelve months every prediction which we made was proved to be accurate.  He went down to meet the Cork City Council to consider how he might concede to them the additional powers that would make local government in Cork possible. He met the Cork City Council and came back and told us that he had arrived at an agreement with the members of the Council and that in future everything would be well.</P>
    <P>I was interested, however, to read in the Press the other day a comment on the actions of the Manager by a member of the Council.  I am not quoting a member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I am quoting a respectable member of the Business Party, but I apologise for the language.  Mr. Braham Sutton was elected in the interests of the business community. He is one of the class whom the Minister is anxious to get elected on municipal councils.  He is a person well known in Cork for his moderate views.  When that type of public representative speaks strongly on any matter you can take it that the matter is one likely to arouse strong feelings everywhere.  &ldquo;Are we to be treated like a lot of school children in a way that practically means to tell us to go to hell?&rdquo; He was referring to the Manager of the Council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The phrase strikes me as remarkably like one I read in the &ldquo;Cork Examiner&rdquo; of yesterday.  I would suggest not exactly that the Deputy is taking this statement from its context, but <Col N="2429" /> that other Deputies should read the very enlightened discussion that is reported in the &ldquo;Cork Examiner&rdquo; of yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that any discussion at the Cork City Council would be an enlightened discussion.  Mr. Braham Sutton continued to say that the Manager spoke to them in this manner in effect: &ldquo;Amend your bye-laws and in the meantime I will do as I like, and be damned to you.&rdquo;  I want to apologise for the language used by this member of the Business Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the language of the Manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is the language of Mr. Braham Sutton, P.C.  When a business representative on the Cork Municipal Council was so aroused by the attitude of the Manager to the Council it can be taken for granted that there is universal dissatisfaction with the local government machinery which the Minister has established in Cork, and which he now assures us is going to work well.  The Minister was much more positive about the Cork City Bill than about the Dublin Bill.  He is beginning to realise that he sometimes makes mistakes, that he or his Department is not always infallible. In so far as we have succeeded in driving a wedge, however thin, into the hitherto invulnerable armour of, shall I say, his self-conceit, we have done well on this Bill.  Perhaps we may yet induce the Minister to realise that persons with much greater experience of municipal government than either he or I have had must be taken seriously when they express views concerning Bills of this kind very contrary to his own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister appeared to treat all these people with contempt.  He swept their notions aside as being old-fashioned and out of date, because they were not in accord with his own enlightened ideas.  That was his attitude when the Cork City Bill was being discussed here.  He opposed as vigorously as he could every amendment to that Bill which <Col N="2430" /> Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party endeavoured to insert in it.  He has now found out in relation to many of the matters then discussed that we were in the right and that he was in the wrong.  I am certain he will have a similar experience in relation to the Greater Dublin Bill.  I still believe the Minister should have come to the consideration of the powers of the Manager with a view to defining the powers of the Manager and not the powers of the Council. By the procedure he has adopted of reserving certain powers to the Council, and giving all other power to the Manager, he has put the Manager in a position of definite superiority to the Council.  He has defended that with arguments which have no relation to it.  He has talked about the possibility of corruption, the undesirability of elected representatives dealing with promotions, the appointment of staff, and the awarding of contracts.  If his purpose was merely to ensure that administrative duties of that kind would be in the hands of a skilled officer appointed for the purpose he should have stated so in the Bill.  A section could have appeared in it assigning the following powers to the Manager: (a) The promotion, appointment or removal of staff; (b) the regulation of the duties of the staff; (c) the awarding of contracts; (d) other matters of the same kind, and all other powers reserved to the elected representatives of the people.  The Manager should have been made definitely subordinate to the Council, in so far as all these matters are concerned, and except those are definitely reserved to the Manager by the Bill, the Council should be able to order him to do what they liked.</P>
    <P>We argued the merits of democracy on the Second Reading, and certain Deputies appeared to think that the utility of democracy had long since expired.  I am not saying &mdash;I do not say now, and I never did say&mdash;that democracy was a perfect system of government.  As some one put it very wittily the other day: &ldquo;When all is said and done there is much more said than done.&rdquo;  At all <Col N="2431" /> events, it is the best system which has yet been devised, and I think we would be well advised to stick to it until something better has been produced. Nothing better has yet been produced.  Democratic control of municipal affairs worked fairly satisfactorily in the past.  Things happened that should not have happened; there were mistakes made. The same thing happened under the dictatorial system which has been in operation for the past six years. I say that the democratic system was, in the long run, the system least productive of evil.  The Minister, however, has tried to produce a cross between dictatorship and democracy, but he has not succeeded.  The result of the passage of this Bill, and the creation of the Municipal Council, will be an immediate struggle between the Manager and the Council for control.  I think it is inevitable that from the first day on which the Council will meet there will be in the minds of all the members the necessity of curtailing the powers of the Manager, while, in the mind of the Manager will be the idea of limiting the powers of the Council, and that atmosphere of strife and hostility is going definitely to impair the efficiency of both.  If the Council had been put beyond question in a position of superiority over the Manager that danger would not arise.  That would necessitate that in a number of matters, such as the appointment of the Manager, the fixing of his salary and things of that kind the Council's decision would prevail.</P>
    <P>Apart from the objections to the Bill on the ground of the defective managerial system which it establishes, we are opposed to it on other grounds, some of which have been mentioned by Deputy O'Kelly.  We would have preferred in the first instance if the Greater Dublin area as defined by the Greater Dublin Commission had been the area selected for the new Council.  It is perhaps unnecessary for us to go back over the arguments which we advanced in that connection on the Second Reading.  The Bill has been slightly improved, but only slightly.  All the <Col N="2432" /> dangers and defects which we saw arising out of the exclusion of the northern and southern coastal areas are still there, and I have no doubt whatever that when the tribunal, which the Bill now proposes shall be established in five years' time, comes to meet, we will, as a result, have a substantial extension in the boundaries of the city.  That extension might as well have been made now, so that when the municipal machinery is being re-established it could be fashioned to deal with the whole area, and not with the limited area given to it in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are other obnoxious features in the Bill, the most obnoxious being that referred to by Deputy O'Kelly, the commercial register.  As he stated, the Government policy in relation to this measure is only in line with its policy on all other matters, the policy as defined by the Minister for Finance when he made his Budget statement this year.  They are trying to placate the monied classes, and, in order to do so, they are apparently prepared to sacrifice both the interests and the rights of the workers and the poorest sections of the community.  The commercial register, and the commercial members of the Council which the Bill provides for, are not merely unnecessary; they are positively harmful.  I believe that if the election of the Council had proceeded in the ordinary way, business interests on the Council would be secured representation equally as good as that given to business interests in the Cork Council.  The fact that this commercial register has been instituted is very largely an admission on the part of the Minister that the business community in Dublin are not sufficiently interested in municipal affairs to seek election in the ordinary way.  Unless the seats can be padded for them, unless the slide into the Council can be greased so that they will not experience the passage, they will not go there at all. We are now going to have the position that some 500 voters will be able to elect one commercial member while it will take about 5,000 voters <Col N="2433" /> to elect an ordinary member.  It does not follow that the ordinary member will have ten times the influence of the commercial member. Quite the reverse will probably be the case.  Each will have only one vote.  About 5,000 ordinary citizens in Dublin are, in the estimation of the Minister for Local Government, only equal to 500 members of the Chamber of Commerce.  That is the biggest insult ever offered to the people of Dublin.</P>
    <P>On the Report Stage of the Bill I asked the Minister to abolish the Local Government Register in the election of the ordinary members of the Council, and to substitute the Dáil Register.  That would have, if adopted, redressed in some way the balance which the Minister had tilted against democracy when he instituted the commercial register. Incidentally, it would have swept away, in respect of the City of Dublin, the last vestige of political inequality between men and women. The Minister was not prepared to agree, and the members of Cumann na nGaedheal voted against it.  I was particularly interested to note that the only lady member of the Dáil voted against it.  The refusal of the Minister to consider the proposal and the refusal of Cumann na nGaedheal to vote for it was, however, merely in accordance with their general attitude to all questions of the same kind.  They are, apparently, determined to establish themselves as the reactionary party. On every occasion in debate some member of that Party is bound to enunciate principles that were considered dead a hundred years ago. We had Deputy O'Sullivan at it yesterday, and we had the Minister for Local Government the previous day.  I hope, however, that their power to ensure that these antiquated principles will be translated into legislation will soon be curtailed, and when that happens I can promise the Dáil that a Bill will be introduced and passed here to amend this Bill, if this Bill is now passed. In order to save time, to save money, and to save annoyance I ask the Dáil <Col N="2434" /> to express its dissatisfaction with this Bill by rejecting it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who criticised this Bill rather keenly when it was introduced, I feel that it is my duty to welcome its passage in its present form.  We hope that the Corporation that will be set up under it will function for the benefit of the city and for the benefit of the citizens generally.  On examining the Bill when it was introduced, I saw some of its defects, but I also saw many of its benefits.  I ventured to say, when the Bill was being discussed on Second Reading, that when it would leave the House it would be a very workmanlike and a very serviceable measure.  I can now express the opinion that it is a workmanlike measure, and that it will be a useful measure.</P>
      <P>The great fault of the Opposition in examining this measure was that it noted all its defects but none of its advantages.  Speaking as one who is as much in favour of democracy as any man sitting on the Labour Benches, I welcome one thing which this Bill brings about, and that is the bringing in of the aristocratic areas of Rathmines and Pembroke, for which Deputy Lemass is a representative, within the ambit of Greater Dublin, where they should have been brought many years ago.  Under the Bill these aristocratic people in Rathmines and Pembroke will be placed on the same level as the democratic workers in the area of which I am one of the representatives&mdash;Gardiner Street, Marlborough Street, and areas of that type.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood he represented the South side, and I thought that Rathmines was portion of his constituency.  If I am incorrect I will not persist on that point.  However, I do say that under the Bill these citizens, who have a very proud tradition behind them, and who always wanted to keep aloof from <Col N="2435" /> the City of Dublin, will be brought in to share the burdens of the ratepayers of the City.  They have hitherto shared all the advantages of the city, but they have never shared the burdens that the ratepayers of the city have had to bear.  Under this Bill those burdens will have to be shared equally by the aristocrats of Rathmines and Pembroke and by the democrats who live in Gardiner Street and Marlborough Street.</P>

      <P>I am in complete agreement with Deputy O'Kelly when he says that this is a totally different Bill from that introduced. It is a much better Bill.  It is a Bill that can be made effective and that can be worked in the interests of the city generally when the new Corporation begins to function.  I have no doubt that it will be for the benefit of the city, and in the hands of an efficient Corporation that a great deal of good can be done under it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that the Minister has not seen his way to grant some other things which were asked for.  I regret that the control of contracts and that the control of the preference with regard to Irish materials and of materials used for Corporation contracts with regard to Irish manufacture was not given directly into the hands of the Council instead of being given into the hands of the Manager.  Of course I do recognise, as the Minister has pointed out, that indirectly the Council will, through the power of the purse, exercise a certain amount of control, but in my opinion that control is not sufficient, and in my opinion such important questions as the preference for Irish materials should not be thrown on the shoulders of one man, but that it is a responsibility that should be shared <Col N="2436" /> by the Council with the Manager, at least in some measure.  I also regret that control with regard to the type of houses to be built is not directly placed in the hands of the Council. I have pointed out that hitherto the type of houses built in this city has been such that the ordinary workers could not afford the rents.  It might happen that the new Corporation will follow the example of the old in erecting houses of that kind, and if I were a member of the Corporation the first thing I would press for would be the building of houses that the ordinary working man earning fifty or sixty shillings a week could obtain at a reasonable rent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle may rule that strictly I am not de rigueur, but morally I think I am. Certain powers that we asked should be given to the Council will have to be given in the course of time, I think.  As far as the commercial register is concerned, I am not one of those who thinks, as the members of the Opposition do, that this is a retrograde step; I think it is a step in the right direction, and it is a step that, as a business man of the city, I do not fear.  I do not think that the small advantage that the commercial men will enjoy in this respect <Col N="2437" /> will possibly act to the detriment of the city.  I am one of those who believe in the real fundamentals upon which representation on the City Council and votes in this House ought to be based, and that is the principle of taxation.  Nobody can deny that it is axiomatic that where there is no representation there should be no taxation.  This class pays about 51 per cent. of the entire rates of the city.  They have every right to have a voice in the affairs of the city, and under the Bill they will have a voice&mdash;not a very powerful one, but still some voice.</P>
      <P>I think that the House should congratulate the Minister upon the wonderful improvement he has made in the Bill.  The Bill has been transmogrified. I would like to refer to one section, which gives real control over the Manager to the Council, and that is Section 58.  That entitles the Council by requisition to call for the doing of any particular thing or act that the City Manager can perform under the powers given to him.  That is a very important control that was not in the Bill when it was introduced. If the Manager wishes to be autocratic, if the Manager wishes to do something that is unpopular with the citizens, if the Manager, in a word, wishes to do things that should not be done, and endeavours to carry out things that are not, in the opinion of the Council, in the interests of the city, the Council will always have, in Section 58, a real controlling influence upon anything that the Manager may do that in their opinion is not in the interests of the city and of the citizens generally.  In conclusion, I should like to congratulate the Minister on the wonderful improvement he has made in the Bill, and to wish the new Corporation the greatest possible success.</P>

      <P>It was far easier to understand the attitude of Deputy Byrne on the Second Reading of the Bill than it was to understand his attitude in the statement he has made to-night.  Certainly his criticism on the Second Reading was <Col N="2438" /> as strong as any criticism from any other part of the House.  To-night he contented himself with saying the Bill had been altered to such an extent that he wanted to congratulate the Minister and the House generally and hoped the Bill would be given a Fifth Reading.  He went on to deal with certain sections of it.  So far as one could find out, the only redeeming feature was that Rathmines and Pembroke were to be brought into the City of Dublin.  He tried to justify the attitude of the Minister as far as Section 34 is concerned. I hope the people for whom he professes to speak in Gardiner Street and that locality will take notice of the vote he will give to-night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is certainly very surprising to me that the Minister for Local Government, who was a very prominent member of the old Sinn Féin Party, should be responsible for including in this Bill a section of that kind. One would not expect it from that quarter.  Anything he has said on any stage of the Bill has not justified what he is trying to do.  There is no justification whatever for giving any man, no matter what his rating valuation may be, the six votes which a man if he has a certain valuation can secure under this Bill. One man, one vote, has always been advocated by every Party which anyone can remember in this country for a considerable time.  Deputy Byrne has just stated that in his opinion a vote should be given on the principle of taxation.  After all, if a man is rated at a certain valuation he is paying according to his means.  A workingman is entitled to a vote because he is paying according to his means and I cannot see why there should be any differentiation so far as business men and working men are concerned. This proposal is certainly contrary to the essence of democracy and one would not expect it from a young Government such as this.  But that is not the worst of it.  This particular individual while entitled to six votes will not even have to go to the trouble of going to the polling booth to record his votes&mdash;he can record <Col N="2439" /> his votes by post.  The unfortunate workingman, who perhaps has not sufficient clothes to enable him to go and vote, has to go to the polling booth to record it, while the person with six votes can recline in his armchair and vote by post.  That is a principle I could not subscribe to, and I am going to vote against the Bill if for nothing else but that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne, in his Second Reading speech, condemned in all the moods and tenses the control that the Bill gives to the Manager, and I cannot see all the changes that he professes have been brought about since the Bill was introduced, so far as the managerial system is concerned.  As the Bill stands, the Manager has been given too much power.  The Manager is not the manager of the City Council.  He is not a person who appears to be in the employment of the City Council. As far as one can see, he is going to manage the Council, and not the affairs of the Council.  I think that is patent to anybody.  As Deputy Lemass has pointed out at the beginning it is going to be prejudicial and detrimental to the best interests and proper government of the city, and that is not what one would like to see so far as the government of an important city like Dublin is concerned.  There is going to be a perpetual struggle between the Manager and the new City Council as to what the particular duties of each are.</P>
    <P>From my experience of local government, I can see no necessity to reserve certain powers to the Manager. The Local Government Department have every power possible to prevent a council from doing things which are improper, and I believe that the Manager about to be appointed in the City of Dublin will have too much power altogether.  I do not believe that is going to contribute to the better government of Dublin.  The Manager, when he knows he has certain powers given to him by the Ministry, and that he is going to be backed up by the Ministry in certain actions he is going to take, will find himself at <Col N="2440" /> variance with the Council in connection with different matters, and that is not going to tend to the betterment of the city.  So far as one can see, the Manager is to be a sort of liaison officer between the Department of Local Government and whatever Council will be set up in Dublin.  While most of us agree with the managerial system, I believe its application in this instance is not going to be for the benefit of the city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I was surprised to hear Deputy Corish say that he was surprised at the Minister introducing this commercial register.  There is nothing strange in that.  It is fully and completely in keeping with the policy of the Ministry and the Cumann na nGaedheal Party for the past few years.  If Deputy Corish would read the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; occasionally the reasons would become clearer to him why the Ministry have introduced anti-democratic and anti-national legislation.  Recently the &ldquo;Irish Times,&rdquo; in its leading article, stated that the policy for which the Independent Members in the Dáil stand has been the social and economic mainstay of the present administration for these last eight years.  Deputy Corish should note this: that unless the Government do something for this class they will not go with their tall hats to the garden parties and will not give the Government the funds to scare the rest of the people into voting for them.  The policy of the Government has been: do everything that these people stand for; give them six votes to the ordinary man's one.  When they give them six votes they get enough funds from them to scare the rest of the people into voting for them by threats of war.  If they do not do what the Independent members stand for, as the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; said, the worm might turn.  The Cumann na nGaedheal Party might be thrown out if they do not toe the line and give these people the control of Dublin City.  That is what it amounts to, in fact.  It is a most dangerous principle to establish this <Col N="2441" /> commercial register.  It is definitely in the City of Dublin putting class against class.  If we are going to pull this country out of the mess it is in, we have to have the co-operation of all classes, and we want the help of people who have been running businesses here, just as we want the good will and co-operation of the ordinary working people.  But if we are to set up here a special class, which has to be knocked down before we can get any further, it is going to lead to a most unhealthy situation in the country.  The business community in Dublin if they are worth their place in the Municipal Council Chamber should be prepared to fight their election and say what they should stand for and ask the people to vote for them, but if they are to be rammed down the people's throats, if the people are compelled to vote for them, if they are told that they must have these people in the council chamber, well then the natural reaction of the people would be to say &ldquo;We will not have these people,&rdquo; and if they are forced on the people then the people will take the first opportunity of getting rid of them.  That does not lead to healthy co-operation in municipal affairs.  I am sorry the Independents have brought pressure upon the Government to set up this commercial register.  It is a thing that is bad for the Independents and for the country as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this stage of the Bill, principally because of the remarks made by Deputy Aiken and Deputy Corish on this commercial register.  They say it is undemocratic and that the Minister is not a good Sinn Feiner because he has prepared this commercial register.  I claim to be a Sinn Feiner for a great number of years.  I also claim that I am a democrat.  I have risen from the ranks of Labour, and that entitles me to speak for Labour.  I support the commercial register also, because of experience I gained in a local council of which I was chairman for four years.  It is because of that and because of the good qualities and <Col N="2442" /> abilities of the men who came from the business community I saw displayed there, that I am in favour of seeing them on the new Dublin Council.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is fair for any Deputy to refer to the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; or any other element such as that, as having any influence upon us in making up our minds in this matter.  They have had no such influence upon me.  And as I supported the Minister when he introduced this Bill, so, to-night, when he is attacked on the ground that he is not a good Sinn Feiner and a democrat, I say that in my opinion he is perfectly right in the course he has taken, and he has my entire sympathy. I also rise to assure our friends that we have not run away from any principles that we professed in the past, and that we are to-day as good Irishmen as ever we were, and that we have the love of Dublin and of our country deeply in our hearts, just as much as those who say we have not.  I think it is time we got away from that kind of accusation and forgot it.  We are sincere in the views we take with regard to this commercial register, and, as I said, having been chairman of a council in Dublin, I know the ability of the men who will be affected by this commercial register, and I shall be very glad to see them in the Council of the City of Dublin to guide its affairs, because I know they will do their best for their class and for the working class.</P>

      <P>I do not want to participate in this debate beyond bringing to the notice of the House one extraordinary suggestion made by Deputy Byrne.  It is only one of a series of his extraordinary suggestions, but I think it is worthy of special attention.  I hope I am not about to misquote him, but I have his words here as I believe he uttered them.  In alluding to the commercial register he suggested that this House should be constituted in the same manner as the commercial register would constitute the Dublin Council &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>However, we have Deputy Batt O'Connor coming out courageously in defence of the commercial register.  The statement of Deputy Byrne is quite in accord with the ground that is being prepared in the official organ of the Party opposite for the abolition of proportional representation.  We may have some measure of that nature introduced in the near future. If that is the only means by which the Government Party believe they can hold on to office, I certainly would not be surprised to see such a Bill introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be surprised to see a Bill introduced on the lines of the speech made by Deputy Byrne, that is a denial of the vote to the ordinary citizen. Why not apply that principle to the constitution of this House if it is to be applied to the administration of local affairs?  If a business man has the right to six votes in the constitution of a local administrative assembly which affects more directly, or as much anyhow, the life and conditions of citizens of this State, why not apply it to the National Assembly?  Deputy O'Connor, as I say, has come out completely in defence of that, and I only rise to inform the Minister and his Party that I am confident that the people of Dublin, when the opportunity offers, will reject him and his Party, who have hurled at them this deliberate insult and denial of the fundamental rights of the ordinary citizens in this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Lemass has put it, 500 <Col N="2444" /> members of the Chamber of Commerce are considered equal to 5,000 ordinary citizens.  The Chamber of Commerce is going to transfer its powers and its influence over to the Mansion House, I presume.  That is evidently the object and intention of the Minister, but I can assure him, and Deputies Byrne and O'Connor, that when the citizens of Dublin get the opportunity they will see to it that all is not yet lost despite the power of the marionettes.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is just like a lot of things that happen&mdash;it is a lot better than Deputy O'Kelly really thinks it is.  On the general question, I think the Bill is a very sound structure, and that it gives the most satisfactory area for a council to begin in co-operation with the managerial system, the work of looking after the administration of the area covered by the city and the coastal borough.  The Bill gives adequate power of extension of that area if extension is necessary.  I think the House has been very well advised not to force the extension of the city area to a greater extent than what is proposed in the Bill. On the question of the commercial register, I admit that has to justify itself in time by the type of representatives that will get on the Dublin Council on that register.  I feel that we are very happy in our proposals, that in giving representation to rateable property that has not yet been represented in the City Council, although paying its quota of rates, while doing justice in that respect we have at the same time been able by means of the presence of <Col N="2445" /> managers of business on the City Council to integrate the business side of the city&mdash;the business on which the city lives its ordinary life, commercial and manufacturing&mdash;with the administrative side proper.  I am quite confident that a considerable amount of good will come from that.</P>
      <P>On the question of the Manager and of Deputy O'Kelly's references to the Commissioners, I desire to say that the gentleman we have nominated in the Bill will be a good manager for the city.  As far as the Commissioners and their reputation are concerned, they want no defence in the eyes of the city against anything Deputy O'Kelly can say against them.  Their work stands before the eyes of the citizens in a better looking city in every way and with lower rates compared with the time when they came in.  Deputy O'Kelly's line of attack on them is simply worthy of Deputy O'Kelly, to use some of his own words.</P>

      <P>The grants made for housing and from the road fund to the City of Dublin during the period of office of the Commissioners were the grants normally due to the city, and in no way has the city been specially favoured.  If we were to consider the road grants and the contributions of the City of Dublin to the Road Fund, the Commissioners could very well argue that they did not receive as much money as they might have expected.  The City of Dublin has been treated in the same way as any other local body.  It got what was duly coming <Col N="2446" /> to it.  Deputy Lemass, in requoting a list referring to Cork, attempted to make a point with regard to the Manager and his position towards the Council out of some quotation from the &ldquo;Cork Examiner&rdquo; of yesterday.  I ask Deputies interested in the matter or affected in any way by the quotation of the Deputy to refer to the somewhat full report of the Cork Council meeting yesterday.  Briefly, the position is that the Cork Council either passed or inherited a certain set of bye-laws. The Manager carried out those bye-laws and is prepared to carry out those bye-laws, which are the bye-laws of the Council and of the Corporation, until they are changed.</P>
      <P>If any Deputy wants to argue here that under the managerial system it shall be possible for a Council to pass bye-laws for the purpose of controlling the city and that the Manager shall not be expected to carry them out, that is not my outlook of the system of Council and Manager.  I would refer Deputies to the discussion and not allow themselves be led aside by suggestions or quotations of one kind or another.  We have, so far as the Dáil is concerned, finished the making of this measure.  The words and sections in any Bill are not going to carry on business, such as the great business of the administration of the City of Dublin, but we have provided an arena, in so far as it can be provided by legislation, in which the Council representing the city and the Manager saddled with full authority and very full responsibility can satisfactorily co-operate to carry on the great work of the administration of this city.</P>

The Minister replied that the Department have not the information at their disposal which would enable the figures asked for to be supplied.  I expected the Minister would give the figures required.  He states that the Department have no information to enable him to give them, but I would point out to him that his Department issues a quarterly report, and he must have some machinery for getting the statistics in that report.  I cannot see why he could not use the same machinery for getting the information which I require.  There is considerable dissatisfaction in the constituency I represent at the speech that was made by the Minister in Hospital recently, when he said there was a very difficult time before the dairying industry. Rumours are in circulation in the constituency that large quantities of butter have been held in cold <Col N="2449" /> storage for a considerable time. There was a rumour to the effect that 400 tons of butter were held in cold storage.  I have heard another rumour that it is as much as 900 tons.  If that is so I cannot see why the Minister would not protect the industry by putting a duty on the import of butter.  There is also a rumour that a considerable portion of that butter has become useless, and that eventually it will be used only for car grease.  If the Minister would give the figures I require it would prevent these rumours circulating, and they are certainly doing damage to the department which is in charge of the marketing of butter. I think the House is entitled to the figures I have asked for.</P>
      <P>When he states that he cannot collect them I do not believe it is so.  I believe he can get them if he wishes.  The Minister has power to regulate the export of butter, and I think he should have power also to have the figures of the quantity of butter which is kept in cold storage from time to time.  If that butter goes wrong somebody has to pay for it, and the farmers are the people who are certain to suffer.  I will again ask the Minister to give the figures that I am looking for.</P>

      <P>In connection with Deputy Crowley's inquiries, I think it is relevant to ask whether it is correct that the Irish Associated Creameries are being very much impeded in the marketing of butter by Section 14 of the Creamery Act, 1928.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is relevant in this way.  Deputy Crowley's point relates to the big quantities of butter that are in cold storage here. My point is that part of that may arise from the difficulty that the Irish Associated Creameries find themselves in in regard to the marketing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Crowley is merely asking for figures.  As the Deputy knows, on the adjournment he is confined to the particular question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Crowley is also concerned as to why that state of affairs prevails.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Hogan) Patrick J. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that I have not any powers to get these figures.  I believe the Statistics Branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce has the power.  The Department of Agriculture has not.  I do not want to get away on that distinction either.  Supposing the Statistics Branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce wanted to get the figures they would have to circularise every creamery in the country and every cold store.  It would take a very long time to get the information, and when it is got what use would it be?  The Statistics Branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce, I understand, have tremendous powers to make business men give information as to what stocks they hold, and so on. I am not so sure, while they may get that information, that they have powers to use that information except in very limited directions. Suppose that as a result of three months' investigation they have found that there are X tons in cold storage, how would that particular information either put up or decrease the price of butter?  It would not make the slightest difference to the price.  It would be three months wasted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I wanted to get the particulars was that £172,000 worth of butter was imported for the first three months of this year, January, February and March.  If the quantity proved to be as high as it is rumoured it is then, I think, the Minister should take action in the matter and see that the home market is protected, so that butter would not be dumped in here from other countries while we have thousands of tons of butter in cold storage.  I maintain that it <Col N="2451" /> is the Minister's business to know what quantity of butter is in cold storage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to that, supposing there is a certain quantity of butter in cold storage.  It might not be imported butter.  Most likely is Irish butter, cold stored since last year. Suppose it is a fact that £172,000 worth of butter was imported in the months of January, February and March.  The position will be that during the months of June, July and August imports will make no difference, because we will have a huge import surplus.  I only want to understand what the Deputy is at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that you have £172,000 going out of the country for butter while we have butter stored up at home.  There is no doubt that it is there and that some of it has gone wrong.  If it has gone wrong, the farmers are certain to suffer; and where you have, as was recently the case, fourpence a gallon paid for milk, I cannot see how the farmers can be expected to pay rates and taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewFogarty" hpid="Mr. Fogarty Mr. Fogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the Minister responsible for the Marketing Board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewFogarty" hpid="Mr. Fogarty Mr. Fogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Who was responsible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The creameries of the country.  I am glad the Deputy asked me that question.  I have no responsibility for setting up the Marketing Board.  The creameries of the country set up this institution. They can run it as they wish. I have no control over it and I do not want to have any control.  I do not think a Government body is suitable to deal with a marketing board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Crowley's point, most of the butter in cold store will be sold in England, not in Ireland.  He says he wants a tariff on butter.  We need not argue as to what the effect of a tariff on butter would be in the months of January. <Col N="2452" /> February and March.  What is absolutely certain is that a tariff on butter during the months of June, July and August would not affect the price in the slightest, because, in fact, we have a big export during these three months.  In any event, I have no power to go to any business man in this country and ask him what butter or what stocks he has in his creamery stores.  If I went to a lot of the creameries they would tell me quite rightly to mind my own business.  The Department of Industry and Commerce have immense power to collect statistics, but they are limited, to a great extent, in the use they make of them. So far as the Department of Industry and Commerce is concerned, it is a question of whether it would be worth their while to stop the work of their statistics branch and spend two or three months collecting this information, having regard to the very doubtful value the results would have for them at the end of their investigations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Crowley's case is that particularly during the months he has mentioned there was a considerable import of foreign butter while there was a considerable quantity of Irish butter in cold store. The I.A.C. held that butter when they should have put it into the market when there was a demand and a good price for it.  While we were importing butter they held their supplies and allowed them to deteriorate. Clearly if that is the case there is justification as to why the Minister should take the responsibility of ascertaining what supplies are in cold store, and of seeing that the demands of the local markets are met from the cold stores.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the discussion has shown that my question is relevant because we have actually been discussing a tariff on butter now.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The marketing of butter by the Irish Associated Creameries has been impeded by Section 14 of the Creameries Act of 1928.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the effect of that section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The prohibition of unlicensed maintenance of certain creameries.  It refers to the licensing of creameries.  If my information be correct it has been found that that prevents the Associated Creameries from making up the butter in pound rolls and that they actually have to start a factory in Liverpool for that purpose, a great deal of the demand being for pound rolls.  That would obviously be a very undesirable thing and a thing that should be immediately remedied by an amending Act. I would like the Minister to tell us if he has had any representation or is aware that that state of things prevails.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That raises a big question. I cannot discuss it on the adjournment. The whole purpose, effect and intention of the Dairy Produce Act is to prevent butter being tampered with once it leaves the creamery, to see that it reaches the customer in exactly the same condition in which it leaves the creamery. To suggest that somebody should have the right to re-open the packets and re-make them is against the spirit of the Dairy Produce Act, and I cannot go into the merits of that. I do not think the House could go into the merits of that in anything like ten minutes.  There are a great many other alternatives besides setting up a factory in Liverpool.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">

      <P>Could the Minister tell us whether a factory has been set up in Liverpool?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  I may say that the I.A.C. has no butter in cold storage.  I happen to know that not as Minister for Agriculture. The I.A.C. has sold its butter, and sold it pretty well.  If it comes to a question of holding a court and trying the various business men for handling their produce badly, I do <Col N="2454" /> not think the I.A.C. would come out of it badly at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister will find that the I.A.C. have set up a factory in Liverpool.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was, certainly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>And it was held over until the price depreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Any butter that was put in cold storage was held there during a period of falling prices. Everyone knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister, since he knows the butter was held in cold store, give the figures asked for by the Deputy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got them. I have no power to get them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is we are told there was butter in cold storage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone in the country knows there was butter in cold storage.  It would be very difficult to get the exact quantity of butter.  I have no power, as Minister for Agriculture, to find out from the cold storage people what butter is in cold store.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore the information that we got is correct, that there was a considerable quantity of butter in cold storage.  It was held over, and as a result deteriorated, and was sold at a considerable loss.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Honestly I am not aware of that.  Suppose there is, is that my business?  Surely I cannot be blamed if the creameries do not market their butter.  Do you want me to go into the marketing business?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AndrewFogarty" hpid="Mr. Fogarty Mr. Fogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fogarty</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not read the report. Suppose all that is true, do you want the Department of Agriculture to go into the marketing business?  The fact of the matter is, I am afraid, that we are going to get into the habit of fighting out this dispute between what are called the inside creameries, the creameries of the I.A.C. and the creameries outside it, here in the Dáil.  That would be rather a bad state of affairs.  There is a difficult situation in the butter trade at the present moment.  There was a decent attempt made by a body called the I.A.C. to find some better means of marketing butter than was in operation in the past.  I am not going to pass judgment as to whether their methods were good, bad or indifferent.  As Minister for Agriculture, I have set up a Tribunal, which I think is an impartial Tribunal, to examine into the marketing <Col N="2456" /> of butter during the last few years and to make recommendations to me.  If that Tribunal is to do its work and give a report that will be valuable it ought to be allowed to operate without trying to prejudice beforehand its findings.  There can be no real argument against letting in the light.  That Tribunal will get all the facts.  I know that there are a great many vested interests.  There are some people with vested interests in single marketing, there are others with vested interests in combined marketing.  Of course, these vested interests are trying to protect their interests.  Our business should be to get the best price possible for dairy produce as a whole without any regard to any interest.  I suggest that the best service that Deputies can do to the butter trade would be to allow the Tribunal to get on with its work and not to listen too attentively to the various vested interests that are trying to get at Deputies of the various Parties at the present moment.</P>
