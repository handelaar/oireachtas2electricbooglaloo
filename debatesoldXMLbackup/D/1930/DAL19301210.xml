      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that at the last meeting of the Donegal County Council a resolution was unanimously adopted in which was pointed out the poverty existing amongst the unemployed, the landless men, the uneconomic holders and the fishermen in that county, and whether he will state the amount which it is proposed to expend in County Donegal out of the £300,000 which has been voted by the Dáil for relief schemes.</P>

      <P>I have not seen a copy of the resolution to which the Deputy refers.  With regard to the second part of the question, the claims of County Donegal will be considered by the Departments concerned in conjunction with claims put forward by other areas, but it is not proposed at this stage to allocate on a county basis the full amount voted by the Dáil for the relief of unemployment and distress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The approval of a road for traffic across the land frontier cannot be effective except with the concurrence of both the Saorstát and British Governments.  In the case of the road from Dundalk to Forkhill, representations <Col N="1043" /> have been made on several occasions since 1925 by the Revenue Commissioners to the British Customs authorities requesting their consent to the full approval of this road or a modified approval for the clearance of goods on certain days.  The British authorities, however, have consistently refused.  In the absence of British agreement, steps cannot be taken to have the road in question treated as an approved road.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Dundalk-Newry road, which is kept open and on which he has customs officials, is not of much benefit to the residents of the Twenty-Six County area, and simply facilitates Belfast buses and Belfast business men?  Is he further aware that this other road which the Dundalk people want open would facilitate the people in South Armagh who used to shop in Dundalk?  They are anxious to continue shopping, in Dundalk, and as conditions exist they are greatly inconvenienced. The people have to go around a distance of fifteen miles.</P>

      <P>The memorandum referred <Col N="1050" /> to is not a general statement of policy by my Department in regard to the nature of the education which is suitable for children between the ages of 14 and 16.  It deals solely with the type of education to be provided by Vocational Education Committees. The programme and regulations of the National Education Branch&mdash;and of the Secondary Branch&mdash;give scope for the provision of education of a general type for pupils between 14 and 16. This memorandum does not, as is suggested, involve any change of policy. It not only is not inconsistent, but is in full accord with the terms of the policy that I outlined whilst the Vocational Education Act was being passed through the Oireachtas.  One of the matters most strongly emphasised by me on these occasions was the difference that ought to exist between the instruction provided by the Committees and the education of a general type that is given in the ordinary primary schools&mdash;and in the secondary schools&mdash;throughout the country. Sometimes I had to refer to the fact that it was not intended to confine the instruction to manual subjects, but I was careful to insist that when what are called &ldquo;cultural&rdquo; subjects are taught, especially between the ages mentioned, they should have a strong practical bias.</P>

No provision is contained in the Act for the grading of fresh meat, and in the absence of such provision there is no power to require marking of fresh meat so as to indicate a system of grading.</P>

A sum of £400 was segregated for the purpose of doing this work out of the relief Vote.  That was subsequently <Col N="1063" /> transferred to another work.  Ordinarily this work should be done out of the Improvement Vote and the Land Commission transferred this sum of £400, sanctioned in the first instance to another work because they expected at a later date to do this work at Inisfree out of the Improvements Vote. In the second place, the islanders were in revolt against the payment of rent to the Land Commission and the Land Commission would not carry out the work until the islanders would agree to recognise their liability for these rents.</P>

I do not want to be unreasonable or to block this Bill in any way by anything I might do.

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>In line 25, to delete the words &ldquo;but does not include fishing for salmon.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill does not bring within its scope salmon fisheries in the sea <Col N="1088" /> around the Irish coast, and we are not satisfied that the reason given by the Minister for excluding these fisheries is adequate.  Up to the present his Department have not given loans for nets to these salmon fishermen, on the ground that there was a danger that if they were given nets they might be seized for a contravention of the fishery bye-laws.  That, in my opinion, is not a sufficient reason.  There are a very large number of fishermen engaged in the tidal waters as well as in the sea, and the industry that is represented by these workers is of great value to the country.  It is worth a great deal of money, and there is no reason why they should not be included in the first section of this Bill. Some of them are very poor people, and salmon-fishing is practically the only means of existence they have.  I think the Minister should, at least, give himself discretion, if an opportunity should present itself in the future, of excluding these poor fishermen and giving them a chance to benefit under this new Association.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands and Fisheries (Mr. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition as it stands follows a similar definition in the rules of the Association, page 2, M. The omission of the words will not in fact have any immediate effect as far as the operations of the Bill are concerned.  It affects in the Bill only clause 2 and clause 3.  Under clause 2, we hand over certain assets to the Sea Fisheries Association.  In fact, I have no such assets in connection with salmon gear that I can hand over, so, as far as the Bill is concerned, the amendment has no effect there.  The Sea Fisheries Board is also mentioned in clause 3, which provides certain penalties where the Association makes loans of boats or gear for specific purposes.  As far as the Bill is concerned, therefore, the amendment really would have no effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to extend the scope of the Association's operations so as to bring in salmon fishermen in the sea, it would be necessary to change the rules of the Association at a general meeting.  I mentioned previously the difficulty to which Deputy Derrig alluded.  That was before the minds of the directors apparently that they <Col N="1089" /> might have made a loan for the provision of boats or gear for salmon drift net fishing and that they would find through a breach of the fishery law the gear seized by the authorities for perhaps very little debt.  Their only remedy then would be to sue the particular fisherman who had borrowed. In many cases, he would be a very poor man.  At the same time, if there were any widespread desire on the part of salmon fishermen for facilities of the kind and if the Committee of the Association saw that that particular thing could be got over it is conceivable that the rules of the Association could be changed.</P>
    <P>I might say, as far as I read the rules, that this only affects the question of the provision of boats and gear, there is nothing in the rules to prevent the bringing in of salmon to the co-operative marketing scheme. As far as I am personally concerned, I have an absolutely open mind in the matter.  If the Deputy thinks it will be any good&mdash;and perhaps it would in the sense that it would give freedom to the Association if they wanted to extend&mdash;I will accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Law</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very glad if the Minister would impress upon the Association the advisability of so amending their rules.  I am aware of certain difficulties that have arisen.  I cannot see that there is anything substantial in the point as to the danger of seizure of nets which might not apply in the case of other fishermen. It is a matter, at any rate, which ought to be clearly, I think, within the discretion of the Associaton, and I hope we may now take it that the Minister will represent to the Association the advisability of so amending their rules.</P>

      <P>If this amendment is accepted the effect of it will be that at least one argument will be removed <Col N="1090" /> when the question comes before the Association.  At least, it effects this: if the Association only consider it advisable, it will give them an opportunity of bringing them in.  If they do not bring them in, giving the opportunity here will not do a bit of harm to the fishermen.  They are a class of fishermen who really fall between two sets of fishermen.  I know that around the coast of Waterford the drift net fishermen find that their interests are not the same as, for instance, the interests of the herring fishermen.  Things done on behalf of the herring fishermen are objected to by the drift net men, who also find themselves in conflict with the interests of the rod men on the river, and those who own charters on the river.  I think, at least, we should make it as easy as possible for the Association to give them the opportunity of becoming members.</P>

      <P>I would like also to urge on the Minister that this class of fishermen should be included, as in Galway there is a considerable volume-of opinion as to the development of drift net fishing, which, in the past, was allowed, and which, by a bye-law, was prevented in 1913.  The Minister has already got representations upon the matter and he must be aware at this stage that there would be a considerable number of fishermen involved in this particular class of fishery.  I would urge on the Minister that if the drift net fishermen were brought into-this it would help them considerably.</P>

      <P>Where the Society has supplied to any member thereof or has repaired or renovated for any such member any sea-fishing boat or any equipment or appliance, for a sea-fishing boat or any fishing nets and a contract has been entered into between the Society and such member whereby such member agrees with the Society to pay to the Society in a particular manner specified in such contract the cost of such supply or repair or renovation and such member does any act, whether of commission or omission, which is a contravention of such agreement, such member shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof, where such member is a body corporate, in the case of a first offence to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds and in the case of a second or any subsequent offence to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds or, where such member is an individual, in the case of a first offence to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds and in the case of a second or any subsequent offence to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds or, at the discretion of the Court, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 2:</P>
      <P>In line 27, to delete all words after the word &ldquo;thereof&rdquo; to the end of the section and substitute therefor the following: &ldquo;in the case of a first offence to a fine of £5 in addition to the amount of debt or damages due by him and in the case of a second or any subsequent offence to a fine of £10 in addition to the amount of such debt or damage, such fine together with such debt or damage to be enforceable by all means by which a judgment may be enforced.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section imposes a new penalty on fishermen who may receive loans from this Association and who may not be in a position to meet their obligations when the time for payment <Col N="1092" /> comes.  In the case of a first offence, the section imposes a fine not exceeding £20 and, in the case of a second or subsequent offence, a fine not exceeding £50, or, at the discretion of the Court, imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months.  It is quite a long time ago since the law which imposed the penalty of imprisonment on rich debtors was abolished, and it seems to me that the Minister is on very weak ground when he seeks to alter the basis of the civil law to enable the offence which I have mentioned to be made a criminal offence, punishable by imprisonment. The provisions of this section will affect a very poor section of the community, while the rich debtors can, under the present law, get off scot free.  The Minister will, no doubt, say that since State moneys are involved it is up to him to see that all possible safeguards are inserted to secure that that money will be collected. He may be justified in saying that there is a tradition that Government debts are oftentimes looked upon in a different way from private debts, that it is harder to collect them and that the people who get these loans have not the same sense of responsibility as they would have in the case of private creditors.  Nevertheless, I think it discloses a fatal weakness in the whole treatment of the problem when the Minister cannot treat the fishermen on the basis that they will deal with him in good faith, that they will try to meet him, and that they will realise he is doing what he can to help them.  Instead of adopting that course, he seeks to impose heavy penalties.  He may say that this provision will, in fact, be a dead letter and that the penalty of imprisonment will not be imposed. As I said on Second Reading, if the directors pass this power by they will be creating a very bad precedent.  On the other hand, if it is enforced the work of the Association will become quite impossible because it will be bearing an intolerable odium in the opinion of these people.</P>
    <P>The amendment which I propose meets the position of the Minister fairly enough.  It recognises his difficulty. For a first offence, it imposes a <Col N="1093" /> fine of £5, in addition to the amount of debt or damage due by the defaulter, and for a second or subsequent offence a fine of £10 in addition to the amount of debt or damage.  The fine, in addition to the debt or damage, is to be enforceable by all the means by which a judgment may be enforced at present &mdash;that is, by the ordinary court procedure. There is no reason why these defaulters should be put on a different basis from, for example, the Land Commission defaulters, who go before the court and have their cases argued according to the ordinary civil procedure. The Minister is trying to make this a criminal offence.  In that, I think, he is very unwise and it is not going to have the desired effect.  I would ask him to meet my amendment or to accept it, if at all possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasPPowell" hpid="Dr. Powell Dr. Powell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Powell</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards another class of debts under the Fishery Acts, a considerable contrast exists in respect of the fines imposed on trawlers and those imposed by conservators on people who poach in the rivers.  I only mention that to show that if in these cases we have very large fines the contrast may be still further intensified between the ordinary fishermen who contravene the law and the rich people who can well afford to pay the fines, but who are let off with fines of about £5.  That amount has been imposed in some instances on trawlers which poached within the three-mile limit.  I support this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>The first difficulty in connection with this section, as Deputy Derrig pointed out, is that it places the people affected in the position of criminals.  It treats this as a criminal offence, which is altogether repugnant to public policy.  This is in the nature of post-war legislation.  Immediately after the war certain types of legislation were necessary as temporary remedies and very severe penalties were provided for.  There is one blot still on the Statute Book&mdash;the Enforcement of Orders Act&mdash;by which, even under the present law, a person can be put into jail where the District Justice is satisfied that the defendant has means and will not pay the debt.  I think that Deputy Derrig's amendment is extremely moderate, because it does not interfere with the ordinary law&mdash;<Col N="1094" /> the power which exists to put people into jail where the District Justice is satisfied that they have the means to pay and will not pay.  That Act, I hope, will be removed in due course, because it is part of post-war legislation and should not be on the Statute Book.  No man should be liable to be put into jail for a mere breach of a civil contract.  It is atrocious that that should be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this amendment would be very bad for the future of the Association.  I shall not use any of the arguments that Deputy Derrig prophesied I would use.  I shall not refer to the fact that there should be any discrimination where State moneys are involved as against cases where no State moneys are involved.  The position is that we are taking, through the agency of the Sea Fisheries Association, a very revolutionary step.  That step is designed to give the fisherman an opportunity of becoming the owner of his own boat on terms of repayment which are equitably adjusted to the circumstances of the industry.  In doing this, we are putting the greatest trust in the general body of fishermen.  I have no doubt that the result will be quite fruitful, that our trust in the men will be justified, and that this proposal will have very beneficial effects on the industry as a whole.  But it would be absurd to close our eyes to the obvious dangers.  It is not by any action on the part of the general body of fishermen, or on the part of any general body, but rather by the derelictions of a few that any beneficial measure may be brought to the ground.  We must provide effectively against those dangers which can be easily foreseen.  There is no question involved as regards the poor fisherman who is not able to meet his obligations.  He is not involved under Section 3 at all.  The Association will have plenty of power under its rules to deal with him.  Section 3 refers only to the case of a fisherman who has obtained a boat or gear from the Association and who wilfully does something in the way of evading his obligations to hand over his catch or something of that kind which is, in fact, dishonest.  That is the person to whom the section applies.  One or two such cases might not matter.  But if two or <Col N="1095" /> three adopted such a course and it be gan to grow the end would inevitably be that the whole scheme for the supply of boats and gear would be imperilled.</P>
      <P>One could easily imagine this thing starting in a certain area.  One or two persons, instead of bringing their fish and selling through the Association's agent, selling perhaps at a higher price to somebody else, and not paying back their share, that is to say the share that would be normally deducted by the Association's agent for the Association.  Such men would, in fact, be attempting to swindle the Association.  You can quite see how that would spread and how the loyalty of the other fishermen would be sapped.  The fishermen would know that this thing was going on. The result would be that, perhaps, the men who were loyal to the Association, seeing this thing going on would be brought into such a frame of mind that their loyalty might be undermined.  One can easily see how that could happen.  I think it is very important that any danger of this thing happening should be dealt with and dealt with severely.  As a matter of fact, I cannot imagine how any member of a fishermen's Association, anxious for the welfare of the Association, and anxious that the Association should go ahead could object to a provision of this kind.  I think the honest fisherman would like to see his Association going ahead. Remember it is his own Association and it is his interest that the Association should be able to bring a prosecution to stop a thing of this kind.  Remember further that the fishermen themselves will have in a great measure control over this Association. It will be their own Association that will bring this prosecution and they will bring it in order to safeguard the general body of fishermen from the black sheep who may be amongst them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must further be borne in mind that these are maximum penalties, and that it will be for the District Justice to exercise his judgment in the imposition of any penalties within the maxima.  It is however provided <Col N="1096" /> in a section of the Bill that before any prosecution is taken it must be taken through the Minister for Fisheries.  The Association under their rules, as I have already pointed out, will have plenty of scope for dealing with the ordinary pleas of non-ability to pay.  But in all cases. of this kind I think the Association should have these further powers to deal with the wrong ones that may be in any particular area.  I think the section as it stands is necessary to deal with those aggravated cases to which I am referring and I ask the House not to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesGeoghehan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I venture to think that if the Minister wishes to persuade this House that dishonesty or fraud or swindling on the part of any individual who comes within the ambit of this Bill should be punished, that he will have a very easy task.  Of course, the Minister has to deal with a situation that is to a large extent novel.  I presume the whole scheme of this Bill is to some extent novel.  The intention of this Bill, so far as one can gather from reading the Bill, or from any statement that has been made, is so admirable that one has to be very careful lest one might say something which might sound as if one desired to impede the Minister either in fostering this fishing industry or in dealing with some new difficulties or removing some impediment that he foresees in the way of this scheme.  Although one may hesitate for these reasons, one is, I think, quite justified in protesting against what seems to be the imposition not merely of a money penalty, but imprisonment for the breach of a civil contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has harped so much upon black sheep, upon the dishonest fishermen, and so on, that one would think from his language that he really contemplates somebody overstepping the existing criminal law.  If that is what the Minister has in view, the law is elastic enough and far-reaching enough to deal with the offence.  According to the Bill, that is not what the Minister has in view.  The marginal note of the Bill is, of course, important, its importance one could not exaggerate.  This marginal note reads: &ldquo;Breach of certain contracts by members <Col N="1097" /> of the Society.&rdquo;  That would seem to indicate what the Minister is aiming at.  I do suggest to you, and I do urge upon the House that we are long past the day when imprisonment even for debt can be defended with any hope of convincing the majority.  But to try to establish a new doctrine that a mere breach of a civil contract which may not even involve liability for the payment of money, is to be introduced into this State, is perhaps something that is repugnant to the sense and the conscience of a great many citizens of this State.</P>
    <P>Granting that there is a breach of contract, why should a novel remedy be introduced?  If there is to be this breach of contract and punishment by imprisonment, why should not the same apply to a contract in the matter of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, or as my collegue, Deputy Derrig, said, of the Land Commission, or of any other public department?  Not even confining it to a public department, but bringing in local boards, why should not a man be sent to jail for a breach of any contract?</P>
    <P>I think this distinction between an individual and the Corporation is not very easily understood except for one reason, of course, that a corporation is not a body that one can very well lodge in jail.  But it does seem unjust that if an individual takes this loan or owns a boat he can be sent to prison for breaking his contract, whereas if that individual went through the formality of forming himself into a one-man company and should commit this offence through his corporation he would have absolute immunity from imprisonment. I submit to the House that such an illustration as that lends force to what has been urged by Deputy Derrig, that apart from the fundamental argument against this section, that there is this argument, that it might lead to discrimination as between the rich and poor.  The rich man having this section in view will avoid the carrying on of his business individually.  He might, under the procedure that exists, turn himself into a body corporate and thereby safeguard himself against these severe penalties.  I venture to think that the House will not be impressed by the arguments of the Minister that <Col N="1098" /> the District Justice will be a buffer between the unfortunate fishermen and the jailer.  The District Justice must, of course, administer the law, but if a breach of contract, a breach of the Act by omission or commission, is proved, the District Justice, however large and charitable his heart may be, must exercise his discretion judicially, and if a breach of contract is proved it is difficult to see how he could refuse judgment or a warrant to send the contractor to prison.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I meant to convey that, and I thought I had said it.  My suggestion is that the discretion vested in a District Justice is not something equivalent to the right to be capricious. That is a mere judicial discretion.  In the exercise of that discretion he must not be guided entirely by the promptings of his own heart.  Once the conditions laid down by the statute are fulfilled and proved to the satisfaction of the District Justice, he is a mere judicial machine.  That discretion must be exercised on those judicial principles. He cannot resist the request for the remedy which is given by the statute. It is also suggested that in some way which I have not quite apprehended the directors or committee of the society may be a safeguard.</P>
      <P>The directors of the society are occupying a position which, if not strictly fiduciary, nearly approaches the fiduciary position.  If those directors are satisfied that a fisherman has broken his contract they, as directors in the discharge of their fiduciary functions, are bound to put the machinery in force and are bound by all the means at their disposal to press the District Justice to exercise the powers given there for the protection of the property of the society.  It is unavoidable, and if they do not do it they are guilty of a grave offence, an offence which, I suggest, would be far more worthy of punishment by imprisonment than a breach of contract by an unfortunate man who borrowed money for a boat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is candidly suggested that, after this Bill has been passed, a director of a society knows that somebody has done an act or has omitted to do an <Col N="1099" /> act which brings him within the section, yet that director deliberately omits to do his duty and put the section into force.  I repeat that a director who would be capable of doing that would be far more worthy of prison.  The big argument against that, the argument upon which I rely, is that to introduce any measure which provides, as this provides in clear terms, that the mere breach of a civil contract is to involve a person in a money penalty, and not merely a money penalty but liability to imprisonment for a term, is something so new and startling and so out of tune with ideas in this country and, indeed, in the civilised world generally, that this House should hesitate long before it lends sanction to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest to the Minister that it is an extremely bad way to start a new movement for fishery development by assuming that the fishermen are a particularly bad lot and that you have to pass special laws and subject them to certain punishment that would be outlandish in the case of any other set of producers in order effectively to deal with them?  I suggest that is not going to get the confidence of the fishermen. It must be plain to the Minister that the fishermen resent this proposal very much.  I do not think it is even yet realised how extraordinary is the proposal.  Let us say a fishing boat is in Buncrana Bay and the men get an offer to sell their fish in Derry. It is said much better prices prevail in Derry than can be obtained by the auctioneer at Buncrana.  The auctioneers' prices are known and the fishermen decide to take advantage, with no evil intent, of the opportunity of selling in Derry.  As the Minister himself stated, the fishermen may get a better price in Derry than in Buncrana.  Yet that breach of the regulations may involve the fishermen in imprisonment.  A fisherman may intend to pay his full instalments and meet all the requirements of the Society with regard to his catch, but simply for a technical offence in sending them for sale to Derry rather than Buncrana he will <Col N="1100" /> be liable to imprisonment.  I suggest that is altogether too ridiculous.</P>
      <P>If the Minister insists on maintaining that provision in the Bill, we, on this side, will have to vote against every stage of the Bill from this forward. We could not agree to a Bill with this particular provision in it going through.  As has been stated, there would be an equal claim for enforcing this provision against people who defaulted in regard to rates or land annuities.  As a matter of fact, there would be a much bigger case, because when a man defaults with his rates his neighbours have to pay.  Here a fisherman can be imprisoned though he does not cause harm to the extent of a penny.  He may, in fact, benefit his society by getting a higher price for his fish.  That is not to say that discipline must not be maintained.  No society could be maintained without discipline, but there are plenty of other ways in which it can be maintained. There are, for instance, rights of excluding a member from a society &mdash;depriving him of membership.  The right of fining him is there, too.  Such a proposal as that he should be imprisoned, or that the liability for imprisonment should be even theoretically available for such an offence, seems, to my mind, to be the most extraordinary proposal that we have ever had in the Dáil.</P>

I thoroughly disagree with the penal clauses.</P>

      <P>There is no use in creating an unreal atmosphere about this clause, and that is the attempt that is being made.  One would imagine it was going to be an absolute certainty that any defaulting fisherman was going to be sentenced to six months' imprisonment.  Deputy Geoghegan referred to the fact that the District Justice must administer the law as it is.  Quite so.  There is <Col N="1101" /> nothing in the section to prevent the District Justice from imposing any penalty, even less than the money fines mentioned in the section.  The Deputy said this was an entirely new principle, and he referred to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  If the Deputy, who is a lawyer, read the Agricultural Credit Act, he would find that there is such a provision in that Act.  He would find the following in Section 22:</P>
      <P>(1)  Any person who for the purpose of obtaining for himself or any other person or any body of persons corporate or unincorporate a loan or advance of money from the Corporation wilfully makes whether verbally or in writing a statement which is to his knowledge false or misleading shall be guilty of a misdemeanour and be liable on conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding two hundred pounds or in the case of an individual and at the discretion of the court to penal servitude for three years or imprisonment for any term not exceeding two years.</P>
      <P>(2)  Every person who, having obtained a loan or advance of money from the Corporation on the terms that such money shall be applied by him for a specified purpose, fails to apply such money for such purpose shall be guilty of a misdemeanour and shall be liable on conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding two hundred pounds or in the case of an individual and at the discretion of the court to imprisonment for any term not exceeding twelve months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Agricultural Credit Corporation therefore does, in fact, provide such a remedy.  I do not believe that that discretion, has ever been exercised by any District Justice, and I believe that it would be only an extremely rare case in which it would be exercised by him, but I believe that it is right that it should be there.  There is no use in pretending, as Deputies Moore and Geoghegan pretended, that I said that this was distrust of the general body of fishermen.  I said that the whole scheme was a sign of the greatest trust in the general body of fishermen.  It is to protect the <Col N="1102" /> general body of fishermen against persons who would injure their association that this provision is inserted. I say that it is because of my trust in the general body of fishermen that I want to protect them from persons who might abuse the benefits given under the Bill and given by the association.  I strongly hold that this provision should be retained.  I almost felt for a, while that we were back there to a situation in which we were inserting in a Bill minimum penalties.  One would imagine that these were minimum penalties and that the District Justice had to impose them without discretion.  That is not the case.  Deputy Geoghegan has already pointed out, though he tried to mislead the House afterwards, that the District Justice has discretion to do what he considers right.  It would only be in the most aggravated cases that he would exercise full discretion and impose a penalty of imprisonment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesGeoghehan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let there not be any confusion of thought in regard to this matter.  If any words of mine were unhappy or inapt I wish to correct and make them plain.  I thought that I had made it plain that I was not suggesting for one moment that crime should not be punished by a money penalty, by imprisonment, or by penal servitude if necessary.  On the contrary, in the opening words of my speech I said that what the Minister had referred to would seem to be offences with which the existing criminal law, common law, or statute law dealing with crime would embrace. The protest which I make, a protest which I think has come from other quarters of this House, is not against the punishment of crime by a penalty, be it imprisonment or anything else, but against the introduction of what we say is a novel principle, namely, the punishment of a breach of civil contract by sending a man to jail.  That is merely the resurrection of a 16th, 17th, or 18th century practice whereby debtors were sent to jail because they would not pay their debts.  Under the clause, as it stands, as soon as one finds that a breach of contract has been committed there is cause to <Col N="1103" /> send to jail.  To compare that with enactments dealing with the obtaining of money by false pretences, or with the wilful misstatement made to obtain money by fraudulent means, is, to put it mildly, not helping this House in the consideration of the clause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Views may differ in this House on such a question.  To me, at any rate, there is nothing very repulsive in the idea of punishing a person who obtains money on the representation that it is to be used for a particular purpose and then applying it to some other purpose.  If a statute enabled him to get money by making certain representation, if he falsely and wilfully makes a false statement, and if he gets money and applies it to something else, speaking for myself, I can see nothing very terrible in the thought of sending him to jail or to penal servitude.  To me there is a wide Atlantic between a case such as the Minister indicates and a breach of civil contract, which is what this clause deals with.  I challenge the Minister to produce any precedent, in any 20th century statute at all events, for the punishment by imprisonment for a mere breach of contract, without even any restriction as to the nature of the breach.  The Minister then proceeds to stress the portion of the clause under which jurisdiction is given to the District Justice, and one would think from what the Minister has just said that this is a provision, so wholly unnecessary and inapplicable to any set of facts ever likely to arise, it will never be put into force.  That, I think, was fairly the tenor of the Minister's observations, that one could hardly fancy a case in which the directors will think it necessary to invoke the jurisdiction or where the District Justice will think it right to exercise it.  If that is so, why encumber the Bill with such words?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If they are unnecessary let them go. If what the Minister seeks to deal with is fraud, or obtaining money by false pretences or any other form of crime, <Col N="1104" /> why not leave it to the ordinary law of the land?</P>

The debate has proceeded altogether on the question of whether or not the words of the section which deal with imprisonment should be retained, and it is the form of amendment 3 which really gets that question decided.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I have another amendment, which proposes to alter the amount to be fixed as penalties in the case of offences under this section.  I ask the House to accept an amendment from me, that in the case of a first offence the fine should be £5 and in the case of a second or subsequent offence £10.  The section as it stands imposes a fine for the first offence not exceeding £20, and for a second or subsequent offence not exceeding £50. <Col N="1107" /> When we consider the circumstances of the people in the poor areas in the West of Ireland it is ridiculous to have £50 as the limit of a fine in one case and £20 in the other.  I suggest that £5 and £10 will be reasonable enough. The Minister has stated that he wants to safeguard the Association.  The Association, in fact, has only come into existence.  It is not organised through the country, and the bulk of the fishermen who may be affected have not had an opportunity of stating their opinion on the matter.  Neither has the Fishery Association had an opportunity of deciding whether in fact these penal clauses and heavy fines would be necessary or not.  I hold they will not.  If they are, I suggest that the fines the Minister has mentioned are out of all proportion to the circumstances of these people and that £5 and £10 would be adequate. If a boat is given, for example, obviously the value of the boat could not possibly be met by a fine of £5 or £10, but in that case you will have a whole Society and you can take action against the individuals in the particular society which got the loan.  I do not think the single individual will have a very heavy responsibility, but rather that the aim will be to develop the thing in the way of a co-operative society.  Therefore I suggest that a fine of £5 or £10 would be sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has already drawn a distinction between a corporation and an individual.  I am only concerned with the individual.  If we think it right to lower the fine in the case of the individual we ought to do so.  We can deal afterwards with the special case of the corporation.  But, as the section stands, it is altogether too general: &ldquo;Any act of commission or omission in contravention of the agreement.&rdquo; These poor people will not be well versed in legal phraseology and, as Deputy Moore pointed out, it may be that the particular offence with which they are charged will not alone not be a fraudulent one for which they would be amenable under the criminal law but, in fact, they may be doing something which would be of benefit to the society.  They can actually be <Col N="1108" /> charged and have heavy fines imposed upon them for selling fish at a higher price than the Association could get for it.  They may be doing themselves a benefit and doing the fishing industry a benefit, but still it is possible to have them up for a contravention of the agreement.  I submit that we have not that in the case of the creamery organisation and in other cases that have been cited here, and we should be very careful not to discourage the fishermen by imposing very heavy penalties.  I therefore ask the Minister, now that he has safeguarded himself by maintaining the principle that imprisonment is to be there as a deterrent, to accept a reduction in the amount suggested as fines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to add to what I said in dealing with the section. It is all nonsense to say that a person is going to do benefit to the Association by evading his obligations to the Association.  The person in contemplation is the person who sells his fish elsewhere, even at a higher price, if he refuses to hand over the proper proportion to the Association for the repayment of the loan for boat and gear that he got.  I do not see how a person is going to benefit the Association if he refuses to act up to the conditions laid down in the granting of these loans.  I think that person is going very soon to disrupt the Association, if he were followed in that respect on any wide scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to Deputy Derrig's point, that a body corporate might have a very big loan from the Association that £5 or £10 as a fine would meet.  He seemed to say that there would be very little individual borrowing from the Association for big amounts, that it would be co-operative societies.  That is not my contemplation of the thing at all.  My idea is that a person down in Dingle or over in Galway who is a member of the Association is going to become the owner of his own boat through borrowing from the Association and repaying out of his catches.  He is going to be the proprietor of his own boat and gear I hope, and I know very well that the loans in some cases that the individuals will be getting from the <Col N="1109" /> Association will run into a couple of hundred pounds even in the early stages.  Even the installation of an engine in a fishing boat will run into several hundred pounds.  That will be one of the first things they will be dealing with.  In a few years I should say, individuals will get through the Association, boats and gear value for £500, according as the Association is progressing and as the individual is making his name with the Association for repayment of loans already given. The small penalties mentioned would not meet the cases at all.  In fact if there is anything that would drive a District Justice into imposing imprisonment instead of a fine, it is having the fine so small, because where a man borrows £l00 from the Association and evades his obligation and the District Justice cannot impose a fine of more than £5 or £10 the District Justice, if he were to administer the law strictly, would feel that he would have to exercise a further discretion.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister has twice referred to the opposition to certain provisions in this section.  He said it is the intention, of the new society to enable fishermen to purchase boats.  Is there not also a big class of fishermen, possibly a bigger class, who will continue hiring their boats and who will not contract for the purchase of the boats at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The word &ldquo;hirer&rdquo; used in the Bill means really that no matter how poor the fisherman is, the amount that is deducted from the weekly catch will be in repayment of the loan.  It is not merely that he is applying for the hire and never becomes the proprietor of the particular implement.  The amount that he repays is repaying the Association for the particular gear given, and when he has paid whatever it costs and the interest thereon, he becomes the sole proprietor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the intention that there will be a class of fishermen who will continue to hire their boats without any intention of becoming the sole proprietors of those boats?  Is it not the case that there may be a class of fishermen who have no intention of purchasing their boats outright and <Col N="1110" /> who will continue to be hirers in perpetuity from the Association?  I understood such a class was contemplated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how that could occur, because in fact they would be paying their money week by week out of the cash from their catches as repayment for the loan, so that in spite of themselves they would become proprietors.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and negatived.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>As this section now makes provision for imprisonment, we are opposed to it.  Besides that, the Minister asks the House to agree with him in imposing penalties when we have no knowledge whatever of the type of contract to be made.  We have no idea whatever from the Minister of what the contract is likely to be, for which any member committing an act, whether of commission or omission, which is a contravention of the agreement, will be liable to suffer the penalty of imprisonment.  It seems to me that that phrase, added to the power to imprison, which the section contains, gives very great power to the directors to pursue an unfortunate defaulter, and there is practically no discretion in the matter.  As Deputy Geoghegan pointed out, the directors are going to carry out the Minister's behest.  They will be his children, as he will have a majority on the board, and if they are going to carry out the work they will naturally have to do their best to have imposed penalties under this section which the law confers upon them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We think these penalties are quite unnecessary and are apt to have a very damping effect on the whole project. And as we have no information as to the offences for which these people could be sent to prison, we propose to vote against this section.  In doing that we want to make it quite clear, as already emphasised from these benches, that as far as the commission of actual crime is concerned, or so far as provision against fraud is concerned, we are quite willing that the full penalty which the criminal law <Col N="1111" /> affords should be put in force, but, as has been pointed out, the offence is simply a breach of a civil contract, and the Minister made no substantial case to persuade this House that these fishermen should have these penalties of imprisonment inflicted upon them when other sections of the community who are debtors and defaulters to the State or local authorities or other associations can get off scot free and are absolutely immune from the threat of imprisonment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it desirable to make this further remark, that these penalties will place the working of the Association within very rigid limits. It will give no freedom of action to the fisherman who belongs to the Society, no matter what the circumstances that arise.  Let him dare to use his judgment with regard to the particular circumstances that arise, he will find himself faced with the possibility anyhow that he may not only be fined, but sent to prison.  In fishing there will inevitably always be occasions when the fisherman has no means of communicating with headquarters or with the general manager of the Society, and has to decide upon some action to meet particular circumstances. Will it be to the advantage of the Society if he sees before him a possibility that if he deflects in any way from the rules of the Society, even though without any ill intention, even though he may think it to be to the advantage of the Society&mdash;will it help the work of the Society if that man sees before him the possibility in such circumstances that he is going to be heavily fined, and even possibly sent to prison, if the law is administered as set down here?  No. I think the Minister should, before the next stage, reconsider this section.  He will find that it is not going to help the work of the Society, that it is not going to give the fishermen confidence that they are being treated on the same lines as the men producing wealth in other walks of life are.  It would be altogether an <Col N="1112" /> advantage if he showed more confidence in them than is evinced in this particular section.</P>

      <P>Deputy Moore harps back again to the pretended lack of confidence and tries to emphasise the fact that there is some differentiation between the treatment of the fisherman and everybody else.  As I quoted from the Agricultural Credit Corporation Act, there are penal provisions in that Act for certain offences, and one of these offences at, least is a breach of civil contract, that is failure to apply money for the purpose for which it was received.</P>

      <P>I beg to differ.  It is a breach of civil contract.  One would imagine that the Directors of this Association were going to spend their time looking out for occasions when they could come down like a ton of bricks on the fishermen.  If a fisherman finds himself in a situation where he cannot conveniently come into the port where the agent of the Association is working and if that is explained to the Association ordinary reasonable men will not prosecute in such a case.</P>
      <P>One must at least give them credit for having ordinary intelligence.  We must assume that the Committee of the Association at any time, now or in the future, will be such a body as will exercise ordinary intelligence in dealing with the application of this clause.  I hold to the same opinion just as strongly as I did at the start this evening.  I have had conversations with the members of the Association on this particular clause and individual members of the directorate told me that they were very keen on having this provision inserted.  I am still as convinced as when I came in this evening that this clause is entirely necessary.</P>

    <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 4 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
    <P>(1) The Minister may grant a licence (in this Part of this Act referred to as a fish sales licence) to sell by auction fresh fish or to act as agent for the sale by wholesale of fresh fish or to do both those things to any person who&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) applies in the prescribed form and manner to the Minister for such licence, and</P>
    <P>(b) satisfies the Minister that he is a fit and proper person to held a fish sales licence, and</P>
    <P>(c) is not an undischarged bankrupt, and</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1115" /> (d) is not employed, engaged or otherwise concerned in the sea-fishing industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) to delete paragraph (d).</P>
      <P>I want to find out what exactly is the object of clause (d) in this section.  It says that an agent to be appointed &ldquo;is not employed, engaged or otherwise concerned in the sea-fishing industry.&rdquo; It seems to me it will be almost impossible to carry that into law.  The Minister has, however, stated that this part of the Bill may not be put into operation until the Sea Fisheries Association demands it.  I would like to know from the Minister what exactly is the object of the clause&mdash;what does it seek to safeguard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider it extremely important that the person who is going to act as auctioneer should be entirely independent.  No one can fairly discharge the responsibilities of an auctioneer if he is otherwise interested, say, as buyer or seller of the commodity he is dealing with.  You can imagine a fish curer in a particular area auctioning the fish as they come in on the boats.  He will have, perhaps, a man representing his own firm there.  Will he not be inclined to give him the short knock?  It will be to his own interest if his own man buys at the lowest price.  This is an obvious precaution which should be taken to safeguard the rights of the fishermen. As I say, it would be perhaps more applicable here than to the minor seaports. I would not, for instance, think it necessary at all to put it into force in the case of a minor seaport, where a man was an auctioneer in a small way and was a fish dealer, unless the Association found something was happening there which was to the detriment of their members.  Normally it would apply chiefly to markets to provide that the salesmen there would not have any other interests and would not he inclined to knock down fish at a price which would benefit themselves and their own relation to the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last day when we <Col N="1116" /> were discussing this matter the Minister was not very definite whether the Association would take over all surplus fish.  Some of the fishermen see this position: that whereas at present the auctioneer is in the habit of purchasing the whole of the surplus left when the auction is over, there would be no guarantee now that that surplus would be purchased at all.  The new auctioneer is not to be a fish merchant, is not to be in any way connected with the disposal of the fish otherwise than by auction.  Can the Minister say now whether the Society would be prepared in all cases to take over the surplus which is left after the auction ceased?  Further, will it be illegal for a fish dealer to purchase a lot of fish and proceed to auction it amongst people who would hawk it through the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I cannot say what the Association may do in any given circumstances in the future, but I should think that the directors would not be fit to occupy that position if they left an unsold glut of herrings, mackerel, or any other fish, in any place where their agent was operating. If their members brought in fish and if the Association did not deal with it, then there would be something very seriously wrong.  Rule 4 gives them very wide scope as regards this matter; they can cure the fish themselves or handle them or deal with them in any way they think fit.  This question of salesmen applies only to the auction that takes place when the boats arrive in the harbour.  What happens after the fish has been auctioned is another matter.  The person who buys in a wholesale way can, of course, sell afterwards at his discretion.  This provision does not affect him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one other matter that I wish to refer to.  I presume that auctioneers will be appointed only at Saorstát ports.  Is it contemplated that no circumstances will arise in which fish taken by members of the Association will be allowed to go, for instance, to Northern Ireland ports? A member of the Association must, in all circumstances, apparently, sell his fish through one of the Association's auctioneers.  I have already referred to the possibility of fishermen hearing of better prices prevailing, say, at Ardglass than prevail at Saorstát ports.  Ardglass is a Northern Ireland port.  Will it be possible for the fishermen to sell their fish at such ports since they cannot be sold there by an auctioneer licensed by the Association?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no such restriction. The Association will have an agent acting for them at particular ports.  If there were a number of their members fishing in Yarmouth or Lowestoft, as is quite conceivable in the future, in the case of members with a bigger type of boat, the Association would appoint an agent at that port.</P>

    <P>(1) It shall not be lawful for any person to carry on in any premises the business of selling fresh fish by retail unless such premises comply with the following conditions (in this Act referred to as the conditions of suitability and cleanliness), that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  such premises and the equipment, fittings and appliances therein are in a state of cleanliness, and</P>
    <P>(b)  there is available on such premises such adequate supply of good and wholesome water as may be reasonably necessary, and</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5, which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), lines 9 to 11, to delete paragraph (d).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These proposals in Part IV of the Bill which deal with the regulation of retail fish shops are rather difficult. It seems to me, in the first place, that it is the business of the public health authorities to look after these matters. The particular section on which I now want information from the Minister is this:&mdash;paragraph (d) reads:&mdash;&ldquo;every shelf, slab or table used as a fish slab or for cutting, skinning, or filleting fish is so situated and fitted as to exclude all contamination.&rdquo; The words &ldquo;to exclude all contamination&rdquo; occur in various parts of this Bill.  I would like to know what exactly the Minister demands under that heading.  It seems to me it is a phrase that is rather vague.  A lot will depend on the inspectors whom the Minister appoints under this part of the Bill.  The inspector can <Col N="1119" /> take a very reasonable view, or if he wants to carry that phrase &ldquo;to exclude all contamination&rdquo; to its logical conclusion, he may insist on hygienic safeguards that would be altogether beyond the possibilities of fish dealers to provide.  I just want to know before we pass this section what exactly is sought in the way of excluding contamination?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing very wonderful about this sub-section.  It means that the fish shall not be exhibited or handled or dealt with carelessly, that it should rather be exhibited on a slab.  This is a reasonable provision.  It is to see that the fish will mot come in contact with anything that might deteriorate it.  What is required is the observance of the ordinary hygienic conditions that any reputable shopkeeper would exercise when dealing with the sale of perishable food.  There is nothing mysterious about the words at all. They convey the ordinary meaning and that is that the Act must be administered in a sensible manner, and I cannot foresee any great hardship at all.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6 which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), lines 12, 13, to delete paragraph (e).</P>
      <P>This sub-section (e) which I wish to have taken out is more definite than the preceding one.  It states that &ldquo;such premises are provided with a refrigerator so situated and fitted as to exclude all contamination.&rdquo;  I notice that the Minister wants to change the word &ldquo;refrigerator&rdquo; to &ldquo;container.&rdquo;  It is very largely a question of what people can afford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a communication here, a copy of which has been sent to the Minister. from traders in the Cork market, in which they point out that in the first place a refrigerator would be too expensive and costly for them, and (2) there would not be any real advantage from the point of view of attractiveness to the customer, that the customer <Col N="1120" /> would have an idea that the fish was cold-stored for a much longer period than in fact it had been in cold storage; furthermore, that the amount of fish required by any trader on any given day can be estimated by him to within a stone or two, and that each evening the small surplus is iced in a stone box and disposed of on the following day.  In that way they point out that the expenditure on this refrigerator would be out of proportion to its value to the trade.  Then there is another objection.  They say that as they are only weekly tenants of the Cork Corporation, the installation of a refrigerator would cost a considerable amount of money, from which the tenants would not benefit.  When the lease expires, these, being fixtures, would become the property of the Cork Corporation.  I merely quote that to show that we are not going on the ground of the word &ldquo;refrigerator&rdquo; or that there is something in it which puts it absolutely beyond the bounds of possibility to provide.  We think the fish traders throughout the country will have a strong objection and that it would be economically impossible for them, however much they desire it. I think we can take it that those already in the business of fish selling are aware that they can get higher prices if they instal a refrigerator than they could get if they had not done so. That others have not done so and have gone ahead with their business simply proves that they are not in a position to supply the capital to provide this. I think the proper solution would be to lend the money so as to enable these men to instal these refrigerators. However, I will be glad to know what the Minister's alternative is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I received a somewhat similar communication to that read by Deputy Derrig.  I do know that the majority of the Cork fish traders, who are installed in the Grand Parade market, would be quite satisfied with the change proposed by the Minister, namely, the insertion of the word &ldquo;container&rdquo; instead of the word &ldquo;refrigerator.&rdquo; As has been pointed out by Deputy Derrig, the installation of a refrigerator is rather an expensive item and would press heavily on those <Col N="1121" /> traders.  The Deputy also mentioned that the majority of those traders are tenants of the Cork Corporation and that the refrigerator is of necessity a fixture.  We all know that fixtures cannot be removed if the tenant is shifting. For that reason a number of those tenants could not be expected to undertake that expense.  However, if the word &ldquo;container&rdquo; is substituted for the word &ldquo;refrigerator&rdquo; the case is met satisfactorily.  That will mean little or no change to the methods hitherto adopted by fish traders.  That will mean placing the fish in boxes of ice.  I think the Minister had that in mind when he suggested the word &ldquo;container.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I agree it is a term which would require to be more fully explained.  A container may mean anything.  It may mean a box without any ice in it, or it may mean cold storage of some sort. As I translate the term, it simply means that the custom which has obtained, namely, that of placing the fish in a box of ice will be the practice, and that will meet the case as far as the majority of traders in Cork City are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out on a former occasion, the word &ldquo;refrigerator&rdquo; is not a very happy word, inas-much as it has no very definite meaning, and rather applies to an expensive plant for cold storage.  I was looking for a word to deal with the situation, and this was the word suggested to me, and I put that word in originally.  We meant something that would keep the fish in a cool temperature.  I propose to substitute the word &ldquo;container.&rdquo; Deputy Anthony says he would like to know what I mean by &ldquo;container.&rdquo;  I understand that an ordinary wooden box, with zinc lining slightly removed from the wood so that ice can be put in between when there is warm weather, would be quite sufficient to meet the case, and that could he got for a trifling cost.  It is a moveable type of article, and that meets the difficulty with regard to the Grand Parade market in Cork, where, if they instal a refrigerator, it would become a fixture and would ultimately become the property of the Corporation.  This is a moveable article which they can <Col N="1122" /> take home with them if they wish, whatever may be the procedure there. I think the insertion of the word &ldquo;container&rdquo; meets the case.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister think of introducing a definition of the word &ldquo;container&rdquo; in Section 1?

      <P>I would like to know if the Minister will reconsider Section 3. We are very strongly against the imprisonment clause.  So long as it is in the Bill I am afraid we will have to vote against it.  I do not believe it is any safeguard eventually for the Association in its contracts.  I think it would be better to withdraw this until the Association decide that they want <Col N="1125" /> such a penal clause.  It will be time enough then to insert it.  The Minister is simply anticipating the worst.  It has been reiterated from these benches that the Minister is in danger, in his pessimism, of throwing a damper not alone on those who would like to see the Association going ahead, but also on those for whose benefit it has been founded and for whose welfare it is going to work.  Once it gets out that there is a definite provision that unless they uphold in every jot and tittle the agreement with the Association, they will be liable to imprisonment, I fear it is going to do a lot of harm.  I would like the Minister to reconsider the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: That the Committee agree with the Seanad in the following amendments:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 2.  All deleted from the words &ldquo;as follows&rdquo; in line 25 to the letter &ldquo;(a)&rdquo; in line 27, and also lines 29 to 32 inclusive deleted and for the lines so deleted the words &ldquo;that sub-section shall have effect accordingly&rdquo; substituted.</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 3 a new section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>3.&mdash;(1) If and whenever the Commission shall unanimously request the Minister to add any particular security or class of securities, currency, balance, or other form of assets to the forms in which the Legal Tender Note Fund or the Note Reserve Fund or both those funds may be held under the Principal Act, the Minister may make an order declaring in accordance with such request that the particular form or forms of assets specified in such request shall be and is or are thereby added (as the case may require) to the list of forms contained in sub-section (3) of Section 61 of the Principal Act or to the list of forms contained in sub-section (2) of Section 02 of the Principal Act or to both those lists.</P>
      <P>(2) The Minister may at any time upon the unanimous request of the Commission by order rescind, vary, or amend in accordance with such request an order made by him under the foregoing sub-section of this section.</P>
      <P>(3) No order made under either of the foregoing sub-sections shall be of any force or effect unless or until it has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas and has been approved by resolution of each such House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4) Whenever an order is made by the Minister under sub-section (1) of this section, the Principal Act and in particular Section 61 or Section 62 thereof or both those sections (as the case may be) shall, so long <Col N="1127" /> as such order is in force but subject to any variation or amendment thereof, under this section, be construed and have effect as if the Principal Act were amended in accordance with such order.</P>
    <P>Section 3.  The section deleted.</P>
    <P>Section 5, sub-section (4).  The words &ldquo;(so long as such note remains identifiable as a particular note)&rdquo; deleted.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 3 achieve simply one purpose.  In the Bill, as it left the Dáil, it was provided that in addition to removing the limitation on British securities which might be purchased by the Currency Commission&mdash;securities which matured in twelve months&mdash;it was thought that the Currency Commission might also purchase securities of the Government of the United States of America.  In the Senate reference to the securities of the Government of the United States of America was deleted and there was substituted a provision which provided that on the unanimous request of the Currency Commission the Minister might make an order adding any securities to those which they already held and that such order, having been approved by the two Houses, would come into effect in the same way as if it had been included in the original Bill.  I indicated in the House that I did not see any Government whose securities were likely to be purchased other than those of the Government of the United States of America.  I also indicated that I did not think that if was likely for a considerable time that a situation would arise to make it advisable for the Currency Commission to purchase such securities.</P>
    <P>It may be that conditions throughout the world will change and that securities other than those of the Government of the United States of America may be suitable for purchase by the Currency Commission.  In any case, it would not be possible to purchase securities of any kind where there was not substantial agreement amongst the members of the Currency Commission.  I have no doubt that if circumstances arose in which it was <Col N="1128" /> suitable for the Commission to purchase securities of the Government of the United States of America there would be no difficulty in getting the Commission to agree.  I pointed out in the Seanad that the Currency Commission consisted of seven members, three appointed by the Minister for Finance, three by the banks, and the Chairman appointed by the ordinary members.  I have not noticed in the representatives of the banks any disposition to be prejudiced against the purchase of securities of the Government of the United States of America or against borrowing in that country as the case may be.</P>
    <P>I indicated that when our Second National Loan was issued we had the co-operation of all the banks and, in fact, the suggestion that half the loan might be issued in the United States of America came from the banks.  I do not believe that any prejudice would operate in this matter.  Therefore, if circumstances were such that it would be desirable to have securities of the Government of the United States of America purchased by the Currency Commission, I do not think that there would be any hesitation on the part of the Currency Commission in making an unanimous request to the Minister.  If there were not an unanimous request it would mean that a substantial body of opinion was against such a thing being done, and in that case it would be desirable to proceed with very great circumspection in the matter.  I think that there is no objection to the acceptance of the amendments.  They provide a method, without great delay, assuming that it is desirable, of making arrangements by which the Currency Commission can purchase such securities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments in the form in which they have been presented by the Minister put the Bill in an entirely different position to that in which it was when it was first introduced.  We are now asked to decide &ldquo;whenever the Currency Commission shall unanimously request the Minister.&rdquo;  The really important principle which has been introduced here is to make unanimous consent of the <Col N="1129" /> Currency Commission essential before any departure may be made from the terms of the original Act.</P>
      <P>When the Bill came before us, we were asked to agree that the securities of the Government of the United States of America should be added to the list of forms in which the Legal Tender Note Fund might be held by the Commission or on its behalf.  In that Bill the principle of unanimity was not included.  When you read the Act it is obvious that substantial agreement, by which I presume we must take it means a mere majority of the Commission, would have been sufficient, if the Bill as originally introduced by the Minister were adopted by the House, to legalise any investments which the Currency Commission might make in the securities of the Government of the United States of America.</P>
      <P>In the course of his speech the Minister has been quite frank and has told the House that so far as he can see&mdash;so far as anyone can see&mdash;for a considerable period to come, the only possible securities, other than those already detailed in the list, in which the Currency Commission might invest the Legal Tender Note Fund would be the securities of the Government of the United States of America.  It seems to me that those who were responsible for the amendments in the Seanad hesitated to come out and openly oppose the enlarged powers which the Minister proposed to give to the Currency Commission and endeavour to secure their purpose in another way by drafting an amendment, which ostensibly enlarged the powers of the Currency Commission in regard to the forms in which it might invest its funds, but in reality confined them within the limits originally laid down in the Act.  If there is not at present, and if there is not likely to be within any period that ordinary human intelligence can envisage, any possibility of these funds being invested in securities other than those of the Governments of Great Britain and the United States of America, what is the purpose of requiring unanimity on the part of the Commission before such investments can be made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1130" /> There is no suggestion at the present moment, at any rate, though Heaven knows what may come in the future, that we ought to invest the Legal Tender Note Fund in the securities say of the Government of Siam or the securities of the Government of Tibet.  There is only one possible alternative field of investment open to us and those who were responsible for this amendment suggest that before we can take that alternative field we should impose the condition that on the part of the Currency Commission there shall be unanimity. The Minister endeavoured to gloss that over by saying that of course no investment could be made unless there was a considerable measure of agreement, but a considerable measure of agreement and unanimity are worlds apart.  A considerable measure of agreement, in my opinion, would be indicated by four members being in favour of one course and three against it.  Unanimity means that all of the members, including possibly some representatives of the banks who might have a substantial interest in the manner in which these funds were invested, would have to agree to the investment being made in the United States of America.  The Irish banks who nominate representatives on this Commission are very large and important holders of British securities.  If the Commission proposes to realise any substantial proportion of their holdings in these securities, and to invest them elsewhere, there would possibly be such an effect on the market as would react very unfavourably on the position of the banks which had large holdings in those securities.  Therefore to my mind it is almost impossible to contemplate that on a matter of this kind there would be secured the necessary unanimity to enable the Currency Commission to do what was in the Minister's mind when he first introduced the Bill, to enable it, if it so desired, to invest in the securities of the Government of the United States.</P>
    <P>I said that those who had been responsible for moving this amendment elsewhere had not disclosed their real purpose.  Lot us see the arguments which were adduced in support of the <Col N="1131" /> proposal.  First of all, I would like to remind the Dáil that it was sought to do two things under the original Act&mdash; first, to remove the limitation which existed as to the class of British securities in which the funds of the Currency Commission might be invested. Under the original Act, investments were confined to securities which matured within twelve months. By the amending Bill it was proposed to remove the limitation as to the period within which the securities could mature, and, as we on those benches stressed at the time, and as Deputy J.X. Murphy, who has had considerable experience in banking, supported us in stressing, the elimination of that condition increased the element of risk which is present in these investments.</P>
    <P>One of the characteristics of those who introduced this amendment in the Seanad, and of the daily journals which support their political attitude, has been that they have always played for safety.  Whenever a proposal has emanated from these benches it has not been discussed without prejudice in a logical, rational way, but instead an attempt has been made to create panic in the minds of the public. We have been told about our hare-brained financiers and about all the other ills with which this Party, in the opinion&mdash;possibly not in the opinion, but in the public statements &mdash;of the President, the Vice-President, and the Press which supports them, is supposed to be afflicted.  Yet here is a proposal which I doubt, if considered in any other Parliament, would secure the assent or the support of that Parliament, a proposal to invest the reserve, upon which the whole currency system of this country is based, in securities which may mature within twenty or thirty years, and which, when they mature, may not be redeemable at all.  Though, as I say, when we propose to discuss vital questions like the land annuities and matters like that, at once the element of risk looms up and is stressed in the speeches of those opposed to us, here is a foolhardy proposal coming from the Minister in relation to the Currency Commission, and endorsed in the <Col N="1132" /> Seanad by those who would make &ldquo;safety first&rdquo; their watchword.</P>
    <P>Of course while the long term securities, as the experience of the past sixteen or seventeen years has shown us, of Germany, Russia, or Austria, might not be free from danger, the securities of Great Britain, whose position in the world is much more vulnerable than the position of these countries must be immune from risk, even should the term of such securities extend as I stated for twenty or thirty years.  The Party in the Seanad responsible for these amendments allowed that&mdash;to my mind the most questionable feature of the Amending Bill&mdash;to go without question and instead proposed a radical amendment to the other sections of the Bill to which I refer.</P>
    <P>What were the arguments used to justify the second amendment?  In the first place, said the mover of the amendment, which the Minister for Finance now sponsors in this House, it is rather invidious to confine this enlarged power of the Currency Commission in regard to Government securities to a single country.  If the Irish people propose to invest their money in securities of the Government of the United States of America, let us beware that the Government of Czecho-Slovakia, of Finland, of Persia, of Baluchistan or of Afghanistan, do not take umbrage at the fact that we think that the securities of the Government of the United States are somewhat safer and somewhat more stable for our purpose than theirs.  One of the reasons why it is proposed to give this power to the Currency Commission is that it would be invidious not to permit the Currency Commission to invest its money, say in securities of the Government of Afghanistan while permitting the Commission to invest it in the securities of the Government of the United States of America.  The second proposal in the amendment, and it is even more astounding still, is that not only may the Currency Commission have power to invest funds in the securities of the Governments of the various countries but it <Col N="1133" /> may invest them in any form whatsoever.</P>
    <P>I wonder has the Minister adverted to that fact: that if the Bill goes through in its present form the Currency Commission will have power to invest the proceeds of the Legal Tender Note Fund not only in Government securities but in industrial securities; so far as I can see, in any form of investment whatsoever, providing unanimity is secured?  I will grant him that.  There is no limitation upon the Currency Commission compelling it to invest its funds only in Government securities, and the person who moved this amendment in the Seanad said: &ldquo;If they are to get increased power as regards investment of their funds they ought to have power to invest in other forms than this.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us see the forms in which the Currency Commission was empowered to make these investments.  &ldquo;Gold bullion.&rdquo;  I suppose American or Chinese or German gold would be just as good as British gold any day, and there may not be any objection to buying gold in France if it is desired&mdash; although the Minister says that he does not wish the Commission to buy gold in any circumstances&mdash;rather than to have it purchased in Lombard Street. &ldquo;Gold coins which are for the time being legal tender in Saorstát Eireann for unlimited amounts.&rdquo;  There is no objection to that.  &ldquo;Money in any form which is for the time being legal tender in Great Britain for unlimited amounts.&rdquo;  I do not suppose I can sustain at this stage an objection to that in view of the principles laid down in the Currency Act.  If we were considering anything other than merely an amending Bill, and therefore limited by the Title of the Bill to discuss it with reference to the Act, we might have something more to say upon it.  But let that pass.  What I want particularly to emphasise is that if this Bill goes through it would be possible for the Currency Commission to invest the Legal Tender Note Fund in money in any form which is, or is not, for the time being legal tender anywhere on this earth.  A proposal of that sort has come, as I have said, from the Party who stand for the programme of &ldquo;Safety First&rdquo; in the affairs of this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1134" /> In summing up, the original mover of the amendment said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These amendments are designed to secure that if the Currency Commission. desire to extend their powers of investment the request for extension shall come from themselves.&rdquo;  I wonder if that was really the purpose.  I wonder if that was the only purpose of this amendment, because it is very significant that in moving it the Senator only dwelt on sub-section (1) of the proposed new section.  He did not say anything about sub-section (2).  Has the Minister studied sub-section (2)? Has he realised the effect of it?  &ldquo;The Minister may at any time upon the unanimous request of the Commission by order rescind, vary, or amend in accordance with such request an order made by him under the foregoing sub-section of this section.&rdquo;  The foregoing sub-section is the one which empowers the Minister, upon the unanimous request of the Currency Commission, to add certain forms of investment to the list.  But this second sub-section renders the Minister powerless to remove from the list any one of these forms of investment which subsequent experience may have taught him is undesirable or dangerous.  He cannot do it.  Even though the whole currency of the country might be debased by the operations of the Currency Commission, or by some investments which they have made and which they were determined to continue to make, the Minister for Finance, except by an amendment of the law, could not remove a single one of these forms of investment from the approved list.</P>
    <P>Now, there might be something to be said in favour of the first part of this section in so far as it empowers the Minister, upon the unanimous request of the Currency Commission, to add certain securities to the list, but surely there can be nothing advanced in justification of sub-section (2) which will not permit him to remove forms of investment from the list unless at the unanimous request of the Commission. I think that is a dangerous section; I think it is an unnecessary section, and I am surprised that the Minister should have agreed to it.</P>
    <P>To return again to sub-section (1) of the section.  One of the strongest objections which we on this side have to <Col N="1135" /> the sub-section in its present form is the vague generality of its nature. The Minister, whether wisely or unwisely I am not going at present to discuss, has chosen to base the currency of the country upon paper, not upon gold&mdash;the term &ldquo;gold exchange standard&rdquo; with which the Minister played in the Seanad is merely a euphonious way of saying that our currency is based upon the paper security of another country and of another State.  Now when so important an instrument of commercial and industrial activity as the currency is based upon paper then I think that the limits within which investments of the nature here involved may be made should be set down in black and white in the Currency Act, and it should be a matter to a certain extent not for the Currency Commission to determine. but for the Dáil in the first instance to say, within what limits the Currency Commission may make these investments. The only limit imposed upon the Commission at present is the limit implied by unanimity.  Provided they can be unanimous, they can invest in any form of security they choose and that form of security need not necessarily be Government securities, need not necessarily be what we call gilt-edged securities.  I hope for the sake of the country that they will be.  But we cannot legislate merely on hopes.  There are a number of people who have speculated on hope.  There are a number of banks, and particularly some of the big British concerns during the last twelve months which, relying upon little more than hope, have brought destitution and penury to a considerable number of investors in that country and this.</P>
    <P>The real thing in this matter is this: that you cannot depend upon the honesty, upon the integrity, or upon the ability of any person when you are investing in paper.  There is a large element of trust which enters into what are regarded as the soundest securities and we say, therefore, that, so far as the basis of the currency of this country is concerned, we ought not to give to the Currency Commission the general power that this section proposes to confer upon them; that we <Col N="1136" /> should lay down that the fund shall be invested in the securities of such-and-such Government.  Instead of depending upon the gold exchange standard as we have been, I feel that the future of the country will be more secure if, accepting for the moment the gold standard principle, we based our currency upon gold bullion and upon a tangible gold reserve.  That is beside the question however.  I am dealing with the proposals now before the House and I say they are dangerous proposals.  Are the proposals themselves consistent with the original Act?  I wonder whether the Minister has studied the effect of this amendment upon the Act of 1927.  I would like to direct his particular attention to Sections 47 and 49.</P>
    <P>Section 47 says: &ldquo;If and whenever any person on or after the appointed day applies to the Commission at the place in Dublin appointed for the purpose by the Commission for legal tender notes and delivers to the Commission at such place and in accordance with the regulations in that behalf made by the Commission&rdquo; such and such things including &ldquo;money (in this section called British money) in any form which is for the time being legal tender in Great Britain for unlimited amounts the Commission shall issue to such person legal tender notes of an amount equal (as the case may be) to the value under this section of the gold bullion or to the nominal amount of Saorstát gold coins or&rdquo;&mdash;to shorten the matter, other consideration offered by persons for the legal tender notes.</P>
    <P>And Section 49 says: &ldquo;Every legal tender note shall be payable by the Commission on presentation at the London Agency and shall be so payable in money in any form which is for the time being legal tender in Great Britain for unlimited amounts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These two sections taken together plainly imply this&mdash;and I am not arguing that it is wise or a judicious thing to have done, but it is a thing the Minister did do: that the funds of the Legal Tender Note Fund should be invested in British securities only. As I am emphasising I am not saying that that is a wise or a justifiable thing but, it is a thing the Minister did and, having done it, I question <Col N="1137" /> whether the amending Bill which he originally introduced was consistent with his action and I am quite certain that the amendment accepted from the Seanad is not consistent with that action.</P>
    <P>Possibly it may be that the Minister is walking a little bit of the way with us and I do not wish to be hard upon him.  I have always thought, particularly during the recent four or five years, that one of the most regrettable things from the point of view of the general economic condition of this country is the fact that we have not an independent currency. It is only by the fluctuations of an independent currency that our adverse trade balance and a whole mass of similiar statistics, can be properly judged and their real significance appreciated.  As it is, at the present moment, whatever one may think and know about it, no person is in the position to say whether this country is purchasing more than it can afford. We on these benches believe it is, but the needle of the indicator or the instrument which should show whether we were living beyond our means has been tied down by the Currency Act of 1927.  If we possessed an independent currency at the present moment, and if we were purchasing more than the country could afford, the slump in our rate of exchange would at once give us not only warning but also a check upon such communal extravagance.</P>
    <P>At the present moment that check does not exist, and as I have said this country may be going down the slope of bankruptcy, simply because the Minister chose in 1927 to link up our currency with the currency of the country from which we buy virtually all the things which we ourselves do not produce and manufacture.</P>
    <P>As I say, it may be that in accepting this amendment the Minister is going some part of the way with us.  I believe that the acceptance of this amendment, and the consequent amendment which will be made in the Currency Act is going to drive a coach and four through the whole theory upon which the Currency Act is based. For that reason we are not going to quarrel with the principle in the <Col N="1138" /> amendment, though we certainly are disposed to quarrel, in the interests of the economic welfare of this country, with the manner in which it is proposed to give effect to that principle. We think the powers conferred by sub-section (1) of the proposed new section are far too wide.  As I said a few moments ago, if we must base our currency upon paper, let us at any rate specify the class of paper on which we are prepared to base it.  I hope the Minister is not going to justify sub-section (1) by sub-sections (3) and (4). We know how the affairs of the Legislature are conducted.  It is not right that the security of the currency of this country should depend upon whatever political party may be in power. You might have in power to-morrow a party which would be fired with enthusiasm for the Utopian proposals of certain financiers in regard to the management of the currency.  That is how the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; would describe them, and we can see the editorial hair rising up at the contemplation of gentlemen of that description sitting upon the benches opposite, packing the Currency Commission and, when the Currency Commission recommended investments in certain forms, coming to the House and appealing to the authority of the Currency Commission as a justification for adding to the list of securities in which the Legal Tender Note Fund may be invested a number of very questionable propositions.</P>
    <P>To my mind, so long as the Minister for Finance has to accept in this House responsibility for the Currency Commission&mdash;and I do not, so far as the present development of politics is concerned, see any possibility of its changing in our time&mdash;and so long as he can rely on the unquestioning support of the majority in this House to carry through his proposals there is no safeguard or precautionary measure whatever in sub-sections (3) and (4) of the proposed new section.</P>
    <P>They might as well not be there, and we might as well face that fact.  For that reason, therefore, I hope that the Minister will reconsider his attitude in regard to these amendments from two points of view: first, that he should not require unanimity, since, so <Col N="1139" /> far as one can see, the only alternative forms of investment at the moment&mdash; and I am taking the Minister's case as he made it himself&mdash;are securities of the Government of the United States; and, secondly, that he should therefore delete the word &ldquo;unanimously&rdquo; and the whole sub-section and return to his first love and the principle he first embodied in the amending Bill&mdash;that the forms in which the Legal Tender Note Fund and the Reserve Fund of the Consolidated Issue may be invested should be clearly specified in the Currency Act.  If he does that I think he will have got back out of the morass into which his friends in the Seanad led him.</P>
    <P>When I read these amendments I rubbed my eyes.  I said, &ldquo;My goodness, if they had been introduced in the Fianna Fáil Benches we would have had the &lsquo;Irish Times&rsquo; out with an editorial headed &lsquo;The Rakes' Progress,&rsquo; or something of the kind, talking of the hare-brained schemes of the Fianna Fáil financiers.&rdquo;  I am astounded that they should have come from so responsible a body as the Seanad purports to be.  I can only imagine, therefore, that the purpose behind them is much more subtle than appears on their face, that in fact the purpose is not to enlarge the powers of the Currency Commission, but to confine them within the limits originally laid down in the Act of 1927.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the amendment proposed would make it only very slightly more difficult for the Currency Commission, if it so desired, to invest in securities of the Government of the United States, because I do not believe that the Currency Commission would start investment in a new class of securities unless there was something like unanimity in its own ranks, even if that unanimity were not required by legislation.  I think, moreover, that it would be a bad thing for the Currency Commission to take up a new class of securities on anything like a bare majority.  Everybody knows how easy it is to create scares and panics in this matter.  I think that even if the Currency Commission were not required to have more than a bare majority it would be practically the duty of the Currency Commission to refrain from <Col N="1140" /> going on any new line unless it had unanimity or something equivalent to it, say a single member standing out.</P>
      <P>I think therefore in practice the requirement of unanimity will not make such a difference.  I am satisfied that the Currency Commission has and will continue to have reasonable and responsible individuals and that there will be no tendency to obstruct the work of the Commission on merely cranky grounds, that if it is clear that the situation is such that it would be profitable, safe and generally expedient for the Currency Commission to purchase securities of say the Government I have mentioned it would not be difficult to obtain unanimity. I do think it does make it slightly more difficult for the Commission to purchase United States securities but I think the change effected in that respect is not at all as great as it may seem.  It could only be as great as it seems if we were to believe that the Currency Commission by four votes against three would adopt a considerable change in its policy.  I do not think the Currency Commission in practice would or could do such a thing.</P>
      <P>With regard to the danger that a Minister holding certain views might proceed to pack a Currency Commission and cause all sorts of rubbishy securities to be purchased by the Commission that could not be done under the present Act, and it certainly could not be done so long as unanimity is required because there are three members of the Currency Commission over whose appointment the Minister has no control.  It would be possible for a Minister if he had four or five years in which, to do it to change the majority of the Commission.  As vacancies occur in the ranks of those appointed by the Minister he could appoint people with particular views to do a particular job and then, when the office of Chairman fell vacant at the end of the five years period he could arrange that there would be no agreement as to the appointment of a Chairman, in which case the nomination of Chairman would fall to be made by himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that way he could, over a period <Col N="1141" /> of four or five years, obtain a majority of the Commission but he could not get an unanimous vote because three of the other members would be appointed by bodies over whom the Minister had no control. Therefore there is not any danger that you might have a Commission whose views might be unsound which would take a particular line of policy as indicated by the Deputy.  It would require, even if we had not unanimity, four or five years and definite support in the two Houses because it is not merely a question of laying the Order on the Table to be objected to.  The Order will have to be definitely approved by resolution of each House and in that way it seems to me that no Order can be made which will in any way be undesirable.  In order to be made, the Order will have to have the support of the nominated members of the Currency Commission, including the Chairman; it will have to have the support of the representatives of the joint stock banks on the Commission, the support of the Minister who will have his advisers in the ordinary way, and the support of the majority in both Houses.  On the other hand, if the Order to be made is obviously one to which there is no objection, against which sound reasons cannot be urged, then it would go through the two Houses, it is to be presumed, very easily and speedily.  So that the Commission if it were found desirable to invest in new classes of securities could get leave to do it easily and quickly.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the Deputy that the provision with regard to the payment for currency notes in sterling implies that the Currency Commission shall invest its funds in British securities only.  It does of course imply that it shall invest a very considerable proportion of its funds in British securities, but the Currency Commission need never contemplate that there will not be a single currency note in circulation in any circumstances that are likely to arise.  So while the general provisions of the Currency Act do necessarily imply that a very large proportion of the funds will be invested in British funds it does not in the ordinary <Col N="1142" /> reading of the matter imply that the funds shall be invested in British securities only.  I can well imagine that circumstances might arise in which it would be well to take advantage of the opportunity of a greater spread, which would be given under the amending Act.</P>
    <P>The Deputy talks about the advantages of a fluctuating exchange.  There would possibly be some advantage in having a fluctuating exchange, but, considering that by far the greater percentage of our business is done with one country, the disadvantages and losses involved in a fluctuating exchange would outweigh very greatly any possible advantages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of the Betting Bill.  This Bill is intended to replace the Betting Act of 1926, except in so far as that Act related to or regulated and controlled the totalisator.  The Totalisator Act of 1929 has already dealt with that side of betting.  This Bill does not deal in any way with the tax on bets.  The tax on bets was imposed in a Finance Bill, and if there were to be any changes in regard to-the tax on bets the changes would naturally and properly be effected not in a Bill such as this, but in a Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1926 Act was in the nature of an experiment.  It provided for the licensing of houses in which bookmakers might carry on the business of cash betting legally, subject to a certain measure of regulation and control.  While certain <Col N="1143" /> defects came to light, in my opinion that Act on the whole operated moderately successfully.  As a result, however, of certain defects which did appear and certain complaints which were made, a Joint Committee of the Dáil and Seanad was appointed to inquire into the working of the Betting Act of 1926, and report what amendments were considered desirable in the existing law in relation to the business of bookmaking.  The Committee sat for, I think, sixteen days, and examined a very considerable, number of witnesses, including representatives of the Churches and of Government Departments, Chambers of Commerce, the Press, householders and bookmakers. The Committee were unanimously of opinion that the main principles of the 1926 Act should not be repealed, but that extended power should be given to remedy any abuses that had arisen&mdash;that is to say, the Committee were unanimously of opinion that we should not go back to the old position in which cash betting, except on racecourses, was illegal. Personally, I entirely agree with that decision.  I think that there were demoralising aspects of illicit betting which had very serious effects, and would continue to have very serious effects.  It is impossible to stop a thing like betting, which is not wrong in itself, but only wrong if carried to excess and abused.  It is undesirable, generally speaking, to make illegal something which is not wrong in itself and which cannot be stopped.  The desirable thing in that case is to regulate it, so far as it can be regulated; to control it and to prevent the growth of abuses in connection with it.  Experience has shown in many countries that attempts to stop something which cannot be stopped tend to create great evils, evils of a new sort and evils which affect the purity and efficiency of public administration.</P>
    <P>A great number of recommendations were made by this Joint Committee. All the principal recommendations have been included in this Bill.  In one or two instances, on further consideration, we did not agree with the Committee and did not include their recommendations in the Bill, but in the <Col N="1144" /> great majority of cases we accepted the recommendations of the Committee or accepted them with very slight modifications.  If this Bill were to pass in the form in which it is now before the House, the principal changes which would take place would be that persons under the age of eighteen years would be prohibited from betting, and it would also be made an offence to send a person under eighteen years of age into a bookmaker's premises.</P>
    <P>The Committee had recommended that the age under which a person should not be allowed to go into a bookmaker's premises should be sixteen. We felt that having two age limits in connection with the matter might lead to some confusion and that it was better to prohibit both betting by persons under eighteen and their entrance into betting premises.  As the Committee recommended, the minimum bet under the Bill will be one shilling, and no sums can be paid out in respect of bets during the hours fixed for the holding of horse races in the Saorstát, Great Britain or Northern Ireland.  The Bill, as recommended by the Committee, will make it an offence to call odds in a registered premises or to permit overcrowding or loitering in such premises, that having been condemned by the Committee as conduct which, while all right on race courses, was not suitable for the premises in question.  It will also be an offence to exhibit in registered premises, so as to be seen from the street, any list of runners or list of prices or sporting papers or any incitement or inducement to bet.  It is provided that there shall be certain additional grounds for refusing a certificate of personal fitness to an applicant for a bookmaker's licence&mdash;grounds connected with his financial standing and his having previously defaulted, and so forth.  There will be additional grounds for refusal of a certificate of suitability of premises&mdash;particularly the fact that an excessive number of registered premises already exists in a particular locality.  Loitering outside or near the betting premises will be made an offence, and the Gárda will be empowered to deal with it.  It is also provided that licences shall expire on a fixed date, as recommended by the <Col N="1145" /> Committee.  The Ready Money Football Betting Act will, under the Bill, be repealed.  That is a matter that was not dealt with by the Committee, but there seems to be an anomaly in the existing law and advantage was taken of the introduction of this Bill to remedy it.  It is not proposed to follow the recommendation of the Committee in regard to the licensing of assistants of bookmakers.  While there are certain arguments in favour of that course, it was felt that registration and licensing of such assistants might lead to difficulties in prosecution&mdash;difficulties in fixing responsibility.  It was desired that full responsibility should rest on the bookmaker, and that his responsibility in choosing his assistants should not be interfered with in any way.</P>
    <P>Another matter on which we thought, on further consideration, that it was well not to follow the advice of the Committee, was that of split hours.  The Committee recommended that registered betting premises should be open for cash bets from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., and from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.  Although the Committee seemed to think that that would not lead to a revival of street betting, on further examination we had ground for fearing that it would, in fact, do so, and that some illicit organisation might easily be built up, and perhaps it could not be prevented by the police from carrying on betting during those hours in which the premises were closed.  We did not insert a section in the Bill providing for split hours.</P>
    <P>There are certain other facts in connection with the matter that confirmed us in our disagreement with the Committee. There has been a tendency for racing to take place at a later hour, and, as a matter of fact, it is possible that a larger percentage of bets are made after 3 o'clock now than there were when the Committee had the matter under consideration.  Certain figures which we obtained indicated that even in the months of March, April and May, 1929, in the case of one bookmaker, 25 per cent. of the bets were made after three o'clock.  If that were so it would be a very conclusive argument against having the <Col N="1146" /> premises closed between 3 and 5, as recommended by the Committee.</P>
    <P>The Committee recommended that a person in receipt of home assistance should he deprived of relief on account of having been discovered engaged in a betting transaction.  We felt that that would be rather Draconic and it was hardly a proper provision for insertion in a Betting Act.  We felt that if it were to be put down at all it should be done in an Act amending the laws in regard to poor relief.  There seem to be fairly considerable powers at present for supervising those in receipt of outdoor relief.  If further powers are required they should be embodied in a special Bill dealing with relief.  In any case, there are other forms of expenditure by persons in receipt of home assistance which are as objectionable as betting, and there would be just as good grounds for making them a disqualification for the receipt of relief.</P>
    <P>There is the fact, too, that in many cases real hardship might be inflicted on the relatives of the person who carried out the betting transaction rather than on the person himself. On the whole, we felt that the Committee was taking a somewhat strict view of the offence in this matter, and we did not insert any section embodying that recommendation.  There was also the recommendation of the Committee that bookmakers should give prescribed and numbered receipts for each cash bet and show the amount received together with the amount of the betting tax to be deducted.  It was felt it would be really impracticable to do that because a very considerable proportion of small backers include in their dockets credit bets and it would be impossible to show the total tax which might arise because certain bets would be conditional bets.  I think these are the main matters that are worthy of notice in connection with the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say that we on this side of the House approach the problem of betting in the same manner as the Minister for Finance has approached it.  We do not regard betting as being ethically wrong in itself; we regard it as something which may be subject to grave abuse. <Col N="1147" /> Therefore, we are in favour of an amendment of the existing law rather than the repeal of the Betting Act of 1926.  I am glad the Minister has seen his way to embody in the present Bill so many of the proposals of the Joint Committee on the Betting Act. I am sorry, on the other hand, that he has not been able to carry out our proposals, particularly in relation to the splitting of hours and the issue of a prescribed receipt.  One of the aspects of the present position which the Committee had to consider was the considerable amount of tax evasion which exists under the present procedure.  We also considered the very objectionable practice which a number of bookmakers have initiated of collecting the tax from the punter when he has won his wager.  The tax in that case is collected by them from him on the total amount of the winnings of the bettor, and the bettor, in consequence, has to bear the whole burden of the tax.  That, to our minds, was a defeat of the original intention of the Act.  We presume that the original intention was that the tax was on the wager and was to be paid by the bookmaker and bettor alike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as that, there was the practice on the part of some bookmakers of collecting the tax in a round, sum which invariably was to their advantage rather than to the advantage of the bettor.  Where the amount of money was such that there was an odd half-penny or possibly a penny concerned, a round figure of 3d. or 6d. was fixed and deducted, and as a general rule, because of the fact that a large number of those who frequent the betting offices are not competent to make the necessary calculation, a certain amount of injustice was done to the punter.  For that reason we thought that it would be advisable to compel bookmakers to issue a prescribed form of receipt in which the amount of tax deducted would be clearly stated.  In doing that we had in mind also the current practice of tax evasion which has been indulged in, not by the bookmakers as a whole, but by a certain number of them.  It was a practice which we thought was a defeat of the purpose <Col N="1148" /> which the Minister originally had in mind when he legalised betting, namely, the derivation of revenue from that very questionable pursuit. I do not agree with the Minister that it would not be possible to issue the receipts as we have suggested because, though the punter does in some cases indulge in a certain amount of credit betting dependent upon the amount of his winnings, nevertheless there is at least one definite bet and that is the bet he makes upon the first race in which he is interested.  If the receipt would specify the amount of his wager in that case, then I think something would be done to protect the revenue and a certain amount of desirable information which is at present withheld from the backer would be afforded.</P>
    <P>The other question we had in mind was the question of licensing managing clerks.  The position with which the Committee was faced in that regard was that in extenuation of offences committed under the 1926 Betting Act it had been urged that the person employed by the bookmaker had let him down, that he was responsible, and that the bookmaker had not been able to keep proper returns because the people whom he employed were not competent or skilled and in some cases were dishonest.</P>
    <P>We felt that this whole business is one that to a certain extent is more open to fraud than any other business, and is one in which we know that in a considerable number of cases abuses have been general from time to time.  It would be no harm that we would insist that all those who are dealing with the public, either as parties to a wager or clerks to bookmakers, or stakeholders, should have certain qualifications so as to enable them to keep simple accounts in a proper manner, just ability in reading and writing, and that no person should be entrusted with the duty of taking bets and temporarily acting in any way in a fiduciary capacity in relation to the public in this country unless he had certain elementary qualifications in this respect.  We had hopes in that way to improve, so to speak, the character, qualifications, and reputations of those who were employed in <Col N="1149" /> these betting offices, and, since we are establishing a monopoly, to ensure that those to whom we give the privilege of the monopoly will be able to fulfil their responsibilities to the State and to the public.</P>
    <P>For that reason we were in favour of licensing managing clerks in bookmakers' offices.  I admit that it may be difficult, but I do not think it should be too difficult for the Minister to solve.  There are numbers of businesses at present in which people have to be registered.  Registration need not be made too difficult.  It need not be so much the question of the possible payment of a fee and setting a standard of character and qualifications.  In return for that we would be giving those employed in this business a definite status, and to a certain extent a monopoly.</P>
    <P>There was one other thing of which the Committee was very much in favour, and that is the removal of the limitation that exists at present in regard to the evidence that may be given in the case of appeals.  One of our recommendations was that in connection with appeals against the refusal of the Superintendents of the Gárda Síochána to issue certificates to bookmakers, the Superintendents should be entitled to call any member of the Gárda Síochána or any other person to give evidence.  I think that the Minister has not adopted that proposal.  I still think, unless my memory misleads me, that the general public are debarred from giving evidence in this matter.</P>
    <P>The following provision in the Betting Act of 1926 shall apply to every appeal: &ldquo;The Superintendent of the Gárda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners and no other person shall be entitled to appear and to adduce evidence in opposition to the appeal.&rdquo; It was felt desirable that the general public, particularly those who are charged with a particular duty in this case with regard to abuses which may arise out of this Act and the moral effect of such abuses on their people, should be permitted to appear and give evidence in cases where an appeal was taken.  There is a certain disinclination on the part of many people to go, as it is said, behind one's back and to <Col N="1150" /> make charges against one.  I know that there are many people who would prefer to come forward and give their evidence in a public court rather than convey to the superintendent of the Gárda Síochána or to the Revenue Commissioners any information about these matters which they may think desirable, because there is a certain stigma attached to the word &ldquo;informer&rdquo; in this country.  One may say that it does not rightly attach in cases of this sort; nevertheless, it is there, it does exist, and if the Act is to be enforced we should take into consideration these things.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter which I think the Minister has to a certain extent met.  That is the excessive size of the penalties imposed under the Act of 1926.  These penalties were defeating the main purpose of the Act.  If a man had committed one offence against the Act his position seemed so desperate that the only thing for him to do was to continue committing the same offences in the hope that he might be able to make a certain amount of profit before being caught, because if he were caught he would never be able to pay the amount of the penalties inflicted. He would never be able to get out of the penalties that would be exacted from him or the imprisonment to which he would be subjected.  The Minister has met us to some extent in that regard, and I am glad he has done so.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter on which the Committee made no recommendation. It is not dealt with in the Bill, but it is nevertheless a very important one.  It is a fact that the business in these betting offices is done mainly in relation to races run in England. It was felt that that was largely due to the amount of publicity which races run in England receive in this country.  There are long lists of winners and there are pages of tips in the papers.  You walk down the streets and you see a placard of the local press detailing to you how a certain wizard or prophet has been able to foretell the future to the extent of a forecast of six winners on the previous day.  Every one of those were horses that ran in English races. One unhealthy thing, apart from the <Col N="1151" /> abuse, was the fact that these were forecasts of races run in England. There is no inducement on the part of the so-called sporting public in this country to take an interest in the horses bred and running upon their own soil.  It was stated that one of the stimuli to this unhealthy interest in English racing was the fact that press publicity mainly centred around English racing.  There is one suggestion that possibly might be helpful to the Minister.  I put it to him now in view of the possible position next year that a tax of so much per column might be imposed upon racing publicity matter of this sort.  In that way we might be able to turn over a penny for the Revenue, and thereby reduce the amount of publicity and the amount of interest which is taken in English racing in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. Shaw Mr. Shaw">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shaw</NameTxt>
      <P>I take very great pleasure in the fact that I voted against the Betting Act in 1926.  I did so because I believed that a 5 per cent. tax on turnover was unfair.  I also knew that the tax on racecourse betting would cause serious injury to racing and breeding.  The tax in England was three per cent. whereas we have a tax of five per cent.  The tax on racecourses there was two per cent. while ours is two and a half.  The British abolished that tax entirely.  I do not say at all that revenue should not be obtained from betting, but an unfair tax should not be imposed on anything. I do not at all object to a tax on winnings but I repeat again that a tax on turn-over is unfair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shaw</NameTxt>
      <P>I said in 1926 that I did not like the idea of betting shops, and now I say that the more I know of them the less I like them.  This Bill will remedy the principal abuses, such as loitering.  There is grave abuse, particularly in the suburbs of Dublin and, I presume, in other cities.  The Act is desperately abused, particularly by women and loiterers.  I do not think that that occurs so much in the <Col N="1152" /> towns, but it is certainly very bad in Dublin.  I do not think that I could describe it better than by adopting Jimmie O'Dea's description of Mrs. Mulligan, with her sixpence up-and-down trebles, who remains from the start of racing hanging around the betting shops until the last race is over.  If persons want to bet they should, in my opinion, adopt such a motto as: &ldquo;Get in, get on, get out.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As a person who has considerable experience in betting, I say that, while these people may amuse themselves and may occasionally win, they have in the long run as much chance of making money in these betting establishments as they would have of making ice in hell.  I do not suggest that everybody loses.  Quite the contrary. Well-informed persons win occasionally, but the ordinary man in the street simply provides money for the bookmakers, and they take charge of it.  The Minister has stated that any contemplated change in regard to the betting tax would have to be dealt with in a Finance Bill.  I would like to know if I would be in order now in stressing the serious plight in which racing is in this country?  Would I be in order in dealing with that aspect of the matter, in view of the fact that I probably will not have another opportunity of doing it prior to the introduction of the Finance Bill or the Budget?</P>

      <P>I may be prepared to show a certain amount of leniency to Deputy Shaw, but I would not accept the principle put forward by Deputy Little, that because the Minister for Finance introduces a Bill, we can go into a discussion on taxation.  As a matter of fact a different kind of Bill would be required if it were proposed to remit or impose a tax.  This Bill does not concern a tax at all.  But discussion has so far had very little relevancy because there would be no possibility at this or any other stage of the Bill to do anything about a tax on betting. I realise that, if the Deputy desires, he may be able to comment to a certain extent on the state of racing, but I would not like to have a discussion on the betting tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shaw</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would say that he is going to accept the recommendations of the Joint Committee and intends to take off the tax on racing.  If he does so I shall have the greatest pleasure in sitting down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shaw</NameTxt>
      <P>A very representative committee of Deputies and Senators, <Col N="1154" /> representing all parties in the Dáil and Seanad, spent a considerable amount of time hearing evidence from all persons interested in racing and they came to the unanimous decision that the betting tax on racecourses was injurious to racing, and recommended that it should be forthwith removed. Since the betting tax has been imposed racing has been steadily declining in the Free State and at present the prospect for 1931 is as black as night, unless, of course, the Minister removes the tax.  The main effects that the betting tax has had on racing in the Free State are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) General slump in attendances at the racecourses, even after the charges of admission had been greatly reduced.</P>
      <P>(2) The value of stake money has fallen from £113,371 in 1926 to £85,440 last year.</P>
      <P>(3) The entries for the principal races in 1931 are the lowest since before the Great War.</P>
      <P>(4) The three Metropolitan meetings (Baldoyle, Leopardstown, Phoenix Park) and the Curragh have been carried on at a considerable financial loss every year since the introduction of the betting tax, and at least 90 per cent. of the country meetings met with a similar fate.</P>
      <P>(5) It is no secret that if the present conditions continue for another year most of the racecourses in the Free State will only be a memory of the past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. Shaw Mr. Shaw">

      <P>The Deputy will remember that when the tax was imposed it was imposed by financial resolution in the first instance, and eventually by a Finance Act.  This Bill, and the original Betting Act of 1926 which the Joint Committee was appointed to consider, do not contain <Col N="1155" /> any provisions in regard to taxation. The tax was included in a separate Bill, so that the Deputy is not now in order in discussing taxation on this Bill.  He may find another occasion to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. Shaw Mr. Shaw">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shaw</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect, the Joint Committee dealt with all these matters, and the Bill which we have here is more or less the result of their investigations.  I do not think that I should be debarred from drawing attention now to the very important matters in the Bill that have been omitted.  I quite understand that the matter may be relevant in the Finance Bill and, of course if you, sir, rule that I cannot discuss it I will not press it further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">

      <P>I have no responsibility for what the Joint Committee discussed.  The Joint Committee was appointed to consider the working of the Betting Act of 1926.  This Bill proposes to amend that Act, but it does not concern taxation, which, as I have explained, was imposed by the Finance Act.  I have allowed the Deputy to go a certain distance, but I cannot allow him to go further on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. Shaw Mr. Shaw">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shaw</NameTxt>
      <P>I will then draw my remarks to a close.  I hope the Minister will carry out the unanimous recommendations of the Committee in regard to the most important matters with which they had to deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. G. Wolfe Mr. G. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal with the provisions of the Bill now before us.  I think that not only those with whom betting is a more or less legitimate trade, as it is now by law, but the general public will view the restrictions which this Bill imposes on that trade with favour because although it is a legitimate trade, like the licensed liquor trade, there is a certain amount of danger in it and consequently there is a necessity for stringent regulations to govern the operations connected with it.  It has been found from experience of the Act upon which we have hitherto worked that certain improvements and additions are necessary. The Committee which sat to inquire into the matter gave the result <Col N="1156" /> of their deliberations in their Report. The majority of the recommendations of that Committee have been adopted by the Minister and although some others were not definitely adopted, such as that in regard to people in receipt of home help and that in reference to certain hours within which betting establishments should be closed, other additions have been made which more or less take the place of these recommendations.  I think the clause in regard to the personal fitness of residents in Saorstát Eireann or outside who may apply for a licence is a very important factor.</P>
      <P>The Bill has made this a necessity. It also introduces very stringent regulations in regard to the suitability of premises.  Another very desirable reform is that it does away with the frightful evil of street betting. I do not know whether it occurred over here very much, but I notice that in towns on the other side of the water where there were factories and things of that kind street betting became a, perfect curse.  Whatever drawbacks there may be to registered houses they are infinitely better, at any rate under proper supervision, than these touts at street corners.  They were a perfect nuisance, and a danger besides.  I think that the restriction of betting in the case of persons under the age of eighteen is an extremely good feature.  The Bill also regulates the position of assistants in the betting houses and prohibits them from making bets on their own account, setting up a sort of bookmakers within bookmakers.  Although the hours for closing which the Commission recommended have not been adopted, the regulation which provides that they must be closed during the hours when racing is going on in the Saorstát, in Northern Ireland, and in England will have pretty much the same effect as the regulation which the Commission recommended.  It will prevent people standing there the whole time in these betting establishments, just as in the Liquor Licensing Act it was found necessary to have a closing time to make habitues leave the premises.  I think this addition to the Act will have that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, also, that the prohibition on <Col N="1157" /> bets under 1/- is desirable, because people with, say, 8/- or 10/- a week, old age pensioners or people like that to whom, of course, every penny is of value, will be prevented by that provision from being foolishly attracted into these places, and of throwing away practically the whole amount of money they have to live upon on very limited information as to what they may get for their money.  I think the prohibition of loitering near these premises is an extremely desirable form too; in fact, I am of opinion the whole Act will be of great use, and that it will put all the regulations for dealing with this very difficult matter of betting on a proper basis.  There is no doubt that even a legitimate business may have great dangers in connection with at if not properly managed.  I think the Bill will tend to make matters work more regularly, and that if the provisions are properly carried out they will bring about a great improvement in the conditions under which betting can be carried on in the Saorstát.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I approach this Bill from rather a different angle to that of Deputy Wolfe.  While, as Deputy MacEntee pointed out, generally speaking, we are in favour of improvements in the regulations governing the business of betting, and the control of those engaged in that business, nevertheless I am not prepared to close my eyes to some of the novel innovations which are gradually, taking place.  First of all, sub-section (2) of Section 2 provides that if any person who is not a licensed bookmaker starts to make a book or opens up a betting shop, he is liable on summary conviction to an excise penalty of £500.  I do not know whether the Minister for Finance or the Revenue Commissioners realise what they are heading for.  If a man commits an offence I believe the proper course to take is, on a complaint made by the Revenue Commissioners, to bring the matter before the District Justice.  Let the District Justice deal with the case on its merits.  They can then either have a minimum or a maximum fine or a sentence of imprisonment.  What is going to happen to the man who <Col N="1158" /> contravenes this sub-section (2)?  Undoubtedly some man will be found some day making a book without a licence who probably will not have fourpence in his possession.  That is why he will be making a book without a licence.  He will be fined £500; the District Justice will have no alternative but to fine him that.  Certain representations may be made to the Minister or to the Revenue Commissioners and that fine may be mitigated. If the man cannot find the mitigated amount the Commissioners have no alternative but to apply for a committal order and send him to jail, and he must lie there at their will and pleasure.  I can foresee this thing happening from the experience I have had of cases under the existing Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not new.  What the Deputy is talking about has been the law for four or five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>In what connection has it been law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The section the Deputy is talking about is only a repeat section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am getting at is that the excise laws deal with a different class of person altogether and a different class of the community. Under the excise laws the Revenue Commissioners deal with individuals who come before them under different circumstances altogether. The ordinary excise laws deal with people who have a traditional training in business methods and in connection with the offences where the Revenue Commissioners have a right under the law to exact certain penalties they are dealing with people who have engaged in calculated frauds or attempts to defraud.  Up to the introduction of the Betting Act the bookmaker, generally speaking, particularly the small one, was a man who had no business training or tradition, who carried his business under his hat and in his bag; who did his business on the nod; who made bets with people and if they paid him well and good; if he defaulted was helped to pay up.  Now suddenly these people are expected to be able to carry out their business just like concerns <Col N="1159" /> that have been established for generations. They are supposed to have all the ideas of a man of business understanding which the Minister himself must know is impossible in the case of some men who act as bookmakers. The Minister said it is not new.  We know it is not new, particularly in the case of the income tax.  But it certainly is new in the case of people carrying on their daily business who are subject to a secret service of the Revenue Commissioners coming in and catching them out and dealing with them without bringing them before the court in the ordinary way and allowing the case to be judged on its merits.  That is where I say the difference arises.</P>
      <P>I hope that on the Committee Stage the Minister will consider the acceptance of some amendment which will allow for the individual being brought before a District Justice and let that District Justice have some authority or discretion in the matter and not put him in the position of having to do a certain thing without considering anything of the merits.  Deputy MacEntee referred to the Betting Commission which received evidence and representations made by certain people with reference to their servants or employees.  I am prepared to believe that in some cases where bookmakers were heavily fined for suppression of bets or for the evasion of duty on bets or the writing down of the amount received these bookmakers were deceived by their own employees.  Yet under the Act and under this Bill, they are to get no protection.  I believe that if the District Justice had wider powers in the matter or if proper powers were left to him, where a man could conclusively prove that the writing down of a bet or the suppression of a bet was done by an employee deceiving and robbing him, the District Justice would take that into consideration and inflict a fine accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister on a previous occasion made it clear as far as he was concerned that the betting fraternity were to a great extent almost a pack of rogues.  I do not accept that view.  I accept the view that these men have <Col N="1160" /> been brought up and have worked in a different school altogether from that which is understood in the business world.  While I admit that certain bookmakers did deceive and defraud, others of them have tried honestly to fulfil the obligations imposed upon them by the Act.  Where a bookmaker was in difficulties and was convicted on twenty or thirty different counts it may have been the first time he was caught and the offences may have only covered a period of a few weeks but the man may have found himself unable to pay and he would be put out of business and put in jail.  At present you have ex-bookmakers walking the streets depending upon the charity of their colleagues.  We do not want to legislate to establish a new class of criminal who becomes a criminal through an accident in many cases.  I do not believe we are out to legislate to deprive people of their livelihood.  I know of a case of a poor man who is illiterate and who carried on the business of a bookmaker for some years until he got into difficulties because he had been allowed credit for the duty payable and when he was called upon to pay within fourteen days he could not pay.  He became a defaulter, with the result that he was heavily fined and sent to jail and is now walking the streets.</P>
    <P>Another thing I should like to call attention to is that in sub-section (2) of Section 4 and sub-section (2) of Section 5 a distinction is drawn between a bookmaker resident in the Free State applying for a licence and a person residing outside the Free State applying for a licence here.  It is only a small difference but I should like to get some information as to why the difference is made.  Sub-section (2) of Section 4 which deals with persons resident in the Saorstát says:</P>
    <P>Every person intending to apply under this section for a certificate of personal fitness shall, not less than one fortnight nor more than one month before making such application, publish notice of his intention to make such application at least once in each of two newspapers circulating in the district of the super- <Col N="1161" /> intendent to whom he intends to make such application.</P>
    <P>The cross-Channel man has only to make one publication in one paper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>A daily paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the other papers referred to are daily papers also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>What papers then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Any paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not let them all make the publication in a daily paper once and not differentiate between the cross-Channel man and a person resident in the Saorstát?  The person in the Saorstát must make the publication twice, whether in a daily or weekly paper.  Why there should be that distinction I do not know.  The local man applies to the local Gárda Superintendent. Why he is not allowed to apply in open court for a licence the same as a publican I do not know.  While the local man applies to the Superintendent of his district the cross-Channel man applies to the Minister for Justice. I can conceive a person here being refused a licence and becoming ordinarily resident across Channel and getting a friend to get a licence through the Minister for Justice for the bookmaking business here.  As far as I can see, the Revenue Commissioners would be defeating their own object in thus differentiating between the two individuals in the end, and they will find difficulties arising out of the new position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the hours, as to paying out of money, I think the Minister will have to reconsider his attitude upon that.  I believe that on the Committee Stage of this Bill amendments will be brought in which will show that it would be impossible for some of the men engaged in, and carrying on, this business to conform to the Bill in regard to the particular hours.  I am not contending that they should be allowed to take bets and pay out at the same time, but I am contending that they should be allowed to arrange hours convenient to themselves depending upon the business they are doing, or that they should receive bets in a place altogether separate from <Col N="1162" /> the paying-out place.  On the whole, I want to try and impress upon the House that it would be a good thing to go back again to leaving the administration of justice to the Department of Justice and District Justices rather than having the Revenue Commissioners turned into judge, jury, and lord high executioner at the same time, and where they cannot judge of a thing except from their own angle on the information received. I do not say that they are going to be biased for the sake of being biased, or to be unreasonable out of vindictiveness, but they can only judge on the information given them by their own trusted officials.  I say, in fairness, they should be allowed to make their case before the independent tribunal of the District Justice and before the Court of Appeal, and that the fines inflicted as between the minimum and maximum, or an imprisonment sentence, ought to be left to the Courts of Justice in the country. I do not know why it is that the Minister for Finance should suddenly be trying to develop so much distrust in the Department of Justice or in the Courts of Justice when it is other people who should have that feeling. I say the bookmakers themselves are quite prepared to take their medicine before any judge or before any District Justice, but there is always an element of dissatisfaction in feeling they were not getting a fair hearing. It sometimes happens an official or a servant of a Department may not be accurate or strictly truthful.  We have cases where the opinions of the Gárda are not always accepted in the District Court, or where the judges discount some of the remarks that they make.  In these cases the Revenue Commissioners, if they are to retain their secret service officials, must of necessity accept their evidence and act upon the information given them.  The Irish District Justice has sufficient intelligence to be able to judge as to the report of an individual whether the offender was as guilty in calculating his offence as a diligent officer might make out.  The public generally will, I believe, feel far more satisfied to have this matter of fines and imprisonment dealt with in the <Col N="1163" /> courts in the ordinary way rather than that such fines and imprisonment should be dictated by the Revenue Commissioners to the court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole spirit of this Bill appears to me to be wrong.  The Minister said that there were certain practices which should be controlled because they could not be stamped out.  In controlling matters like this we have an analogous example, for instance, in the matter of licensing. Where you have an appetite that is easily developed into excess and that leads to public disorder, it is naturally the function of the Department of Justice to deal with that from the point of view of the public policy, and purely and simply in order to control that particular matter in the interests of the public generally.</P>
      <P>The principle of this Bill is to make money out of an appetite, and the first consideration is the collection of taxation and trading upon the excess and abuse of what people contend is an ordinary human tendency.  It is quite legitimate for people to bet when they have a little surplus money, but the authorities in the matter who refer to the moral law have pointed out that where people bet with money that they cannot afford, and that should be spent on the vital necessities of their families, they are not entitled to use such money for betting.  A great deal of the betting under the Betting Act is done in small bets by persons who obviously have not got the money to spare from the necessities of their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the report of the evidence given by the Commissioner for Police the evils arising from small betting were shown.  When the representative of the Revenue Commissioners gave evidence he pointed out that in Dublin 50 per cent. of the bets made were small bets under 2/-, and he was therefore against making two shillings the minimum bet.  The compromise arrived at is, I think, to make the minimum bet 1/-.  The reason I mention that is because that finance department which is in control of this Bill kept in view&mdash; and from their own technical point of view it was the correct thing to do&mdash;<Col N="1164" /> purely the point of view of getting money for the revenue.  If that be correct from their point of view I think it is deplorable from the point of view of the public policy.  The Bill is itself a re-enactment of 30 clauses of the original Bill plus six clauses containing some of the recommendations of the Report, and also containing one proposal which no one having regard to public policy would have brought into any Bill.  I refer to the repeal of the Ready Money Football Act of 1920.  The passing of that Act was due to the abuses prevailing at the time.  Here we are widening the gates of betting and widening them specially to the detriment of the younger people, because it is the younger people who are interested in football, and it has been rightly said that sport and football are enormously injured in other countries by the enormous element of betting, and that we, in this country, are about to ruin some of the finest sport in Ireland by opening the flood gates of betting where they were shut, and shut, be it noted, by a foreign Government.</P>
    <P>The Report makes very sorry reading indeed.  In the general Report we find the following: &ldquo;The information thus available disclosed a large measure of agreement as to the practical effects of the Betting Act.  No witnesses appeared before the Joint Committee to urge that serious blemishes in practice have not accumulated around the working of the Act.  These are stated to be of a social character, for example, as adversely affecting public order and decorum, or the economic welfare of the community, particularly of the poorer classes, or the formation of the character of young people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I could hardly imagine anything so terrible as an Act being put upon the Statute Book which would interfere with the formation of the character of young people.  It reminded me of a quotation the exact words of which I forget, in Juvenal, who, to say the least of it, was not himself a squeamish person when he was writing.  He had a phrase about the reverence due to youth.  Since this Act was passed, so far as the habit of betting is concerned, we certainly have not that <Col N="1165" /> regard for young people which we should have.  We have now to deal with the appetite created in young people in the last three or four years. I do not think that the Act faces up to the situation which the Government have created.  The amendments are not stringent.  Although I disagree with the Joint Committee on which all parties were represented in their findings, I might say that the advantage of having such a Committee and its report is that it helps to mature one's views on a question like this.  I can imagine one who has signed that report forming later on a further set of views on the matter.  In any event the terms of the Committee were so limited that it was very difficult for them to deal with the evil involved. The Terms of Reference were: &ldquo;To enquire into the working of the Betting Act, 1926, and to report as to amendments considered desirable.&rdquo;  Except in so far as the evidence which could not be prevented from getting on the records and which pointed to the terrible evil created by this Act was concerned, it could not deal with the whole principle involved.  Therefore, one feels perfectly at liberty to differ with the findings even of the Committee as they stand, but I do not think that the suggestion of simply keeping people of eighteen years of age from entering a betting shop is going to stop the appetite which has now been created amongst the younger people.  It will be handed on in the schools and elsewhere from one boy to another, and it will require a great deal more than merely stopping boys of eighteen from entering the shops. Other people can take bets from them and arrangements can be made so that the persons who go into the shops will be over the age.</P>
    <P>It is said that the evils of the old street betting were worse than the evils created by this Act.  Although there is the evidence of the Commmissioner of Police to that effect I cannot find that so far there are any facts adduced to show that that is so. Therefore I think that we should approach this Bill from the very fundamental point of view of those whose duty it is to look after public morality rather than from the point <Col N="1166" /> of view of those whose duty it is to collect revenue.  Under this Act I think the Department of Justice should be given powers to make regulations from time to time to deal with the whole question of betting.  A Committee sitting for a short period and dealing with the facts as they have been brought before them does not really meet the situation.  You want to have the powers of the Department permanently interested in the question and actively working and from time to time making such regulations as would reduce the evils of betting to a minimum.  We must frankly face the fact that the Revenue Commissioners are going to lose money if we are going to prevent poor people who cannot afford to bet from doing so. Unless the House faces the Bill in that spirit it is doing an evil act contrary to all public policy in legislation which should be in the interests of the character of the people first. The collection of revenue should be a secondary matter.  The powers granted to the Revenue Commissioners should not belong to that Department at all.  The Revenue Commissioners have the power of imposing the penalties.</P>

      <P>They have the power of going before a judge and insisting upon imprisonment.  The act of the judge in those cases is purely of an administrative nature.  He has no discretion whatever in the matter and the Minister knows that.  Then, again, the Superintendents of the Gárda are the persons who are to decide as to the suitability of applicants for licences and the suitability of their premises. Their decisions are to be made privately. This is really a judicial matter and should be dealt with by a judge in an open court.  The Act puts into the hands of the Gárda powers which they, by themselves, should not be in a position to exercise.  Suggestions were made in the report for a wider use of the totalisator.  Legitimate betting on races is perfectly fair  if persons go to races, take an interest in the races and bet within reasonable limits while there.  To that there can be no objection.  The people who bet now, <Col N="1167" /> however, hardly know whether a horse has three legs or four legs.  All they know about a horse is what they read in the newspapers.  The newspapers, with their tipping articles, create a morbid psychology.  The people read these articles and develop an appetite for gambling.  The result is the evils we see around us to-day.  If this were an enactment made in Russia, it would probably be used in this country to show what a frightful country Russia was.  This is an enactment made amongst some of the poorest people in the world, living under the rottenest housing conditions in the world, and here we add to their conditions of poverty an absorbing vice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the technical point of view, there is no justification for repealing the old Act, because the additions made to that Act are so small that they could easily be effected by a small amending Act of six clauses.  If there had been a series of amending Acts or if there had been a series of decisions in the Courts under the Act, then there might be some reason for codifying the law, but here we are offering an insult to the intelligence of the Judges by re-enacting the Act from beginning to end and simply adding six clauses to it.  It would have been far better to have introduced an amendment to the old Act and leave it at that for the present, giving power to the Minister for Justice to make regulations from time to time to control the evils of betting. Some of the amendments show a total ignorance of the law in its present condition. For instance, cases have been decided in the Courts that loitering&mdash; not merely loitering which stops the traffic or obstructs persons in the pathway but notional loitering&mdash;is an offence.  Cases have been decided showing that loitering is against the law so that in this Bill we take everything out of the hands of the Judiciary. The question of advertisements has already been decided.  In Scot's case these advertisements were declared illegal and yet we are re-enacting law already decided.  From the point of view of legal enactment, the Bill is chaotic.  My own feeling about the Bill is that unless it is radically <Col N="1168" /> amended and the Title widened so as to deal with the tipping articles which appear in the Press and create an appetite amongst people who before would not have thought of such a thing&mdash;unless the Bill is amended in that respect I may be disposed, when the Bill comes to Report Stage, to vote against it altogether.</P>

      <P>I only said you &ldquo;may.&rdquo;  I must confess that, to a large extent, I agree with the last speaker.  I was disappointed when I read this Bill.  I looked back to the time when the original Act was passed in 1926, and I remember that many of us voted for that Bill in the hope that the effect of it would be to diminish the &ldquo;betting evil,&rdquo; as I think it is rightly called, rather than to increase it.  It was said that to bring that evil to the surface would make it easier to deal with.  If we consider what has happened since 1926 I think it will not be contended against that the effect has been a very large increase, particularly amongst those who can least afford it.  We see springing up like mushrooms, in all directions, betting shops.  In one respect the Bill will probably improve things.  It will prevent the loitering of people about these shops, but the shops will be there as advertisements of and incitements to betting.  I think that it will be admitted that since 1926 there has been an immense increase in bets&mdash; particularly in small bets.  It appears to me that the effect of this Bill will be that where a person has, up to the present, put on 6d., which he or she could very ill afford, he will in future put on l/-, which he can still less afford.  In one respect the Bill will tend to diminish and restrict betting inasmuch as it prevents those who are under the age of 18 from betting.  That and the provision as to loitering seem <Col N="1169" /> to be the two good points in the Bill. But when the Bill comes into operation, as I am sure it will, I do not think we shall have done very much to effect what I had hoped this Betting Bill would do&mdash;something to bring about a large and important diminution in betting.  It will make some difference, but I do not think it will make a very serious difference.  In that respect I hold largely the same views that Deputy Little has expressed. One could only deal with some of the points that he has mentioned by referring to what might be in the Bill but which it would probably not be in order to attempt to introduce in the Bill in its future stages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. McGilligan) Patrick McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Veterinary Surgeons Bill, 1930, be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;  This Bill in its main outline follows the models that <Col N="1170" /> have already been before the House in connection with medical practitioners and dentists.  The Bill is founded upon an agreement which forms the First Schedule.  Outside that, and as far as the country is concerned, the Bill establishes a Council which is to regulate the veterinary surgeon's profession in the country for the future. There is a variety of clauses which deal with the method in which that Council is to be elected and there is a certain arrangement made to fit in. with the agreement which forms the First Schedule.  Under the agreement the Council that at present controls veterinary education in England, and which used to control that education both in England and here, is to be enlarged by the addition of four members who are to be elected here by those who are qualified veterinary surgeons registered in the General Register, which is the English Register, but resident in this country.  They will vote in a particular way that is laid down here.  These four will become members of the General Council and they will have certain functions assigned to them as such. In addition they will have functions in connection with veterinary education in this country without any relation whatever to England, Scotland or Wales.  There are also to be four members who are to be appointed from amongst the professional men resident here, whether registered in the General Register or not, as long as they are qualified veterinary practitioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 30 and 31 lay down the conditions under which people in this country may be registered on the register which will be established here. Section 30 sets out: &ldquo;There shall be registered in the register at the establishment thereof&mdash;(a) every person who is registered in the general veterinary register immediately before the establishment of the register and is then resident in Saorstát Eireann, and (b) every person who is registered in the general veterinary register immediately before the establishment of the register and is then resident outside Saorstát Eireann and applies to the Council within one month before such establishment to be registered in <Col N="1171" /> the register.&rdquo;  Those are entitled to go on our register who have a registration effected for them in the general register on the other side or who hold a diploma in veterinary science, veterinary surgery or veterinary medicine granted by a university or college in Saorstát Eireann &ldquo;and for the time being recognised by law as a diploma conferring on the possessor thereof the right to be registered in the register.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The main point with which the agreement deals is connected with erasures from the register.  Here a somewhat different system has been established to what was effected with regard to medical practitioners or dentists.  The position in future will be that if an offence is committed which seems to warrant an inquiry, possibly leading to erasure from the register, if the person is practising as a veterinary surgeon exclusively outside the Free State, or practises both outside and within the Free State, and the offence is alleged to have been committed or, in the case of continuing conduct, begun outside the Free State, the right to inquire into it falls on the Council on the other side.  The report of that Council shall be conclusive as to the facts, but the Irish Free State Veterinary Council shall form their own judgment on the case independently.  With regard to people practising exclusively in the Free State, or both within and outside the Free State, and the offence is committed or, in the case of continuing conduct, begun within the Free State, then the right to investigate shall fall on the Council here and the corresponding result follows, except as regards the finding of facts, upon which they will form their own judgment. The Council for this country will have control of veterinary education, and it will decide whether any person can properly be registered.  It will also see that the rules are properly kept. It comes to this, that hereafter we will prohibit the practice of veterinary surgery by persons not registered. The register on the other side only comes in by reference, and a person registered there may have his name entered on this register.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1172" /> I do not intend to go into details with regard to how the Council is elected.  All that is dealt with in the Bill and can be read.  There are two points with regard to the Irish Free State representatives who sit on the General Veterinary Council, and the investigation of any offences, whether criminal or of the unprofessional conduct type, and what follows on the finding of facts by each body.  Outside that the situation is that the old Veterinary Surgeons Acts remain in force in this country in so far as they are necessary to carry out the agreement. The power of the old General Veterinary Council to hold examinations, to supervise examinations and to grant diplomas which entitle persons to registration on the General Veterinary Register, is still continued just as if the Free State were never established.  This agreement corresponds exactly with the agreements made for dentists and the medical people.  There still remain to be decided what are the bodies that are to be entitled to give diplomas which, for the time being, would be recognised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very little.  There are changes in the internal arrangements. There are changes in the method of appointing the Council, and in some smaller details.  The Bill is on the lines of the Dentists Bill.  The Dentists Bill dealt with a different situation.  This is a different matter, but the difference that arises in substance in the principle of the Bill is in two sections of the Agreement.  In fact the difference is in Section 4 dealing with the Agreement.  There is also Section 6, which is somewhat different, but Section 6 is a minor <Col N="1173" /> matter.  Section 4 is really the section with the great change that has been made as between the arrangements for the medical and the dental people and the veterinary surgeons.  It means what I have just said&mdash;that in the old scheme there had been a council of a particular type and there was no necessity for a change.</P>
      <P>In this Bill the change is required because the old council consisted of 32 people and it is intended to enlarge that body of 32 to 36.  The four extra members will be people appointed from those veterinary surgeons who are resident here but who are on both registers.  As far as other things are concerned the preservation of the old jurisdiction of the Veterinary Council for the purpose of keeping a general register, preserving their right to investigate offences and preserving their own jurisdiction with regard to examinations&mdash;just as in the Medical and Dental Councils&mdash;is preserved here. There is a small point about the extra representatives.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance is not here.  I do not know whether this motion is to be left to a free vote of the House or whether it is to be made a Party question.  I should like to know.  The Minister for Finance was the chief opponent of this motion on the last occasion when it was before the House.  Though his opposition may have been strong enough his arguments were very halting indeed. I will deal with a few points raised in the Minister's speech.  He said:&mdash;&ldquo;there is a very great difference between those men and the resigned members of the R.I.C.&rdquo;  We quite agree.  The members of the R.I.C. who resigned certainly made sacrifices. I do not want to cast any aspersions on them.  There was a Committee of Inquiry held when allotting their pensions and matters were raised which I do not like to refer to here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree that the members of the R.I.C. showed as much courage in resigning as the Connaught Rangers did in their mutiny in India in order to prevent British atrocities in this country as far as they could do so. The Minister for Finance also said that these men did no more than the civilian population in Ireland did during the Black and Tan regimé.  Of course that is a childish argument. The great majority of the people here were on the same side.  They might have run a little risk.  They might have made some financial sacrifices but they kept their farms and businesses and whatever positions they had.  The men who mutinied in India risked their lives and knew they were risking them.  They knew that they would be at least imprisoned and dismissed from the Army.  Soldiering was the trade of many of them and they knew no other.  They had nothing to turn to.  They lost all <Col N="1175" /> pension rights.  There was no promise to them of reward no matter who won here.  The Minister for Finance said that no appeal was made to them.  Perhaps that is all the more credit to them for acting spontaneously through patriotic motives. It was well known that the Connaught Rangers all through their history had national sentiments.  They acted without hope of reward.  They were, the Minister said, no factors in the matter of solving the Irish problem at that time or in getting freedom or an instalment of freedom for this State.  I quote from the &ldquo;Freeman's Journal&rdquo; of July 6th, 1920, which states:&mdash;&ldquo;The &lsquo;Westminster Gazette&rsquo; says &lsquo;The mutiny of the Connaught Rangers in India seems to be a localised affair and we hope it will not spread or cause a break in the tradition of service to the Empire built up by Irish regiments, but it is a sign of the widespread feeling amongst Irishmen against the present policy of the Government.&rsquo;&rdquo; So that it was taken by the &ldquo;Westminster Gazette&rdquo; as a sign and a signal of the feeling of Irishmen.  Evidently the &ldquo;Westminster Gazette&rdquo; took it that these men were some factor in the matter of the Irish revolutionary movement.</P>
    <P>The Minister also says &ldquo;there has been a certain difficulty in ascertaining the facts as to the services of the Connaught Rangers.&rdquo;  That is just our case.  The Minister mentioned six who had service of over seven years, I think. My colleague, Deputy Kerlin, who did the spade work in this inquiry, and who did all the documentation for me, is, I regret, not present.  Deputy Kerlin discovered twelve men with services of over seven years.  It is therefore all the more reason why there should be a Committee of Inquiry into the cases of these men, such as is suggested in this motion.  &ldquo;A considerable number of these men were given work for certain periods,&rdquo; says the Minister.  It would be very interesting to get detailed information as to the work that was given to these men, to whom it was given, and for what duration.</P>
    <P>Looking through the list I find that there were 23 of them in the National Army, two got clerical appointments, <Col N="1176" /> and nine joined the Civic Guards. Those in the National Army, of course, with the exception, I think, of three, have now joined the unemployed.  The letters are rather instructive as to the conditions under which these men were living a few years ago, when the motion was first brought in, and when we got the documents which were necessary to deal with the case.  Some of them got three weeks' employment. Does the Minister think that that is a sufficient reward for a man who lost his gratuity, who spent three years in jail, as a number and not as a human being, who comes home in broken health and with nothing to turn to?  As I say, some of them got three weeks' employment.  The Minister said that there are numerous complaints of ex-British soldiers being in great distress. We regret that any Irishman should be in distress, but Britain's failure to help those who served her is no excuse why we should neglect those who helped us in our hour of need.  We have an example, of course, of the treatment of Irishmen who joined the British Army in the &ldquo;Ballad of Patrick Sheehan,&rdquo; but that is of no use to us now.  It is rather callous of us to neglect these men as we have neglected them.</P>
    <P>I shall just go through a few cases which will illustrate the condition of these men: John Moorhouse, Newbridge, Co. Kildare, wife and three children, unemployed and practically starving, also served in National Army.  John Flannery, Dublin, with thirteen years' service in the British Army, unemployed; dependents, aged invalid mother and widowed sister. Patrick Donohue, Cork, broken down completely in health as a result of wounds received in World War, not fit for work, and lost his disability pension.  J. Fallon, Drogheda, 12 years in the British Army, spent two years in prison, has widowed mother in bad health dependent on him, unemployed and in destitute circumstances. Patrick Dyer, Ballymote, two years' imprisonment, wife and three children in bad circumstances, suffered severely from malaria. Thomas Devine, Longford, sentenced to death for part in mutiny, commuted to penal servitude for life, <Col N="1177" /> imprisoned for 2½ years, unemployed and living with aged father; at the time of mutiny had been granted £1 per week wound pension and was waiting to be drafted home, but lost this by taking part in the mutiny, and afterwards got wound pension of about 7/6.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion I quoted the case of James Davis, Dublin, who took part in the mutiny at Jullundur and was sentenced to two years' penal servitude; escaped from Woking Prison in England in 1921, and within a week joined the I.R.A. (Second Northern Division) in the North under the late Charlie Daly; took part in engagements against the Specials in the Sperrin Mountains, was taken prisoner in December, 1921, sentenced to five years' and sent to Peterhead; was released from there in January, 1926, having completed his sentence; had nineteen years', service in the British Army, and also three years' naval service; was entitled to a pension of not less than 30/- a week, but this he sacrificed; practically unemployed since release from prison.  John Oliver, a Galway man, sentenced to death, commuted to penal servitude for life, imprisoned for two and a half years; fifteen and a half years' service in British Army, unemployed and in bad health; spent many months in Galway Hospital and in County Home; when last heard of was living on 4/- a week outdoor relief.  The last case I will quote is that of M. Kearns, Dublin, who was sentenced to three years' penal servitude and imprisoned for 21 months; six years in British Army, had aged mother dependent on him; unemployed.  Regarding this man, I may say that this House can do nothing for him now. He died in the South Dublin Union in August last, and were it not for the Christian charity of an undertaker he would have been buried in a pauper's grave.</P>
    <P>These are some of the cases to which I have drawn attention and the Minister says that there are six men who might have claims.  If they have claims now how is it that they had not claims in 1923?  Why does the Minister say that he will consider the claims of six out of 53 survivors of the mutiny?  I <Col N="1178" /> have the names of eleven men whose service in the British Army ranged from 10 to 17 years.  The Minister's figures differ from those with which I have been supplied.  I think it is very ungenerous of the Minister to suggest such treatment as this, namely, that he will consider the case for employment only of six out of 53 men.  These men have not, of course, much influence. They will not influence elections very much but they certainly have a claim on us.  It was not always thought by the Minister's colleagues that these men were no factors in the case.  I have letters here from several of the Minister's colleagues written to these men expressing a different view-point.</P>
    <P>There is one letter here signed &ldquo;Risteard Ua Maolchatha&rdquo; from Oglaigh na h-Eireann, General Headquarters, Dublin, 20th December, 1922. It was in reference to securing the release of the men who were then in British prisons.  One sentence refers to the men of the Connaught Rangers. He referred to those who stood so nobly as one man when their assistance was of such use to the country.  That is a different view to that expressed by the Minister.  There is then a letter from Cumann na nGaedheal, from 5 Parnell Square, Dublin, dated 4th November, 1924, in which it is stated: &ldquo;It is unnecessary to add that of all the terrible incidents of the recent struggle for independence the dramatic sacrifice of the Connaught Rangers has most struck the imagination and sympathies of our people, and if your members have a suggestion to make in writing of their situation or needs it will receive our most careful attention with a view to action.&rdquo;  It is signed &ldquo;S.O hAodha, Ard-Rúnaí.&rdquo;  Apparently Cumann na nGaedheal at that time had the idea that these men had done something for their country.  Deputy Dr. Myles Keogh wrote saying that he would do anything he could for these men and expressed recognition of the action that they had taken. There are letters from several other T.D.s which I might read but I will content myself with reading only one more.  It states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>With reference to a query regarding my attitude towards those of <Col N="1179" /> you who laid down your arms in India to further the cause of Irish independence, I beg to state that should I be elected in this fight in North City I will do everything humanly possible for you.  I fully realise the responsibility you took upon yourselves when you laid down your arms, thousands of miles away from your people, and faced the bullets, if need be, in support of your convictions.  I maintain you should be treated as if you were members of the I.R.A. from the time you first started your opposition to British rule in Ireland and pensioned accordingly, or, failing that, I will demand the same rights for you as were given to R.I.C. men who resigned during the Black and Tan régime.  Hoping to have your support in this election, and assuring you that your service to Ireland in her hour of trial should not go unheeded.</P>

    <P>The writer is now leader of the Government Party in the Seanad.  He had some idea then&mdash;I do not know whether it was during the election or whether it was a permanent idea&mdash; that these men had done something for Ireland.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us whether this motion is to be left to a free vote of the House <Col N="1180" /> or whether the Whips are to be put on.</P>

We are not asking, as the Minister suggested in his speech the other day, to give these men pensions.  We merely want a Committee of Inquiry.  The Minister is opposed to giving them very much. He knows our attitude regarding pensions for able-bodied men of any type in the country and it would be quite safe to leave it to the Committee so that some reward might be meted out to these men.  You have had three men already dying in destitution and we should see that no more of them would die like that.  The Minister can rely on it that a Committee such as we suggest will not be wasteful of the people's money and that they will do only what is right and just.  I am convinced that history will judge us very harshly if we do not come to the rescue of the survivors of the mutineers of the Connaught Rangers.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That a Select Committee consisting of eleven Deputies, to be nominated by the Committee of Selection, be set up to consider the present position and future prospects of the industry of tobacco-growing in Saorstát Eireann; and to report whether any assistance should be given to it, and what should be the nature and extent of any such assistance;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Committee have power to send for persons, papers and records.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the Minister when he comes to reply will say that this question of tobacco growing has been examined often enough arid that no good results accrued; that time was simply wasted; that it was impossible to grow this plant here, and such things as that.  I believe there has been proof enough given that the plant can be grown here if it got sufficient encouragement. Perhaps the rebate in duty was sufficient to create this industry and make it a flourishing industry, but what I wish to draw attention to and what does not seem to have been attended to on previous occasions is the severity of the excise rules and regulations which govern the growing of tobacco.  I believe that there is profit to be got from an inquiry into these rules and regulations and that some suggestions would be forthcoming from the Revenue Department as to how they could be made somewhat easier and more encouragement given to farmers to grow this plant.  Most of us are aware that it was grown in this country&mdash;that County Wexford grew it largely.  We are also prepared to admit that at that time County Wexford <Col N="1184" /> got a good deal of profit through an illicit trade with England.  But we will also have to admit that it was in the interests of the Colonies that the industry was prohibited here, and I think on inquiry we will admit that on this last occasion the decay of the industry was largely due to the interests of the Colonies.</P>
    <P>I hold that what mostly prevented the propagation of the plant was the severity of the excise rules and regulations. We are all familiar with different Acts passed long ago by the British Government&mdash;Land Acts and other Acts.  These Acts were passed in the belief that they would bring about what was desired.  But as soon as these Acts got into the hands of those who were to administer them and they had formulated their rules and regulations, the Acts at once became useless and the desires and wishes of the sponsors were defeated.  We have had previously in this country big sums of money spent on this industry.  We had rebates of tax.  The Minister will probably explain, as he explained before, how much the taxpayer puts up if a rebate is given.  All that was done and it was admitted that the plant could be grown.  Then we had Commissions set up to inquire into the cost of growing and all that, and reports brought in putting the cost of production altogether higher than it really was.  They magnified the difficulties in growing the plant here.  All that, of course, to anyone who knows anything about the growth of the plant was absolutely propaganda.  There was no necessity for such minute instructions nor was there any necessity for expensive manure or all these precautions. Neither was there a necessity for the expensive barns that were erected and for which the people paid and which are left there useless to-day.  Tobacco can be grown and will without all that.</P>
    <P>Now, I shall be asked what is the reason it was not grown.  I am going to give the reason by reading some of the rules and regulations which governed the growth of tobacco and which aimed definitely at preventing that crop from being grown from an industrial point of view.  In other words, the rules and regulations definitely prevented <Col N="1185" /> the manufacturing of the leaf in this country.  You have the most foolish rules and regulations governing the tobacco growing that anybody could imagine.  Of course we all quite understand that the idea was that tobacco should not be allowed to be grown, that the Government thought it advisable to make these promises with regard to tobacco growing, and then the regulations were brought in, and the result was to prevent the industry from materialising.  I do not intend to read all the rules and regulations because it would take too long a time, and that in itself will give some idea of what the farmer had to face at the start of his attempt to grow tobacco. Most people will admit that the farmer would not read all these rules, but he would read one or two of them, and he would say &ldquo;We will not have this because if we do we will have visitors four or five times a day, or else we must buy a piece of land three miles away and build a factory and get two securities of £1,000 each.&rdquo;  I admit that the Revenue Commissioners are not inclined to carry out these orders to the very letter of the law, but at the same time it does not follow that they could not do it if they wanted. The reasons why I want this Committee set up is to enquire into these excise rules and regulations to see if they are not too severe upon the industry to give it a fair chance.  Here is Part I. of these statutory rules and orders, 1911, No. 49.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;1.  As to licence entry and duty. (1) A person may not sow the seed of the tobacco plant or grow tobacco in the United Kingdom or cure tobacco grown in the United Kingdom without having in force an Excise licence for the purpose, and except upon land and premises which have been approved by the Commissioners and have been duly entered by that person.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;2.  The Commissioners may refuse to grant a licence for any land or premises on or in which from their situation with respect to the premises of a manufacturer of tobacco, they think it inexpedient to allow the growing or curing of tobacco.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1186" />&ldquo;3.  A person requiring a licence shall obtain from the proper officer a form of application and shall furnish in the form the particulars thereby required, and shall return the form duly filled up and signed by him to the officer.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;4.  The licence shall whenever issued be granted only on payment in full of the duty chargeable there-on, and shall expire on the last day of February in each year.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;5.  Every grower and every curer shall in each year before making use of any land, shed or place for growing, curing, or storing any tobacco make entry in the prescribed form of the land upon which the tobacco is to be grown, and of every shed or place to be used by him in connection with the growing or curing or storing of tobacco, specifying the purpose for which each such shed or place is to be used, and the entry shall not be withdrawn while any tobacco remains on or in the entered land, shed or place.  The grower or curer shall sign the entry, and deliver it to the proper officer.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;6.  Every grower before commencing to grow any tobacco and every curer before receiving any tobacco for curing shall give security in such sum and in such form as the Commissioners may require that he will observe and comply with all regulations made by the Commissioners in relation to the tobacco.  The security to be given by a grower shall also be a security for the due removal of all tobacco grown by him to the premises of a curer or for otherwise accounting for the same.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;7.  Every grower who cures tobacco grown by himself and every curer must produce to the proper officer for preliminary weighing all tobacco grown by him or received by him for curing in any year as soon as it is in a condition to be weighed and not later than the first day of January following the cutting or gathering of the tobacco or such subsequent day as the Commissioners may allow.  Each package in which the tobacco is produced must be distinguished by an identification mark and number, and the <Col N="1187" /> weight ascertained at the preliminary weighing shall be used for the purpose of raising a presumptive charge of duty in respect of the total quantity of the tobacco produced.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;8.  The duty on the tobacco shall become chargeable as soon as it is in a fit state for use by a manufacturer of tobacco and an account of the tobacco shall then be taken, but in the event of there being a deficiency not accounted for by a legitimate cause in the weight then ascertained as compared with the weight ascertained on the preliminary weighing the weight ascertained on the preliminary weighing shall, subject to such allowance for loss of weight during the process of curing as the Commissioners may allow, be deemed to be the weight of the tobacco chargeable with duty.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now that is the preliminary part and I am quite sure the House will agree that these rules and regulations so far could easily be simplified and made to hold less terrors for the average farmer, who even yet has the greatest terror of officials.  Of course they go a lot further than this and they speak of tobacco entry form books to be kept and such other things, with the result that the growing of tobacco has largely been impeded if not entirely prevented.  Even under the present rate of 6/8 duty in the £ it could be made profitable for a man to grow an acre or two of tobacco and manufacture it himself.  Although the Department thought previously that tobacco could only be grown for pipe purposes and that we could only grow a very strong dark tobacco that, of course, is not the case.  It is strange that in this country and especially in Wexford a leaf can be grown for cigar or cheroot manufacture that cannot be beaten in any other part of the world.</P>
    <P>You can grow a cheroot leaf in this country which, when harvested, hung up and dried for 9 or 10 weeks, can be smoked without any process of manufacture.  I admit, from the Excise point of view, there is great <Col N="1188" /> danger of abuse there and loss of revenue, but at the same time I think the day has come when that cannot so largely enter into the question, and when farmers ought to be allowed to grow on their land whatever they can possibly grow with profit.  I admit that the revenue obtained from tobacco in this country is big, but it is obtained, perhaps, without very much consideration from the point of view of the prosperity of the country.  It was found by the Revenue Authorities to be a very handy means, of collecting taxes.  The duty amounts to three million five hundred thousand pounds. I admit that has to be considered, but if these rules and regulations were modified for a period of five or six years, until people got confidence and the industry was more or less established, there is nothing at all to prevent the Minister for Finance at any time resorting to stronger methods and preventing any abuses that might arise.</P>
    <P>I admit he can make a good case that we would slip it across the border and that there would be a certain amount of confusion in that way, but I believe that the tobacco growing industry in this country under the conditions I say, that is, for the purpose of the manufacture of cheroots and cigars could be made an industry which would occupy a number of families.  Not alone that, but the fact of smoking cigars and cheroots, if they can be sold, and I believe they can, at a low price would be an easy means of cultivating a taste for Irish tobacco. I would like to see a committee set up which would consider that point.  I am able to give an example of a man in the Co. Wexford who started with only £30 capital.  I do not say that was used in the growing.  I mean the manufacturing side.  That man is manufacturing cheroots; he employs 6 or 7 hands, and he has a fairly nice little industry going; but for that industry those people would be on the road.  He himself grows and manufactures his own tobacco, and will be in a position at a later period to take tobacco from others.  The difficulty is this: there are rules and regulations preventing all that.  I believe if this <Col N="1189" /> committee was set up a solution could be got.</P>
    <P>We all admit that the plant can be grown; it is grown in Europe and all over the world; it is grown in hot and cold climates.  The flavours are different, but it can be said that the tobacco grown here is 50 per cent. more wholesome and better than tobacco that comes from the United States.  That is the particular tobacco used here for cigarettes.  That tobacco is not used in America.  Great Britain and Ireland are the only European countries which make use of the American leaf.  France grows and uses her own tobacco; Germany the same; but we, somehow or other, have not been able to succeed, I believe, because of these rules and regulations. There is any amount of scope for an inquiry.  They will have sufficient evidence. I know if I asked that a Committee be set up for the other purpose, the Minister would easily reply there is no existing industry and there is no one to give evidence.  A lot of the evidence given previously, I admit, was not given exactly as things worked out.  There was a great deal of false propaganda used.  It would be reasonable that that portion should be inquired into as well.  I do not believe that abuses would arise for three or four years.</P>
    <P>Another thing about tobacco is the importance of the nicotine industry, and what prevents it from arising here.  Something like ninety thousand lbs. weight of tobacco was put in bond here.  An agreement had been reached in the County Waterford for sale to a manufacturer, but when it came to removal the process of preventing it being used for any other purpose was so expensive that no sale could be brought about.  I know myself there are far cheaper and simpler processes for that purpose, but the Revenue authorities would not agree.  I know that cheap experiments have been tried in the last five or six years to bring about that result.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners not only objected but issued a warning that such an attempt should not be made.  Being a farming community we use a great deal of sheep dip: it is admitted on all sides that nicotine <Col N="1190" /> sheep dip is far more efficacious than any of the poisoned dips.  In County Waterford you have a factory turning out nicotine, buying the raw material from Germany, and exporting the nicotine to England.  They have no market here, for its uses are not known in this country.  You are able to get three crops of tobacco in the year.  The stalks are quite suitable for the manufacture of nicotine.  As you harvest the leaf here you are not allowed to do anything with the stalks; you must destroy them and have an officer of the Revenue present while you do that.  If you want to sow seed you have to explain how much you have sown; if you are going to plant out you must give the officer two days' notice.  He must be present and know the amount you have in each class of crop.  When you are going to harvest it you have to give two days' notice.  Sometimes he is not available the weather gets bad, and you cannot go on with it until he is there.  If you want to turn it into tobacco or nicotine you must have a bonded store.  In that bonded store you must provide a room with water for the Revenue officer to preside in.  You must have a scales properly proved and correct, and you must have your tobacco in hales of 80 lbs. and nothing less.  That bonded stores must be at least three miles away.  You must enter into security of £2,000, two persons of £1,000 each.  I admit that on application those things have been reduced. That might be the case once, but it-may not always be the case.  I have no hesitation in saying that if the Minister will agree to set up a Committee for the purpose and relax the rules and regulations and make them a little more sensible, in other words to indicate that he has not the same suspicion at the back of his mind as the British Government had, the tobacco industry could become a source of great profit.  It would give people, especially labourers, employment.  The industry goes hand in hand with poultry raising.  The plant grows on fowl manure better than any other.  I have seen it grow at 990 feet and in bogs.</P>
    <P>There is no difficulty whatever in the way.  The cheroot manufacture <Col N="1191" /> is the one I should like to see concentrated upon because the cheroot cannot be made by machine.  The human hand is required to make a cheroot. It is quite a simple process and its use will gradually cultivate a taste for home-grown tobacco.  The moment that people get a taste for home-grown tobacco they will resort to no foreign-grown tobacco.  They will find that the amount of dope contained in foreign-grown tobacco does not exist in Irish tobacco.  Irish tobacco needs no manipulation, no curing, and no chemical processes of any description. I believe that foreign tobaccos need a good deal of manipulation, especially American tobacco.  American tobacco is used here because it is the handiest. It is well graded.  There is no expense in the handling of it.  At the same time, although we have new factories set up here every day, they do not seem to have given additional employment according to statistics. Indeed, the number of operatives seems to have decreased while the number of salaried officials has increased.</P>
    <P>I dare say that on the motion later we shall be told a good deal more about the abuses that exist.  I do not suggest that if we set up this Committee and if we tone down these rules and regulations and get an industry started here&mdash;I do not suggest that, having done this, we should start to compete with the Imperial Tobacco Company or that we should start to export tobacco.  I do suggest that anybody who has the tradition or taste ought to be allowed to grow it with a good deal of freedom and not so much suspicion.  The officials in general are very polite and thoughtful people but I suggest that at times these officials can use the power they possess with too great severity.  I would ask the Minister to consider seriously the tendency of the rules and regulations which govern this whole industry.  He may say that that can be considered by going before the Commission.  That is not the case. The setting up of a committee will not cost very much and I believe that far better results would be got in that way than by the other course.  I am <Col N="1192" /> quite sure that the Minister is only too anxious that any industry that can be set up should be set up.  I know, although he may be a non-smoker, he is convinced that tobacco of a very suitable kind can be grown here.  Tobacco for the manufacture of cheroots is being tested by the public at present.  There are numerous shops throughout the country selling these cheroots which are manufactured by a common or garden amateur and untrained hands&mdash;ordinary country boys and girls who have only started the work within the last year or two.  No special cheroot manufacturer was got over from Belgium or from any of the defunct factories in England.  It was started by local brains and I am quite sure that the House will come to the conclusion that if that industry were handled properly it would be a great source of employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not profess to know as much about tobacco as does Deputy O'Reilly.  However, the nicotine factory to which he referred happens to be in my town and I am familiar with it.  I happen to know a little, too, about the use of foreign sheep dips in this country.  We import a tremendous quantity of sheep dips and, unfortunately, the people have a taste for foreign poison sheep dip.  I believe that the nicotine we manufacture in our place is just as effective, but whether it is due to the slave mind or not, the people will not use the sheep dip made in their own town.  They prefer to use the sheep dip made in England and Scotland.  It would be a good idea if we compelled our own people to use the sheep dip of their own manufacture in preference to that made by one who, I believe, is a bitter enemy of this country.  If we did nothing else but use that by-product of tobacco in the manufacture of nicotine sheep dip, we would be providing a goodly number of people in this country with employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to tobacco, the Governments of other countries are, I think, wiser than ours in this way: that whether their people have or have not <Col N="1193" /> a predilection in favour of Virginian tobacco, they are practically compelled to use tobacco grown or manufactured in their own country.  In Italy, France and Germany if you look for tobacco you have almost perforce to take the tobacco grown in the country. Otherwise you will have to pay an exorbitant price.  We could do the same here.  If our people will not willingly support the article that is made in their own country and which gives employment in their own country, we should see that they are compelled to do so.  That may seem very arbitrary, but it would be better for the people themselves, because I think a lot of the tobacco we use in this country is not as healthy or as good as the tobacco that we could make ourselves.  We should start and create a taste for the tobacco we manufacture ourselves. Apart from that, it would be a good idea if we could encourage the growing of rough tobacco for the manufacture of nicotine from which we make the sheep dip which is used so extensively in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not expect that this motion would be reached to-night and I have not any papers in connection with it here.  I have, therefore, to speak entirely from memory.  This question of tobacco growing has been before the Dáil many times.  I, like other members of the Government, entered upon consideration of tobacco growing with a very strong prejudice in its favour. The question of tobacco growing was discussed a good deal in the papers edited by the late President Griffith and most of us had the idea that a flourishing tobacco industry ought to exist here and that it was merely foreign misrule and foreign misregulation that prevented its growth.  A closer examination convinced us that there was really no prospect of growing tobacco here on a considerable scale on anything like an economic basis.  Nevertheless, a very considerable preference was given to tobacco &mdash;as much as it was thought could in any way be justified.  In my own view the preference given was perhaps more than could be strictly justified unless it were to be of a temporary character. <Col N="1194" /> The preference given was not only not of a temporary character, but all the indications were that if the industry were to be continued at all on any scale that would make it worth talking about, even a larger preference would have to be given.</P>
      <P>A Committee of the Dáil was set up in 1925 or 1926&mdash;perhaps it was in 1924. It sat and considered the matter and made certain recommendations which, having heard the representations of the growers, they considered would be the minimum and that would suffice to enable the tobacco growing industry to be continued here.  As far as I remember the effect of the recommendations, if they had been adopted, would have been to give a subsidy of £120 an acre for every acre of tobacco grown.  One comment made upon that was that it would be better to pay everybody who had ever been connected with tobacco-growing a sum of £3 a week and tell them to go and live in comfort for the rest of their days than to pay a subsidy of £120 an acre for the purpose of encouraging tobacco-growing.  As far as I can recollect it, the position seems to be that it would cost something like 1s. 6d. to grow tobacco of a type which could be bought on the market for about 6d.  It is quite all right to subsidise an industry and subsidise it heavily for a period if it is going to root itself, so to speak, and become economic subsequently.  I do not say that you should not entertain an industry at all even if it is never to become economic.  There are certain industries which should have small assistance in perpetuity which it might be desirable to foster and to give that assistance to, but I am satisfied that tobacco is not one of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy talked about rules and regulations and the onerous character of those rules and regulations. I do not know whether that sort of speech proceeds from second thoughts, because there is nothing in the motion to indicate that that was his line of approach.  I thought the Deputy would pursue the old line we had so often in the Dáil, and which indicated that we should give a greater subsidy. A remission of taxation is a subsidy; it is exactly the same in its effect on <Col N="1195" /> the Exchequer and the individuals concerned as if those individuals got a direct subsidy.  If it takes ? or 2/6 a lb. to induce anybody to grow tobacco, then if there was no tax at all on tobacco, and if it were permitted into the country free, it would take a subsidy of approximately the amount of the remission of duty to induce persons to grow the plant.  The Deputy suggests that a Special Committee should report whether any assistance could be given to the tobacco-growing industry and indicate the nature and extent of such assistance. There is nothing in that motion to indicate that the Deputy was going to deal mainly with the question of rules and regulations.  I think when the Deputy put down the motion he must have intended to ask for a larger subsidy.  Perhaps he read some of the reports of the discussions that have already taken place in the Dáil, and he came to the conclusion that there could be no case for a further subsidy, that there would be no chance of anybody on the Government side accepting the motion and, therefore, his best course was to pursue a new line of attack.</P>
    <P>I have not had the advantage of looking up reports and other things recently.  I have, of course, seen these rules and regulations, but it is years since I saw them, and I had no opportunity of going over them within recent times.  As the Deputy proceeded in his references to them there was nothing to indicate that they were unduly strict or that something less onerous could be adopted.  If I had time to go over those rules and regulations, and if I were discussing all this matter with some person interested in the industry, some prospective grower who would be anxious to get down to rock-bottom, it might be possible to see some small modification that would be of advantage to the grower.  As it is, we have to consider this as a revenue matter of importance.  Tobacco which would get into consumption irregularly would mean a substantial loss. If some person could grow an acre of tobacco illicitly he might rob the revenue of £400.  You cannot allow <Col N="1196" /> individuals to have the chance of robbing the Exchequer or acquiring for themselves the equivalent of a subsidy of £300 or £400.  If tobacco-growing is to be tolerated at all, it certainly must be under such conditions as would prevent individuals for their own profit from extracting large sums of money either from the Exchequer or from the people&mdash;the consumers of tobacco.  The Deputy might say that it does not matter if an odd acre or half an acre escapes taxation.  An industry which can only be kept going by getting £300 an acre&mdash;perhaps more &mdash;or £150 a half acre, is not any good. The Deputy talked about a labourer growing tobacco on his plot, and he touched upon fowl-rearing, and he pleaded for regulations that for all practical purposes would give the labourer who grew tobacco a good chance of escaping and having no duty to pay.  If you are going to let a labourer grow half an acre of tobacco without paying duty, it would be just as well for you to tell him not to trouble at all about growing the tobacco and give him £3 a week so that he could take matters easy at home.  If it is going to cost the Exchequer £3 a week, as it surely would, why let the labourer go to the trouble of cultivating the plot of tobacco at all?  The whole point about tobacco-growing is that the industry could be carried on if you are going to make the Exchequer pay a very exorbitant subsidy.  I think that the sort of subsidy that has to be paid, if more tobacco were grown under the present rules, could hardly be justified as a permanent thing in view of the results to be obtained.  I do not know whether it works out at £40 or £60 an acre.  I know, however, that it works out at a very substantial sum, far more than is commensurate with the employment given in tobacco-growing, and far more than is commensurate with any benefit that may result to the community.</P>
    <P>We have to make up our minds, whatever may have been the conditions in regard to the growing of tobacco here one or two centuries ago, that the whole position is entirely different and that it is not a suitable industry <Col N="1197" /> now.  It may have been that transport costs and the conditions of production elsewhere at one time were such that tobacco could be grown here on a competitive basis.  It is now clear from all experiments that it cannot be grown here on a competitive basis at the present time.  In fact, in order to grow tobacco what is literally the equivalent of a very substantial subsidy would have to be given and it would have to be given in perpetuity.  It would be far better, if we want cultivation and all that sort of thing, to give a smaller subsidy for other crops and you would then get more employment for the individual and more land under the plough.  If I had documents that were in my possession a few years ago I could explain the matter to the Deputy in greater detail.  My recollection is clear enough, however, to show me that the thing is a forlorn hope.  It is a matter that we should put behind us.  It is only a shade better than a proposal to grow oranges or tea.</P>

      <P>As regards sugar beet we are paying a very large subsidy but it is nothing equivalent to the tobacco subsidy.  With regard to sugar beet we could not justify that subsidy in perpetuity; you could not justify a perpetual subsidy such as is being paid for beet.  That subsidy will be paid for ten years as an experiment. There were very long periods of experiment in connection with tobacco and for a number of years it was grown on a very reasonable scale.  If there was any prospect of the industry rooting itself so as to be on an economic basis the large subsidies might be justified.  What I think is not justified is the prospect of a large subsidy for all time.</P>

      <P>The Dáil has already appointed a Committee of Inquiry into this matter, and the Report of this Committee has been already dealt <Col N="1198" /> with by the Dáil.  As far as I can see the situation has not altered at all since then.  Deputy O'Reilly has undoubtedly pursued a new line of argument in recommending this motion to-day.  If Deputy O'Reilly seriously suggests that by a modification of the Excise regulations assistance can be given to the growers I am quite prepared to examine the question whether or not some modifications in the Excise regulations could be made. Perhaps it would be possible to make some modifications in these regulations if we get down to it.  But undoubtedly there would have to be strict supervision. We cannot have the sort of loose arrangement which I thought the Deputy suggested because of the growth of one half acre.  The illicit growth of one acre of tobacco might mean that a person could get away with £300 which ought to go into the Exchequer.  It is only in details that the regulations might be capable of modification.  If Deputies want that matter examined, I am prepared to have it examined, but that is not a matter for a Committee of this kind at all.  It is a matter for one or two people interested, putting up their case, arguing their point and discussing it with some officials and the Minister responsible.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister considered what the effect would be if the incidence of the tax were shifted from the raw tobacco to the manufactured article?  If that were done I believe there would be no loss in revenue.  Would the Minister look at it from that aspect?  If the Minister looks at it from the aspect it is simply a question of where you get the tax. If you take it off the cigarettes and tobacco, but not off tobacco grown in this country, there can be little loss in the matter of revenue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">

      <P>It does not really make any difference, because if you examine the article made from Irish grown tobacco you are in the same position. You are in exactly the same position as far as I can see, and then a very great change will have to be made to which, I think, there are very great objections in this whole business of <Col N="1199" /> tobacco manufacture.  The manufacturer takes his stuff out of bond.  He pays the duty as he takes it out, and then does what he likes with it.  If you were to have an Excise supervision of the factories you would be at a great loss, and if our tobacco were not chargeable to duty you would have a great amount of private manufacture by individuals and you would have enormous losses.  For that reason I do not think the matter could be met on these lines.</P>

      <P>If there is a question of an increase of subsidy, which was what I thought was the meaning of the motion. That was what the motion seemed to me to indicate and what was in view when the matter was last before the Dáil.  I am satisfied that this motion is folly; that it is an entire waste of time and it is raising false hopes. If that is the intention, I would do what I could to kill it.  If it is another matter, if it is what was indicated in Deputy O'Reilly's speech and not what was in the motion, then I do not think that the Committee of the Dáil is the right body to consider it. I think that has to be considered by one or two interested parties who will put up their case to the Revenue Commissioners and have the matter examined by officials, after which the Minister could take a decision as between them.  The question of these regulations is mainly a matter for the Revenue people.  The only thing the Minister might decide is that a certain risk here and there might be taken by the Revenue.  It is entirely a technical matter for the officials concerned who have to safeguard the Revenue and see that these sums are not taken away.  I think that the time of the officials and the time of Deputies and the Ministers, and the time the Departments would have to give in <Col N="1200" /> making up the case and presenting the facts would all be wasted.</P>

      <P>Like the Minister, I was not prepared for this motion coming on to-night.  I think it was this morning we got the census dealing with this particular industry.  I would like to examine it so as to see the full extent of the industry at the present time.  The arguments which the Minister put forward do not convince me at all.  There are numbers of us in this House who believe that an important article of consumption such as tobacco which can be grown in this country ought to be grown.  I would like to have the possibilities examined.  The Minister has only dealt with one thing, that is the matter of the subsidy.  On this matter of the regulations that has been introduced by Deputy O'Reilly we have an open mind.  We want to see the possibilities in that industry examined.  The Minister has convinced himself on this matter.  We still remain at the stage in which the Minister was originally.  That is why we believe that this is an important article of consumption.  We know it can be grown in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want the possibilities examined and all that is asked in this particular motion is a Select Committee consisting of eleven Deputies to be named to consider the present position and the future prospects of the tobacco industry in the Saorstát.  The Minister has not indicated what his objections are to the setting up of such a Committee.  What expense does it give rise to if eleven members can be found who are prepared to examine the situation anew, and give their time to it?  Why should they not be allowed to do so?  The Minister feels now that he would do his best to kill their recommendations as he said himself.  He said he would kill this whole proposal.  But let others of us who see possibilities in it be given an opportunity to have a proper examination of it.  That is what we ask for. We ask the Minister to indicate why he objects to the Committee being set up.  He is satisfied that his own views are right but there is a large number of Deputies who are not satisfied.  If <Col N="1201" /> this motion is passed eleven Deputies will be found to give time to the consideration of this subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister ignores the application to have a Committee set up.  He has great confidence in his officials.  The officials on the Tariff Commission have been unable to make up their minds after a number of years as to whether a tariff should or should not be imposed but when the exigencies of the moment demand that the Minister for Agriculture should flood his market with cold-stored butter, the Cumann na nGaedheal Party can make the Tariff Commission make up its mind overnight and the whole country have to swallow a tariff and swallow an increase in the price of butter.  But because our Party has the audacity and impertinence to assert its right as a responsible Party in this House and to ask through its Leader and members that this question should be re-examined, the Minister for Finance has the cheek to turn them down without even giving a reason.  The Minister came here prepared to meet a case that was not made, a case for a subsidy.  That case was not made by Deputy O'Reilly. The case he made was a case for an investigation into the Excise regulations and restrictions and into these alone.  To that case the Minister made no answer.  He was not able to answer it but still he has the audacity to tell the House that he will not appoint this Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are paid for attending to the work of this country.  Out of the last eighteen months we have had over twelve months' holidays.  Now we want to do some work.  Ministers may claim that they are busy and that their officials are busy about revenue and one thing or another.  We want to find out whether means can be devised for deciding on a line of action in this matter.  We want to get an opportunity of asking if means can be devised for finding employment on the land for the people.  The County Meath has been accused of being a great ranching county.  Here is a definite opportunity of ascertaining what might be done in the way of getting employment.  If it is possible <Col N="1202" /> to do what the motion says well and good, and if it is not possible, if the Minister has such a strong case to make against it why is he not prepared to appoint a Committee and let his officials and the Revenue Commissioners come here and state their objections? Then he could have a good laugh at us later on, but he will not even allow the question to be discussed.  The fact that the matter has been discussed here before and has been turned down is no proof that it will not be again under discussion, and it may eventuate sometime in something being done. After all, proposals that have any strength in them in regard to economic matters have to come up again and again before they are finally adopted. The Minister chooses to dismiss the whole thing because he, as treasurer, forsooth, says that there will be a tremendous loss.  That question has not been discussed here.  The sole question with which Deputy O'Reilly has dealt is that relating to the Excise regulations.  The late Sir Nugent Everard gave a short summary of these regulations in the evidence which he submitted to the Committee on home-grown tobacco which sat under the chairmanship of Deputy Esmonde and reported in 1926.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Excise regulations require the grower to give written notice to the proper revenue officer 24 hours before any important operation can be commenced; entries must be made on official forms and permits obtained for removals, etc., under heavy penalties.</P>
    <P>Inspections at intervals, not exceeding 28 days, must be made by the officer of the growing crop, and after harvesting at least once a week until removal.</P>
    <P>Supervisors also must occasionally visit every farm, and once a fortnight, when the tobacco is being cured; they must also attend at the destruction of tobacco scrap used in other countries for the extraction of nicotine, the most valuable of all agricultural products.  Collectors must see that supervisors report <Col N="1203" /> regularly on the progress of the experiments.</P>
    <P>The curing of tobacco is also made subject to rules which make it almost impossible to produce the best results, as they prohibit processes used in every other country.</P>
    <P>All these interferences are most harassing to growers and unknown in other countries, where the growing is entirely unrestricted and supervision confined to the manufacturer.</P>
    <P>The Minister wants to get away from the whole question of these restrictions which was not answered when put up at the Committee.  Other members have personal knowledge of the matter but it seems to me that the arguments put up against these restrictions and regulations were not answered because generally these officials who come before committees have to carry out the policy which is in force at the moment and in the long run it is a question for the Government whether they will make the necessary alterations in their policy to enable the growers to do things with more ease.  The officials had no answer to put up in regard to these regulations.  All they could say was: &ldquo;The restrictions are not as bad as you say and can be carried out by an ordinary person.&rdquo;  The Committee were not convinced on that point and recommended the development of the tobacco industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Reilly is not asking for a remission of duty or for a subsidy.  He asks that a Committee be set up which can go into the question once more, hear what the growers have to say on the one side and the Revenue Commissioners on the other.  Having cognisance of the importance of the industry and the amount of employment which it could give, and also as part of their duty as representatives of the people and the taxpayers, Deputies from all Parties in the House should be afforded an opportunity to see whether any means could be found, while safeguarding the revenue, to make it possible for growers to do this work, which Deputy O'Reilly says can be and is being done with very small capital and which gives more employment than any other crop.  I simply want to say <Col N="1204" /> that we as a Party, when we ask that a committee of this kind be set up, are, at least, entitled to more courtesy than the Minister has shown.  The Minister practically says to Deputy O'Reilly, &ldquo;When you come here you have no right to speak but if you come to the back door of the Ministry of Finance, go down on your knees to my officials and tell them what you want, it will be all right.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Reilly does not agree.  He is not going to the back door of the Ministry.  He is a Deputy who represents a constituency which is very much interested in this matter and he has the support of Deputies in this Party and in other Parties here when he asks for a re-examination of the question on the strictly limited basis of seeing whether anything effective could be done to develop the industry by abolishing, altering or modifying to a considerable extent the restrictions about which growers complain.  They say that these restrictions do not exist in other countries and that they are so troublesome that they make it impossible to engage in an industry which should be one of the most profitable and remunerative industries in the country.</P>

      <P>Deputy Derrig has remarked that the Minister for Finance has been discourteous, but the Deputy knows nothing of the capacity for discourtesy in this matter so far as the Minister for Finance is concerned. On previous occasions his denunciations of those who wished to encourage the tobacco industry have been far more bitter than they have been to-day. He seems to be almost fanatical on this question.  I have heard many debates on this subject in the Dáil and elsewhere.  I remember the speeches that were made twenty years ago by the Irish Parliamentary Party in the British House of Commons.  Many committees have been set up to deal with the matter.  A committee was set up over twenty years ago by the British, and we must admit that the British Government was far more generous in encouraging tobacco-growing in this country than our own Government has been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1205" /> I presume, however, that the British Government have more money to spend on such matters than we have.  In 1923 the Agricultural Committee which was set up went thoroughly into the matter, and a large number of witnesses were summoned before it. Its report is very similar in many respects to that of the Select Committee of 1925.  Owing to the terms of reference of that Committee it had to report back before the end of the financial year, and had only about one month to collect whatever evidence it could.  It only recommended changes in so far as they affected the excise duties.  No other form of encouragement was possible for them to suggest. Deputy Derrig mentioned certain evidence given by Sir Nugent Everard, and said that his statements had not been answered.  We had nothing to do with such statements so far as regulations were concerned, because they did not come within our terms of reference. The Minister has always held the view, a view which, in my opinion, is wrong, that remission of excise duties is a subsidy.  I think that that is quite wrong.  Most of the evidence which we received was in favour of a subsidy for the growing of tobacco.  We were not in a position to deal with that.</P>
    <P>At present a man who wants to grow tobacco is taxed by the Government for daring to do so.  If his tax is remitted, the Government says that he is receiving a subsidy.  The question of regulation is one of great difficulty so long as the tobacco leaf is subject to any form of excise duty. Although Sir Nugent Everard was against the regulations, a very large number of other witnesses, who had been engaged in growing tobacco, said that they had no complaints regarding them and the manner in which they were carried out.  I am aware that in certain countries in Eastern Europe where tobacco is grown extensively, the regulations are far stricter than those governing the manufacture of opium and other drugs.  I think that this motion comes too late.  The only possibility that I can see of a revival of tobacco growing is the coming together of a substantial number of persons who are prepared to put up <Col N="1206" /> capital on certain conditions to develop the industry.  In that event the House would be in a far more favourable mood to consider their claims.</P>
    <P>Of course past experience, unfortunately, would tempt very few persons to put capital into the industry.  We all know that the late Sir Nugent Everard practically ruined himself, purely from patriotic motives, in attempting to establish the industry in Meath.  To me it seems that a Committee of Deputies set up to-day would be in exactly the same position as the Agricultural Committee and the Select Committee of 1925.  It would be composed mainly of persons who are not acquainted with the industry on its technical side.  It would receive the same information and the same evidence from the same witnesses, who are not very numerous in this country.  In fact a number of witnesses who attended the previous Committee are, I regret to say, dead. This industry has been conducted for the past twenty years in Ireland on an amateurish basis.  It was conducted mainly by amateurs.  There were practically no experts with experience of tobacco growing in other countries to help to make it a financial success in Ireland.  It has been largely a sentimental, patriotic business.  A certain number of country gentlemen like the late Sir Nugent Everard and the late Lord Dunraven in a moment of patriotic enthusiasm started this industry in order to give employment on their estates.  It has not been a success in spite of the fact that the British Government gave it a substantial subsidy. First of all they gave a subsidy of £50 per acre and then they gave a subsidy on the weight.  In any case the whole industry was run on an amateurish sentimental basis, and unless it can be inaugurated on a purely business basis I do not think that it is much use setting up a Committee of Deputies who are not experts on the industry to go into the matter any further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Esmonde has stated, this is not a new question.  In fact it is about 30 or 40 years old.  In the days of the Irish Parliamentary Party, Committees were set up to consider the possibility of tobacco growing <Col N="1207" /> in Ireland and to take evidence on the subject.  Successive British Governments took up the matter of tobacco growing in Ireland for reasons of their own.  They thought it good business to try to humour the sentiments of certain people in the country and they spent a good deal of money on it.  Not only have there been five or six Committees with a vast accumulation of evidence on this question, but rather exhaustive experiments have been carried out at considerable expense and they all proved a failure.  These experiments were started before the war, went on during the war and were continued after the war.  Here you have an industry which was started years ago, and Committees set up in connection with it making annual reports and hearing exhaustive evidence; you have had experiments entered into pre-war, continued during the war and carried on after the war, and most of the results published in one form or another, and at the end of it all the experiments are considered by the Government of the day to be a failure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is practically admitted that this industry cannot be carried on unless a very considerable subsidy of one kind or another is given to keep it going.  At this stage we ought to know at least some of the facts; they should be common cases with all parties.  If Fianna Fáil Deputies do not know a considerable amount of the elementary facts in connection with the industry, it is their own fault. They are all published.  We ought to discuss this question as people who have some consideration for all the relevant factors in a case like this. One of these is that the industry cannot be carried on in this country without a big subsidy.  An attempt has been made to draw a distinction between a direct subsidy and a remission of taxation.  Of course, a remission of taxation is an indirect subsidy. If everybody engaged in the business were allowed a remission of taxation, wherever it comes from, or if special exemptions were given to a tobacco grower in one area, then that man is subsidised as against his opponents. The country is losing the amount of revenue which would ordinarily be paid <Col N="1208" /> on that tobacco, so that where there is a remission of taxation in respect of one grower over another it is a subsidy.  The Government is receiving loss revenue and the tobacco grower is receiving preferential treatment as against his opponents, as he has not the same charges to pay.  We ought not, therefore, to make any distinction between a direct subsidy and a remission of taxation.</P>
    <P>It is said that it takes about £300 an acre to make tobacco-growing pay. Yet in the month of December, in the year of grace, 1930, the Fianna Fáil Party come forward with an appeal for further consideration for the industry. Deputy Derrig comes back here after a six months' holiday with a large amount of unexpended energy and wishes to expend it in setting up a committee to investigate the possibilities of tobacco-growing in this country.</P>

      <P>Here in the year of grace, 1930, after the Irish Party had expended all their energies on the question, after the British Government, in order to do a good turn which did not cost them much, being a rich Government, had financed rather elaborate experiments in regard to tobacco-growing, after numerous Commissions had been set up to inquire into it, Deputy Derrig tells us that he has been eating his head off in Kilkenny during the holidays, and he comes back to the Dáil and says: &ldquo;I consider that tobacco-growing is a right thing to investigate, and I ask that a Committee be set up to consider it.&rdquo;  Really the Deputy attempts to put us in a wrong position.  We as a Government are satisfied that there is no case for tobacco-growing in this country. We may be wrong, but there is one thing that a Government ought to do, and that is to come to a decision.</P>

      <Col N="1209" /> It cannot be said by any Deputy on the opposite benches that we have come to a decision without knowing the facts, without having information.

There have been commissions set up to inquire into the matter and their reports have been published.  There have been no back-door methods and asking civil servants to give information.  Most of the information is available in public form and everybody can get it.  As I say, we certainly have more information on this question than on most experimental matters.  We have come to a decision.  It is our duty to come to a decision.  It is the duty of a Government to come to a decision and back that decision in the Dáil and ask a majority of the Dáil to agree with them.  It is only in that way you can get business done.  There is an extraordinary point of view that a Government is being discourteous if it does not back the policy of the opposite side.  That is entirely wrong.</P>

      <P>That may be.  For instance, the Deputy does not agree with me.  The Deputy has his rights and can exercise them.  He can speak and persuade other people to take his point of view.  But we have a perfect right to put this point of view: that in the light of the information received we have come to the conclusion that tobacco growing is futile, and in that state of affairs we are not prepared to waste the time of the Dáil, even for the sake of finding an outlet for Deputy Derrig's unexpended energy, by setting up a committee to consider the question of tobacco growing.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1210" /> It seems to me that Deputies do not understand democratic institutions.  I find that not only in reference to this matter, but to many other matters. Deputy de Valera has often expressed it.  We take a responsibility before the country and in the Dáil for our policy.  That is the only way we can get work done.  We do not hedge. When we come to the conclusion that a certain policy is right, we ask the Dáil to put it into operation, and we only remain the Government as long as the Dáil gives us its confidence and puts it into operation.</P>

You will never get any results if you are hedging on any question.  There is nothing like trying an experiment and standing or falling by the results.  If you are wrong go, and do not make a row about it; if you are right, stick to your policy.  That is our line.  We believe that there is no future for tobacco growing in this country.  There can be no question about it.</P>

Experiments have demonstrated, at least to us and, I think, to everybody who has taken the trouble to read the published evidence, that it would take an enormous subsidy to make tobacco growing a possibility in this country.  We believe that we can spend that money in other directions in a better way or leave it in the taxpayers' pocket and that he can spend it better.  Hence we are not prepared, after we have seen this experiment through to its bitter end, after the whole thing has been wound up and all the facts revealed, to stultify ourselves by pretending to the country that we are beginning this futility all over again.  Hence we ask the Dáil to defeat this motion.</P>

As I heard him speaking about the rapidity, or at least the manner in which the Government came to its decisions, and the tenacity with which it adhered to them, I was wondering if he would find that this question of tobacco growing offered to him less freedom of manoeuvring, say, than the butter churn did, because we heard the Minister expressing a policy in regard to butter a few months ago and later coming into the Dáil and supporting a radically different one. No doubt in the meantime he had been listening to enthusiasts like Deputy Derrig, Deputy Ryan, and others putting forward their point of view and their arguments in support of a butter tariff which compelled the Minister radically to change his mind in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In raising this question I want, in the first place, to make it perfectly clear that I do so in no spirit of hostility to the Imperial Tobacco Company.  I have been a smoker of their products for a great number of years, and when they decided to jump the tariff wall, and to come into this country, giving very much-needed employment and acting as a stimulus to trade and commercial life in this country, I, together with the great majority of the people, smokers and non-smokers, welcomed their advent.  I would still continue to welcome their presence in our midst if they did not ape the tactics of the cuckoo in the thrush's nest and attempt to throw overboard the prior owners of the nest who had really a prior claim on the surroundings.  In reply to my question to-day I note that the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that &ldquo;in the event of facts being furnished to me indicating that any practice is being followed in the nature of an undue or unwarranted restraint of trade I will have them examined to see what action is open to me.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of that particular statement, I want to endeavour to satisfy the Minister that there is something in the nature of an undue or unwarranted attempt to restrain trade. The facts, briefly, are as follows: The Imperial Tobacco Company came into this country as a result of the tariff. They had a certain bonus arrangement with traders.  That bonus arrangement laid it down that the company's goods should be displayed in a prominent and conspicuous manner by the shopkeepers, and that at least one-half of the slot machines would be retained for the sale of their particular products.  There was nothing else very specific in the restrictions placed on the retailers.  That was read by most tobacconists as implying that at least one-half of the window and shop space would be devoted to the products of the Imperial Tobacco Company, and the remaining half of the window or shop <Col N="1213" /> space could be devoted to the products of any other firm.</P>
    <P>We have in this country an old-established Irish firm selling tobacco and cigarettes, Carroll's of Dundalk. Until some time last summer, in the cigarette market at least, Carroll's were not a very serious rival to the Imperial Tobacco Company.  But somewhere about the summer of 1929 they endeavoured to extend their market in this country for cigarettes, and they decided upon a scheme of gifts for coupons.  Each packet of cigarettes would contain a coupon, and fifty and a hundred of these coupons were to purchase certain gifts and so on.  This scheme was put into operation somewhere about December, 1929.  The first point is that there was nothing particularly novel about that type of pushing sales.  Tea people, cocoa people, butter people, sweet people, and a number of other trading concerns adopted the same system. The first move made by the Imperial Tobacco Company was in November of this year, when a circular was sent out to the retail tobacconists containing the following paragraph: &ldquo;My directors regard action which tends to push or advertise this form of trading as being against the best interests of trade as a whole, and they wish it to be understood that they consider gift displays in windows and show-cases as contrary to the spirit of the bonus scheme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As I said, in the bonus scheme the only restriction placed on the trader was that at least half of the slot machines would be reserved for the Imperial Tobacco Company's products and that their goods and advertisements would be placed in a conspicuous place.  There was no further restriction and no attempt whatever on the part of the retailers of this country to depart either from the letter or the spirit of the particular agreement they signed.  Yet on the 1st of November this particular circular was served upon all traders.  I have here an amount of correspondence which I shall submit to the House and the Minister without mentioning the names of those to whom letters were addressed, for the simple reason that I have not got permission <Col N="1214" /> from those people to use their names in this particular debate.</P>
    <P>The next step in this particular attempt to force Carroll's tobacco and cigarettes off the Irish market was a visit by the inspectors of the Imperial Tobacco Company to various retail shops in Dublin.  In one of these shops there was no display of gifts but there was a very prominent display of &ldquo;Sweet Afton&rdquo; cigarettes. The inspector ordered the tobacconist to remove them from the window. The tobacconist offered to give three of the four shelves to Imperial Tobacco products and to reserve the fourth to Carroll's cigarettes.  The reply of the inspector to that particular request was that he would have none of Carroll's stuff displayed in the window.  The next thing was that that particular attempt to drive Carroll's products out of the shop windows extended to the country and the same attempt was made both through correspondence and the inspectors to intimidate the retailers from stocking Carroll's goods.  Now the Imperial Tobacco Company has really won the premier position in the cigarette market, chiefly due to the excellent cigarettes they supply and to a great extent to the very generous terms they give to agents.  They have won such a position that it would be nearly impossible for any retail tobacconist to carry on if the supply of the Imperial Tobacco products were denied him.  The very fact of accepting that as being a reasonable statement of the position and to follow up that by a threat to refuse to give him the bonus would be tantamount to dictating absolutely to that particular retailer not to handle Carroll's goods any more.  If there is very general evidence, and I think there will be, from practically every constituency that there was an attempt to dictate to retailers as to what other goods they should keep in their windows, then I submit to the Minister that that is certainly undue and unwarranted restraint upon trade.</P>
    <P>Now the position with regard to the sale of the different cigarettes is this: With an Imperial Tobacco Company packet of twenty cigarettes you get a picture and a halfpenny or a box of <Col N="1215" /> matches.  By the accumulation of so many of these halfpence you can buy anything that a particular number of halfpence will buy.  Carrolls give a coupon and by collecting so many of these you can buy certain goods.  The difference is this, from the Irish point of view, that with the number of halfpence you can buy any goods you like but with Carroll's coupons you can only buy a particular set of goods stocked by a particular department.  Carrolls have made every endeavour to ensure that the goods supplied under their gift system are of Irish manufacture. Therefore they are not only stimulating and pressing their own particular commodities but they are also of immense benefit to other Irish industries.</P>
    <P>Nobody, I think, will deny the fact that they are not big enough, and never will be big enough, to be a serious rival to the Imperial Tobacco Company and that this attempt by a huge combine more or less to push out of trade a smaller Irish factory is certainly most undesirable, and every effort should be made by an Irish Government to protect an existing Irish concern.  There is plenty of room in this country for the carrying on side by side of both, and the mere extension of Carroll's trade is not going seriously to jeopardise the position of the Imperial Tobacco Company.  I would like the Minister, therefore, through his Department, to make every possible effort by negotiation to try to get the Imperial Tobacco Company to withdraw this persistent attack on Carroll's products.  It would be much better that the question should be settled in this way than that an outraged sense of fair play should make the public take it into its own hands and possibly launch a boycott against certain products, which would only result in injury to certain industries which are giving a considerable amount of much-needed employment in our midst, and possibly bring about a situation where employment might not be so great as it is at the present moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering this question, the Minister should bear in mind that the Irish tobacco company which <Col N="1216" /> has been threatened by the imperial Tobacco Co. pays its income tax in this country, that its profits are spent in this country, and that every workman engaged in its factory is a native of Ireland.  We hope that the Minister will take up a strong attitude against this big monopoly concern, which comes inside the tariff barrier here and uses its position to crush a firm which is turning out a better article than they are turning out.  The Carroll firm which has incurred the wrath of the Imperial Tobacco Co. is turning out a good article and getting a good sale for it.  The article is so good that it has penetrated the British market&mdash; the home of the Imperial Tobacco Co. It is up to the Minister to support that firm or any other Irish firm placed in a similar position.  It is impossible for a small Irish manufacturer with £100,000 or £200,000 capital, or whatever the capital may be, to compete on trade terms over a number of years with a huge firm like the Imperial Tobacco Co., backed by several millions of capital.  When dealing with questions of tariffs here, we have often advocated that big foreign firms coming in here should be controlled in some way, so that their coming in would not sound the death-knell of native factories.  The Imperial Tobacco Co. pays no income tax in this country.  A large number of its highly-paid employees are Englishmen, and the only good result that has accrued from its coming in here has been the employment of a few lowly-paid workers in this country.  An Irish Government should certainly back up the Irish firm against a foreign firm such as that, particularly when the product of the Irish firm is every bit as good as that of the other. I hope the Irish people as a whole will resent the attempt&mdash;I am sure it is an illegal attempt if it were properly looked into&mdash;of this big foreign monopoly to crush a small rival here.  If the law books were dug up, I think it would be found that there is some law which could be invoked against the Imperial Tobacco Co. in its attempt to crush its rivals by the means which it has adopted.  I do not think there can be any law which would support the withdrawal of supplies by the Imperial <Col N="1217" /> Tobacco Co. from people to whom it has been giving supplies up to now. I hope that the Minister will say, if there is no such law, that he will bring in a Bill and make such law operative here before long.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This question, when raised to-day, received, a certain reply from me.  That reply was to the effect that in the event of facts being furnished to me indicating that any practice was being followed in the nature of an undue or unwarranted restraint of trade, I would have them examined to see what action was open to me.  I answered in that form because this matter, which was brought to my attention this morning, is only the Irish side of a war which is being waged in England at the moment, where the Imperial Tobacco Company have taken exactly the same action against other firms which have adopted the same gift scheme.  They have circularised traders who stock their goods and have more or less threatened the withdrawal of their bonus scheme&mdash;not the withdrawal of supplies&mdash;if these practices are persisted in.  In England, they have got, strangely enough, the support of a body called the National Chamber of Trade, which issued a statement in October of this year supporting the war which had been declared by the Imperial Tobacco Company, on the grounds that it was a bad system to have a trade done in small articles which are given away as gifts arising out of tobacco sales.  The situation here in that respect is entirely different, as Deputy O'Higgins has pointed out, because in this country the firm which has most definitely gone in for these gifts arising out of sales has the support, I understand, of Irish trading concerns generally behind it, in so far as they insist that any gifts given to people in respect of the collection of these coupons are, so far as they can be procured, Irish goods. They have a host of Irish manufacturers besieging them to have their goods put on the gift list.  The situation is, therefore, to some extent different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point to which I referred myself, as to whether the matter amounted to <Col N="1218" /> an undue or unwarranted restraint of trade, is not free from doubt in England. As a matter of fact, a Committee was established about two or three months ago there to inquire into certain trade practices, this obviously being one of the things aimed at.  A group of other matters was taken into the terms of reference but the Committee are to inquire as to whether there is such an undue interference with trade as would lead to the application of certain laws against the people practising in that particular way and to make recommendations as to how these practices should, in the best interests of the trade of the country, be met.  I cannot say that anything that has come before me yet&mdash;I have very little official information&mdash;amounts to an undue or unwarranted restraint of trade under the law preventing &ldquo;restraint of trade,&rdquo; as it is called.  I cannot see at the moment that I have either sufficient evidence before me to make a case or that even such evidence as I have before me by rumour gives me sufficient cause to get the law invoked against the Imperial Tobacco Company.  I have hopes that what Deputy O'Higgins says will turn out to be the case&mdash;that a certain amount of reason will prevail and that we will get the position cleared of the difficulties that have arisen.  As soon as I got the Press reports, a certain amount of Departmental investigation took place.  Since I got certain information given me, we have kept a pretty close eye on the situation. Although we find a certain reluctance on the part of traders to come forward and put in our hands definite and detailed evidence, I am not without hope that we shall get definite and detailed evidence.  We promise them our fullest support in standing out against this attempt of the Imperial Tobacco Company to beat down their rivals in this way and, if it became necessary, we should have to consider the introduction of legislation to deal with attempts of that kind in this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins spoke of letters which he has in his possession but which he cannot use because they are <Col N="1219" /> associated with the names of certain people.  If he can get permission to use them in the sense of putting them before me, not as an individual, but acting as Minister for Industry and Commerce, I shall be pleased to see what use we can make of these and see if any strong action can be taken in the matter.</P>
    <P>I should not like to allow this matter to close without adverting to one point made by Deputy Aiken.  He spoke of the native producer&mdash;Carrolls.  Of course, other firms are interested, but referring to Carrolls he spoke of the inability of a native manufacturer with small reserves to stand up against a big concern.  I should like to say that, in investigations we have from time to time to make as to how trading concerns in this country are doing, nothing has given us greater pleasure than to see the extent of the improvement in the business of that firm.  It can hardly be said that it is a small firm likely to be crushed easily when sales of a particular <Col N="1220" /> type of popular cigarette which had risen somewhere to the region of a quarter million per month a year ago have now got to the four million mark per month.  That indicates a very big increase in the production of that popular brand of cigarette, and it is a very good sign that they have strength in the way of capital reserves, advertising genius and business capacity, behind them.  It cannot be taken that they will be beaten by fair means and we shall see that they will not be beaten by unfair means.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggested that this firm would not be able to stand this opposition over a number of years.  I am sure the Minister will agree with me that if the Imperial Tobacco Company can prevent retailers displaying Carroll's cigarettes in the usual way Carroll's trade will be adversely affected and that figure of 4,000,000 will be reduced very much in a short time.</P>

It is not practicable to lay down any general rules to govern the various cases that arise.</P>
      <P>It has not been the practice to grant such applications without sufficient cause.</P>
      <P>As a matter of general policy, I do not think that I should be justified in making public the reasons given by the parents of the children when a transfer is asked for.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether the school carried on in a single room in Tullamore by Miss Costello and her sister has been certified by him as a suitable school for the purpose of the School Attendance Act, 1926, and, if so, will he state what qualifications do the teachers in this school hold for giving instruction in Irish; whether the instruction in Irish is such as is laid down in the Programme of the National Programme Conference which has been adopted by the Minister for use in all schools recognised by him; and on how many occasions during the past two years have Inspectors of his Department visited this school in order to satisfy the Minister that suitable instruction, including instruction in Irish, is being given in this school.</P>

      <P>The Misses Costello conduct a school in Tullamore in which elementary and secondary education is given.  In this school there are three rooms.  These teachers are university graduates and registered secondary teachers.  A part of the school has been conducted for the past 31 years as a secondary school and is recognised as such.  For elementary education the school has been certified as a suitable school under Section 5 of the School Attendance Act, 1926.  The elementary section of the school was visited once during the past two years by an inspector of my Department. The secondary section has been inspected <Col N="1075" /> under the same conditions as other secondary schools.  I am satisfied that there is no adequate reason to refuse certification.  The school&mdash;on its primary side&mdash;is not a State-aided school and the regulations in regard to the adoption of the programme of the National Programme Conference do not apply in the same way as in the case of national schools.  In fact, instruction is given in Irish in both the elementary and the secondary sections of the school.</P>

      <P>My Department sanctioned reconstruction works rendered necessary as a result of the amalgamation of the Dromina Boys' and Girls' Schools.</P>
      <P>These works have been carried out. Their cost was £14 2s. 6d., and the Manager applied for a grant of two-thirds of that sum.  The grant has now been made.</P>
      <P>Three months have elapsed since the application for the grant was received. The delay was due in part to the very heavy demand on the officers dealing with matters of this nature in my Department, and in part to the necessity for having the works approved by the Commissioners of Public Works before payment could be made.</P>
