      <P>asked the Minister for Finance when he proposes to pay the balances due to subscribers to (a) the First National Loan of the Republic of Ireland, (b) the Second External Loan of the Republic of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the First and Second External Loans floated in the United States.  I can give no indication of any date in this matter, inasmuch as the Receivers appointed by the American Courts have not yet, so far as I am aware, completed their task, and as the Register and other documents and records relating to the Loan are under the control of the American Courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the moneys have been repaid, that the balance has been distributed, and if he wishes to avail of the live addresses the Receivers have, steps should be taken immediately to see about the repayment of the balance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the exact position that has been reached, but in any case until the documents and all records have been returned to us we cannot take any steps.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he can state the total amount refunded to date to subscribers towards the Dáil Loan (Internal), 1919-20, in the old Parliamentary Constituency of South Sligo <Col N="1222" /> and what amount remains to be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>As was explained to the Deputy in reply to a question which he asked on the 17th April, 1929, the form in which the records of my Department are kept is such that the preparation of the information he desires would entail an amount of labour which would not, in my opinion, be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankJCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister can state how much of this money remains to be repaid in South Sligo?</P>

      <P>Can the Minister give any indication as to when he hopes to be in a position to complete the repayment of this money to subscribers in South Sligo?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not tell the Deputy by what date absolutely all the money will have been repaid but within a few months very little will remain to be repaid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister indicate roughly the amount?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not asked for the amount for the whole country and I have not the figures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankJCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that some members of his Party have already stated publicly in South Sligo that this money was to be repaid as long ago as last October.  In view of these statements, I think the Minister should be in a position to-day to give some information as to when the subscribers will receive payment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankJCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether his attention has been directed to the legal proceedings instituted last April by certain subscribers to the Dáil Loan (Internal), 1919-1920, against the person who acted as treasurer for this loan in the old Parliamentary constituency of South Sligo, for the recovery of a sum of £40 subscribed by them, through him, and whether, in view of the court decision <Col N="1223" /> in the case, he is now prepared to refund to these persons the money which was subscribed by them in good faith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen a Press report of the proceedings to which the Deputy refers.  The decision of the court does not afford any reason for modifying the decision at which I had already arrived on the claims of the persons concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankJCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that these moneys were subscribed to the Dáil Loan in good faith. Does he consider it fair treatment that his Department should now refuse to pay back to the subscribers the money which they contributed to this Loan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a good many factors in this case.  For instance, there is no indication as to when the money was subscribed.  It was not lodged until a considerable time after the Loan was closed and if Dr. O'Harte had forwarded it to Dublin it would be credited to the Self-determination Fund at the date at which it was lodged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankJCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister hold out any hope that the persons to whom the question relates who subscribed to this Loan will receive a return of the money subscribed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardDoyle" hpid="Mr. E. Doyle Mr. E. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he can state what drainage schemes are in contemplation in County Kilkenny, and whether any progress has been made with such schemes; and, if not, can he state whether, in view of the distress that prevails in the Kilkenny rural districts, due to agricultural depression, he will undertake to expedite drainage works with a view to relieving unemployment in such districts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Bourke) James A Burke">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Bourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Of seven petitions under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, transmitted to the Commissioners of Public Works from County Kilkenny, all except two have been rejected.  The two remaining proposals are the Sugarstown and Kilfane and the River Goul, which extends into County Tipperary (South Riding).</P>
      <P>The preliminaries in the Sugarstown and Kilfane scheme are well advanced. A detailed drainage scheme has been prepared and submitted to the votes of the occupiers of affected lands, and a public inquiry in respect of objections to the scheme was held recently.  The Commissioners are now awaiting their investigator's report, on consideration of which it will be decided whether or not the scheme should proceed.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners have had the River Goul proposal inspected by an engineer and a land valuer, and as a result of their reports have submitted the case to the County Councils of Kilkenny and Tipperary (South Riding) for free grants of 14-? per cent. and 1-? per cent. respectively of the total cost of the scheme&mdash;estimated at £8,490.  The Minister for Finance has agreed to contribute 48-? per cent. of the cost.</P>
      <P>Drainage works are from their nature unsuitable for execution in winter, and there is no prospect of any actual works being carried out in either of these districts for a considerable time, but the Commissioners' investigations will be proceeded with as expeditiously as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that <Col N="1225" /> serious damage is being caused as a result of the flooding of a large area of land in the vicinity of Bunduff, parish of Ahamblish, Co. Sligo; and whether he will authorise the allocation of a sufficient sum from the Relief of Distress Grant to have these lands properly drained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankJCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that serious damage is being caused by the overflowing of the River Duff, on the borders of Sligo and Leitrim; and whether he proposes to allocate a grant to enable the drainage of that river to be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>No petition has been received for works in either of these areas under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, and no proposal has been received by the Commissioners of Public Works for the execution of works under a Relief Grant; but any proposal which may be received will be duly considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankJCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>If a petition is forwarded to the Parliamentary Secretary in connection with the drainage of the lands in the vicinity of Bunduff will he undertake to see that sufficient funds are allocated to carry out the drainage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say that.  As a matter of fact, it is very unlikely that we will be able to do anything in the way of drainage on this relief grant at all because, as I have already stated, the operations do not lend themselves to carrying out in the winter time except in very unusual circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankJCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that in the case of Bunduff a considerable sum was spent by the Land Commission for electioneering purposes in this place some years ago and that no real improvement was effected?  I think he should consider the matter now in view of the fact that there is £300,000 available and see that a sufficient grant is allocated and that the work is placed in competent hands.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that, owing to the delay in introducing the Bill dealing with the Report of the Town <Col N="1226" /> Tenants Commission, tenants whose leases have expired are being victimised by landlords forestalling any benefits which may accrue to such tenants from the passing into law of such legislation; and if he will state whether he will take action to prevent such mulcting of tenants or to prevent a stay of contemplated proceedings, or the carrying out of ejectments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankJCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the attention of the Minister been called to the victimisation of the Barry family in Sligo; and, if so, will he undertake to see that some action is taken to prevent Mr. Andrew Barry and his family from being evicted from the houses built by his grandfather and father?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention was called about a fortnight ago to the particular case to which the Deputy refers by some inhabitants of the town of Sligo.  As far as I know the facts of the case, the gentleman in question can avail himself of the existing town tenants legislation, so far as the licensed premises are concerned. As far as the town park is concerned, I do not see that any legislation can help him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinnsias O Fathaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state the reason for the delay in issuing diplomas to teachers under Rule 172a, and whether such diplomas could be issued within six months of the completion of the two years' probation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Minister for Education (Professor O'Sullivan) John Marcus O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Professor O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>To warrant the award of a training diploma under Rule 172a, a teacher who has undergone a course of training must have served continuously for two years, on probation, in a capacity recognised or approved by my Department, and the reports on his work in respect of these years must he satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To arrive at a decision in each case, <Col N="1227" /> my Department must have reports from the inspectors during the period of probation, and a report as soon as possible after the close of that period. In some cases, an inspector may not be in a position to furnish the latter report for some little time after the close of the probationary period owing to the demands of his other duties.</P>
    <P>In practice, however, there are very few cases in which diplomas have not been awarded where teachers have served for more than six months beyond the period of probation, and no unfavourable report has been received on their work during that period.</P>
    <P>Every effort is made by my Department to expedite the award of diplomas in all cases where two years' continuous satisfactory service has been given, and I should be glad if the Deputy would supply me with particulars of any cases which he has in mind to enable me to have them investigated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state whether he will consider framing a scheme to assist in the purchase of school books for necessitous poor children attending primary schools by the utilisation of a portion of the money devoted to County Council Scholarships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>County and Borough Councils are empowered by Section 10 (2) of the Irish Universities Act, 1908, to devote a sum not exceeding the produce of a penny rate to the provision of scholarships for <Col N="1228" /> certain classes of students attending a university; and under Section 17 (1) of the Local Government Act, 1923, councils are empowered to devote a similar sum to the provision of scholarships for students tenable in secondary schools and vocational schools.  The schemes under which both these classes of scholarships are awarded are framed by the responsible councils and not by me.  Under the statutory enactments which authorise the provision of these scholarships, there is no legal authority to divert part of the moneys collected therefor to any other purpose such as that mentioned in the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWhite" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that scholarships in some instances are awarded to boys and girls who do not need them and who are the sons and daughters of well-to-do people? Could not a scheme be framed by which portion of the money spent on scholarships would go in the direction indicated in the question&mdash;for the purchase of school books for necessitous children?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EugeneDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the Minister will not be able to answer this question off-hand: I should like to know the amount of free money distributed to people in the district referred to by Deputy White, what advantage has been taken of it and what advantage the State is getting out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has to some extent the gifts of a seer. I cannot answer that question off-hand. He was quite right in supposing that I would not be able to do so. I told Deputy White already that I have no power whatsoever to divert this money or to suggest that it be diverted in the direction he indicates. As regards the first portion of the supplementary question, I have no information of the type he refers to. Perhaps he would supply me with that information and I could take the matter up with the county council. Generally speaking, we have to leave the valuation of means to a large extent in the hands of the local authoritities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister considered the desirability of standardising <Col N="1229" /> school books so that they would be of some use to a family?  The present system is to change readers after three or four months.  The books, too, are bound in light covers, and they are of no advantage to poor families.  The only advantage goes to the people who issue these books or who get money for printing them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This question has been raised several times, and I indicated within the last three weeks that at present I cannot see my way to introduce legislation of the type indicated.  I am quite aware that there is undoubtedly a charge on the poor, as there is in connection with various other matters, but I did not feel that I was in a position to put on the funds of the State the very considerable expense that would be involved in any scheme of this kind which would have to apply not merely to Donegal but to the whole country.</P>

      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is necessary for the reason that it would have been impossible to have introduced a Vote for this money at the time that last year's Estimates were under consideration, because at that time the Vocational Education Act was not through the Oireachtas. In reality, this Supplementary Estimate is in consequence of the passing of that Act.  It provides the money for the training of the additional teachers to be engaged in vocational schools.  The additional teachers are required for the three classes of subjects mentioned, (1) woodwork and building instruction, (2) metal work and motor car engineering, and (3) domestic economy.  It is not proposed to limit the training grant in the next twelve months to these three classes because we expect to be able to take on two additional classes, namely, 40 teachers, or aspiring teachers, in scientific and commercial subjects, and also a special course for 40 Irish teachers.  As these particular courses are not to commence until after April, it is thought that next year's estimate will be able to cover them, but as regards the three classes of subjects mentioned we need a vote at once. The numbers will be: for woodwork and building instruction, 20 teachers; for metal work and motor car engineering, 16, and for domestic economy, 20.  A special course is being provided for these.  If the money is voted, it will start in the month of January.</P>
      <P>Roughly speaking, the cost of these three courses will be £8,090, of which £1,840 is due to be paid before the end of the financial year.  Hence the necessity for moving for the sum mentioned in the Supplementary Estimate. A certain number of places are reserved for candidates with a good knowledge of Irish.  If there are not a sufficient number of candidates with the necessary qualifications to fill the reserved places and with, in addition, the necessary qualifications in Irish, these reserved places will be passed on to the unreserved list.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not suppose there will be any opposition to this Vote. <Col N="1242" /> I think, however, it is a pity that the training of these teachers was not undertaken at least a year in advance. A request to that effect was made in the Dáil on more than one occasion. We recognise that the putting into operation of this vocational scheme will naturally be slow and that the foundations must be properly laid. The training of the teachers is, of course, a very necessary and essential part of that work.  In this connection would the Minister give us some information with reference to the buildings and the pound for pound suggestion that was made&mdash;to the promise that was made by the Minister in the course of the debate on the Vocational Education Bill when it was going through?  In Vol. 34, Col. 1767, of the Dáil Debates, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The loans will be on the security of the fund and into the fund will be paid the various sums I have mentioned.  Therefore, if the Government pays into that fund, its contribution goes also to the building and to providing the interest on the building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In another place the Minister promised that it would be pound for pound.  During the debate on the Bill I rather emphasised the question of the provision of buildings and teachers.  The Minister thought that I was too critical.  He suggested even that I did not understand the Bill, but I find that in that critical spirit and want of understanding I am in good company even now after the Bill has been passed and directions issued to the various educational committees through the country, because I notice that the Most Rev. Dr. Cullen, Bishop of Kildare and Leighlin, in a speech which he recently delivered, said that buildings will be required. It would not be reasonable, his lordship said, &ldquo;to expect the ratepayers to shoulder the burden nor was it the impression they were left under when the Bill was passing through the Dáil. It is understood that under the scheme the ratepayers of Carlow will be expected to contribute £300 more than last year and the amount to be contributed by the Department will be £8.  When the Bill was in the Dáil <Col N="1243" /> we were told that the contribution from the Central Fund was to be pound for pound.&rdquo; Perhaps as his lordship may also misunderstand the matter the Minister would be good enough to allay the anxiety that is felt, not only in the County Carlow, but in other places as I know from correspondence that I have had in regard to this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather early to press the Minister for Education for information in connection with the progress made under the Act that we are discussing, but if at this stage the Minister could inform the House of his policy it would, I think, be helpful, not only to Deputies but to the various committees that have been set up under the Act throughout the country. The Minister is quite right in laying the foundation by providing the necessary teachers.  It is obvious that until these teachers have been provided much progress, cannot be made.  It does occur to one that special teachers are not necessary for the provision of a continuation scheme.  The urgency of that particular aspect of the question was urged by the Commission.  Seeing that it is not necessary to have special teachers for that particular work, which might be put in hands immediately, one would be glad to know from the Minister what his intentions are, and when he hopes to put that particular portion of the scheme into operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will remember that when this Bill was under discussion the question of the type of education to be given in these schools was considered, and especially the type to be given to pupils between the ages of 14 and 16.  I think at that time there was general agreement among <Col N="1244" /> all who took part in the debate that there should be nothing in the nature of specialisation during these periods, and that while practical subjects would be undoubtedly taught, and the education given would have a practical bias, the main idea was that the education given in these schools should be of a continuation nature, and in fact the Act does, in Section 3, define continuation education as education to continue and supplement the education provided in the elementary schools, and to include practical and general training.  It includes these things, but it is not confined to them.  In the course of the debate on 14th May I expressed agreement with that view.  I said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>What is more necessary than anything else is that he should get a sound general education, an education that would enable him to take advantage, not so much of the classes he would attend later on, because that can only be to a limited extent, but of the various treatises, articles, books of all kinds, and lectures that he might read or hear from time to time; the type of education that would enable him to benefit by attendance even at the Spring Show.</P>
      <P>I was referring to the rural children. Deputy Tierney adverted to the same aspect of the question more effectively, and the Minister in reply said he agreed with the Deputy.  When the measure was going through the Seanad the Minister was more definite.  In the Seanad report of the 18th June, column 1592, the Minister is reported as saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Senator Connolly spoke on the question of cultural education.  It is not intended to exclude cultural education by any means.  In fact, a large portion of the continuation education between fourteen and sixteen will be of a general character, and though it will have a very practical bias, in many respects it will be cultural in character.</P>
      <P>That statement should be taken in connection with the memorandum.  One part of the memorandum, part 2 dealing with organisation and curricula, has this rather significant statement:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1245" /> Vocational schools should have a definite technical trend.  The mode of conducting such schools and classes and the methods of instruction employed should differ radically from those of the primary or secondary school.  A definite break both as to subject matter and its treatment is needed all through the vocational course.  Where subjects of the ordinary school curriculum are included they should be treated with a view to their direct utilisation in employment.</P>
    <P>Ordinary members of vocational education committees reading that instruction, and taking it as part of the policy of the Ministry, will be justified in assuming that the policy as regards these schools, even where they provide education for children between the ages of 14 and 16 will be definitely of a technical nature, and that education of the general type given in the primary and secondary schools will be taboo.  That is the general impression one would get, and that an ordinary member of the vocational committee would get, in reading that particular paragraph.  I think it is necessary it should be made perfectly plain that it was not the intention of the Minister, or of this House when it passed the Act, that there should be such a definite movement from the type of education given in the primary or secondary schools, that in fact, as the Act says, it should be a continuation and supplementing of the education given in these schools, and that it should not be assumed general education of a cultural kind, including such subjects as come generally under the heading of cultural education, should be excluded or even pushed into a secondary place.</P>
    <P>I think the general effect of these instructions will be that that will happen, because in these instructions issued to the trades preparatory schools special attention is drawn to the type. of education it is intended should be given.  I think it is contrary to all ideals that children of the early age of 14 should have their education so directed as seems to be set out in the instructions issued from the Department. I am sure the Minister knows that the issue of these instructions has <Col N="1246" /> given rise to a great deal of criticism and comment.  I asked the Minister a question in regard to this matter yesterday, and his reply, while fairly elaborate, did not entirely clear up the doubt I had in my mind about the matter.  He says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The memorandum referred to is not a general statement of policy by my Department in regard to the nature of the education which is suitable for children between the ages of 14 and 16.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Deputy misunderstands.  He asked a general question.  It is purely for accuracy of statement that I gave the reply in the precise form I did.  I was showing that the memorandum is not a general statement so far as all pupils between the ages of 14 and 16 are concerned. I wanted to make it quite clear that it applied to Committee schools only and does not apply to the bulk of pupils in primary or secondary schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the report of the Commission, and we know what it has recommended, but the Commission, or this House, did not at any time go so far as the instructions which the Minister has given to the vocational committees would seem to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My object in raising this is to give the Minister an opportunity of explaining more clearly than he has done up to the present what is really the policy of the Education Ministry in regard to these schools.  Undoubtedly the opinion has got abroad that the education to be given to the children between the ages of 14 and 16 in these particular types of school is merely the type that is given in trades preparatory schools and that what we understand by ordinary cultural education is going to be at a very great discount.  I do not think that that is right or that it is the proper view to take in the matter.  I am raising these points <Col N="1248" /> specially to give the Minister an opportunity of explaining generally at this stage of the development of the schemes what his views and the views of his Department are on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated the amount of money required in order to enable him to secure more teachers.  He specially mentioned teachers for the building and the engineering trades.  I wonder has the Minister ever considered the desirability, in the matter of engineering centres where you have an engineering instructor already&mdash;a properly qualified man&mdash;taking the theoretical and practical side, of taking in a tradesman to help in the technical side in a workshop?  Personally I think if the proper type of man were to be found he would be just as desirable and there would be less expense entailed on the committee if the Minister were prepared to accept that.  A working engineer who teaches on the practical side should be brought in because otherwise it is going to be dearer on the institute, that is if they are going to have a second teacher.  In Wexford where there are a great number of engineering students we find this difficulty, that where there are first and secondyear students and the principal is taken away for lecture work at certain times of the day, he has to leave the first year class when teaching the second year class and the result often is that there is horseplay in the workshop when he is away.  The Minister ought not to insist that a technical school in an engineering area should employ a second man at a high salary which the school could not afford to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter&mdash;that is the question of building.  I understand that the Education Ministry are endeavouring to secure from the Minister for Finance a promise that the Local Loans Fund will be available for technical committees who are prepared to renovate their old buildings or to extend them.  I would like to know if any progress has been made in that direction because I know of some schools that are prepared to go on.  I would like to know if any work has been done in that direction <Col N="1249" /> so that the schools would be prepared at the beginning of the academic year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take first a few of the small points that have been raised, because Deputy O'Connell has raised a very big question. As regards the buildings I am quite aware of the conditions.  In a case not referred to by Deputy Fahy the committee wanted a sum of £600 or £700 for building.  They were apparently under the impression that the money was to be paid out of this year's revenue.  Of course that is not so, nor was it ever intended that it would be so.  All that they were expected to pay was the interest and the sinking fund, and roughly speaking in the case I refer to, these would amount to about £50 to £55. That was a very different proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the £ for £ promise is concerned I think the Deputy will remember that I indicated that in the first year it would not be necessary as there would be sufficient money from the increased compulsory rate.  If the Deputy wishes I will give him the passages in my speech where I dealt with that matter.  I indicated that the policy not for the first year but look at over, say, three years, would be £ for £.  Deputy Corish referred to the buildings, that they should be done by borrowing.  If he will put a particular case before me there will be no delay in dealing with that matter.  As regards the other points raised by the Deputy so far as tradesmen are concerned, not merely may it be cheaper to get a tradesman to teach a technical subject&mdash;and that is not always the chief consideration&mdash; but it may be better.  What we are doing in a great many cases is to take men who are already tradesmen and train them to teach.  In that way not merely will you get better results from the teaching point of view but morally such a teacher imposes himself more on the youngsters.  The teacher who has a practical as well as a theoretical training imposes himself more on his students.  They will be more attentive to the teaching they will get from a teacher who is a tradesman than they would in the case of a teacher who is only a theoretical <Col N="1250" /> man who has got a short course in a technical school.  As regards the question of assistants, that is a new case and if the Deputy puts it before me I will look into it.</P>
    <P>As far as the matter of vocational education is concerned I have sent out a memorandum explaining the full policy to the Committees.  I gather that Deputy O'Connell is not pleased with the memorandum.  I would think from some remarks interjected by Deputy Good that he is not displeased with the memorandum or that he is not opposed to it.  I think Deputy O'Connell accused me yesterday of being inconsistent in this matter.  I would be quite prepared now to take up any quotation from any speech of mine on this measure when it was going before the House, to take everything I then said and my whole speech on the Second Reading, both the opening and concluding speeches here and in the Seanad and any answers I made then to the points raised, and I will be able to show the Deputy that in those speeches there is nothing inconsistent between them and the policy in the memorandum.  That policy is now the same as my policy when the measure was going through the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I stated on more than one occasion in my Second Reading speech in the Dáil that I definitely disclaimed any intention of setting up a new principle of control in education in this country, and it would be a new principle in control if I set up a school for general education managed by local committees.  I definitely disclaimed any such intention.  The Deputy in the question yesterday and now suggested that I was inconsistent in the matter of the memorandum with the views I gave expression to on the Second Reading.  As a rule I have not the habit of reading my speeches, but there has been such a lot of controversy about this Bill that I have been condemned to read more than once everything that I then said about the Bill.  If I am not boring the House too much, or inflicting myself too much upon the Deputies, may I quote one or two statements? I will refer to Volume 34, Col. 1739. As the Deputy will probably remember, <Col N="1251" /> I object there, and not for the first time, to the employment of the words &ldquo;continuation education.&rdquo;  I pointed out that I disliked the words &ldquo;continuation education.&rdquo;  I thought that Deputies would be tired of my expression of view.  I objected to the term precisely for the reason that it might lead people into the idea that we would be continuing, not instruction after the primary schools but a type of instruction such as would be given in the primary schools.  That was my principal objection, and I quoted in column 1739 a paragraph from the report from the Technical Commission. I quoted it for the reason that I agreed with it.  The paragraph quoted from the report refers to the quite different school atmosphere that ought to pervade the continuation schools. It emphasised that the atmosphere should be quite different from that which pervades the primary schools. In that column I said &ldquo;I say I dislike the word continuation, because it gets the idea into people's heads&mdash;it is hard to avoid it&mdash;that this is simply a continuation of the primary schools.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Right through the Second Rearing statement and elsewhere through the Committee debates, in the Seanad as well as in the Dáil, I continually emphasised the importance of the break to which the Deputy now refers. At the end of column 1742 and on the top of column 1743 I referred to two types of education which would be quite different from what was proposed to be given in the continuation schools.  I explained that I had nothing but admiration for the system of primary and secondary education, but I pointed out that these two types of education were not suitable.  In the next column I stated &ldquo;It is desirable that in all the schools there should be this overriding consideration as to the atmosphere that should prevail&mdash;the absence of the atmosphere which the pupil gets in the primary school and the definitely vocational character of the education that is to be given.  That applies especially to those between the ages of fourteen and sixteen, and even on to seventeen or eighteen, who attend those schools.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have taken out those passages not <Col N="1252" /> because they are the most emphatic but because they come first in the debate, but there are any amount of other quotations in which the break with the national school is emphasised. In column 1742 the Deputy will notice &ldquo;In that continuation education a thing that ought to be continually in the minds of the people responsible for the running of the schools is that the occupation, the business, of the persons attending the classes should be always before their minds.  On the other hand, no continuation system of education should neglect the cultural side.&rdquo; Whenever I mentioned the cultural side there was hardly an occasion, either here or in the Seanad, on which I did not definitely make it clear that by cultural education I meant something different from manual training, such as mathematics, English, science, and so on, and I pointed out that continuation education must have a distinctly practical bias.  That is precisely the purpose of the circular.  It is not intended that instruction in the vocational schools should be limited to manual instruction.  I made that clear in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>It was proposed in the Seanad, I think by Senator Connolly, that there should be a limitation in the hours of manual instruction.  I found great difficulty in following the amendment because, though the wording applied to one part of the Bill, the actual section belonged to another.  I made it clear that the amount of manual instruction would be limited, I pointed out that there were other subjects which would be taught but with a practical bias. That runs right through the whole conception so far as the Bill was concerned.  I emphasise that most strongly.  I was particularly anxious so far as certain principles were concerned, but I was convinced that there was a prejudice against a certain type of education because it was what the ordinary person would call useful. When a man comes to the age of 20 and takes up reading and studies for himself I am convinced that if between the ages of fourteen and sixteen he is taught anything well&mdash;mathematics, for instance&mdash;and if he has an interest in that particular thing, and sees its <Col N="1253" /> effect on his ordinary life, he will be better able to read literature when he comes to 20 years than if he continued in a purely theoretical fashion and without interest to deal with these matters in the school.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1931, to pay the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including the Rates Advisory Committee.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose for which this token vote of £10 is required in the present financial year is described in the sheet which has been circulated to Deputies. On many occasions since the Statistics Bureau was established on a proper basis I have been asked to take in hands the publication of an Official Handbook for the Irish Free State. We propose to put this work in hands at once and this money is for that purpose. I should explain that it is only a token vote because of savings made in other parts of the Vote.  I should also explain that the £250 gross which is required for the financial year does not see the end of expenditure in the matter.  It is estimated that a sum of over £3,000&mdash;almost £3,500&mdash;will be required. Against that there will be appropriations-in-aid arising from the sales of the book itself and advertisements. We reckon that in the end the State will have to bear about £200; the full extent of the State expenditure will be about £200.  I want to get the Vote in this financial year although it is not even certain that the £250 will be spent before the end of the financial <Col N="1254" /> year.  Without getting leave from the House by the passage of this Vote I cannot even make arrangements with regard to the employment of artists and designers in order to see how the book will be drawn up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It will undoubtedly be an advantage to have available in a handy form statistical information relating to the State.  But I think the Minister should tell us when it is intended publication will be made and if it is intended to be an annual publication or merely a single publication. I think he should also tell us whether the total estimate includes the cost of the editorial staff or merely the cost of printing and publishing. If it will necessitate any work on the part of the present staff of the Statistical Branch of the Department, will it result in any further delay in the publication of the census volumes, and other information which we have been waiting for for some time.  I think if that was likely to result the publication of this handbook might be delayed until the work on the census has been completed, because some of the information ascertained is overdue. I would be glad if the Minister could give that information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to correct the Deputy's first remark.  He expressed his delight that there would be now available in handy form statistical information.  This will not be merely a compilation of statistical information so far collected.  It is intended rather to have the type of handbook one sees produced by different countries in the world, which will have references to the more detailed statistical information which is available.  It will not contain the rather dry matter which one sometimes gets in statistical publications. It is intended rather as a descriptive booklet with reference to the production of statistical value to which students may afterwards have reference if they want to get further information about the country.  It will not be a statistical publication as we understand that.  It will be better dressed up.  It will not have lots of dry-as-dust statistical information. We will have a great deal more descriptive matter and hope to produce it in an attractive form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1255" /> At the same time I do not want to go to the other extreme and to make it a sort of handbook which tourists would carry about.  It is not intended to be an annual publication.  It is impossible to be precise at this stage. Rather it will be so written that the majority of the articles in it will not need to be re-written except at intervals of five or ten years.  Chapters may be re-written from time to time where newer statistical material is made available and changes may be made in certain descriptive matter.  I am also in a quandary as to when it will be available. It will take fully a year to produce. If I get this Vote the book ought to be ready in the early part of 1932.  As to the cost, the final sum which we estimate&mdash;it is only an estimate&mdash;is about £3,500.  About three-quarters of that will be printing costs and the other quarter will be for the editorial staff, and fees to designers, artists and writers.  I intend to keep this as far removed from the officials of the statistical bureau as possible. They will be asked to lend their aid and to make matter available to the editorial committee.</P>

Judging by the table of contents the Minister has read out, this book will be a fair-sized one. If the Minister hopes to get it sold, well and good.

      <P>That is a different matter.  I prefer to speak on that on my own Vote next year.  There is a scheme which the statistical people have in mind on account of the delay. in getting out certain volumes of the census.  It has not been possible to get that plan carried out.  They have in mind that they will take a census of certain things at different periods of the year.  That will be so done that about every five years' period there will be a new census revelation, and they will add a chapter or two each year, so that at the end of the five years' period, and in some cases in an <Col N="1257" /> eight years' period, there will be a completely new statistical abstract.  In addition, they propose to publish what is more technically called an abstract to the statistical material in hand.  I have not been able to get down any real scheme for that.  It has been thought of.  We have all the plans completed, but we prefer to go ahead with the publication of matter still to be issued in connection with the census. The matter to which the Deputy refers has not been lost sight of.  As to Deputy O'Kelly's question, we intend to have a certain number of copies for free distribution, mainly where we get free copies ourselves.  These will be required and, in addition, there will be other copies where we think there should be free distribution.  But we are looking for an edition of 15,000 copies for sale.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Where the Society has supplied to any member thereof or has repaired or renovated for any such member any sea-fishing boat or any equipment or appliance for a sea-fishing boat or any fishing-nets and a contract has been entered into between the Society and such member whereby such member agrees with the Society to pay to the Society in a particular manner specified in such contract the cost of such supply or repair or renovation and such member does any act, whether of commission or omission, which is a contravention of such agreement, such member shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall (without prejudice to any civil proceedings in respect of such act) be liable on summary conviction thereof in the case of a first offence to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds and in the case of a second or any subsequent offence to a fine not exceeding sixty pounds.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have given very careful consideration over-night to the points raised by Deputies Derrig, Anthony and some other Deputies during yesterday's debate on clause 3.  I was impressed chiefly by the consideration that the retention of the provision for imprisonment for certain aggravated cases might result in militating against a general readiness on the part of the fishermen to come into the Association. For that reason, I have reconsidered my attitude and I have put down this amendment, which removes from clause 3 the penalty of imprisonment.</P>

      <P>I need scarcely say that we, on this side of the House, welcome the repentance of the Minister even at the eleventh hour.  We are glad to see that he is not prepared to revive penal legislation of a type long obsolete and unknown anywhere else within what is described as the civilised world.  At the same time, I think he was scarcely fair. There was one Deputy whose speech <Col N="1259" /> yesterday, I think, made it quite impossible for the Minister to have proceeded upon the lines of the original Bill, and that was the speech which was made from these benches by Deputy Geoghegan.  Speaking with all the force and authority that his position at the Bar of this country endows him with, he made it quite clear that it would be inconsistent and utterly unjust on the part of the Minister to imprison a humble fisherman for a breach of a civil contract while the directors of the society themselves, who would stand in a fiduciary relalation with the shareholders and State, would be permitted, in case they failed to discharge their duties properly, to go scot-free under the terms of the Bill.  Nobody wishes in a case like this to make capital out of what was a manifestly wrong act on the part of the House, and particularly on behalf of the unthinking majority in this House.  What was a manifestly wrong act has now been rectified by, I must say, the commonsense of the Minister. I am prepared to concede him credit for having extricated that unthinking majority which followed him blindly into the lobby from the absolutely untenable position in which they landed themselves.  I think, however, the part of Deputy Geoghegan in this matter should not be lost sight of.</P>

    <P>(2) Whenever an inspector gives a direction under this section to the carrier prohibiting the export of any package of eggs, it shall be the duty of such inspector, where such carrier is not the owner of such package, to notify the consigner of such package of the giving of such direction.</P>
    <P>(3) Every person who exports or attempts to export any package of eggs in respect of which a direction prohibiting the export of such package has been given by an inspector under this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds.</P>
    <P>(4) Wherever a direction prohibiting the export of a package of eggs has been given to the carrier under this section and such package is, at the time such direction is given, actually loaded on a ship at a port in Saorstát Eireann, the carriage of such package on such ship shall not for the purpose of this section be deemed an exportation of such package if such carrier proves that such package was subsequently returned to and landed at the same port in Saorstát Eireann by him at the first available opportunity, and that between the time such package left and was landed at such port it was in the sole charge of such carrier and was not opened or interfered with in any way.</P>
    <P>As I say these sub-sections do not materially alter the section as it stands, but give a certain amount of elasticity and prevent to some extent the danger of eggs being held up in large quantities at the port or on the quay.</P>

      <P>(1) Before altering or cancelling (otherwise than in accordance with an application in that behalf made under Section 10 of the Principal Act) the registration of any premises under the Principal Act or this Act, the Minister shall give at least one fortnight's notice in writing of his intention so to alter or cancel such registration to the registered proprietor of such premises or his personal representative (if any) or its liquidator (as the case may be) and shall consider any representations made before the expiration of such notice by such registered proprietor or personal representative or liquidator (as the case may be) and may, if he thinks fit, cause an inquiry to be held in relation to the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) A notice of the Minister's intention to cancel or alter registration of premises under the Principal Act or this Act may be served by delivering it to the person to whom it is addressed or by leaving it for him with a person over sixteen years of age on the premises to which it relates or by sending it by post to the person to whom it is <Col N="1263" /> addressed at his last known place of abode.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill do now pass.  Deputy Ryan drew my attention to Section 6, which reads:</P>
      <P>Without prejudice to any other reason for refusal which may arise under the Principal Act or this Act, each of the following shall be a good reason for the refusal by the Minister of an application for the registration of premises in the register of exporters or in the register of preservers, that is to say:&mdash; (a) that such premises were previously so registered and such registration was cancelled by the Minister under the Principal Act or this Act, or</P>
      <P>(b) that the person applying for such registration was previously the registered proprietor of other premises so registered and, while he was such registered owner, the registration of such other premises was cancelled by the Minister under the Principal Act or this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal case is a case like this: AB is the owner of premises registered; he contravenes the Act five or six times but has to be let back every time after a certain interval on simply applying to be re-registered.  His equipment and premises are, <i>ex hypothesi</i>, all right and conform to the Act in every way, therefore the Department has no option but to admit to re-registration the registered proprietor although his licence has been previously cancelled five or six times. That is the general case we have to <Col N="1264" /> meet and it is covered by paragraph (b).  Paragraph (a) is necessary for this reason amongst others.  It is common for a man to make a bogus transfer, to transfer it to his wife or daughter or a son under age, and the only way we have to meet that case is to get the powers in paragraph (a).</P>

      <P>I raised the question yesterday about the Second Reading of this Bill.  Since then I have had some little time to go into it and we are of opinion that the Second Reading ought not to be taken to-day. The Bill was only circulated in the last 24 hours, and in our opinion there is not such great urgency in the matter that the Bill could not wait over and be dealt with if the House wished next week.  We are not prepared to give the Bill a Second Reading to-day. We would be prepared to meet next Wednesday or Thursday if the House so desired and the Government were willing for the discussion of this with other matters that might be put before the House.  This House has not had a great deal to do this year.  We have had five months' vacation from July last.  We have had a few short days' session and now we are to have another six or eight weeks' adjournment. Taking that into consideration, we are not satisfied that it is fair to all the interests concerned that a Bill of this kind&mdash;which, at any rate in principle raises important issues&mdash; should be rushed through in this fashion.  On the principle of the Bill I do not wish to say anything at the moment.  It is because of the rush with which this Bill and others are being sought to be put through and bearing in mind the long vacation we have been taking, and propose to take, that we see no reason why we should go out of our way to facilitate the Second Reading of this Bill at this stage.</P>

It extends the powers of the county councils but it does not make anything mandatory on the councils. It gives them power in certain circumstances to extend the area of charge. The advantage I see in the Bill is that it will enable county councils more easily and more readily to utilise the £300,000 which is being issued by the Government to do necessary work which, perhaps, they would not be otherwise inclined or willing to undertake.</P>

There are grants available now, and the Bill may give a chance to the local authorities to assist in the expenditure in some way.  There are several sewerage and water schemes coming up to the Government from the local authorities. With the grant from the Government, the local authorities may be able to contribute if the Bill is put into operation. Otherwise the schemes may not come to anything because of the inability of the local authorities to contribute to them.  The work should be allowed to go on, and we should give the Bill a Second Reading now.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Kelly <Col N="1266" /> suggests that we should meet next week in order to deal with this Bill The Government are very anxious that at a busy time of the year&mdash;just before the Christmas work&mdash;Deputies should not be brought unnecessarily to Dublin to deal with a small volume of business.  On the question as to why this matter was not dealt with earlier Deputies who have discussed with me the difficulties about the area of charge for public health schemes, as many Deputies have done since I came up against this general question will recollect that the circumstances of small areas were such that in many cases it was quite impossible to provide them with a water or sewerage scheme without extending the area of charge beyond the existing powers.  I intimated to many Deputies individually that these matters could not be properly dealt with unless the board of health area was made the area of charge.  To a certain extent, I have modified my opinion on that.  I could not get that carried out without the agreement of individual county councils. Only one county council has adopted the county area of charge. We have been looking around for alternatives.  We have been looking round for these alternatives at a time when there was a considerable amount of talk about derating and changing the incidence of taxation, so that there were many reasons why we should not press forward our ideas on these matters unnecessarily. We came to a period when it was decided to give £300,000 in relief.  There were many bodies with prepared schemes for water supply and sewerage who were anxious to get a part of the cost of the schemes from the Relief Vote.  Because of the present law regarding the area of charge, they could not go on with the work if the whole cost of the schemes was not borne by the Relief Vote. Since the Relief Vote was introduced, I have had representations from local bodies, and I have had deputations from different areas irrespective of the local bodies impressing upon me that even with a substantial grant from the Relief Vote the schemes could not be carried out on the present area of charge.  If we are to take <Col N="1267" /> the case mentioned by Deputy O'Reilly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that question again.  On the town, it would put a charge of 7s. 6d. in the £. With the facilities proposed in this Bill for a charge of one-seventh of a penny on the county and a penny on the rural district, a waterworks scheme could be provided in the town of Oldcastle at a rate of about 1s. 3d. in the £.  There are other places waiting for the same facilities.  There is nothing complicated in the Bill.  It is suggested that we should wait until next week to deal with a matter as simple as that.  We think it is unreasonable to ask Deputies to come back next week to deal with one matter which might be dealt with now and thus enable the work to go ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. Shaw Mr. Shaw">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shaw</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the Second Reading of this Bill.  I would like to point out that the advantages to be derived from the provision of a hot meal for children attending schools who, through poverty, are unable to obtain sufficient food, and who often have to come to school with a scanty breakfast, do not require to be stressed. Where such meals are obtainable they have proved to be of very great benefit to the general health and physical condition of the children.  For the past sixteen years urban district councils have possessed the power to co-operate with voluntary agencies in providing the requisite accommodation and equipment for providing meals for school children.  They could, also, with the consent of the Local Government Department, incur expenditure from the rates for the supply of food for such meals.  Of recent years the benefits obtainable from school meals have been more keenly appreciated, with the result that the number of urban authorities carrying on such schemes has increased from twelve in 1923 to 38 at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obviously unfair to withhold from towns under the control of town commissioners the statutory powers conferred on urban districts.  In fact, the town of Mullingar is larger than the majority of the urban districts, <Col N="1270" /> while there are only two such towns which do not exceed in population the smallest urban district, which is, I believe, Granard.  There are twentythree towns under town commissioners containing a total population of 52,443.  There is, therefore, an indisputable claim to amending legislation in this respect.  There would be no good reason for denying to the children in those areas the benefits conferred on urban areas by the Education (Provision of Meals) Acts, 1914 to 1917.  As regards the question of necessity, I can say that there is an urgent necessity.</P>
    <P>In Mullingar the nuns of the Presentation Convent and the Christian Brothers are co-operating with the St. Vincent de Paul Society, and are doing their best to supply meals to children, but there is a heavy demand on their limited funds.  I have no doubt that the town commissioners are willing to raise the necessary funds and, therefore, I ask that the necessary statutory powers should be granted to such bodies to enable them to provide meals for the children of the poor, whose meals at any time are scant and uncertain.  I appeal, therefore, for a speedy passage for this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the Second Reading of this Bill. From my experience in Longford of the work of providing meals for school children for the last few years, I can say that it has proved very satisfactory and is greatly appreciated by the children.  I know that the ladies who give their services free in connection with the scheme are extremely glad to be connected with it. I am satisfied that if powers were given to the town commissioners there would be much happiness in the district.  I would like to suggest that in towns where there are neither town commissioners nor urban district councils, the boards of health should have authority to delegate powers to town committees to provide meals for school children and thus make the scheme general.  The cost of such schemes does not run into a large sum, not more than £100.  I know that children in fairly good circumstances are ready to avail themselves of the opportunity of securing <Col N="1271" /> a hot meal during the day.  They like to be associated with the other children and often avail themselves of the opportunity.  The meals themselves are excellent and the quality of the food which is contracted for under the supervision of local ladies is quite satisfactory.  As I have said, I trust that the Minister will direct the attention of the boards of health to this matter so that they may delegate powers to towns in which there are neither commissioners nor urban district councils and to provide money from the area for meals for school children.  I trust that this Bill will pass before the Dáil adjourns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>While in agreement with the idea underlying the Bill, it strikes me as rather peculiar that while towns like Trim, Granard, and similar towns have powers to strike a rate for the provision of meals for school children towns like Mullingar have not.  It is evident from that fact that towns like Mullingar should seek urban powers to do this particular thing as well as other things which are very necessary.  I understand, that the people of Granard, which is a comparatively small town, asked the Ministry to relieve them of their urban powers but that was not done.  I just say that because, on a matter like this, the necessity for urban powers in comparatively large provincial towns with a population of over 5,000 is clearly indicated.  It would be a good idea to have local authorities administer school meals in the rural areas but there would want to be better machinery.  As the boards of health are constituted at present, I do not see how they could very well manage to do this themselves without having separate committees set up to deal with it.</P>

      <P>I would like to say that we support the proposal inasmuch as it extends the powers for the provision of meals.  What we would like to see is the extension of the same powers to every local authority, whether rural or urban.  Anyone who understands the conditions in rural towns will admit that meals are as necessary to school children in the <Col N="1272" /> poor rural districts as they are in the towns.  As my colleague, Deputy Corish, reminds me, they are, in fact, more needed, because in addition to having scanty meals at home, the children in rural parts have to travel long distances to school.  Though the parents of some children may be a little better to do than those of others, all children appreciate hot meals in the middle of the day.  Inasmuch, as the Bill extends the powers to make provision for school meals, I am in favour of the Bill and I desire to congratulate Deputy Shaw on its introduction.</P>

      <P>We have for some years advocated the provision of meals for school children.  We are sorry to find that there is any need for them in Mullingar, despite the great prosperity spoken of in that town some time ago. I hope these children are not left without meals by their parents because the money has been sent to their elder sisters and brothers in America, as was suggested in a recent election campaign.  I wonder would the Minister for Education say what steps he proposes to take to deal with this matter.  Will there be a special closing hour or will special facilities be afforded for the provision of these meals?  Will they be partaken of during recreation time?</P>

      <P>I would like to correct an impression that might have arisen as a result of Deputy Fahy's remarks that the provision of school meals necessarily indicates that the children partaking of them are in a state of poverty.  The real argument for school meals is not so much the question of the poverty of the school children as the necessity for school children to get some warm meal during the day.  If the impression were broadcast that those partaking of school meals are necessarily stricken with poverty, then the whole idea of <Col N="1273" /> launching a scheme of school meals would be defeated by that impression.</P>

      <P>I think it is necessary that we should correct the misapprehension under which Deputy Dr. O'Higgins is labouring.  One of the pleas which Deputy Shaw made in introducing this Bill was the poverty of the school children.  I quite agree with Deputy Dr. O'Higgins that this question of poverty should not be stressed at all and that it is essential that if children are to derive the utmost benefit from the educational facilities afforded them, they should be provided with these school meals irrespective of class.  In that attitude we approach the Bill and hope that it will be adopted by the House.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil approves of the International Treaty for the Limitation and Reduction of Naval Armament signed at London on the 22nd day of April, 1930, a copy of which was laid on the Table of the Dáil on the 3rd December, 1930, and recommends the Executive Council to take the necessary steps to ratify the said Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to examine at all the details of this Treaty for the Limitation and Reduction of Naval Armaments.  It has been before the House since 3rd December and Deputies had sufficient <Col N="1275" /> time to examine the details for themselves. As a matter of fact, the details with regard to ships, tonnage, etc., do not concern us very much. What does concern us is the attempt, the successful attempt, that has been made at least to get some measure of agreement with regard to the limitation of armaments even though it is confined to one sphere of warfare.  I think it will be recognised that the fact that success has been achieved is due to the fact that a better approach was made to the question of disarmament in naval matters after certain political agreements had been reached. Attempts had been made previously to bring about disarmament on land as well as on sea but those with regard to naval agreements had not been very successful.  There had been one rather successful one, but the effect had been somewhat spoiled by the abortive attempt made in 1927.  Even though success had been achieved at the earlier Washington Conference, the points on which there was disagreement rather excited the nations of the world to compete again in building the class of vessels in which they were still allowed to compete.</P>
    <P>At the London Conference this time there was a much better atmosphere, due almost entirely to the fact that better political agreements had been reached amongst the nations, arising out of the fact that the Kellogg Pact in particular had been signed, and that the Optional Clause had been adhered to by so many of the nations associated in the League of Nations. In addition, the majority of the nations of the world had bound themselves through their association at Geneva, not merely to defend one another against an aggressor in time of war, but to cut off all connection both by way of finance and commerce with an aggressor State.  With the better hope arising from all these considerations that a new attitude would be taken up on the question of navies if people believed sincerely in the Kellogg Pact and in these other international agreements, their navies were no longer to be looked upon as instruments of aggression, or, at least, as instruments for an aggressive policy. <Col N="1276" /> War had been denounced, and all that was thereafter required was that a navy and every type of armament should be regarded merely as a method of defence against an aggressor State, if any State had become aggressive and broke the peace of the world.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances this Conference met and substantial agreement on very important details was reached. As far as certain portions of this Treaty are concerned, two Powers associated with it in other parts failed to make agreement, but it was understood at the time that the London Conference broke up that these conversations had not been abandoned but deferred. It was hoped that, subsequently, agreement would be reached as between these two States, and that the Treaty would become a full Treaty as between all the contracting parties.</P>
    <P>We were invited to take part in the Conference.  We were very pleased to have the invitation extended to us, and equally pleased to have the chance of attending, though, as I have said, we are not immediately interested in the question of scrapping ships or of limitation by way of tonnage or otherwise. We were pleased that the invitation had been extended to us, particularly when we learned that a great country, the United States, was specially concerned that this Conference should meet, that the nations invited should assemble, and that we as one nation should be there.  We felt that to abandon the Conference at that point, and to say that we were not interested would have been flaunting indifference in the face of the United States on a matter that vitally concerned them.</P>
    <P>As a small nation we must, of course, have a very deep interest in anything that will lead to the preservation of peace as opposed to the emergence of war conditions.  For these reasons we were pleased to accept and to attend, holding that our constitutional position, the one other point that had to be attended to, was safeguarded throughout the Treaty.  As this is a Treaty which is in the general interest of international peace, even although it may not go the whole way people expect from it, we recommend it to the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>With anything that has been done to help forward the idea of international peace and the limitation of armaments we, on this side, are in full accord.  We would be very glad indeed that a great deal more could be done and that the Conference should not have been restricted to one sphere of, shall I say, military activity.  During the time that this Treaty was being negotiated, and since, I read in both the American Press and in the Press of Europe a considerable amount of criticism of it, particularly with regard to the limited extent to which the nations that were in consultation had been induced to go in for limiting their armaments.  In fact, I think it can be truthfully said in the case of some nations that an international Treaty for the limitation of and a reduction in naval armaments means, in effect, the giving, for some time at least to these nations an increase in their naval armaments.  Therefore, while it is officially called a Treaty for the Limitation and Reduction of Naval Armaments, as it is in fact from certain standpoints, it is in other respects a Treaty which empowers these nations to increase their armaments.  So far as the Treaty goes in the limitation of armaments, limiting the power for evil, so to speak, of navies, it is all to the good.</P>
      <P>I suppose it was meant as a compliment, and was taken as such by the Free State Government, to be invited to be present at this Conference and to assist in bringing its work to fruition. In so far as the nations concerned meant it as a compliment, I am sure the Free State Government appreciated it.  In that connection, I notice that the preamble to the document before us says in the first paragraph:&mdash;&ldquo;The President of the United States of America, the President of the French Republic, his Majesty the King of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the seas, Emperor of India,&rdquo; and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was under the impression that the title &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; had no constitutional or legal significance after the setting up of the Irish Free State and the Northern Government.  I was under the impression, perhaps I am wrong, that as representing an entity, recognised <Col N="1278" /> constitutionally and legally, Ireland no longer existed, but here we find that the King of England claims Ireland as part of his territory. Therefore, in the eyes of the King of England and of the British Empire&mdash; evidently for the purpose of the King and his title&mdash;the name of Ireland does exist, but so far as we in this country are concerned Ireland no longer exists.  It is the Irish Free State and the Northern Government, but Ireland has gone out of existence as far as legal and constitutional matters are concerned.</P>
    <P>I know there has been some change in the style and title of his Majesty the King of England.  I am not very certain what that is, but I suppose as we find it here we have the proper title now.  I would merely call attention to the fact that when it suits the purpose of the British Empire they keep Ireland and recognise it constitutionally for the King's title and other purposes.  They can recognise Ireland as one single entity, but when it suits their purpose, not for the limitation of armaments and not for limiting the powers of the British Empire, they forget Ireland or at least they ignore it and cut it in two.  They set up two legal entities obliterating Ireland and set up the Irish Free State so called and the Government of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I hope it was not merely to bolster up the title of the King of England with any power, constitutional or otherwise, over this country that the Free State consented to act, that when they received an invitation to act on this conference it was not with any idea of associating themselves with the King of Great Britain in his capacity of King of Ireland and the claim of his constitutional power over Ireland, as is claimed in this title.  I hope it was not with the intention of bolstering up that power the Government of the Free State consented to take part in the conference.  The Minister will, perhaps, explain the mind of the Ministry with regard to that aspect of the matter when he is replying.</P>
    <P>It is, as the Minister says, true that they have little interest in this beyond the interest of every citizen who <Col N="1279" /> desires international peace.  Beyond that we have little interest in the details set out in this document.  We know there is a considerable list of vessels, in some cases, to be scrapped, or that are to be applied to other purposes.  That is all to the good if the idea behind it is that we should get, perhaps by easy stages but nevertheless some day, to the condition that navies will be used, as the Minister says, not for aggression but purely as instruments of defence.  I am rather doubtful if we will arrive at that stage, and I think we will have to arrive at the millennium before we arrive at the stage when navies will not be used by those who are powerful enough to use them as instruments of aggression. We have heard over and over again countries that have large navies state that the best form of defence is to be well armed against attack, but it is also, I think, recognised that those who are very well armed against attack are very frequently looking out for opportunities to test the efficiency of their armaments.  However, we do not in any way question the bona fides of some of the nations that have associated themselves by their signatories with this Treaty.</P>
    <P>We have no navy, and we are hardly likely to have one.  No one would suggest that the gun-boat we have, I think there is a gun on it, the Muirchu, would form the basis of a navy for this country, but some time or another perhaps we will arrive at a stage when we will have power and money and the means of defence of our own coast, and especially of our own fishermen and their boats, and, let us hope, have our ships that will fly the Irish Republican flag at sea.  Apropos of the publication of this document by the Irish Free State, I read a leading article in what I suppose is one of the organs of the Free State Ministry, and certainly it is one of their ablest defenders. That paper was very much upset at the principles maintained in this document that is now to be ratified by us. The paper says in this leading article published in Monday's issue:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When the programme is completed&rdquo;&mdash;the programme of the limitation of armaments&mdash;&ldquo;the London <Col N="1280" /> Treaty will have had no effect save to transfer the supremacy of the sea from Great Britain to the United States.  The balance of naval power will have shifted, but the project of international peace will be no closer than before.  What will happen when the people of Great Britain realise that their birthright has been assigned away?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Seeing that the Minister was so deeply immersed in Imperial affairs recently, I wonder what were the reactions of the Minister, Imperial-minded as he must be in these days, to the sentiments expressed in that organ, I would not say of his, but that expresses the mind of his Ministry so frequently.  Undoubtedly there were matters other than affairs relating to commerce and economics and constitutional matters discussed at that Imperial Conference.  The question of the defence of the Empire must have been one of the questions discussed, and the Minister, as head of the delegation over there, I am sure, took part in such discussions as to how the Empire, and the Free State as part of it, was to be defended, perhaps against America and other countries in days to come.  Articles of a similar nature to the one I have quoted appeared in other papers, and I think there was one recently in the &ldquo;Sunday Times,&rdquo; which, I am sure, the Minister sees. They expressed grave fears with regard to the outcome, so far as the British Empire is concerned, of this naval treaty and the passing, as they suggest there will be a passing, of the domination of the seas eventually from Great Britain to America as a result of this treaty.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister must have given thought to that matter, for no doubt as one of the pillars of the Empire he is concerned.  I would like to know if he has any views to express on that aspect of the question, as to how he thinks the future might be affected so far as his interests in his Imperial capacity are concerned as regards the Empire and the Free State considered from the point of view of national defence.  At any rate, speaking for myself, I would not hesitate to say that as far as Ireland is <Col N="1281" /> concerned, she would have nothing to fear if the hegemony of the seas did go into the hands of the United States. In the past the United States has been to us more of a friend, and a great friend at times, than an enemy.  If we have anything to fear from any of these nations, by past experience there is only one we have to fear.  As far as I know, at any rate, we would not worry if such a change did take place, but perhaps in view of his recent Imperial associations and developments the Minister might be of a different mind. If he is, I would be glad to hear what he has to say.</P>

      <P>I am glad to see that Deputy O'Kelly has changed his mind in this matter of war and peace. When last we discussed the ratification of the Kellogg Pact in this House, after one of his supporters had indulged in a long speech of abuse against the American people and denounced them as being hypocrites, the Deputy himself got up to announce that his Party stood definitely for war. To-night he has improved his mind.

    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and disarmament. The Deputy seemed to be a bit confused as regards the preamble to the Treaty.  After the Imperial Conference of 1926, it was made quite clear that the title of the King as head of the Commonwealth was not a title differentiating different sections of the Commonwealth, but was a geographical title, and therefore the term King of Great Britain and Ireland and the British Dominions Beyond The Seas was purely expressing a geographical and not a political entity.  For instance, there is not such a person to-day as the King of England, who is frequently referred to in this House and on platforms in the country. There is no King of England.  I think <Col N="1282" /> it is very satisfactory that we should have had the honour to participate in this Conference, and I regret that the Minister for External Affairs has taken so long to bring this matter before the Dáil, because I think it is almost bordering on discourtesy to the other nations who signed this Treaty and who are more vitally interested than we are ourselves in its passage to have that Treaty held up by a country which has no navy.  It is obviously for the benefit of this country that we should do everything possible to promote peace, seeing that without peace it is absolutely impossible for us to take any part in the development of Atlantic communications through which there is a future for this country.</P>
      <P>There has been a danger in recent years that whereas previously the people of this country thought of little else in the world except England, now they are inclined to think of no other part of the world except Europe.  Some Irishmen in America imagine that the only countries in the world are this country and America, so that to that extent a large number of our people are divided amongst themselves; some look upon us as exclusively European and others look upon us as being simply an appendage of the United States of America.</P>
      <P>We must at all costs try to think Atlantically and try to preserve the balance between the European and American aspects of our national life. That will be the first step towards ultimately obtaining that wider outlook and thinking universally in view of the widespread diffusion of our race throughout the globe.  I hope that the Dáil will unanimously pass this Motion.  We regret that the Minister did not introduce it sooner than he has done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Mr. Mullins Mr. Mullins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullins</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as my voice can affect it the Motion will not be passed unanimously.  I rise to protest against the continuance of the farce which started with the Kellogg Pact to which Deputy Esmonde made reference and which is changed now in the various Conventions which we have before us in recent months and which has culminated in the bringing to this House <Col N="1283" /> to-night for ratification the Naval Pact for the limitation and reduction of naval armaments.</P>
      <P>The Minister when recommending the adoption of the Pact to the Dáil stated that success had been achieved this time, and Deputy Esmonde said that it was a great honour to have participated in the Conference which led to the signing of this Treaty.  I think that the Dáil would be far better occupied in devoting its attention to matters affecting the direct welfare of the people of this country than in attempting to assist the British Empire in bolstering up its rotten and decaying structure.  This Treaty for the limitation and reduction of naval armaments is, in my opinion, a monument to Ramsay MacDonald's failure in the matter of world peace, but it is also a monument to Ramsay MacDonald's genius in retaining British control of the seas.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kelly quoted from some editorial Statement in which the writer bemoaned the passing from British hands of control of the seas.  Anybody who has given any thought to the study of this Treaty, and anybody who has followed the discussion which took place during it and prior to it at the preparatory Disarmament Commission in Geneva, cannot fail to be struck by the kernel of the whole document.  Article 21, paragraph 3, which, though the Treaty was negotiated by five Powers, does not apply to France or Italy, says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>If during the term of the present Treaty the requirements of the national security of any of the high contracting parties in respect of vessels of war limited by Part II. of the present Treaty are, in the opinion of that party, materially affected by new construction of any Powers other than those joining in Part III. of this Treaty, that high contracting party will notify the other parties to Part III. as to the increase required to be made in its own tonnage within one or more of the categories of such vessels of war, specifying particularly the proposed increase and the reasons therefor, and shall be entitled to make such increase...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1284" /> If the success of naval limitation which the Minister has spoken of means anything, it means that this naval pact continues the eye-wash of the preparatory Commission for Disarmament at Geneva enabled a smoke-screen to be thrown about this question of control of the seas to such an extent that we have here a recommendation brought forward that we should assist Great Britain to maintain that control. I ask what interest has this partitioned part of Ireland in assisting to maintain British control of the seas? What interest have we in seeing whether the British retain control of the sea or not?  It should be clearly the advantage of the State, while there is a state of war existing between us and England, to see that British control of the seas is abolished. Yet in this naval treaty, when ratified by the Dáil, we, as a component part of the British Empire and a constituent State of the British Commonwealth of Nations, add our signature, through Professor Smiddy, and assist in creating the illusion that naval security and limitation has at last been reached.  The Minister stated that it was a good thing that we are being asked to assist in the discussion. and Deputy Esmonde stated that it was a compliment to the Free State to have been asked to take part in it. I think it is time that the Dáil faces up to the facts and refuses to continue this farce which has been perpetrated here to-night.</P>
    <P>At the preparatory Disarmament Conference in Geneva three or four years ago a proposal for real disarmament was put up by the Soviet delegation.  That proposal was the abolition of the navies and armaments of the world.  It was revolutionary undoubtedly.  That proposal was ridiculed and laughed out of court. Two years later at the London Naval Conference a proposal tending towards the same objective of limitation and reduction in the tonnage of battleships from 35,000 to 10,000 was also ridiculed out of court. This Treaty is supposed to have secured comparative naval security and disarmament.  Part 2 of Article 6, also a very interesting section, deals with the one recognised and <Col N="1285" /> generally accepted inhuman weapon of modern war&mdash;submarines.  All arrangements have been made for them, for their tonnage, displacement, armaments and number.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister does not mean to insist that this Treaty is really what he describes as a success?  Surely we have the situation occurring in England that the Treaty ratified by the Irish Free State Parliament&mdash;the ratification of it&mdash;will be deposited in order to show the civilised people of the world that this little part of Ireland at all events is vastly and immensely interested in world peace. Whilst all that apparent attempt at securing world peace is going on, surely we must consider what is happening behind the scenes.  We must consider this message from the United States on the occasion of the laying of the keel of a new thirty-thousand tons American trade liner. In the course of a speech on that occasion made by one of the delegates to the London Naval Conference&mdash; Senator Dwight Morrow&mdash;it was stated that the building of an adequate merchant marine was essential to American commerce and security.  Senator Morrow added that his experience at the London Naval Conference convinced him that the most indisputable interest which the United States Government had in building an adequate merchant marine was to have a secondary defence in time of war.  The London Naval Pact, we are told, leads us further on the road to peace.  The Kellogg Pact led us further on the road to peace also. We have, on the other hand, statements of this nature which absolutely belie the whole atmosphere that permeated the London Naval Conference. They give food for thought to anyone who tries to penetrate that smoke-screen and paper wall set up by the five great Powers and their component parts, including the Irish Free State.</P>
    <P>The one thing, I think, the Dáil seems to forget in dealing with this naval treaty&mdash;and it is deplorable that it should forget it&mdash;is that whilst we are here engaged in discussing an international agreement of this nature, and while the Minister will afterwards, probably, refer in cynical language, as <Col N="1286" /> he did on the occasion of the Kellogg Pact debate, to anyone who had the daring or the cold brazen cheek to express a point of view which is not that of the Minister, we cannot get away from the fact that war budgets are being increased.  While all this talk about peace and security and naval limitation and disarmament is going on the war budgets of five of the largest Powers have been increased ever since the London Naval Pact was under discussion. Strange to say, the home of the Kellogg Pact has been foremost in ensuring that its war budget shall not lag behind.  It is time we got away from the atmosphere of international agreements which do not and cannot affect the Free State.  This Pact would have no effect on our international relations, because Britain retains the control of the seas.  Britain is still master.  Following the Washington Conference 600,000 tons of American war vessels went to the bottom of the sea, and it was only afterwards the Americans realised that they had been bluffed by John Bull.  The Irish Free State, through its representative, is lending itself to the continuance of this hypocrisy.  I want to protest against the ratification of this Naval Pact. Whether or not there is anybody in the House with me in this matter, I wish to have it on record that I am against the continuance of this procedure.</P>

I am sure the unfortunate fishermen around our coasts, who looked to our Minister for External Affairs, when he went to London, to be in some way interested in preventing foreign trawlers from raiding our bays and harbours, will be delighted to know that instead of anything in the way of protection for them we have a new naval agreement.  I am sure the whole country will be delighted at this product of the Minister's visit to Buckingham Palace where he had luncheons and dinners towards which the unfortunate taxpayers have to contribute £10,000 a year.  I am sure the unfortunate workers in Cork, <Col N="1287" /> when they see Furlong's now selling foreign flour&mdash;140 lbs. sacks made in England&mdash;will be very grateful to the Minister for External Affairs, and they will be anxious to know how many inches he proposes to take off the old gun on the Muirchu.  Apparently that is a more important matter than looking after the Cork flour mills or the fishermen who are being robbed of fish around our coasts.</P>
      <P>I do not think there could be anything more nonsensical than a gentleman taking £1,700 of the people's money coming in here with this proposal, with a Relief Vote of £300,000 tacked on to it.  On top of that we have the fact that after ten days' work we are going off for another holiday. There could not be anything more contemptible. Does the Minister think that he will be let get away with this thing?  I wonder if under this Treaty for the limitation and reduction of naval armaments we are going to take away the shells that are not fit to be used on our naval patrol boat for the protection of the fish?  Are we going to take 1¼ inches off the gun on the Muirchu that fires no shells?  I would like to hear from the Minister what contribution we are going to make out of our navy towards this proposed reduction in armaments.  It will be interesting to find that out.  I am sure this proposal will be extremely satisfactory to the unfortunate fishermen and our flour workers, upon whom, some time ago, the eagle eye of the Minister&mdash;just like the eagle eye of the Skibbereen Eagle&mdash;was pitched. The Minister was using his eagle eye in order to see that Ranks would do no harm.  While the flour mills are closed the Minister goes to London and dines with the Prince of Wales and helps to reduce the naval armaments. I wonder what would those who fought and who were executed in Easter Week&mdash;Pearse, or any of his comrades&mdash;think of this thing to-night? I wonder what they would think of the Minister?  In my opinion, the Minister is beneath the contempt of any decent man.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It took me until to-night to discover why Deputy Mullins <Col N="1288" /> had left the Fianna Fáil Party.  We get it pretty clear that he thinks this Treaty is one that gives the control of sea power more and more into the hands of Great Britain.  Deputy O'Kelly believes it does not, and believes that the hegemony of the seas has passed to another country.  I am asked a lot about my Imperialism.  If it has resulted in the passage of sea power to the United States of America I leave people to judge it by that afterwards.  Deputy O'Kelly is rather anxious as to whether navies will ever be looked upon as instruments of defence. It was by reason of people being such doubting Thomases before the war that the war occurred.  It is because there is such a point of view operating at the moment in world matters that there is some better regard for peace and the things which lead to peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if we do not get to that stage at once it is well to make the attempt. That is a point on which Deputy O'Kelly seems to be in line with Deputy Mullins's point of view.  Deputy Mullins is apparently very wroth over things that lead to peace.  I suppose the Deputy will not put his faith on the road that will lead to the Workers of the World Commonwealth Conference, because he cannot get there to-morrow.  The comments made on this are that we have not got a navy, that we have not got general disarmament and, therefore, this Treaty is to be disregarded.  This Treaty has been defended on two grounds by those who are interested directly in naval limitation.  It was defended first on the ground that it prevents for the future, between people who are most interested, competition in building; it limits competition of the type that want on before the war.  It is limiting building to a certain type, a certain maximum tonnage, and these two things alone are well worth having and have been sufficient to get this Treaty approved of by all the people who are recited in the Preamble of the Treaty, excepting this country to-day.  Deputy O'Kelly is anxious about the title of the King.  The title of the King used here is the official title of the King; <Col N="1289" /> it is the one to which we agreed and the one by which we recognise him at the moment.  Deputy Mullins used one phrase that I want to take exception to.  He talked of this as a Five Power Conference and that only three Powers signed.  It is nowhere so stated.  It was a conference representative of eleven countries.  I do not know whether we are to claim for ourselves the title of Power in regard to naval matters, but there were eleven States represented there.  There was no question of a Five Power or a Three Power Pact.</P>

It is stated here and the Deputy can read it.  As to the steps for ratification, the instrument of ratification will be prepared on the advice of, I think, the Executive Council.  It might be by myself or another Minister or the Executive Council.  The instrument of ratification is then prepared, and bears in the recital itself that it has been done with the approval of the Dáil and Seanad of this country.  Ratification is, of course, in the name of the King.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde raised a point to which I want to refer.  He complained that we have been dilatory in bringing this matter into the Dáil. That complaint cannot be made at the moment.  I think if the Deputy understood the circumstances he would admit there is an explanation of the delay.  We were not ready to have this discussion when the Dáil was last in session and there seemed to be no immediate necessity to have it brought forward because at that time the Japanese Government were very slow about ratification.  We thought the delays which seemed likely to ensue in the Japanese ratification would carry us over until the reassembly of the Dáil.  As a matter of fact, when the Japanese Government got this accepted we made an attempt by approach to two of the other Parties in this House to get leave to ratify it, assuring those two Parties that this would be the first motion to be brought before the Dáil on its reassembly, <Col N="1291" /> as we did not want to appear discourteous to the other countries.  Our neglect of ratification was the only thing that prevented the Treaty becoming operative.  We did our level best to get ratification earlier but it was not possible.  The date which seemed to be the vital date passed before we could get anything done.  In these circumstances there was no necessity to hurry it beyond the date of the assembly of the Preparatory Conference on Disarmament.</P>
    <P>As regards Deputy Corry, I do not think it is worth while replying.  I was glad to see that his Party realised that his intervention would not be very effective and sent him out on some childish errand, to see was the flag flying or something of that kind. It was a pity the Deputy did not stop out longer.  On the other hand, his presence here does lend something to the House.  The depths to which he can get rather raise the general level of the House.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Eireann approves of the International Convention relating to Dangerous Drugs, signed at Geneva on the 19th day of February, 1925, a copy of which was laid on the Table of the Dáil on the 18th day of June, 1930, and recommends the Executive Council to take the necessary steps for its ratification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Convention has been so long in the hands of the Deputies that I do not want to take any time by going through the details of it.  The special importance of this Convention, as opposed to any other in this matter, is really in Chapter III.  In Chapter II. the contracting States undertake the effective control of the production, distribution and export of raw opium. Chapter III., the important one, then goes on: &ldquo;Due regard being had to the <Col N="1292" /> differences in their commercial condition, the contracting parties shall limit the number of towns, ports or other localities, through which the export or import of raw opium or cocoa leaves shall be permitted.&rdquo; It was on the point dealt with in Chapter III. that the suppression of illicit dealings in opium had been a failure.  It will be seen by anybody who reads the Convention that we are not very much touched by this.  We are not a producing country, and we are not a manufacturing country as far as this is concerned. We are, to a very limited extent, an importing country, but we are supposed to limit, except on very definite conditions, the passage through our territory, or even the ships that call here.  Opium has to be listed in a particular way.  Unless people have both import and export authorisations, they are not allowed to convey opium to third countries; also unless we are satisfied that there is a limitation exclusively to medical and scientific purposes. The Convention is also useful inasmuch as it sets up, in Chapter VI., a central board of eight people.  Each contracting State is bound to send in a report each year giving certain items in regard to the importation and use of these dangerous drugs.  The State undertakes the supervision of the traffic in dangerous drugs and to take legal action to suppress it.  This is one of the Conventions on which the Assembly has, from year to year, laid stress and asked on many occasions that a very big number of States should join.  It is realised that the traffic is an undesirable one and that a proper attempt to suppress it cannot be made unless a very big number of States agree.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Dáil disapproves of the decision of the Executive Council accepting the recommendation of the Tariff Commission that a Customs tariff should not be imposed on packing and wrapping papers and cardboards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Tariff Commission on this application was published recently. The application was made in the first instance by the Paper and Paper Bag Manufacturers' Association of the Irish Free State, and was for the imposition of a Customs duty of an amount equal to 33? per cent. of the value of the article on importation into Saorstát Eireann of packing and wrapping paper, and subsequently an <Col N="1294" /> application by the proprietors of the Clondalkin Paper Mills for a Customs duty on certain cardboards was added. Both applications were reported on together.  The recommendation of the Tariff Commission, which has been accepted by the Executive Council, is unfavourable in respect of both applications. I think it is very desirable that the Dáil should have an opportunity of discussing the Report.  In the ordinary course the Report from the Tariff Commission on an application which has been reported on unfavourably would not come before the Dáil, and that, in my opinion, is a very serious defect in the Tariff Commission Act.  It was to try to remedy that defect, and to afford the Dáil an opportunity of considering the Report that I tabled this motion.  Apart altogether from the desirability of the Dáil considering the Report, the case for the rejection of the application is so weak that, in my opinion, the Dáil should pass the motion in my name and thus induce the Executive Council to reconsider its attitude.</P>
    <P>I do not remember any Report from the Tariff Commission in which a weaker case for its recommendation was made than in this Report relating to wrapping papers and cardboards. I came to the consideration of the circumstances of this industry completely as an outsider.  I knew nothing whatever about it.  Only once in my life was I in a paper mill.  I got no reliable information from any outside source whatever.  The bulk of the information available to me is contained in the Report.  But, on the information made available in the Report, it seems to me the recommendation of the Tariff Commission should have been other than it was.  Of course the outstanding fact arising from the Report is the complete unsuitability of the Tariff Commission machinery for dealing with the circumstances of an industry, such as the paper making industry in this country.  There is in Clondalkin a paper making mill which at one time gave very considerable employment, and which is capable of giving some employment in the future. A number of persons are apparently prepared to acquire and work that mill in the production of cardboards <Col N="1295" /> and papers subject to a customs duty being imposed.  The Tariff Commission however is precluded under the terms of the statute under which it operates from agreeing to the imposition of that tariff until the mill has been actually acquired by persons intending to work it.  The position is, therefore, one of stalemate.  The Tariff Commission refuses to recommend a tariff, and refused at one stage even to proceed with the consideration of the application, because it was not satisfied that there was a company available with the necessary financial resources to acquire and operate the mill.</P>
    <P>On the other hand a number of people who were apparently quite willing to acquire and operate the mill did not want to commit themselves financially in an irretrievable manner until the certainty of a tariff existed.  The Report of the Tariff Commission upon the part of the application relating to cardboard has nothing whatever to do with the merits of the case for establishing the industry but deals only with the merits of the particular individuals who appeared before them and expressed their intention of working the mill subject to a tariff being imposed.  It is in fact difficult to understand what the Tariff Commission mean when they say in their Report that the application failed in so far as it relates to the Clondalkin mill.  If it is the duty of the Tariff Commission to acquire all possible information relative to the industry in respect of which the application was made, to examine the question of whether that industry is capable of development in the country, whether a tariff is going to promote that development, whether its imposition may not have counter-balancing effects upon other industries, then the actual merits of the individuals associated with the application should only have a very minor part in their consideration of the question.  In relation to this particular application, however, the merits of the possibilities of the industry were apparently not considered at all but only the financial resources and technical ability of the <Col N="1296" /> group of individuals concerned.  I am not interested in the individuals.</P>
    <P>In relation to a debate upon another tariff, the flour milling tariff, I had occasion to point out that because of the peculiar formation of the association responsible for the application a case for a tariff was made over which I personally was not prepared to stand, and which in my opinion was not the best possible case for the tariff.  The same applies to some extent in relation to this application. The actual business merits of the company which had acquired an option on the Clondalkin mill should not weigh unduly with the Tariff Commission people.  Undoubtedly they should take relevant matters of that kind into consideration but the main question for them to decide was, whether the imposition of a tariff was going to result in the re-opening of the mill and the development of the paper making industry in the country.  It is quite obvious from the evidence submitted to them and from the conclusions as stated in the report that the imposition of a tariff would have that effect.  I do not know whether Clondalkin mill is doomed as a result of this report or not.  It appeared at one time immediately following this publication that the mill was doomed, that the machinery was going to be scrapped and that the buildings were going to be utilised for some other industry.  An announcement to that effect appeared in the Press.  Subsequently however it appeared that a London firm of auctioneers have expressed their willingness to acquire the mill and operate it as a paper mill if a tariff is imposed, and on the first of this month it was stated in the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; that the head of the firm, accompanied by Sir John Irwin and Mr. D. McCullagh, met the President of the Executive Council and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The report reads as follows:</P>
    <P>It is understood that he made representations to the effect that the present owners of the mill could arrange the necessary finance to restart the mills if the Government would guarantee the necessary tariff <Col N="1297" /> on imported boards, packing and wrapping paper.  An application for such a tariff was rejected by the Tariff Commission mainly because the financial provision for the re-opening of the mill was unsatisfactory. An &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; representative learned that the matter may go again before the Tariff Commission and another effort be made to restart the mill.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there is any foundation whatever for that statement in the &ldquo;Independent,&rdquo; but if there is I think that an early official pronouncement should be made so that workers concerned, who are emigrating in large numbers, and the other parties interested should be given to understand that all hope has not been destroyed. It did appear, as I said when the Report was published, that the paper-making industry was doomed to extinction; but if the matter is to be referred again to the Tariff Commission in consequence of the representations made by the deputation to the President and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, then an official announcement to that effect should be made soon.  The announcement already was made during the progress of a by-election in the constituency in which the mills are situated, and they have been influenced by that fact.  A number of people had the opinion that it was a red herring drawn across the trail in order to deceive the people of Clondalkin for the few days that intervened between the appearance of the notice and the polling at the by-election. Whether that is so or not I do not know, but as the by-election is now over we may have an official contradiction to set all doubts at rest from the Minister for Finance to-day.  The position is that the Irish Free State is at present the only country in the world which permits the importation of paper free of duty.  The surplus products of mills and factories in other countries can be sent in here without any restriction whatsoever.  It is difficult to see any circumstances existing here which would make the imposition of a tariff inadvisable that do not also exist in England, France, or any of the other countries.  The difficulties of the Irish industry have been considerably <Col N="1298" /> aggravated by the fact that in 1926 an import duty of 16? per cent. was imposed upon wrapping papers and cardboard imported into England.</P>
    <P>The same consideration that seemed to weigh so heavily with the Tariff Commission here must also have occurred to the British Government&mdash; the possible effect upon the cost of production of other industries and the cost of living in general.  Yet the British Government seem to think that the competition with which the British mills had to contend was of such a character as to be capable of being considered unfair.  The same competition was offered to the Irish mills and was, in fact, intensified as a result of the British tariff, so that since 1926 the industry here has found very considerable difficulty in carrying on, and there is, in fact, at the moment only one mill in full production.  The Tariff Commission considered this application in relation to various matters set out in the Tariff Commission Act: the efficiency of the industry, the cost of production, the nature of the competition, the effect of the tariff upon other industries and on the public revenues.  I have said already that it is very difficult to understand how, in view of the evidence made available to them and in view of the information relating to the industry published in the Report and their own conclusions under each one of these headings, they recommended against a tariff.  If the wording of the Report were changed slightly, without in any way altering the material, it would appear to be a Report in favour of a tariff rather than against it.  They say, of course, that there are certain objections to the imposition of a tariff.  In the first place, we are told that the industry is not efficient.  We have come up against this efficiency difficulty in relation to every industry which had the audacity to make application to the Tariff Commission. The persons in charge of these industries were each told that they were inefficient, whether they succeeded in getting their application considered favourably or not.  It appears that the paper mills in the Free State are not efficient.  Nobody expected the Tariff Commission to say that they <Col N="1299" /> were efficient.  Some day, perhaps, the Tariff Commission will discover an efficient industry in this country and the effect will be so astonishing that the Dáil will immediately proceed to vote a subsidy to the manager of the mill or to do something of that kind. There is no indication, however, that an efficient industry is likely to be discovered for a long time.  I want to read the paragraph of the Commission's Report which relates to this question of efficiency (paragraph 42):</P>
    <P>The efforts made by the Brown mills to keep working in the face of severe competition, the expenditure which they have incurred in the improvement of their plant, and the satisfactory quality of their products give ground for believing that they would endeavour to improve the industry under the more favourable conditions which a tariff should bring about.  It is to be expected that the mills at present closed would re-open. and if they obtained regular orders, in sufficient volume, all three mills should be able to work full time.</P>
    <P>That is not &ldquo;efficiency,&rdquo; in the opinion of the Tariff Commission.  I do not know exactly what their definition of &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; is.  It seems to me that the obvious meaning of that paragraph which I have just read is that the industry in the Free State is as efficiently conducted as existing circumstances would permit.  The Tariff Commission, of course, tell us that the premises and plant of the mills which they visited in the Free State did not approach in efficiency the premises and plant of the average British mill, but they add: &ldquo;We feel that expenditure warranted by the circumstances of the industry in the Saorstát had been made, or was in process of being made, at this mill&rdquo; (that is, the mill in full production), &ldquo;and that, in view of all the circumstances of the case, the management had secured reasonable efficiency.&rdquo; The efficiency which the Clondalkin mill would be likely to attain was difficult to estimate, because it had been out of production since 1921, and there must have been some deterioration of the machinery.  At the same time there was no reason to <Col N="1300" /> believe that those who would acquire the mill, consequent on the imposition of a tariff, would not be able to conduct it properly and to equip it so as to permit of the production of paper and cardboards, if not as cheaply as they can now be imported, at a price which would be in very close accord with the prices prevailing in other countries.  When we come to consider the question of a possible rise in the price of the products, following a tariff, we must bear in mind that this is the only country in the world in which no tariff on paper exists, and that it can be said that dumping does actually operate.  The term &ldquo;dumping&rdquo; is very hard to define, and it is one in respect of which great differences exist.  But mills in England and on the Continent are able to send, and do in fact send, their products for sale in this country at a price less than they actually procure for their products in the home market.  That, undoubtedly, is happening, and the effect has been practically to kill the industry in the Free State.  The increase in price of the products of the industry following the exclusion of these dumped products is not something to be deplored; it is rather something to be sought for, because the present situation can only be a temporary one in any case.</P>
    <P>As soon as the last Irish mill has disappeared those supplying the market from abroad will be in a position to charge any price they like for their product and will, undoubtedly, set out to recoup themselves for their losses now.  There seems to be no reason whatever to believe that the paper-making industry cannot be fostered here.  At one time it was one of the most important industries in the country. Over a hundred years ago there were 100 mills in production in this country, employing a very large number of people.  In consequence of developments in that industry, and the troubles it had to contend with during that period, the number has now been reduced to four, of which only one is, in fact, working full time.  The case made for the tariff before the Tariff Commission seemed so convincing to one of the firms <Col N="1301" /> which opposed the tariff&mdash;a firm of bag manufacturers which imported the paper&mdash;that they became convinced that the Tariff Commission would have no option but to report in favour of a tariff and they acquired a mill.  They now find that their action was unnecessary.  The Tariff Commission did what they did not expect.  Although this firm were opposing the tariff, they thought that the case for a tariff was so strong that the Commission could not possibly refuse to recommend that a tariff be imposed.  They bought a mill.  They may proceed to work that mill, but in fact, the chances of their doing so, now that free importation is to continue, are slight.  The raw materials of the industry exist in plenty.  They are mainly, as Deputies know, waste paper, rags and things of that kind.  We export a considerable quantity of these materials.  The export of these materials last year was valued at £34,000 or £35,000.  The Tariff Commission recognised that fact, and they say that if the industry received the protection which it asked it would be able to organise the purchase of these materials in a more efficient manner and take steps to obtain a steady and cheap supply which would enable it to reduce its costs.</P>
    <P>The wages paid in the industry are lower than those generally paid in England.  All the parties associated with the application paid tribute to the efficiency of that labour.  The managers of the Irish mills stated that they were quite satisfied, and the Tariff Commission held that their estimate was confirmed by the owners of mills in Great Britain who now employed workers who were formerly engaged at Clondalkin.  The costs of production are somewhat higher, because, of course, the mills are only working spasmodically at present, without any certainty of sale for the products.  It is impossible to say what the costs of production would be if the mills went into full production.  The situation in this case is similar to that in the case of flour production.  Because the mills cannot be worked to their full capacity the costs of production are higher than they otherwise would be.  If a tariff <Col N="1302" /> were imposed only for the time necessary to enable the mills to reach the point of working at full capacity, its removal would leave the mills in a much stronger position to deal with foreign competition than at present.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that if the present position is allowed to continue the industry will disappear.  The loss of employment involved is considerable. The reference in the Commission's Report to the men who were formerly employed in Clondalkin mills, whom they now found employed in English mills during the Commissioners' visit to those mills in Great Britain, is, I think, a condemnation of the delay which took place in affording this industry the protection which it has asked for since the Free State Government was first established.  It seemed possible that some degree of protection would have been given when the British Government decided, in 1926, to impose a customs duty on paper imported into England.  The effect of that duty in England has been to increase the efficiency of the English mills, to decrease the costs of production and to decrease the selling price of the products.</P>
    <P>The imposition of a similar tariff here would have the same effects. Surely the same considerations which seemed to weigh in the mind of the Tariff Commission here applied also in England.  There are firms here who might have to pay a slightly increased price for cardboard and paper used in the packing of their goods, but it would be so infinitesimal that it would have no bad effect of any permanence.  That applies particularly to the tobacco industry. The tobacco factories have practically an absolute monopoly of the home trade.  If there were any possibility of these factories, in consequence of the increased price of wrappers, having to face intensive competition from abroad, there might be some case for rejecting the application. That, however, is not so.  Every factory operating in the Free State will be subject to the same disability, and the market is reserved for them in any case, the possibility of foreign competition increasing being very remote.</P>
    <P>It is hard to know what were <Col N="1303" /> real reasons which influenced the Tariff Commission in producing this recommendation.  It seems to me that on the report the recommendation should have been otherwise.  Those who were present at the inquiry, including one of the firms which appeared in opposition to the application, were satisfied on the evidence&mdash; though I am prepared to admit that the case of the applicants was very badly prepared and not properly presented&mdash;that the Commission would be forced to produce favourable recommendations. They did not really consider the case for a duty on cardboard at all.  They only considered the financial position and commercial stability of certain individuals who acquired an option on the Clondalkin mills.  That was not what the Commission was set up to consider.  Here is an industry which existed, which can exist, and which gave a large amount of employment to skilled workers, an industry in every way suitable to the country and with the raw materials available here. Will that industry be fostered by a tariff?  The answer must be in the affirmative.  There is no case for hoping that the industry can survive under present conditions, and unless a tariff is imposed it is going to disappear. Surely the Free State is not in such a prosperous condition as to be able to afford to watch an industry disappear without taking any steps to preserve it.</P>
    <P>If it is worth while on the part of Great Britain to depart from her traditional policy of free trade and to protect that industry, if it is worth while on the part of every country in the world to protect that industry, surely it should be worth our while also.  If the Free State is to remain the dumping ground for paper mills with a surplus to export to any part of the world, then this very old industry is going to disappear, and the members of the Tariff Commission when they next visit Great Britain will find a much larger number of Irish workers employed in the paper mills there than they did on their last visit. The case for the passage of the motion which appears in my name, the case <Col N="1304" /> for the imposition of a tariff on wrapping paper and cardboard, appears in the Report.  Anyone, like myself, who knows nothing about the industry, except what he learns from this Report, would be able to present here a case for a tariff much stronger than anything which has up to the present been made against it.</P>
    <P>The existing concerns are admittedly efficiently managed.  They have carried on under considerable difficulty in such a manner as to convey a reasonable assurance that if given the advantages of a tariff they will develop their plant and their productive capacity so as to provide the requirements of the country in paper and cardboard.  The costs of production will be reduced.  The efficiency of labour employed in the mills will be increased in consequence of the permanent employment which will be afforded.  The effects upon other industries will be practically negligible and certainly will be no greater than the effects on British industry which resulted from the imposition of a British tariff on paper in 1926.  Surely the Dáil is not going to decide that this industry, which has existed here for hundreds of years, which at one time gave employment to thousands of skilled workers, is to disappear now merely because certain individuals, whom the Commission did not like, acquired an option on the Clondalkin mills, individuals who also, perhaps, were not the best persons to entrust with the management of the mills subject to the imposition of a tariff. There are two or three groups, I understand, who are willing to put up the necessary finances to acquire the mill and operate it, if a guarantee of a tariff is forthcoming.  The attitude of the Commission, however, is the reverse.</P>
    <P>They want to see somebody commit themselves to the purchase of the mills and to their operation as a paper-making concern before they will even proceed to consider the question of a tariff.  That is not their duty; it is putting the cart before the horse.  It is the duty of the Dáil to reverse that order, in order to ensure that progress will be made.  The employment <Col N="1305" /> of a number of workers is at stake. The existence of an old industry, and something more than that, is at stake, because I believe if the Dáil is prepared to reject this motion and to permit the disappearance of that industry on the very insufficient evidence contained in the Report, then there is no hope that the Dáil, as at present constituted, will give any more favourable consideration to any other application which comes before them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given a good deal of consideration to this question since the issue of the Report, and I listened with considerable interest to the speech of Deputy Lemass.  I must say that rarely have I heard Deputy Lemass to less advantage than on this particular case.  We are asked to say that the Dáil disapproves of the action of the Executive Council in accepting the recommendation and in refusing to put a tariff on wrapping paper.  If we disapprove of the action of the Executive Council we are asked to say that what the Executive Council should have done, in spite of this Report of the Tariff Commission, was that they should have forthwith put a tariff on a particular class of paper of 33? per cent.  When one looks at it from that point of view, it becomes impossible for us to say that we disapprove of the action of the Executive Council in this matter.  I feel that if they did, on receiving this Report, put it aside and if they themselves proceeded to impose the tariff asked for, then certainly there would be a case for the Dáil disapproving of their action.  We are committed to the principle of a Tariff Commission or of having a prior examination by some body of an application for a tariff of this kind.  If that is so I think we should have some very considerable regard for the Report which such a body would place before us.  I think that a Report of this kind, having gone into great detail and having the evidence examined and sifted as it has been, should not be turned down by the Executive Council without very grave reasons indeed.  We must remember that the paper industry cannot be put into the same category as flour milling, which concerns an absolutely essential industry.  What is concerned here is the question of whether the industry <Col N="1306" /> is a useful one from the point of view of the country and the point of the labour it gives.  We must recollect that 33? per cent. would be a practically prohibitive tariff.</P>
      <P>We cannot but have regard for the very great volume of opposition which this application brought forth from a very large number of firms of various kinds in the country, firms which employ a good deal of labour.  There were over 20 firms, besides various groups, representing in one case 17 firms, in another 14, and in a third 10, firms like P.J. Carroll, Ltd., tobacco manufacturers, the Irish Butter Exporters' Association, Slattery &amp; Sons, bacon curers; the Master Printers and Allied Trade Associations, and the Sugar Confectioners and Allied Trades Association.  Quite a number of firms which give considerable employment have asserted, and given reasons for their statements, that the tariffs will result in a considerable crippling of trade and would lead to disemployment. In making up our minds as to what decision we should take in this matter, while we should have regard undoubtedly to the increased number of workers who would be employed in the mills, we must likewise have regard to the number of people who might possibly be disemployed in other trades.  I am not by any means against the encouragement of the paper-making industry in this country, but there can be, and I believe there are, other ways of encouraging an industry besides putting on a tariff.  I am not at all of the opinion that the one and only way to encourage industry in this country is to put a tariff on imported goods.  I think there may be other ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass referred to the small increase there would be in the price of paper.  I do not know what evidence he has produced to show that it would be a small increase.  The 33? per cent., if it would be effective at all, would be effective almost to the point of prohibition. In view of these considerations I think, while it may be that this question has not been sufficiently examined and while it may be that there may be other considerations to be taken into account or that some other suggestions might be made to encourage <Col N="1307" /> the industry which will lead to the opening of the Clondalkin mills, no case can be made to sustain the resolution that is here, which, as I say, would practically say that the Dáil was of opinion that what the Executive Council should have done was to reject the Report completely and to put on a tariff.  I am not prepared to support that point of view.</P>
    <P>I am anxious, as all on these benches are anxious, that anything that would lead to permanent employment for people unemployed in the State should be encouraged, but we must at the same time consider the reactions of any such proposal.  I am not satisfied, in this case, that there would be no reaction, and that is what we have to consider when we are asked to support a motion of this kind.  I think that all the questions have been gone into very fully in the Report of the Tariff Commission.  I think it was right on the part of the Commission to satisfy themselves whether or not, on the part of this body, who were the main applicants for the tariff and who were proposing to open the Clondalkin mills, there was, in fact, a real intention to operate the mills.  I am not at all inclined to agree with Deputy Lemass that when a firm comes along and says, &ldquo;we are going to open an industry or operate an industry if you give us the tariff,&rdquo; it should be granted.  I doubt very much how far a principle of that kind should be encouraged.  On the whole, taking all these things into account I am not prepared to vote for this motion.  I propose to vote against it, not because I think that there may not be other ways of encouraging industries but because I feel that if the Executive Council had adopted what would be the implications of this and had imposed a tariff, in spite of this Report, they would be doing something of which this House could not and would not approve.</P>

      <P>I desire to oppose this motion on many grounds.  I have some knowledge of the paper industry. I know that at least two syndicates, <Col N="1308" /> if not three, tried to get a tariff on paper before they bought the Clondalkin mills. Options were got on the mills by a couple of syndicates.  The late Mr. James White, the famous financier, was intimately connected with one.  The object was to secure a profit before the mills were bought. For a period of seventeen or eighteen years I had experience of buying the output of the Clondalkin mills.  I can say, without fear of contradiction, that the output of the mills for twelve or fourteen years was never on an economic basis.  Those of us who tried to keep the mills going by purchasing paper from them, particularly news print, did it from patriotic motives.  We paid a much larger figure for an article that was inferior to the products of British or Continental mills.  I think it would be extremely unwise to attempt, by way of a tariff, to bolster up an industry which, in normal times, could not really succeed, and which could not have been kept going at all were it not for the support it received from the newspapers and printers of Ireland.</P>

      <P>Some of the people who tried to acquire these mills are not <Col N="1309" /> Irishmen.  They were English speculators who came across here to get a guarantee of a tariff, and when they got it they would probably unload this Irish mill on a gullible Irish public. I think it was necessary that this question should have been dealt with by the Tariff Commission.  It has been excellently dealt with by the Tariff Commission.  If my information is right, the Commission delayed their report and gave every opportunity to those so-called philanthropists who wanted to help an Irish industry.  The Commission, however, could never get any document from these people to prove that the mills would be reopened even with a tariff.  When dealing with tariffs, and especially with the paper trade, if you pick out two or three items to be tariffed, what is the effect of that going to be on printers, newspaper users, whether shopkeepers or others, throughout the country?  It would mean that every parcel of paper coming into the country would be held up by the Customs.  There would be no such thing as getting your ordinary supplies without delay.  The newspapers, printers, and traders of the country generally would need to have their agents down at the North Wall begging to get undutiable paper released. If you are going to put a tariff on paper you cannot pick out certain items in the trade for a tariff.  You must either put the tariff on all paper or none.  An attempt was made to put a tariff on certain items in the case of other industries, and it proved an absolute failure.  The effect of putting a tariff on certain classes of paper would mean that you would have a general hold-up at the Customs.</P>
      <P>[<i>An Ceann Comhairle resumed the Chair.</i>]</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass stated that there were thousands employed in this industry. I wonder what period was the Deputy speaking of.  My memory goes back for some time, and I cannot remember when thousands were employed in the paper industry in this country. The Deputy must be speaking of a period some hundreds of years back. A tariff on paper would have such reactions on other industries that it would create unemployment instead <Col N="1310" /> of giving employment.  It is pretty generally known, in the present condition of the paper market all over the world, that even the British mills to-day cannot compete with the Continental mills because their plant is not up-to-date and is not capable of the mass production carried on in other countries.  One of the last industries that we should start in this country, with a view to producing on an economic basis, is one for the production of paper because it cannot be done.  That can only be done in countries that have big forests and cheap power.  Even the British mills are not able to compete with these countries to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be pleased to support this motion if I were satisfied it would in any way benefit the community and if I were satisfied that it would give an appreciable amount of employment in the country.  From what I know of the industry I can easily anticipate what might occur if a tariff such as suggested were placed upon paper bags and cardboard.  I feel I would not be doing justice to those whom I represent nor would I be doing justice to one of our chief industries&mdash;the printing industry&mdash;if I gave any support to this motion or even if I gave a silent vote.  Deputy Lemass when he endeavoured to make a case for this imposition on paper, I feel sure was putting forth his best efforts.  I believe he made one of the best speeches in that connection that I ever heard him make in this House, and I feel sure that he was most sincere in everything he said.  I took a note of one phrase which he made use of and the spirit that permeated right through his advocacy of this tariff was shown where he suggested that if the tariff were imposed it would place the paper bag manufacturers in a much stronger position to compete in this country.  I do not think that during any portion of his speech he made the claim that it could successfully compete.  However, I am not going to labour that point.  But I would point out to the House that the industry which would be chiefly affected by any imposition on paper would be the printing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was stated in evidence before the <Col N="1311" /> Tariff Commission by the Association of Master Printers and Allied Trades who gave evidence that there are over 3,000 people engaged in that industry, and those of us who are conversant with newspaper production know that, on the whole, it is a fairly prosperous industry and that the wages and conditions are undoubtedly fair.  Anything that would tend to militate against the success of that industry would not have my support.  I do not see how any of us sitting on the Labour Benches could support a tariff that could have such reactions as those indicated by Deputy O'Connell, and some of which I am trying to indicate myself.  Do Deputies of the opinion of Deputy Lemass and others supporting this motion know that in nearly all cases now those firms manufacturing paper bags have printing works attached, and the printer is largely dependent, and will be for many years, upon the importation of the paper from abroad?  Deputy O'Hanlon pointed out some of the disabilities under which the trade has laboured for a considerable period. It surprises me that during all those years, even before the imposition of any tariff, when there was a spirit of self-reliance in the country and when the Irish manufacturers got a good deal of support for their paper from patriotic motives primarily, and when there was a great opportunity of developing one side of that industry&mdash; that is to say, the newsprint side&mdash;that it did not become far more lucrative and important.  I have not the figures by me, but the imports of newsprint would represent a considerable volume of all the trade that is done in paper in this country by way of imports.</P>
    <P>I have tried to indicate some of the disabilities that would be put upon the printing industry by a tariff.  At the Tariff Commission a number of witnesses gave evidence to that effect. Already the printing industry is labouring under sufficient disability.  I could well understand Deputy Lemass calling upon the Tariff Commission to put a tariff upon imported printing matter.  There would be something in that case, and a corollary might be to <Col N="1312" /> tax paper, but where you have a less important commodity connected with the great industry of printing I suggest that an attempt to put a tariff on that is putting the car before the horse.  As I have already said, I would only be too happy and willing to lend my support to a motion of this character if I thought it would be of benefit to the country.  But I feel that it would be of no benefit to anybody, or relatively to only a small number of persons who might find employment as a result of this tariff.</P>
    <P>Again, it would all boil down to this in the final analysis, that the consumer would have to pay.  Wrapping paper is, as we all know, a commodity which enters into the daily lives of every one of us.  I remember many years ago when old newspapers used to be bought up by various retailers in Cork and Dublin and elsewhere, but very properly, from motives of hygiene, that traffic was stopped.  Wrapping paper is also a cheap commodity; it is in daily use in our lives, and the poor housekeeper in the end would have to pay for this tariff if it was imposed.  A piece of wrapping paper is placed around a candle or bars of soap or any other commodity used in the household, and it would be the poor housekeeper who would have to pay.  The ordinary consumer would not mind an extra penny, but to the poorer classes of the community, those who live in the alleys and lanes and the slums of the cities, the pennies and the two-pennies matter a great deal.</P>
    <P>I reiterate I would be glad to support this motion if I thought it would not have the reactions pointed out by Deputy O'Connell and emphasised by Deputy O'Hanlon.  Deputy O'Hanlon knows the newspaper trade, and so do I.  I have experience of every branch of the trade, and I say in regard to this tariff in the end it would be the poor who would suffer.  With few exceptions nearly all these tariffs have that effect.  As Deputy O'Connell said, we set up a Tariff Commission to examine these things, and to report upon them to the Executive Council, and, having agreed to that, I do not see why we should depart from it unless it outrages our conscience a very great deal indeed.  That is not the case, and I <Col N="1313" /> propose, therefore, to vote against this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I need take up the time of the House for very long upon this motion.  I think really any arguments which Deputy Lemass advanced have been disposed of by previous speakers. The application, so far as it was an application, of the small mills hardly merited very much consideration, because they only manufactured one or two sorts of paper, common brown and rope brown, and if they were tariffed the probable result would be a very great decrease in their consumption, and the tendency of people to turn still more to the use of kraft paper, which has already, to a very considerable extent, replaced common brown and rope brown.  It was a serious and important application only because the Clondalkin mill was associated with it.  It was, in my opinion, absolutely incumbent upon the Tariff Commission to find out whether there was a group prepared and able to work the Clondalkin mill, and if they had rights to take the mill over and work it if a tariff should be granted.  The Tariff Commission found that there was no such group.  In fact, it became abundantly clear&mdash;the matter seems to me to be very mildly dealt with in the Report&mdash;that the people who professed to be willing and ready to work the Clondalkin mill were not in a position to do so at all, and, in fact, had no such intention.</P>
      <P>I believe Deputy O'Hanlon absolutely hit the nail on the head in his remarks upon that.  In any case, where you find a group of mere speculators having a lien upon a mill and pretending to be prepared to work it in case they get a tariff, the granting of the tariff would, in nine cases out of ten, be but a prelude to some scheme to off-load it upon the Irish public or somebody else at a price greater than it was worth and probably not have it worked at all.  I think it would have been grave negligence if the Tariff Commission, having regard to the fact of the Clondalkin Mills, ignored the question of individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass referred to the fact that a group that were prepared to <Col N="1314" /> work the mill in the event of a tariff being granted had approached the President and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Certain individuals representing a group did approach the President and the Minister for Industry and Commerce. It may be that they represented people able and willing to work the mill, but that remains to be seen.  If there is a group which clearly has the money and the experience and the willingness to work the Clondalkin Mill then the whole question of a paper tariff would require and would merit some further consideration by the Tariff Commission.  I do not know at the present moment whether any such group will appear or whether the people who approached the President and the Minister for Industry and Commerce do in fact represent a group that has the requisite qualifications.</P>
    <P>It should be borne in mind that considering this question of a tariff on paper, even if we had the Clondalkin Mill working, there is quite an appreciable export trade which would be definitely injured by a tariff on paper, and it is by no means certain, even if circumstances were more favourable than when the matter was before the Tariff Commission, that a tariff on paper, on balance, would give any increase in employment. I think it could very easily result in a decrease in employment.  There is no doubt, as Deputy O'Hanlon has said, that in its latter years a great many, if not all, of the customers of the Clondalkin Mills were dissatisfied with the price and the quality of the article they had to buy. I have for many years, and from many quarters, heard grave complaints and, undoubtedly, if the result of the tariff was to be dearer paper and worse paper, the effect on business could easily be such as to lead to a definite decrease as compared with the increase of employment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass talked about a time when a great number of people were employed here in the paper industry. I do not know the time when those people were employed at this industry. But if it were a considerable time ago, then conditions with regard to paper manufacture have changed. There was a time perhaps when we <Col N="1315" /> had the raw materials here.  That was the time when paper manufacture was carried on, on a different basis. We certainly have not to any appreciable extent the raw materials of paper manufacture now.  The real raw material of paper manufacture now is wood pulp.  Certain qualities of paper that are mentioned in this report are made from old paper and other materials, but the real raw material of paper is wood pulp.  We have no wood pulp.  Conditions with regard to the manufacture have entirely changed from the time when rags and such things were the principal constituents of paper.  As Deputy O'Connell has pointed out it would have been a most unjustifiable proceeding for the Executive Council, after having received this report, to have come down to the House and proposed a tariff on paper.  It seems to me that, from the point of view of the application put forward, this is a devastating report.  I cannot imagine how Deputy Lemass had the nerve, having read this Report, to get up and make the speech he made, and ignore the facts that are brought out in the Report, and indeed ignore what are really the main factors in the whole situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrady" hpid="Mr. Brady Mr. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this motion.  We were told for a number of years that one reason why we did not get industries in this country was because we had not a tradition behind us.  In fact it is well known that many of our manufacturers who are now in a fairly flourishing condition, owing to the operations of the tariff, had in point of fact to label their goods as made across the water before those goods would be purchased.  Here we have an industry with great traditions behind it.  We have mills in Clondalkin working for over half a century; we have what we lack in practically everything we start&mdash;skilled tradesmen. We also have very suitable conditions. We have, I am told, water in this district second to none for this particular industry.  In fact it is the one big factor that would induce any cross-Channel paper manufacturer <Col N="1316" /> to try to acquire the mills at Clondalkin.  We also have the mills very close to the city.  For this reason. I think the Executive Council should reconsider its decision with reference to the application for a tariff on this particular kind of paper.</P>
      <P>The total capacity, according to the Report before us, of the various mills for the particular form of papers for which a tariff was asked comes to something like 7,000 tons per annum. The total import comes to something between 7,000 and 8,000 tons per annum.  In other words, we have already a market for the total capacity of the mills operating at present in the country, and while that is so, according to the Report, the actual amount of paper produced at these mills only comes to about 900 tons instead of the 7,000 tons which they are capable of producing.</P>
      <P>During the period when the paper mills were either idle or working on very short time the Stationery Office imported a very considerable amount of paper, and that is one point that I would like the Minister to explain, because I have asked the question of his officials on a number of occasions, and I have failed to get a satisfactory explanation.  They have imported to the extent of £235,000 worth of paper. Of that, £4,529 worth was packing paper.  For every pound's worth of that paper that was made in the Free State £15 worth was imported, so that in the Stationery Office alone, if our mills got protection, there would be a considerable customer for keeping them in action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one thing that appeals to me very strongly on this particular question is the fact that if the mills in Clondalkin are not saved it is admitted by the officials of the Department that that means the closing down of all the paper mills in the country, even those working on short time at present.  The House knows that very recently the mill at Clondalkin had its machinery put up for auction, and that machinery was sold for something like £5,000, or approximately one-eighth of the original value of the machinery.  That machinery has been carted out and sent across to the other side for scrap purposes.  I am told that the essential <Col N="1317" /> machinery is still there, so that if something is done, and done soon, that portion of the machinery will be saved. I am also informed that the buildings in Clondalkin were reconstructed about six or seven years ago, and that preparation was made for installing the most up-to-date machinery there, so that the buildings themselves are reconstructed in such a fashion that at any time, if the necessary capital is forthcoming, the most up-to-date machinery can be installed there.</P>
    <P>The local people, who are naturally concerned about the mills, informed me that during several elections very encouraging promises were made to them.  I understand that the late Mr. Kevin O'Higgins told the people there was no danger of the Clondalkin Mills going out of existence.  I believe there was correspondence between Mr. O'Higgins and some of the people concerned. I think there has been great neglect on the part of the Executive Council over these mills, and it would be a very grave mistake if the recommendation of the Tariff Commission is sanctioned by this House. It would mean the going out of existence of one of our remaining industries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Anthony told us that if this duty were imposed the poor would suffer.  In point of fact the poor around the district where the mills are situate are already suffering and have been suffering for a number of years, so the Deputy cannot earnestly put forward that claim.  He said that it would be much more reasonable if Deputy Lemass advocated a duty on imported printing rather than on imported paper.  The poor would suffer there too, so that is not a logical argument.  I hope the Executive Council will change its attitude on this matter and, before it is too late, decide to save the paper milling industry.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister if it is not a fact that certain Irish people concerned in this industry have approached the Executive Council&mdash; people for whom the officials in the Department concerned have very great respect on account of their knowledge. I am informed that certain Irish people approached the Minister and <Col N="1318" /> gave an undertaking that if a tariff were put on paper they would find the necessary capital and they would give a guarantee that the mills would be reopened. If that is a fact I think it should be definitely announced to the House.  I am told on very good authority that it is so, and that the only thing that prevents the mills being reopened is the refusal of the Government to impose a tariff on paper.</P>

      <P>I did hear the last sentence but I also heard the previous sentence, and that definitely was an encouragement for foreign capital. It seems strange that on one day we are anxious to keep out foreign capital and the next day we are anxious to get it in.  In one sentence we are told we do not want it and in the next sentence we are told it is necessary.  The whole thing seems very inconsistent.  I think that if we are able to get native capital it would be very desirable; if we can get Irishmen to invest capital in native industries by all means let us do so; but if we cannot get that then I will be in favour of joining with Deputy Brady in encouraging foreign capital. It would be much better to have foreign capital invested than no capital at all.  It would be better to have workmen employed with foreign capital than to have unemployed on the dole.  Some time ago a tariff was applied for, but soon after those who applied for the tariff were very anxious to drop it.  Foreign capital came in and put the industry going. People there did their utmost to break the foreign capitalist, but now we are at our wits' end to know how to accommodate the foreign capitalist.  I am anxious to know whether the Opposition have reached the point of <Col N="1319" /> view that it is better to have foreign capital than no capital at all.</P>

      <P>I have read this report of the Tariff Commission and the first thing I have to do is to congratulate the members upon the soundness of their academic views, and upon the meticulous way in which they have troden the paths of the investigation prescribed for them.  They have examined this tariff, as all of us can see, by taking the paragraphs one after the other in relation to the efficiency, extent and relative importance of the industry, the amount of capital invested therein, the numbers employed therein, the total annual value of the goods produced by such industry, the cost of the production of such goods in Saorstát Eireann as compared with such cost in other countries, and they made a very minute examination of the condition of the industry as it exists.  But they became lost in a mass of detail.  They have been so absorbed in their examination of these conditions that they have quite forgotten to look at industry as a whole, and to place it in its true relation to our present economic position.  Though there has been a good deal of reference to the effect which this tariff would have on the drapers of the City, on the tobacco manufacturers of the City, and upon some of the printers in the City, they have not for a moment contemplated what might have been the effect of the tariff upon our agricultural industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the House will advert to the volume of agricultural statistics which was issued in 1926 it will recall that according to the official figures then published the land of this country was carrying very many more persons engaged in agriculture per acre than was the case in other countries in Europe; that by far a very much greater proportion of our people was engaged in agriculture than in Denmark or any other of those countries which are supposed to be mainly agricultural countries.  The conclusion, to my mind, of that is this: that too many of our people are compelled to secure a mere sustenance upon the soil <Col N="1320" /> of this country.  That is one of the reasons why our agriculture is in a comparatively backward state and those who are engaged in the industry do not get a sufficient <i>per capita</i> remuneration from it.  One of the problems that must invariably face the Government here&mdash;one of the problems from which it cannot escape&mdash;is how we are going to absorb our surplus agricultural population in industry. Here, in paper-making, was an industry which afforded an opportunity of absorbing an additional 440 people within it.  It would have taken these 440 off the roll of the unemployed or off the overtaxed land.</P>
    <P>Of all the pleas that have been advanced in support of the Tariff Commission proposal, to my mind, the one that can be least sustained is the argument that this tariff is going to increase the cost of living.  I say that because of the industries which it is alleged would be principally affected if it were imposed.  We had Deputy Anthony getting up, and like the carpenter after he had eaten the oysters with tears streaming from his eyes, telling us about the poor old woman and her penny candle, and the increase in the cost of that candle which would follow if a tariff were imposed upon paper.</P>
    <P>I made a calculation in the course of Deputy Anthony's speech and I found that 17,920 sheets of kraft paper cost £22 a ton.  If a tariff of 33? per cent. were imposed on that particular class of paper the increase in the cost of a sheet of that paper measuring 36 by 48 inches would be, approximately, half a farthing.  A sheet of that size would wrap up 96 candles and the increase in the cost of the wrapping of the candle would be fourteen-thousandths of a penny.  We can imagine the extreme difficulty with which Deputy Anthony's poor old woman would scrape in the bottom of her purse in order to find the fourteen thousandth of a penny to meet the increase in the cost of living which this tariff had occasioned.</P>
    <P>It is strange that the increase in the cost of living was stressed by Deputy Anthony and by Deputy O'Hanlon, two Deputies who, I believe, are admittedly interested in a business which is <Col N="1321" /> already heavily subsidised by the State, namely, the newspaper industry. The newspapers of this country are carried through the post far below the cost of the service, while telegraphic and telephonic messages for newspapers are also transmitted far below the cost of the service.  Though these two Deputies, whose avocations have already resulted in a very considerable increase in the cost of living of the people of the State, based their arguments in support of the Tariff Commission's finding on that ground, nevertheless the Tariff Commission itself does not attach any importance whatsoever, or at least a negligible importance, if one might express one's self in a contradiction in terms, so far as the cost of living is concerned, because the Tariff Commission itself is honest enough to say that the tariff would tend to add&mdash;they were not even so positive about it, and are not even prepared to make the definite statement&mdash;to the cost of living, the addition would be inappreciable, so also in this case the cost of living.</P>
    <P>The Commission said &ldquo;it would tend to add, though not appreciably, to the cost of living.&rdquo;  Just as a straight line tends to become crooked, nevertheless for practical purposes it remains a straight line.</P>
    <P>I would ask the House further to consider some aspects of this argument about the cost of living.  One of the principal industries which it has been alleged is going to be affected if this tariff were imposed, and if employment were found for 440 hands who are at present unemployed and a burden on the whole community, is the tobacco industry.  It might be injured; this tariff, it is alleged, might be the last straw that breaks the camel's back.  Let us see what the Minister for Finance has already done to this poor tobacco industry, the people engaged in which are able to pay dividends of 20 per cent., and periodically to make distributions of their reserve funds that represent very considerable fortunes in many cases to those who have large holdings in that concern. When we hear what the Minister has already done to this poor struggling tobacco industry we shall see how much validity there is in the argument that a tariff on paper is going to injure <Col N="1322" /> that particular industry, so far as the Free State is concerned.</P>
    <P>So that there might be no doubt as to the reliability of the figures I am going to quote, I have before me the Census of Production issued the other day.  In Report No. 1, dealing with the tobacco industry, I find that the gross output, including cost of ingredients, fuel, purchase of cases, etc., amounted in 1929 to £5,215,746.  Of that £5,215,746, the Minister for Finance, who has fled lest he should hear how cruelly he has treated this overburdened industry, took no less a sum than £3,215,073 by way of duty on the raw materials of an industry which, we are told, is of prime importance to the people of this State.  Now there is a terrific outcry amongst manufacturers when you propose to tax the raw materials. But think of it: out of an industry whose gross output is something like £5,250,000, the Minister for Finance takes no less than £3,250,000 out of it, and then come here to wail about the unemployment which would be caused by this tariff on paper, which, if we had imposed it, would mean an increased tax which would not exceed, I believe, £40,000.</P>
    <P>According to another table in this Report, I find that the estimated cost of purchases of cases, tins, cartons, wrapping paper, etc., sold with the goods purchased, the cost of replacing tools, the cost of materials used by the firms' own work people in the execution of repairs on the firms' buildings and plant amounted during 1929 to £147,470.  Now I think I am exceedingly generous if I allow £100,000 of that sum to represent the cost of the cartons, wrapping paper, etc., sold with the goods produced, and upon that basis a tariff of 33? per cent. would only add an additional burden&mdash;I will not say burden upon this industry, because that would be incorrect&mdash;would only withdraw from the huge profits of this industry a sum of £33,000, an industry out of which the Minister for Finance has taken £3,250,000.  Let us be quite clear.  The imposition of this £33,000 upon the tobacco industry in consequence of a tariff on paper is not going to reduce the consumption of tobacco and cigarettes in this country. If the industry is so strong that it can carry £3,250,000, it can carry that <Col N="1323" /> £33,000 which is necessary in order to start the Clondalkin and other paper mills.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Tariff Commission investigated this application with such an excess of academic enthusiasm that they have quite lost sight of the practical realities of the case.</P>
    <P>I think there is one other point I would like to deal with and that was the point made by the Minister for Finance.  He said, I think, that this tariff would mean dearer paper and worse paper: the effects, he said, would be serious and would result in greatly increased unemployment.  Let us examine that proposition for a moment.  The suggestion there is that if the paper is a little dearer, or if it is a little worse, it is going to result in diminution of purchases by the general community, that a man who wants to buy a pair of boots because the soles have gone beyond repair or, a man who must buy another coat because his coat is too tattered for further patching is not going to buy a pair of boots or a coat because he dislikes the paper in which they are wrapped.  That is the real purpose of the argument which the Minister for Finance pretended to state seriously in this House.  I am not surprised that after he realised the effect of it he should have fled.</P>
    <P>It has been said also that these mills are inefficient, and that because the industry is inefficient, because of the fact that it has been closed out of those markets in which it has a first claim, inefficient because it has not been provided with the necessary credit facilities, inefficient because those who were formerly responsible for its operation in Clondalkin were caught in the financial catastrophe which occured in England after the Cunliffe Commission had recommended that the banks should pursue a certain policy of deflation, inefficient altogether for reasons outside of its own control, the recommendation of the Tariff Commission is, that the industry should be allowed to die.  Let us apply that to the case of a man who is suffering from mal-nutrition, let us apply it to the case of a man who has had an attack of influenza or of pneumonia and is slowly recovering. <Col N="1324" /> He is inefficient, it is quite impossible for him to work, quite impossible for him to maintain himself in the competition of this hard world. Therefore, on the same basis as the Tariff Commission has sentenced this paper industry to death, the man who is suffering from mal-nutrition, who is convalescent, should not be given an opportunity to recover; he should be allowed to die.  That is a perfect analogy with the arguments advanced in regard to the paper-making industry in Clondalkin.</P>
    <P>Suppose for one moment that the Irish Associated Creameries had been dealt with in that callous, hardhearted way by the Minister for Agriculture or by the Executive Council as a whole; suppose for one moment that the Irish Associated Creameries, on the verge of bankruptcy, trembling and about to collapse, had been permitted to go to pieces in that way, what would have been the consequences for the Minister for Agriculture and for the Executive Council?  Yet the case of the Clondalkin paper mills is on all fours with that.  If the Executive Council were justified in imposing a tariff of £5 per cwt. upon butter, and I am not going to say they were not justified&mdash;if they were justified in that and, therefore, in increasing the cost of living to the whole community very appreciably, surely they are not justified, on the grounds that it would increase the cost of living, in refusing a tariff upon a commodity which is not a necessary of life, which is not, I believe, with the exception of the tobacco industry, an essential material for any other industry in this country, upon a commodity a tariff which, according to the Tariff Commission, would not have appreciably or significantly increased the cost of living. The Government which has come to this House and recommended a tariff of £5 per cwt. upon butter cannot consistently refuse a tariff which the paper-making industry has applied for.  At least, they cannot refuse to grant it on the grounds that the tariff would increase the cost of living, and they cannot refuse to grant it on the grounds that the industry is inefficient, because there has been no greater inefficiency shown in any <Col N="1325" /> industry, within the memory of this House at any rate, than that which was displayed during the past 12 months by those who were charged with the marketing of the output of the Irish creameries.  The Minister who was responsible for the tariff, and the Executive Council who were responsible for it, know that just as well as I do.</P>
    <P>The effects of this tariff, I think, should also be looked at from another point of view.  I am not one of those who believe that the burden upon the community can be increased indefinitely, but I do say that in certain directions there is room for increased taxation.  Year after year, since he first became responsible for the finances of the Twenty-six Counties, the Minister for Finance has come to this House and, in order to balance his Budget, has segregated his expenditure into two classes, normal and abnormal.  The normal is met out of the ordinary course of revenue, the abnormal is met by borrowing.  As I have said, the tariff on paper would not be a tariff upon any essential material of any industry with the exception, possibly, of the tobacco industry, and to a certain extent the newspaper industry, which is already heavily subsidised by the State, and therefore should make some return to the State.  Therefore it is a material which could, I believe, easily bear a tariff, because the tobacco industry is a luxury trade, and the newspaper industry to a certain extent is a luxury trade also.  There is no man going to starve because he cannot read a newspaper. The Minister for Finance, as I have already pointed out, has been accustomed to defray a large part of his annual expenditure by borrowing.  The consequence of that has been that almost £20,000,000 of State expenditure has been defrayed out of borrowed money, and on account of that the taxpayer has to find at least an additional £1,000,000 per year.  I do not suppose that next year the Minister is going to come to this House and say that this vicious principle of segregating expenditure under the heads of &ldquo;nor mal&rdquo; and &ldquo;abnormal&rdquo; is going to cease.  He is going to come again to <Col N="1326" /> the House and say that he must borrow next year a few hundred thousand pounds more.  It would be to the benefit of the whole community that the amount of money which has to be borrowed every year should be reduced to a minimum.  It would be much better for the future of this State if we were able to pay our way as we go. If we were able to do that it would be better for the community as a whole, and taxation raised in that way would be taxation profitably re-employed afterwards in the State.  Here in this tariff the Minister has a way of raising, I believe, £110,000 per year mainly out of luxury trades, and for the rest of it out of a material which is not an essential material of any other industry in this State beyond the tobacco trade.</P>
    <P>It would be sound public finance to impose this tariff.  This is one of the tariffs which the community as a whole could bear. It would, apart altogether from increased employment, bring returns in other ways to the community.  For instance, I may as well consider the effect upon the unemployed population. The figures published in the Tariff Commission Report are very significant figures.  I am not sure whether the House is aware of them.  A detailed statement in connection with the application was read before the Tariff Commission on the 12th May, 1928.  At that time there were 74 hands employed in the paper-making industry in this country.  When the Tariff Commission visited Killeen mills they found there were only 16 hands employed.  That, I believe, was the only mill working at full time when the Tariff Commission was making its investigation.  The number of people continuously engaged in the industry on the 12/5/1928 had shrunken, I think, to 16, when the Tariff Commission was making its investigation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, just as one can blame a snail because it takes a month to climb a wall, so one can say that the reduction in the number of those employed was due to the Tariff Commission. I do not want to put any greater responsibility upon them than <Col N="1327" /> that.  The Tariff Commission on the other hand stated that if the tariff were imposed it is probable that the effect would be to increase the number of hands employed in the industry to 461 and the difference between the 16 hands at present employed and the 461 which would be employed if the tariff was granted is 445, of whom I think about 350 are men, the heads of families, because the hands are definitely segregated into &ldquo;women, men, boys and girls.&rdquo;  These 350 are at present maintained in idleness by home assistance or by public charity, or they in some other way constitute a burden on this community.  These men are not permitted to starve in this country.  We keep them barely alive at a cost, in my opinion, of not less than £35,000 a year.  If they were employed in this country we should have to offset that against the £110,000 which the tariff might bring in.  I do not think the burden would be so great as that.  The tobacco people would still bring in the cigarette papers which are necessary and the fine wrappings which are necessary, into the country.  Certain of the luxury shops in Grafton Street would still import the fine tissue which they use in the wrapping up of jewellery, articles of female adornment, and so on.  Therefore, I do not think that the total first cost of this tariff would be anything like £110,000. But I do know that if it were imposed the burden of £35,000 which is at present imposed upon the community to keep 445 men in idleness would be immediately lifted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no use considering these tariffs in an academic way.  There is no use losing ourselves in detail.  There is no use making investigations into the present efficiency of the industry.  The industry is frankly not as efficient as it might be, but at the same time we do know that there is one mill maintaining itself in open competition again British mills which themselves in their own market have been protected by a tariff of 16 per cent.  The burden of that tariff upon British manufacturers is very much greater in proportion than the burden which this tariff would impose on our people. There are no manufacturers likely to <Col N="1328" /> be affected by this tariff beyond possibly the tobacco industry, and to a certain extent the printing industry.</P>
    <P>This tariff, while it would protect our paper makers, would to a certain extent protect our printers, because I believe one of the effects of it would be that in regard to certain articles the printers would secure cheaper paper than that which at present they have to import.  That might possibly result in a change in the fashion of wrapping articles in this country.  Surely we are not going to stand up and say that if because we have not got the natural facilities, and therefore cannot produce the best class of wrapping paper in this country, we are not going to produce what the experience of our lifetime has taught us is in certain circumstances a good substitute for the best?  The introduction of kraft paper is comparatively recent.  The community was able to get along with the old Irish manufactured brown paper quite well, and if by reason of this tariff it is driven back to the use of the old Irish brown paper so much the better.</P>
    <P>We have quite a lot of rags in this country, and if the present policy of the Government continues they will be even more plentiful still, because there will not be a man engaged in industry in this country who will earn enough to put a sound coat on his back.  We have a plentiful supply of the raw material and, therefore, since the raw material is here in great enough quantities we ought to make out of it what may not be from the point of view of appearance the most attractive article, but what is, from the point of view of general utility, quite as good.  When we have gone to France and elsewhere we have noticed that they do not use there what is fashionable in other countries, but that they use what they can produce for themselves.  We have seen the manner in which French matches and tobaccos are packed, and I do not think the standard of living of the French people as a whole has been injuriously affected because the boxes are made up a trifle more crudely than the boxes in which the finer cigarettes coming from the tobacco manufacturers here are packed.  The same thing applies in regard to collars and other <Col N="1329" /> articles.  Where we cannot produce the best and where we can produce an article which is a fair substitute for the best and will serve our purpose, we ought, notwithstanding anything which those interested in the distributing trades, such as drapery and other trades, may say, content ourselves with the things we can make out of our own natural resources.</P>

      <P>I did not wish to intervene in this debate, but I am tempted to do so, inspired by the eloquence and rhetoric of the Deputy who has just spoken.  I want to examine one or two of his arguments and his conclusions.  I will put the case this way: Anything put up by our Ministers on this side is a matter which it is the bounden duty &mdash;I had almost said the moral duty&mdash; of Fianna Fáil to oppose by any argument however specious, by any doctrine, however absurd, and by any proposals which they think fit.  I will summarise my view by putting up a parallel case.  Suppose, by some strange fatuity, the President, whom I see here to-night, put forward a question, whether this House should discuss the Ten Commandments, I am sure Deputy de Valera would consider it his bounden duty to say that Moses was absolete, that we had evolved.  Deputy Lemass is, of course, well grounded in the Christian principles of the faith, so I come to the Deputy who has just spoken, Deputy MacEntee, whose imagination is perfect and whose conduct and language in this House always meet with my approval.  On the Seventh Commandment, Deputy MacEntee would say that Moses was a bit weak. That represents the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party on the social questions that came up here for the last few days.  It is not fair; it is not straight dealing, when we are making an honest effort to improve the social conditions, that this claptrap should be inflicted upon this House.  While I am not protesting against it, I am certainly registering my disapproval of it.</P>

      <P>I think it is as well that this motion was moved.  It gives an opportunity of learning again the views of the Fianna Fáil Party <Col N="1330" /> with regard to any application upon which judgment has been passed by the Tariff Commission.  If ever there was an application for a tariff which showed the necessity for thorough-going examination, this particular application is the one.  Over and over again, there have been comments made &mdash;the comments were generally laughed at&mdash;as to the dangers of bringing in a certain amount of chicanery and graft when tariff matters are treated lightly.  The Tariff Commissioners' report shows what would have happened if there had been a sudden rush into a tariff on this particular application.  Will anybody read the paragraphs that deal with all the movements in regard to the Clondalkin mills and not feel convinced that, if we had suddenly rushed into the granting of a tariff such as was asked, there simply would have been a bit of speculation, a very definite bit of gambling, in regard to that mill, and that we would have had not any real safeguard with regard to business being done hereafter through that mill, but that there would have been &ldquo;put over&rdquo; upon the people of this country a transaction profitable to the people that were concerned, but which would certainly not have any profit for the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been numerous complaints about the delay in connection with this Report.  When people read the Report, will these complaints hereafter be made?  Can it not be realised from the Report, if it never was realised before, that the only chance there is of getting a paper industry going in a proper way in this country is almost entirely based upon whether or not the Clondalkin mill can be got going?  Can there be anything said with regard to delay except that the Commissioners delayed until the very last point in order to see if there was any decent business going to be done in regard to Clondalkin mill?  Was that a delay in order to destroy the tariff, or was it to see if there was a reasonable proposition likely to be brought forward in regard to this mill?  The way in which that application was dealt with, the fact that the Tariff Commissioners gave certain <Col N="1331" /> people sufficient time to have certain manoeuvring exposed, ought to serve as a warning to the House as to what is going to happen on the granting of an application without a thorough-going examination.  I mentioned this in connection with certain other tariffs.  I mentioned it in connection with milling. I have talked about the danger of the speculator.  I spoke of the difficulties we are up against on the part of people who buy bankrupt or rival concerns, hoping there will be an enhanced price to be got afterwards on a sale, the addition to the value to the particular concern being made simply by the fact that it has got a certain market secured for it in the country. If there ever was a warning required; if people were not, in their own mind, sure that that was the situation and that danger lurked always about any application, there is clear evidence of it in this Report.  Clondalkin being disposed of temporarily, the fact that the whole movements in connection with that were such that the Tariff Commissioners had to neglect Clondalkin as a mill likely to be in operation soon in this country; the fact that the Government also had to neglect it as a mill likely to be in operation soon in this country&mdash;that being the situation in regard to Clondalkin, what else are we left with?  Can anybody say that there is a really valuable industry working efficiently, efficiency always being considered in relation to the circumstances of this country?  Can anyone say, once Clondalkin is taken out of the picture, that there is any evidence here that there would be an industry working in an efficient, business like way, efficiency being regarded in relation to the circumstances of the country?  That Report is a most striking example of the necessity for a proper, thorough-going examination of these applications.</P>
    <P>I do not know where Deputy MacEntee gets some of his figures.  The Deputy has really urged this in the portion of his speech which I heard as if he was urging a revenue tax. One of the complaints of Deputies on the opposite side is that the tariffs which we put on are put on for revenue purposes.  Deputy MacEntee wants this.  The main burden of his <Col N="1332" /> song to-night was &ldquo;This will bring in £110,000 per annum.&rdquo;  The applicants did not seem to think that that was likely to be the result.  They estimated a gain to the revenue of £14,000.  The difference between the applicants' sober calculation and Deputy MacEntee's imaginative description is the difference between people who know their business and people who are making a political case.  The estimate of £14,000 was based on particular figures.  Deputy MacEntee says £110,000, and on that basis wants a tariff.  Is it a protective tariff or a revenue tariff?  His whole speech was on the lines of a revenue tariff.  He referred to the luxury trades.  The luxury trades are peculiar.  The cigarette trade, he says, is a luxury trade.</P>
    <P>I wonder what would have been said if, in the discussion raised last night in connection with certain tobacco manoeuvring which is going on at present, I had said that the matter did not require very much consideration because the whole tobacco manufacturing business is a luxury business and is therefore not deserving of the consideration that one might give to a business of another type.  I wonder where does the Deputy get his economics from.  We heard a lot about old-time economics.  It is a very oldtime economic book that describes tobacco any longer as a luxury.  Even before the War, it moved to being considered as somewhere between the category of a necessity and a luxury. Certainly, I never heard of any economic treatise since the war that classed tobacco as a luxury article. I have seen no classification of trades which classified the tobacco industry as a luxury industry at this period of the world's history.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy cannot take the obvious implication from my remarks I will not assist him.  The Deputy referred to the newspaper trade as being a luxury trade.  I am sorry that the Deputy did not develop that point of view.  Unfortunately he stopped at these two trades.  There is a variety of trades spoken of in <Col N="1333" /> the Report as likely to be affected adversely owing to the high manufacturing costs of paper in this country. Are they the only two?  The two which he picks out as luxuries are tobacco and newspapers.  Are the others, at any rate, to be regarded as articles that one would like to see produced here and whose costs, either first or final, would be increased by reason of the fact that paper, in some form or another, comes into their use?</P>
      <P>The objection to this application has been based on two points, that when one looks into the industry as it was in recent times in this country it was the Clondalkin mills first and foremost, above anything else, and three or four smaller mills.  So far as Clondalkin was concerned, we found that it could not be kept running, and so long as that situation exists there is no case for a tariff being granted.  So far as the others are concerned, it is definitely stated here, and has to be accepted on the evidence given, that the manufacturing costs are higher, and as the industry is of relative minor importance there is no question of a tariff.  I believe that the point has been raised here that Clondalkin is not yet out of the picture.  That has been represented to me as being the case.  I have had a visit from people who say that they want to do real business in the matter of Clondalkin mills. They are different, I think, from any of the groups mentioned here.  They say they have capital behind them, and that they intend not merely to buy the mills as a speculation but to work and run the place.  If that is the case they can make application to the new Tariff Commission.  There are new circumstances then that might warrant a re-examination of the case.  That does not get away from the value of this Report and the proper conclusions drawn in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how far the newcomers are serious or not.  It was quite clear that, on the statements made to me in my office, I could not come to any decision.  They talked in rather big figures in regard to capital. They talked in a persuasive way in regard to the people behind them, and they talked in a businesslike way as to what was intended.  All these <Col N="1334" /> statements have to be tested, and there was no aid to me at the time to get their statements examined.  They left me, stating that they would themselves put their proposition on paper.  They hoped that that statement of theirs would be treated as an application and would get examination.  I promised that it would be examined, not by me or my Department but by the Tariff Commission.  That is the situation in which this question of a tariff is at the moment.  The Clondalkin mills being out of the picture, it has to be out of the picture on that report.  On the evidence before the Commissioners there never was a report which was better justified, and no report ever better justified our attitude towards tariffs.  Clondalkin being out of the picture there is no reason for a tariff as far as other mills are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister for Industry and Commerce did not think fit to say more about the motion before the Dáil.  He talked about the immorality of gambling, the difficulties of the tobacco industry and the newspaper industry, but he said very little concerning the paper-making industry. I am prepared to agree with him, and to go as far as I can in the suppression of gambling, but a Tariff Commission was not established to suppress gambling.  It was established to consider applications for protective measures designed to promote industry.  The Commission and the Minister between them may have succeeded in giving a useful lesson to certain individuals who thought they could gamble with the machinery established by the State, but they have also succeeded in creating a position in which it appears that a very old Irish industry is going to disappear.  Is that a victory?  Are we to congratulate the members of the Tariff Commission and the Minister for Industry and Commerce because they have succeeded in establishing a moral standard in relation to these applications which apparently did not exist heretofore or are we to condemn them because in their anxiety to establish that moral standard, they have produced a position in which a large number of unemployed people are likely to remain <Col N="1335" /> unemployed unless they do as a number of them have already done&mdash; emigrate to England and elsewhere to find work?</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that it appears at present that the maintenance of the Clondalkin mill is the only chance for the paper-making industry in the State.  If the Clondalkin mill goes, then it is going to be much more difficult to re-establish that industry in future.  Is there any need for the Clondalkin mill to go?  The Minister made reference to certain people who met him in accordance with the report in the Press and who stated that they were prepared to put up the necessary finances to operate the mill. The Minister wants to know are they serious.  Is the Minister serious?  If these people convince him that they can put up the necessary finances and that they are going to operate the mill, will they get a tariff?  That is not the attitude of the Tariff Commission. That has not been the attitude of the Minister heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These people say they are prepared to go ahead if they are assured that a tariff will be forthcoming.  The Minister wants to see them start first, to enter into certain financial commitments, to gamble on the Tariff Commission acceding to their application, and, judging by the reports we have had from the Tariff Commission, its decisions are very largely based, not on the merits of the case, but on the manner of its presentation.  It is very largely a gamble that the Minister is asking these people to undertake.  Is the position this, that if reliable, reputable persons are available with the necessary financial resources to acquire and restart the Clondalkin mill they will get a tariff?  That is not the position. The Minister knows that is not the position.  He knows from these people that they are anxious to proceed, but the project of re-opening the mill will have to go before the Tariff Commission, and probably remain before it for two years, with the possibility that at the end of that time they will meet with the same fate as the flour-millers, the coachbuilders and the rest of them after they have wasted a <Col N="1336" /> very considerable portion of the financial resources that the Minister insists they should possess.</P>
    <P>One point the Minister made in relation to the application for a tariff was that the costs of production are higher.  Of course they are higher. If they were not higher there would be no need for a tariff.  Were not the costs of production in the English mills higher in 1926 than they are now?  Of course they were.  The British tariff enabled the British mills to reduce the cost of production, and it would have the same effect here.  When you have mills working part-time, broken time, and uncertain of being able to find a market for their products, workers probably dissatisfied because of their unsatisfactory conditions and uncertain hours, you cannot have efficiency or the reduction in costs which the Minister seems to demand should come before, and not subsequent to, the imposition of a tariff.</P>
    <P>The Minister's attitude seems to be entirely unreasonable.  If there is a reasonable prospect that those in control of the industry will avail of the tariff and that the particular group applying for this tariff will increase their plant and will develop their productive capacity, then the tariff should be given to them, and there is a reasonable prospect to assume that. The Tariff Commission says so.  I shall read again what they say:</P>
    <P>The efforts made by the Brown mills to keep working in the face of severe competition, the expenditure which they have incurred in the improvement of their plant and the satisfactory quality of their products give ground for the belief that they would endeavour to improve the industry under the more favourable conditions which the tariff would bring about.  It is to be expected that the mills at present closed would reopen, and if they obtained regular orders in sufficient volume all three mills would be able to work full time.</P>
    <P>In view of that conclusion of the Tariff Commission, in view of the fact that the industry did exist and prospered in this country for many years, in view of the fact that it is obviously suited to <Col N="1337" /> the country, and in view of the fact that every other country in the world protects this industry, there is no ground for the rejection of the case put before the Tariff Commission except the case which the Minister made, that it was necessary to kill this industry in order to discourage persons gambling on the prospect of a tariff. If our sole concern is to suppress gambling, to raise the moral standard <Col N="1338" /> of Irish industrialists, then undoubtedly the Minister and the Tariff Commission are to be congratulated, but if our concern is to ensure that industries will be started and developed and that employment will be given to our people in their own country, then it is the duty of the Dáil to express dissatisfaction with the Tariff Commission and the Minister by passing this motion.</P>

      <P>The qualifications prescribed as essential for the post of county librarian were a good general education and training in, or experience of, library work.  A diploma in library training and practical experience in office organisation were stated to be desirable, but not essential.  A substantial preference was to be given to qualified candidates with a competent knowledge of Irish.  If no such candidate were available for Mayo, the successful candidate would be required to comply with the terms of the Local Offices and Employments (Gaeltacht) Order, 1928.</P>
      <P>There were five posts to be filled. The Selection Board, having interviewed all the candidates, reported that only five were fully qualified according to the terms of the advertisement. Two of these had a competent knowledge of Irish, the remaining three had some slight knowledge of the language.  Preference having been given, as prescribed, to the two candidates who had a competent knowledge of Irish the five candidates were placed in order of merit and a choice of the five posts was given to the candidates according to their place in this order of merit.  The recommendation of Miss Dunbar for the appointment in Mayo resulted from these arrangements.</P>
      <P>Miss Dunbar had attended a course of library training in the National University and her library experience was obtained during a training of 1¼ years in the libraries of County Dublin and of Rathmines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In constituting Boards of Selection to interview and report upon the merits of candidates for this, as well as other classes of local appointments the Local Appointments Commissioners take care to ensure that the Boards include persons possessing qualifications and experience allied to the post under consideration.  In the normal course I do not know, nor <Col N="1341" /> does any Minister know, the names of the persons who have acted on the Selection Board.  But I called for that information in this case and am in a position to state that the Board consisted of a University Professor and three librarians of much experience. As a Board for the purpose of the appointment in question, I am satisfied that this was a thoroughly competent one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposing this motion.  We think there is no justification for adjourning to-day when we have here, for example, a Bill which the Minister for Local Government was so anxious about that he wanted to rush it through all its stages.  He told us that this Bill had definite relation to certain relief schemes for which £300,000 was voted recently by the Dáil, and he said that certain hardships would be inflicted if this Bill was not passed.  We objected to the passing of the Bill because we could see no reason why, with some weeks to spare yet before Christmas, the Dáil should not be asked to sit on and give due consideration to that Bill.  Speaking for myself, I am prepared to accept the principle of that Bill, but members of our Party very naturally want the opportunity that should be given from the time of the introduction of a Bill to its Second Reading, to examine it in relation to its effect upon their own particular areas, as well as to examine the general principle involved in it. Now, this Bill is so urgent that the Minister wants to pass it without due consideration at all.  It is so urgent that he will not give members the ordinary time for examining it.  This is going to inflict hardships, and yet the President is not prepared to give the House an opportunity of dealing with that Bill as it well could do in the coming week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We object very strongly to the practice which has grown up of throwing a number of Bills at the House on the eve of its adjournment and asking us to rush them through.  An attempt is being made, when we ask, as we are <Col N="1343" /> entitled to, for a reasonable time properly to consider the Bills, to put us in the position that we are a party to the infliction of a hardship.  I want to make it quite clear that we are not any party, in this connection, to the infliction of any hardship that may arise from the non-passing of this Bill. There is ample time between now and Christmas to properly consider this Bill.  The Minister tells us there is no use bringing Deputies here, as there is so little work to be done.  There is plenty of work to occupy Deputies in the House in the coming week.</P>
    <P>We have here on the Order Paper, in addition to this Public Health Bill, an Agricultural Bill and the famous Land Bill, that we are all so anxious to see&mdash; this ingenious solution which Deputy Roddy is supposed to have discovered as a way round the difficulties which the Minister for Agriculture so cleverly put up here when a Land Bill, with reference to vesting, was put forward from this side of the House.  We are all very anxious to see it, and we would be very ready and willing to come back here, in the coming week, and to give full consideration to that and to the Public Health Bill.  We have also an Apprenticeship Bill.  No excuse can be made, as is so often made by the President when moving an adjournment like this, with a clár like that, that the Government want time to consider certain proposals. When the adjournment was moved on the last occasion for a period of twenty-two weeks, the excuse was that the Executive wanted time to prepare their proposals for the Dáil.  Here are proposals definitely prepared, but the Ministry is so anxious to get away from this Dáil that they are not prepared to sit for another week in order to deal with matters that have already been prepared.  Of course there is, in addition to this clár, a long list which on previous occasions we brought before the notice of the Ministry.  There is the Town Tenants Bill.  Evidently the Minister was afraid to face the criticism, the scorn, if I may put it, of the Dáil by coming along and telling us that we would have this Town Tenants Bill when we came back.  He is tired of saying &ldquo;positively the last time,&rdquo;<Col N="1344" /> and, therefore, he goes through the formality of getting it a first reading, but we are not to see this Bill. Obviously the Bill is not ready, and we are not to see it until the middle of January.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Corry pointed out, there is a list of replies with reference to that Bill that we have received in the past.  Deputy Corry showed that on the 24th October, 1929, the Minister for Justice said: &ldquo;The Bill is not yet ready, but we hope to be able to introduce it before the Christmas Recess.&rdquo; That is a year ago.  Later, on the 6th December, he said &ldquo;he was sorry, but he had hoped the Bill would be completed before that.&rdquo;  On the 19th February, when the Dáil reassembled, he said he hoped to &ldquo;introduce the Bill at an early date&mdash;this session certainly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then on 19th November, we were told that we were to get it before the Christmas Recess.  I suppose in the face of all that the Minister could not face the House and say now &ldquo;You will get it when you come back,&rdquo; but that is what he has done.  He has given a certain earnest by getting leave to have it printed, but we are not to see the Bill until January.  Then what about the Co-operation Bill? What about the Clean Milk Bill? What about the Road Traffic Bill? What about the Dublin Transport Bill, the Insurance Bill, and the Merchandise Marks Bill?  What about the Minerals Bill, and the Workmen's Compensation Bill?  All these Bills have been promised at one time or another and in addition they were promised when we were adjourning on the last occasion.  Again, after a period of 22 weeks, Deputies on this side of the House had hoped that good use would have been made of the time by the Executive Council in the preparation of these Bills and in bringing them before us.  Instead of that a few Bills of no importance were brought before us, and we are going to have a Recess for another ten weeks before these Bills are dealt with.  That is really to say that in a period of 35 consecutive weeks the Dáil will have met for seven days, with that programme of work before the Executive <Col N="1345" /> Council.  I think we have a very good right to complain against the general inactivity and the attempt that is being made by the Executive Council really to evade its obligation and avoid meeting the Dáil.</P>
    <P>There is another Bill.  I refer to the Housing Bill.  We all remember the famous election occasion when we heard of a £15,000,000 housing scheme and a definite undertaking had been given to the candidate on that occasion that the Government intended going on with the scheme.  This Housing Bill has not yet appeared.  We have no idea when it is going to be brought forward.  Everyone of us knows that the slum position in Dublin so far from improving is going from bad to worse. All of us, I take it, have the figures by heart now.  There were nearly 74,000 individuals in Dublin City in 1913 condemned to live as members of families in single rooms.</P>
    <P>That is 20,000 families with only one room for the family.  The position went on getting worse until in 1926 there were 79,000 people, that is to say, 5,000 more individuals were involved than in 1913.  The Report of the Committee on Unemployment, of which Deputy Rice was Chairman, classified these dwellings.  That Committee made it quite clear from that classification that whilst the number condemned to live in these dwellings was increasing, the number of dwellings themselves, on account of the deterioration that was going on, was diminishing.  Those of us who looked at that Report will remember that there were three classes.  That is to say, (1) those that were structurally sound, (2) those that might be repaired, and the third class, those that could not be repaired.  When you compare the condition of those three classes in 1913 and 1928, you find that the number of class 1 dwellings had diminished. The number of people occupying them had diminished, and the people had to go into a worse class. Class 1 house has so deteriorated that it had to be put into class 2 or class 3. In the face of that situation is it fair for the Executive Council to go on neglecting that position?</P>
    <P>We remember another matter.  Some years back&mdash;on the 18th October, 1927 <Col N="1346" />&mdash;we had a report from the Food Prices Tribunal.  That Tribunal recommended the establishment of a permanent Prices Board charged with the duty of studying current and future problems, of the supplies and prices of articles of general consumption included in the description of &ldquo;food and clothing,&rdquo; which Board would issue periodical reports.  No notice whatever has been taken of that report, though everyone of us knows the need of such a Board.  One of the indications of the need for such a Board is the delay, for example, of the bakers in bringing down their prices when the prices of wheat and flour have fallen. We remember on another occasion when a coal strike was threatened in England that the price of coal was put up 4/- a ton, although the coal yards in Dublin were known to be well stocked.  This is not a question of fixing prices.  It is a question of having some supervisory board that would pay constant attention to these matters and publish reports.</P>
    <P>The only safeguard there is to people of small incomes is to publish reports like these and so get public opinion on the matter if competition is not sufficient. That public opinion is effective was indicated by the Report of the Tribunal itself.  The Tribunal said that &ldquo;the outstanding impression left on our minds as a result of this Inquiry is the need for continuous investigations and supervision.  We have reason to believe that the fact of the existence of this Tribunal, and the publicity which its proceedings obtained were instrumental in securing reductions in prices of some of the principal articles of general consumption, and in restraining the tendencies to increase prices.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With that programme of work undone, we are not justified in agreeing to this adjournment for another ten weeks.  For my own part, I think it is a scandal to adjourn after a statement such as was made to-day by the Minister for Local Government.  He pointed out that certain hardships were bound to be inflicted in certain areas and that the portion of the grant which might be made available will not now be available if this Bill is not passed. The Executive Council is trying to put <Col N="1347" /> the onus on us of preventing the passage of that Bill.  The onus is not upon us.  We are quite prepared to sit and, if these hardships occur, then the responsibility lies definitely with the Ministry who are forcing us to adjourn when there is ample time to give due consideration to these Bills.  We are going to oppose this adjournment.</P>

      <P>When the Dáil met here after five months' adjournment we had a statement from the President and there were flaring headlines in the papers that direct relief was going to be given to the farming community. Questions were asked about the De-rating Commission, but apparently its report has been hung up in some place where nobody will ever see it any more.  The farmers cannot wait.  The Minister for Finance in his last Budget statement said that even after the De-rating Commission had reported it would take a long time to give the farmers any relief.  Are the farmers going to be wiped out whilst the President, receiving £2,500 a year, can go on holidays for five months, then come back for nine or ten days, and go off for holidays again?  Where is the direct relief that the newspapers put in blazing headlines and that we saw posters about at every cross-road in North and South Dublin during the last few weeks?  Why has not that direct relief been given to the farmers or are they going to get any relief at all?  We heard whispers that this was going to be done and that was going to be done, but nothing at all is being done.  The President should sit here next week and pass a grant equal to the second moiety of the poor rate and send that on to each county council to relieve their present needs.</P>

      <P>What about the malt? The Executive Council are trying to knock all the holidays they can out of the people who are paying them until they get a permanent holiday, and the sooner they get that the better it will be for everybody.  To-day, when there was objection to the Bill brought forward by the Minister for Local Government <Col N="1348" /> it was immediately declared that a water scheme for such and such a place was held up waiting for the passage of the Bill.  Now the Ministry have no hesitation in going on holiday for three or four months.  They will leave the water scheme still held up, though to-day the Minister was wringing his hands in despair that the scheme was being held up because Fianna Fáil were not prepared to take the Bill.  We are not prepared to do what the Governor-General does&mdash; apply a rubber stamp and say: &ldquo;This is all right, here is our signature.&rdquo; Some sixteen or seventeen Bills have been thrown into the wastepaper basket in the past week.  As fast as the printing machines can turn out Bills they are being thrown at us here, and we are asked to accept them, and then we are asked to agree to another adjournment so that some of the gentlemen opposite can go to Portugal in order to bring back new treaties. More of them want to go somewhere else, but none of them wants to work for the people who pay them.</P>

      <P>Now, Tim, you must not say anything, even though you think you are the father of the House. There is an older man here who is claiming that distinction.  The people are entitled to have those Bills properly considered.  This kind of rushed legislation is not fair or just.  Nine or ten motions have been on the Order Paper for a long time.  They should be considered, but the President wants an extended holiday.  The President, with his £2,500, and the Ministers with £1,700, are only prepared to work for two months in the year, and it is time that was ended.  I think it is a shame to come here for only nine days after a five months' recess.  Is it not sickening? The farming community are becoming defunct and the President has effectively gagged them, but I demand on their behalf that the President should come here next week and pass a measure of relief for them.  They are sick of the President's promises.  If he came down to Cork City, which, unfortunately, <Col N="1349" /> he represents, last Saturday and saw all the in-calf heifers that were thrown into the market in order to pay the farmers' rates, he would realise the position of affairs.  It would pay the Ministers better to go through the country than to be at dinners with the Prince of Wales. That would be more in their line.</P>

      <P>We might be able to send you there some day.  My view is that the President should call the Dáil together on Wednesday and submit a financial motion to grant to county councils the full amount of the second moiety of the poor rate.  That should be given to assist the farmers, pending the hatching of the De-rating Commission's egg.  In all probability that egg will turn out to be a glugger, just the same as the eggs that were hatched by the Tariff Commission from time to time.  The President should be prepared to give relief to the farmers who are paying the salaries that keep this circus on here.  If he does not do that, I would advise him to go to the country immediately and get rid of his burden. The sooner he does that the sooner he will have a holiday for good. He deserves that for sitting two months of the year and drawing £2,500.</P>

      <P>Whilst I protest against this adjournment, I must also enter a protest against such language as has been used by the Deputy for East Cork.  It is a very good thing to be on the side of the angels.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear that to be on the side of the angels one must indulge in a good deal of vituperation and abuse, and that, apparently, is in the minds of some people identified with good citizenship, not to talk of citizens in the representative capacity of a Deputy here.  Personally I feel humiliated that a speech such as that which has just been delivered should have been uttered in this House.  As one who is very much opposed to the President and to his Executive Government, I think if there is one man in this country who deserves a holiday it is the President.  I do not <Col N="1350" /> believe that these adjournments have taken place in order to give the President a well-deserved holiday.  At the same time I think some arrangement might be made to carry on if such be the case.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect of the position that the Executive Council has not considered.  I do not know what Deputies may think, but so far as I am concerned it simply multiplies our work.  These long adjournments have no attraction whatever for me.  I would much prefer to work here for eleven months of the year than to have these long adjournments. It simply means that the work which devolves on Deputies in the cities during these months becomes so multiplied that they have not the necessary time to devote to other business when here in the Dáil.  As an example, I can quote what happened in the last couple of weeks.  We have been deluged with new Bills.  I challenge any Deputy, even those fresh from the Universities, and even the later additions, who come straight from the Bar with a chance of being promoted one of these days to the judicial bench, to say that they could digest all that is in these Bills within the last few weeks.  From that point of view alone, can we perform useful service here by having those Bills thrown at us at very short notice?  I suggest that we cannot.  From that point of view I object seriously to long adjournments.  I feel that we have a lot of work to do and that there are many social problems calling for immediate attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want, however, to disassociate myself absolutely and entirely from this class of debate where we have abuse which is a little too frequent, coming from a certain section in the House. It must be forgotten by some people that the President must have work to do during the recess.  Ministers have work to do during the recess, and I hope the responsible members of the Fianna Fáil Party, who, one day expect to be a Government, will seriously consider this conduct and ask themselves if they have not every reason to maintain their own prestige.  Is this the class of criticism they would like to be subject to because <Col N="1351" /> of the exigencies of business in the Dáil when they would have to have long adjournments?  I object to long adjournments.  We have many important measures to deal with, private Deputies' motions and other matters, but again I want to disassociate myself from the class of vituperation that has been indulged in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Mr. Mullins Mr. Mullins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very interested to hear Deputy Anthony's very able defence of our hard-working Ministers, and I am quite in agreement with him that, while the Dáil is adjourned, the President and Ministers have work to do, and that that work has to be done.  But Deputy Anthony in his wisdom feels quite humiliated at the atrocious speech delivered by Deputy Corry from the Fianna Fáil Benches, and he feels that speeches of that type should not be delivered in a deliberative assembly that takes itself seriously.  I agree.  But does this assembly take itself seriously?  Does the Ministry in charge of the conduct of the business in this assembly take itself seriously as a Ministry directing the affairs of the Twenty-Six Counties of what was once Ireland?  I do not agree that they do.  If Deputy Anthony will only reconsider the matter I think he will realise, quite as well as Deputy Corry, that Deputy Corry's speech only expressed the outlook and the mentality of the ordinary working farmer throughout the country who, when he gets up in the morning and reads that the Dáil has again adjourned for two months, will begin to ask himself questions, and will begin to pass the very same comments that Deputy Corry has passed in connection with the Executive Council, for recommending such a long adjournment. Personally I have no objection to a long adjournment, but I believe that a deliberative assembly of this nature, in which we are supposed to look for dignity&mdash;and whose dignity we are asked on so many occasions to uphold &mdash;when it re-assembles in the 18th February will have sat seven days in nine months.  How could that assembly expect either respect or anything <Col N="1352" /> else from the ordinary people who are beginning to ask themselves what is it all about?  Seriously, I suggest to the President that whilst there is a programme of work, such as we have outlined before us, even from the point of view of bringing Deputies up from their constituencies, and from the point of view of expense, as well as upholding the dignity of the assembly, so as to make it a serious deliberative assembly for the Twenty-Six Counties, these long adjournments should not be lightly entered into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree when the Dáil adjourns to-night that it could not find useful work to occupy it until the 18th February.  There is a programme of work and motions on the Order Paper which would certainly keep it occupied for at least another week.  There are several Bills that would occupy the attention of the House for another fortnight.  With so many measures on the Clár, as well as measures postponed from time to time, surely the President could see his way to ensure that some of these matters would be dealt with before the 18th February.  I am particularly interested in one motion on the Order Paper in my name, with regard to the provision of immediate relief for the farming community.  I believe that pending the report of the De-Rating Commission, and some concrete proposals from the President that that motion would deserve some attention from the House, and consideration from the Executive Council before the 18th February.  I suggest that those who are bringing this assembly into contempt are not Deputies like Deputy Corry, who expresses the mentality of the ordinary people, who cannot understand these long adjournments, but the President and the Executive Council who are in charge here.  It is they who are really reducing what should be a deliberative Parliament to what Deputy Corry described it.  Any Deputy who desires to be taken seriously as a member of a serious assembly would not like that impression to get abroad.  We are trying to do the business of Twenty-Six Counties in the ultimate hope that this assembly may be enlarged, so as <Col N="1353" /> to transact the business of the thirty-two counties.  People outside are losing respect for this assembly, and refuse any longer to regard it as anything more than a county council or a board of guardians.  What hope is there that its deliberations will be taken seriously if we have such long adjournments?  On these grounds I intend to vote against the adjournment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>When I listen to Deputy Anthony on some occasions I think that the problem of bi-location has been solved.  I heard the Deputy address this House in terms that fittingly could come only from the Chair.  On many occasions he adopts the role of a functionary who has not yet found a place in our public life, that of censor of Deputies' manners.  I would suggest to Deputy Anthony that he should not permit himself to be overworked, that it is almost time he consulted an oculist, because I am afraid he has been so busily and so frequently engaged in searching for motes in his neighbour's eye that he must by this time be suffering from eye strain, and must have quite forgotten the beams that some time obstruct his own vision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the motion for adjournment before the House, we came here after, I think, an unprecedented recess, and, as a result of time and the expenditure of public money, in a comparatively short session we have passed two Bills, the Expiring Laws Bill and the Tariff Commission Amendment Bill, both of them unopposed measures.  To-day we had to deal with the Unemployment Insurance Bill, the Portuguese Treaty Bill, and the Legitimacy Bill, every one of them unopposed measures. We dealt with the Sea Fisheries Bill, which was of comparative unimportance. The main proposals in it consist, if I may shortly describe them, in prescribing that a shop and premises in which fish are sold should be equipped with a marble slab, an ice-freezer, or rather a box to contain fish, as the proposals were afterwards amended. The slab has a certain appropriateness. I think it ought to be erected with a suitable inscription over the door of the Department of Fisheries.  I am not suggesting that it should be erected <Col N="1354" /> as a memorial to the Irish fishing industry because that has been already buried at sea by the British and foreign trawlers, with the Muirchu representing the Minister for Finance in attendance.</P>

      <P>I was endeavouring, by referring to the Sea Fisheries Bill, to show how little was done for sea fisheries.  Outside of that Bill nothing has been done, though the country was told when the Bill reorganising the Department of Fisheries was introduced in this House, that, with a fresh staff and the comparative freedom which the Minister for Fisheries would have to devote himself to that important industry, something, at least, would be done to save the industry, which has been a decaying industry, and upon which so large a part of the very poorest districts in this country depend.  It is quite clear, however, from the state of the Order Paper that the Government has got into a mess. The long adjournment, and the release from work over prolonged periods, is a very bad thing.  We all know how men who are unemployed for a long time at last become unemployable.  It is quite clear that the Government in this matter has cultivated, not only the habit of sloth, but the habits of the animal which is known as the sloth. It is upside down.  The Order Paper indicates that the Government, and the Government Party, are upside down, and in that position even the mighty intellects of the Government cannot be expected to function, though when one comes to think of it I suppose that that need not necessarily impede the progress of Government legislation and of Government measures through this House, because it is not on the minds and not on the intellects of the Government members that the Government depends to carry its legislation, but upon their feet.  I <Col N="1356" /> would like to remind the Government that there is a certain element of danger in these prolonged recesses. We have noticed that the minds of the Ministry have become atrophied by disuse.  Might I suggest to the President that if he permits his team to go away for this prolonged adjournment, then when they come back they will not even be able to use their pedal extremities and undertake the laborious task of climbing up these steps, passing through the lobbies to vote upon measures the discussion of which they have not even sat here to listen to?  We had a motion here in the House last night in connection with the position of the mutineers of the Connaught Rangers, and during the time that motion was being discussed, and the case of those men pleaded in this House, there was not a Government Deputy sitting on the Government Benches.</P>

      <P>That in view of the discontent prevalent amongst the lower grades in the Civil Service, the Dáil is of opinion that the Executive Council should set up a Commission of Enquiry to investigate and report on the present method of computation of the cost-of-living bonus and its application to Civil Servants' salaries and wages.</P>
      <P>That is a motion which would receive the support of this Party.  If the Government are not in a position to discuss the Bills which are on the Order Paper, let us, at any rate, discuss this matter, which, as Deputy Anthony and others of us are aware, is causing grave discontent amongst the Civil Service.  If Deputy Anthony was sincere in putting down that motion, why did he not get up and make a different speech this evening&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No person in this House objected to a reasonable holiday for anybody here.  The fact of the matter is that the President and members of the Government Party have had an unreasonable holiday.  They have had a holiday of five months. Before the House adjourned on the last occasion a number of important measures were promised.  The text of not one of them is in the hands of the House to-day.  We were promised a Town Tenants Bill.  We are told now that it may be produced in the middle of January.  The Land Bill, about which we had so much propaganda in the newspapers five or six weeks ago, has not yet been circulated.  That, I think, is one of the most important Bills which this House could consider. We all know the burden which the nonvesting <Col N="1359" /> of purchased land imposes upon the farmers, and we think that if the Parliamentary Secretary has determined the lines upon which he is going to proceed in the case of that important problem, he is not justified in permitting this House to adjourn without putting the text in the hands of Deputies.  We are quite willing to meet again this week, and the week after.  There is no reason why the House should adjourn up to Christmas. If the Government have formulated the proposals which they promised to submit to the Dáil, they ought to withdraw the motion for the adjournment and meet again next week and the week after, if possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Clare): I think that it will be agreed that the problems facing this State are mainly of two classes&mdash; the problems of the rural districts and the problems of the towns.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health is probably acquainted with most of the problems affecting the towns.  There is one problem to which I should like to direct his attention. For thirty-two weeks that problem is being postponed.  If we were in earnest in our consideration of that problem, and sincere in our protestations about our desire to cure it, we would not only sit here until Christmas, but we would sit day and night in order to try and find some solution for it.  I refer to the slum problem.  If we were in earnest about this problem we would not let thirty-two weeks go by before we tackled it; we would endeavour to remove that canker from the heart of the nation.  That problem not alone affects the adults, but it affects the children.  There is no measure which the Minister could introduce here which would be of such far-reaching importance and so vital to the people as a proper and comprehensive housing measure.  Yet we were asked to adjourn for twenty-two weeks, and now we are asked to adjourn for ten weeks more without making any contribution whatever to the solution of this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he considers that that is the way that this <Col N="1360" /> Assembly ought to face the housing problem.  If he thinks so, then I say that the Minister for Local Government and the members of his Party are not honest in their protestations when they tell the people of the country that they are anxious to settle that problem.  We ought to sit constantly, day and night, until we save the children of the towns and cities from the dangers that threaten them from this slum evil.  I reason from what I know to the general matter In my own town, the number of houses which are not fit and cannot be made fit for human habitation is 200; the number of families inhabiting these houses is 1,600; the number of houses seriously defective but, which could be made habitable is 100; the number of houses immediately needed is 400.  We are asked to adjourn for another ten weeks, after twenty-two weeks' holiday, without making any serious contribution to the solution of that problem.  I propose to be brief, because I should like to hear somebody from the Government Benches defend this motion for the adjournment.</P>
    <P>
      <i>[An Ceann Comhairle resumed the Chair.]</i>
    </P>
    <P>There is then the rural problem. We had foreshadowed in the Press and from other sources proposals for the improvement of the agricultural community.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health knows that there is a serious problem facing the agricultural community.  There was a De-Rating Commission set up, and it is understood that there are certain reports before the Executive Council on this matter.</P>

      <P>If there are not, the reports are in process of preparation. They have got so far in preparation and signatures that we are told that there are going to be several reports. If we know that there are to be several reports, the reports must be ready for presentation to the Executive Council.  If we are in earnest in our protestations, that we are going to do something to relieve <Col N="1361" /> the agricultural community, then we ought to continue in session here.  If we do not sit here between now and Christmas we ought to sit early in January and tackle that problem, so as to relieve the agricultural community. We shall have adjourned for thirty-two weeks, if we pass this motion, without having made one serious contribution to the solution of the problem that faces the towns or the problem that faces the agricultural community.  I should like to hear what any member of the Executive Council has got to say in justification of this adjournment, with these two serious problems confronting the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with Deputy Hogan in asking whatever Minister may be replying on the adjournment what defence he can make for adjourning now without doing something for the agricultural community. We were told when this session commenced that we were going to be kept busy with many new Bills. It was not only Press representatives who told it to us.  We were told even a few days ago by President Cosgrave himself in the public Press that he had some direct benefit ready for the farming community.  What the direct relief is we have not been told.  The reply was sent by the President by return of post to a farmer in the County Dublin just before the election took place, and since then he has not thought fit to inform the Dáil what that relief is going to be.  At any rate, whatever it is, it is quite evident that farmers now have to wait for that direct relief until some time after the 18th February.  The question is whether the farming community can afford to wait or not.  We are awaiting certain reports, and are anxious to know what they are going to be.  This time last year we were told by the Minister for Agriculture that he hoped to have the report from the Grain Tribunal early in the following year, at any rate before we would reassemble after Christmas.  Twelve months have passed and we are in the same position. This Grain Tribunal heard all the evidence twelve months ago, and surely the report did not take twelve <Col N="1362" /> months to prepare.  If that report has gone before the Executive Council, what is the delay due to, and why have they not come to some decision?</P>
      <P>Then, again, within the last few weeks we were told that the people interested in the production of bacon have put in an application for a tariff on bacon and that that application would be considered as quickly as possible. This present Tariff Commission, we are informed, is going to be much more expeditious in its work.  If it will issue a report in connection with the application for a tariff on bacon, must that report also wait until we reassemble in the middle of February? Everybody in this House who is interested in agriculture will agree that the farmers have been facing a very severe fall in prices during the last few months, particularly in the price of milk, but also in the price of pigs, sheep and horses, the only stock which have maintained their price being cattle.  It is pretty generally admitted throughout the country that the farmers are in a very bad way facing this winter and will find it very difficult to meet their annuities, rates, and so on. If the Government have a policy of direct relief for agriculture and if they intend to de-rate agricultural land, they ought to try to give that direct relief to the farmer as soon as possible, so that they may not be compelled during the next few months to sell part of their stock in order to pay those annuities and rates.  If it is not done, when de-rating does come they will not have their farms properly stocked and will not be able to benefit by any relief that does come.  The small farmers and the poorer farmers are often the concern of Deputies in this House.  They are in a particularly bad way, because the potato crop is very important to them and it has not been a great success this year.  As a matter of fact, it has been a complete failure in many districts, and if these small farmers who are compelled to live principally on their potato crop are in the position now that they have not enough potatoes to last them throughout the winter, they are going to be in a particularly bad way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another question that was raised here a few weeks ago was the <Col N="1363" /> question of fuel.  The Minister for Local Government on that occasion did not see that anything special was necessary, although it was pointed out to him that the turf crops this year had been badly saved and that in some cases people were left with a scarcity of fuel.  Because of the operations of the Forestry Bill which was passed here about twelve months ago, people are practically prohibited from substituting timber for turf and in any case in many parts of Ireland there is no timber to be got.  They are dependent entirely on turf.  If the turf is a failure they have to go without fuel.  Of course we all know that coal is out of the question for these people because they could not afford to buy it, but the real crisis in agriculture is going to come within the next few months.  Farmers who have a certain amount of stock and feeding stuffs on hands are all right for the next month or two, but the real crisis is going to come as soon as their own feeding stuffs run out, and they are compelled during the months of February and March to buy feeding stuffs to finish off whatever stock they may have for winter feeding.  If these farmers are not able to buy feeding stuffs and are at the same time being pressed to pay their annuities and second moiety of rates the only alternative will be to sell their stock at a most uneconomic time for them.</P>
    <P>We know that the hay crop this year was not as well saved and is not of as good quality as it should be, and consequently the stock will not perhaps thrive as well during this winter as it might in a winter after a good hay crop had been saved.  I think, taking all these circumstances into account, that if the Government are going to postpone the giving of that direct relief until we meet in the middle of February the benefit of that direct relief will be lost, because the farmers are not in a position to wait until the beginning of February for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely wished to draw the attention of the Minister for Local Government to the distress that prevails in the County Wicklow.  He is well aware of that from the reports he receives from the home help officers and the labour exchanges. Last October the county council passed a resolution proposing to give £5,000 on condition that the Minister would give £5,000 from the Road Fund for relief work before the Christmas period.  The board of health estimate was exceeded by over £2,000.  We were faced with the position that we had a large number of men in all parts of the county who might be hungry over the Christmas period.  I put down a question to the Minister for Local Government and he gave me an unsatisfactory reply.</P>
      <P>The position is that the Wicklow Council are holding a special meeting next week, as the Minister has failed to give us any satisfaction, to see if any thing can be done so that no person who is willing to work will be left hungry during the Christmas season.  I make a special appeal to the Minister, if he has not yet made up his mind, to deal with this matter. The county surveyor has prepared schemes for the purpose of relief in the county amounting to £10,000, £1,000 in each area.  I would ask the Minister to sanction that scheme with the other relief schemes which are held up, so that we may be able to give these men work prior to Christmas.  The Commissioner in Bray, when interviewed by a deputation recently, held out no hope that he would be able to give employment. If the local body has to provide a percentage of the expenditure on road work.  I hope the Minister will not forget the workers in the rural areas and that he will call the attention of boards of health to the necessity for providing houses for agricultural workers.  As I have not received a definite reply from the Minister for Local Government, I hope that he will get some definite scheme started in Wicklow so that the people will not be left hungry during the Christmas season.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that every member of the House could from practice and habit make the speech which the President is now going to make.  With that exquisite courtesy which has so much endeared him to all of us, he will tell us that it is all a &ldquo;cod,&rdquo; that we are &ldquo;ould cods.&rdquo;  I believe that is an expression which has been made classical by use by the head of the State.  He will tell us that he has heard it all before. He will tell us that we do not mean a word of it, and that we would be desperately disappointed if our opposition were acceded to and if in fact he withdrew the motion.  I am trying to save him a lot of time, trouble and extraneous matter by anticipating him.  I could proceed and deliver the whole of the conventional speech with which we are all familiar.  What I am suggesting to him now is, that having regard to the fact that he is anxious to save time and to be in a position to reply, we should agree with the rest of the House to take as read his conventional speech on occasions of this kind and deal with the matter, to cut out the usual semihumorous, irrelevant impertinences with which he is accustomed to treat the House when Deputies attempt to put up arguments and reasons which are contradictory to the Party necessities which govern the conduct of business in this House.  I do want to know why&mdash;a very simple question &mdash;it should be necessary at this particular moment, instead of to-morrow, instead of next week, that we should adjourn.  What critical emergency has arisen which decides half-past ten on this Thursday night as the moment at which we must adjourn for ten weeks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be some particular reason why we should not meet to-morrow. We have not invented what is written on the Order Paper.  We have not invented the necessity for dealing with the things which are on the Order Paper.  Those are facts, separate and distinct from the President and from ourselves.  What is the fact, undisclosed to the House, which makes half-past ten to-night the unescapable moment for adjourning for ten weeks after twenty-two weeks' <Col N="1366" /> adjournment?  Why cannot he deal with these matters?  Is there some urgent engagement of the Ministry? Mind, I am prepared to be reasonable. If the Minister has a good and sufficient reason why we should not meet to-morrow, well then we will meet him by meeting on Wednesday.  If he has a good and sufficient reason why we should not meet on Wednesday, we will meet his convenience by meeting on Thursday.  He must have some reason, and the reason must be disclosed to the House, because the whole subject-matter of the debate is half-past ten to-night as the time we shut down. There is no other element in the motion, and no reason whatever has been given to show us why that is the critical moment.  We might have expected from the massed wisdom of Cumann na nGaedheal, from those silent Solons and inarticulate Miltons, who occasionally decorate those benches, from that which is overwhelmingly obvious to every one of us, so overwhelmingly obvious that they are all going into the lobby to vote for half-past ten to-night&mdash;we might have expected that some one of these undiscovered geniuses would have risen in his place and answered the question which in one form or another every member of the House is asking.</P>
    <P>Are they all dumb-driven cattle in reality as well as in name?  Have they made any inquiry themselves which would enable them to go back and tell their constituents how after twenty-two weeks' holiday, seven days' functioning of this Dáil is considered sufficient before we adjourn for another ten weeks?  Have they, I ask, made any inquiries?  Are they as ignorant as we are on the subject of what is in the minds of the Ministers and what is the overwhelming necessity which makes 23 or 24 minutes from now the critical and unescapable moment at which we are to adjourn?  Perhaps Deputy Anthony knows.  I am quite sure that he is much more in the confidence of the President and the Executive Council than the average back-bencher of Cumann na nGaedheal. Every one in this House, every human being with a soul to be ravaged, with a heart to bleed, must have bled at every pore when he saw the martyrdom <Col N="1367" /> of St. Anthony to-night.  Seventy-eight inches of martyrdom&mdash;seventy-eight inches and a twist in every inch.  Do you wonder at his martyrdom?  Do you wonder that he feels humiliated, this stately Alexandrine which like a slow snake drags its long length along?</P>

      <P>This interesting assembly is going to adjourn for ten weeks. What is going to happen in those ten weeks?  The House has a precedent in relation to adjournments and what was done in them.  There have been other occasions on which men have been told that if they liked their subscriptions might be anonymous, and the results have been a general election during the Recess.  Have we any assurance now that that same sort of game is not going to be played, that we are not going to have a stunt?  Remember they were fooled the last time by a Dublin result.  Remember that the last time they adjourned they gave us a stunt election during the adjournment. They were fooled by a Dublin result.  The precedent is complete, but will not be so complete later.  Is this the critical necessity?  Has the General Staff decided that at half-past ten o'clock to-night the preparations, not for discussions in this Dáil, but for the elimination of this Dáil, are to take place?  What else is going to happen? We are going to let them loose apparently without any criticism, without any supervision whatever, little as the supervision and criticism in this House can be effective, so long as the minority in this House includes men of the political allegiance and indeterminate conduct of St. Anthony.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is going to happen?  You have a Ministry now which, for the next ten weeks, is going to be uncontrolled, in full charge of the administrative machine, to do what it likes with it, to do what it has done with it.  Is the House satisfied without an explanation of why we are going, for ten weeks, to leave that position?  What is the Minister for Justice going to do?  Is he going to give us another all-purpose cow?  Is he going to have the same conduct encouraged which has made a High Court Judge say that he would send the proceedings of a civil action <Col N="1369" /> to the Attorney-General for prosecution for conspiracy and perjury against the servants of the Minister? Is that the position?  For ten weeks are we going to leave uncontrolled the rights of members of the community in the possession of the Minister for Justice and people inspired by his kind of mentality?</P>
    <P>True, fisheries are going to be attended to.  I believe that was the whole of the contribution made by the Minister for Fisheries down in Kerry.  He said they were going to be attended to.  For the next ten weeks they are going to be attended to in the way they have been attended to for the last ten years.  Is he going to catch finnan haddies?  Is he going to start another fish market in Cork and forget to get any fish?  Is he going to tow in from the Arran Islands, at a cost of £7 10s. each, the boats which he has confiscated from the Arran Islanders and sell them for firewood at ten shillings?  Is that what is going to happen in the Ministry of Fisheries? How many county councils is the Minister for Local Government going to suppress because bishops, priests, laymen, men of all politics, are united in disagreeing with the Minister for Local Government?  How many county councils are going to remain?  Is the whole place going to be covered with mandamuses just to enable the interested misused authority of that Minister and of that Ministry to be made effective over the heads and against the will of the ordinary community in this country?  Is that what is going to happen?</P>
    <P>What about the Minister for Agriculture? How many more children is he going to put on the backs of the community while refusing to acknowledge the parentage of them?  Is the I.A.C. going to be just able to clear its butter stocks in the interval?  Have they calculated on that basis, from half-past ten to-night until the 18th February?  Is that just the calculated time for the Minister for Agriculture to save his face by preventing the child he has repudiated from being made publicly bankrupt owing to being unable to fulfil its actual existing financial commitments?  What other new stunt is going to be devised in the interval? <Col N="1370" /> The Minister for Defence with the army which the father of the I.A.C. says is not worth a damn&mdash;what is he going to do with national defence in the meantime?  Ten weeks of uncontrolled misuse of his authority.</P>
    <P>I should imagine by that time that we shall have at least eight or nine official armies, as distinct from the unofficial, and I should imagine that the whole of them, so long as they are official under that aegis, would come under the same description of the whole damn lot of them, not being worth a damn because the men who are looking after them are not worth a damn.  I believe that the present army is quite a good army made up of quite good young men who know they have got a good job and are trying to keep it, but I do not think it is worth a damn as long as it is run by men of the efficiency which is represented by the Minister for Justice's C.I.D. in court and the Minister for Fisheries' fish market in Cork without any fish.  What have they done in the daylight which enables us to trust them in the dark?  What goods have they delivered, any one of them?  One of them has succeeded in producing a position in which sugar, which is bought f.o.b. Hamburg to-day at less than 6s., costs the actual consumer in this country six times that amount!</P>

      <P>We are asked to postpone the adjournment until next week.  During the last hour and twenty minutes we have heard speeches directed to that end.  There is not a schoolboy over fourteen years of age in the country who would not be able to understand and master within half that period of time the Bill that the Minister for Local Government introduced yesterday, and a Second Reading of which was refused by the intellectuals opposite to-day. They say that we are trying to put the blame upon them.  Not at all.  There is no necessity for that because it is upon their backs and on their heads.  They have stopped the working and the successful administration of the £300,000 Relief Vote in a satisfactory and sound manner.  We are attacked and abused by these people.  The leader of the Opposition, who <i>in absentia</i> was nominated as President of the Executive Council last year, was absent from this House from December of last year until June of this year.  These are the people who say to us &ldquo;five months' holidays.&rdquo; What was he doing outside of this country when the Budget of this State was being discussed here?</P>

      <P>The Bill for which the Minister for Local Government asked consideration is not only a simple one but it has really got only two effective clauses.  That Bill was posted to every member of the House yesterday morning.</P>

      <P>And, in addition, there was sent with it an explanatory statement covering two pages.  The Party opposite is not free from having lawyers on its benches.  They come here, sit listening to speeches or make speeches.  But to come here and study Bills, to consider what are the real <Col N="1372" /> needs of the country and how best public money can be spent, is something that they will not do at all. Their attitude on these matters is: &ldquo;Let us talk on that on the adjournment.&rdquo; What are we asked to come here for next week?  To consider a Bill of two effective clauses.</P>

      <P>What about the Land Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>That Bill is not yet in the hands of Deputies.  The Deputy who has mentioned the Land Bill introduced one himself last year which was a joke, and he realised that it was a joke.  The Deputy sitting next to him introduced another Bill, which was also a joke, a Bill which we had to amend and strengthen so as to save it from being a laughing stock.  The Deputy knows that.  Only to-day a Deputy on the opposite benches&mdash;a lawyer&mdash;asked us were we going to adjourn without bringing in the Rent Restrictions Bill&mdash;a measure that we had already passed.  These are the gentlemen who talk about studying Bills.  The Bill that was sent out last night was a simple Bill, and they would have been better engaged in studying that than in making speeches.</P>

      <P>It was posted yesterday. If the Deputies had devoted the time they spent discussing the Bill at their Party meeting to a study of the Bill they could have mastered it.  There is not a youth over fourteen years of age who could not have mastered that Bill in half the time spent on this adjournment motion.  Yet, we are asked to come back next week to discuss Bills which are not yet in the hands of Deputies. Yesterday, in connection with three motions which had appeared on the Order Paper for a week I was asked for a postponement until to-day.  The Veterinary Surgeons Bill was down for consideration, but the Deputies opposite would not have a Second Reading of it, though they admitted that it was on the Committee Stage the real work on that Bill was to be done.  The work of this country is not carried out here, but outside where the <Col N="1373" /> business men and farmers ought to be at their work.  If there is business sufficient to warrant the attention of Deputies in the House we are prepared to give time for it.  I am asked by a Deputy who for a couple of years has been talking about the financial bankruptcy of this State and about general elections&mdash;he still has that question on his brain&mdash;to bring the House back next week.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will want to look after the little bit that he has. It will require nurturing and some <Col N="1374" /> minding.  There are various other measures to which the leader of the Party opposite would object if we were to ask him to come here next week to consider them.  Before the adjournment last summer there were motions on the Order Paper which Deputies got adjourned, and now we are to be taxed for not coming here next week. The work of this country is not done by talk, and the people are finding that out as they have done in the City and County of Dublin.</P>
