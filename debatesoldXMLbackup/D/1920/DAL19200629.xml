    <Title>ORDER OF THE BUSINESS.</Title>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT stated that he would defer any remarks which he had to make until the reading of the various reports had been completed.  He suggested that the business on the Agenda should be taken in the following order:&mdash;First that the Reports of the various Departments be read, that the motions standing in his name be then taken up and that these should be followed by the debates on the Reports.  It was essential to complete the business in one day, and this order would enable the Dáil to see more clearly how much time could be allotted to debating each Report.</P>
<P>Arrangements had been made to have the members supplied with lunch&mdash;half the members at 1.30 p.m. and the remaining half at 2.15 p.m.  He moved accordingly that there would be an adjournment at 1.30 p.m. for lunch, and that business would be resumed at 3 p.m. At 6.30, if it were considered desirable to have a further sitting, there could be an adjournment for tea, and a resumption of work some time later.  He was of opinion, however, that the proceedings should end at 10 o'clock, and that the Ceann Comhairle should be empowered <Col N="169"/> to terminate the proceedings at that hour.</P><P>The House agreed to these suggestions.</P>

    <Title>REPORTS - DEFENCE.</Title>
<P>The MINISTER FOR DEFENCE, in the course of an oral report, said that as a result of the work of the Defence Department, and owing to the efficiency of Headquarters Staff, the enemy in spite of thousands of troops, guns, aeroplanes, and all the modern equipment which they were sending into the country, had got the worst of the argument since the last meeting of the Dáil.</P>
<P>The enemy's new tactics were designed to provoke the Army of the Republic to come out into the open and meet them on their terms.  His Department intended to use its own methods.  In most parts of the country the so-called enemy police force had been driven out or confined to certain strongholds with the result that British law did not exist in those places.  Consequently the Department of Defence had now to do work which it should not have to do, namely, to perform police duties, capture criminals, and put down crime and offences and so forth.  That class of work was <Col N="170"/> being done successfully and would be done so long as was necessary.</P><P>The Substitute Minister for Home Affairs was however anxious to take it over as he meant to draw up a Criminal Code.  In connection with all this work the hearty co-operation of the Teachtai, particularly in districts in which there had been local land trouble, was essential.</P><P>The Department of Defence would provide such protection and assistance as was necessary to enforce decisions come to by the Courts set up by the Dail.  It was hoped however that this portion of the work of the Volunteers would be made as light as possible, so as not to take up the time which must be devoted to their military duties.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="STATEMENT BY THE" RHead="ACTING-PRESIDENT:">
    <Title>STATEMENT BY THE ACTING-PRESIDENT:</Title>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT in his statement said that it was over seven months ago since the last Session of the Dail was held.  During that time, as they were aware, the strongest offensive hitherto attempted against them had been undertaken.  They all knew that the enemy had been beaten back.  The present meeting was the best attended of any held yet.  The number of living members of Dail was 68 of whom 51 were at present available; 46 of these were in attendance. Seven members were in the United States, 2 in France, and 2 in Jail. There were 2 absent through illness, 4 absent through inability to attend and 5 absent who were available.</P><P>During the period under review in addition to the defence of the country against the attacks of the enemy, they were faced with the necessity of reaffirming the verdict of the General Election of 1918.  This re-affirmation was made at the Municipal Elections in January last and again at the County and District Council elections in the present month.</P><P>The result of these elections had very much strengthened the hands of the Representatives of the Republic in America and had made clear the case of Ireland throughout the world.  It was a repudiation of England's propaganda on the Continent and in America to the effect that the vote of 1918 did not represent the people's will, and it was an endorsement of all their activities since the Dail came into being.  In America the work accomplished by the President had been extraordinary. He had welded the Irish Race into a United Force.  He had raised the Irish question there to the position of an International issue.  Were it not for Mr. de Valera's work in the United States of America there was little doubt that with some amendments, the Peace Treaty, including article 10, would have been carried. The adoption of article 10 would have been disastrous to Ireland.  As Mr. Boland's interview pointed out yesterday, the reservation written into the Peace Treaty made it quite clear that the League of Nations could only be adopted with Ireland as a consenting party, and the writing in of that reservation had made the Irish question an International question which could not be settled without the assent of America.  The propaganda carried on against Ireland on the Continent and in America during the last seven months had been very virulent.  The Propaganda Department had done wonderful work in counteracting this campaign, and at present there was scarcely a nation on the earth in which the Irish case was not understood.</P><P>The difficulties which had to be encountered by the Ministry were very great.  He supposed that no Ministry ever existed that did so much work under similar difficulties.  Every possible obstacle was placed in their way to prevent them from carrying on the work.  Perhaps their greatest achievement was the establishment mainly through the work of Mr. Barton, of the Land Bank.  The establishment of that Bank enabled them to settle the land crisis that arose in the West of Ireland.</P>
<P>The next biggest thing was the establishment of the Land Arbitration Courts.  The establishment of these Courts prevented the land question <Col N="171"/> being used to divert the energies of the people from the National issue.</P><P>There was also the Industrial Commission which had a considerable amount of valuable work to its credit. On the whole, taking the seven months past, the amount of constructive work achieved had been very remarkable.</P><P>The Minister for Finance had accomplished one of the most extraordinary feats in the country's history in connection with the bond issue.  He had issued a loan of £250,000 and it was now over-subscribed to the extent of £40,000 in spite of the most determined opposition of England.</P><P>During the early part of the present year, they had a story in London that this movement was going to be crushed out of existence by March. This was the story in official circles. They had got assurances from Dublin Castle that they would succeed in destroying the Republican Movement by March.  They were wrong.  The gentlemen who gave that assurance were now down and out.  A change in the methods of the enemy at the present time might portend some change of feeling but he was inclined to think it was only an attempt to achieve by conciliation what they failed to do by force.  That day the Democratic Convention met in San Francisco.  Mr. de Valera was there to secure the insertion of an Irish plank in the Party Platform.  Mr. de Valera has refused to accept any expression of sympathy as a substitute for the Recognition Plank.</P><P>This time the President was in San Francisco determined to have the plank for Recognition of the Irish Republic part of the Democratic Platform or in the alternative to have nothing at all. Neither party would be allowed to ride away with a motion of sympathy.  Of course the President's strength in America was just the strength of themselves here at home.  It they were weak here he would be weak there, and correspondingly if they were strong here he would be strong there.  They must keep this Movement as strong as they could make it.</P><P>During the period that had passed since last session and before they had an opportunity of meeting the Dail, they appointed certain substitute Ministers and it would now be for the Dail to confirm them.</P><P>Originally provision was made in the Constitution for nine Ministers, only eight of whom were appointed. One Ministry was left open because Mr. de Valera desired that Mr. Stack should join the Ministry when he came out of jail.  &ldquo;I therefore ask,&rdquo; continued the ACTING-PRESIDENT, &ldquo;that the Dail confirm Mr. Stack as a Minister. While I am acting as Acting-President, he will act as Home Secretary.&rdquo;</P><P>The Minister for Local Government having been arrested, Mr. O'Higgins was chosen Substitute Minister in his absence.  The Director of Agriculture, Mr. Barton, having been also arrested, Mr. Art O'Connor was appointed to his place and as a Director of Fisheries was required they chose Mr. Etchingham as Director.</P><P>In regard to the Ministry of Irish it was decided at the last session to establish this Ministry, and the gentleman appointed to that post was their Speaker.  Now it was for the Dail to agree to these appointments and ratify them.</P><P>They would thus have one more than the nine Ministers provided for in the Constitution, but this one happened to be the Speaker.</P>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT then submitted the following resolutions tabled in his name:&mdash;</P><P>1.  That the decision of the Ministry authorising the President to expend at his discretion such sum not exceeding $500,000 as he may require in connection with the Election Campaign for the Presidency of the United States of America be and is hereby ratified.</P><P>2.  That the President be empowered to expend a sum not exceeding $1,000,000 to obtain the recognition of the Irish Republic by the Government of the United States.</P>
<P><Col N="172"/> 3.  That the sum of $1,000,000 be voted to the Department of Defence.</P><P>4.  That the President be authorised to appoint Consuls and Diplomatic Agents to the following countries:&mdash;Russia, France, Spain, Italy, Austria, Germany, Denmark, Switzerland, and that he also be empowered to appoint one Director in each of the following cities in the United States, namely:&mdash;Chicago, New Orleans, San Francisco and Boston, to organise and direct Irish opinion at these centres.  That the names of a number of persons suitable for these posts be supplied to the President by the Ministry and that the agents be selected by the President from amongst the persons so nominated.</P><P>5.  That the Ministry be empowered to appoint an Ambassador to Washington, in the United States of America.</P><P>6.  That the Ministry be authorised to despatch a Diplomatic Mission to the Government of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic with a view to establishing diplomatic relations with that Government.</P><P>The vote provided for in resolution No. 3 was a recommendation from the President himself.</P><P>With regard to No. 4, the President's suggestion in connection with this was that the Dáil should select a number of names and forward them to him.  He would then make the appointments from amongst those selected.  The Ministry would be glad to receive suggestions from the Teachtai of suitable persons for this work.</P><P>With reference to No. 6, what the President wanted was to be empowered to despatch such a mission when he thinks it advisable.</P>

    <Title>RATIFICATION OF MINISTERS.</Title>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT formally moved:</P><P>(a)  &ldquo;That the appointment of Sean Ua Ceallaigh, T.D,, as Minister for Irish, be ratified.&rdquo;</P><P>(b)  &ldquo;That Aibhistin de Staic, T.D., be confirmed as a Member of the Ministry in charge of the Department of Home Affairs, until the President's return.&rdquo;</P><P>(c)  &ldquo;That the appointment of Cacimhghin O Huigin, T.D., as Substitute-Minister for Local Government during the absence of Mr. Cosgrave be ratified.&rdquo;</P><P>(d)  &ldquo;That the appointment of Art O Connchubhair, T.D., as Substitute-Director of Agriculture during the absence of Mr. Barton be ratified.&rdquo;</P><P>(e)  &ldquo;That the appointment of Sean Etchingham, T.D., as Director of Fisheries be ratified.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR DEFENCE seconded the motion.</P>
<P>PIARAS BEASLAI (Kerry East) thought that if the Speaker of the House were appointed a Minister, a temporary Speaker should be chosen to preside while the affairs of the Department concerned were being discussed.</P>
<P>FIONAN O LOINGSIGH (Kerry South) agreed with the previous speaker and suggested the name of the Deputy for Clontarf (Risteard O Maolchatha) as temporary Speaker for this purpose.</P>
<P>PADRUIG O MAILLE (Connemara) seconded the nomination of the Deputy for Clontarf.</P>
<P>THE MINISTER FOR DEFENCE did not see any necessity for this course.  The Speaker could remain in the Chair and direct the work while the report of the Department for Irish was being discussed.</P>
<P>PIARAS BEASLAI (Kerry East).  It is not fair to ask the Speaker to translate speeches in criticism of his Department.</P>
<P>THE SPEAKER explained that he was really a Deputy for the Speaker who was at present in Rome as an Envoy. The amendment which he was going to put to the House was therefore <Col N="173"/> whether they should appoint a Deputy Speaker to the Deputy Speaker.</P><P>The amendment was put and negatived by 18 votes to 8.</P><P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT'S motions for the ratification of the various appointments were then severally put and unanimously adopted.</P>

He asked for permission to apply funds to the purpose stated and now the Dail was asked to ratify the Cabinet's action in authorising him to do so.</P>
<P>The motion was seconded by the MINISTER FOR DEFENCE, and put and carried.</P>

That the names of a number of persons suitable for these posts be supplied to the President by the Ministry and that the agents be selected by the President from amongst the persons so nominated.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR DEFENCE seconded the motion.</P>
<P>M.P. COLLIVET (Limerick City) asked why none of the new Republics were included in the resolution.</P>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT in reply said that they might include such countries later on.  The motion did not mean that they would confine their activities to the countries named.  The President required 30 men for the posts and he specially mentioned the countries named in the motion.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR DEFENCE thought that it would be well to amend the motion to enable Consuls to be sent to places other than those mentioned.</P>
<P>M.P. COLLIVET (Limerick City) stated that he had in mind India and Egypt.</P>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT suggested <Col N="174"/> that the words &ldquo;and other&rdquo; be inserted in the motion after the word &ldquo;following&rdquo; in the third line.</P>

<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT moved:</P><P>&ldquo;That the salary of the Secretary to the Commission of Enquiry into the Resources and Industries of Ireland be increased to £500 per annum as from 1st March, 1920.&rdquo;</P><P>This motion had been tabled in consequence of a request from the Commission.</P>
<P>SEAN O'MAHONY (Fermanagh, South) seconded the motion.</P>
<P>In reply to questions by JOSEPH MACGUINNESS (Longford) and PROINSIAS O FATHAIGH (Galway, South), the ACTING-PRESIDENT stated that the present salary of the Secretary was £350 per annum and that it was likely that the Commission would take two years to complete its work.</P>
<P>R. SWEETMAN (Wexford North) was of opinion that the Commission would sit for five years at least, or more likely for ten years.  The Ministry had now widened the scope of their enquiries and he was strongly of the view that the present arrangement would in effect give semi-ministerial powers to the Commission.  It would be well that the Dáil should recognise that.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR FINANCE stated that he held very strong views about this Commission.  The Commission was tinkering with the question.  It was sitting now for some time and there was not yet an ad interim report on the resources of Ireland.</P>
<P>Propositions were being received from all parts of the country involving the utilisation of the country's deposits. The Commission should be working on these problems.  He would undertake to do in one year what the Commission was going to take five years to do.  If they had to wait for five years or ten years for a report as to the mineral resources of Ireland they would miss the opportunity now available for developing them.  Information regarding the extent and possibility of these mineral deposits was a matter of urgency.  Every place where there were mineral deposits <Col N="175"/> and every place where there were likely coal mines should be reported on.  Areas containing valuable deposits should be taken over by County Councils and other Public Bodies and worked under the supervision of the Department of Industries; the idea being that they would become the property of the State so that they could not be exploited by private syndicates, as had happened in other countries.</P><P>If this Commission was going to sit for five years, then they must get a Commission that would report in twelve months.  The thing could be done if they meant to do it.  At the same time he desired to support the motion for the increase of salary.</P>
<P>D. KENT (Cork East) agreed with the remarks of the Finance Minister. While they had money they should use it to the best advantage.  He stated that there was a mine near Kanturk in which there were very valuable coal deposits.</P>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT stated that the Commission was at present working on coal and minerals.  They had first taken up the question of Food Supplies. An idea had gone abroad that the Dáil were going to finance certain undertakings.  The Dáil could not undertake the working of mineral deposits with the resources at present at its disposal.  The whole loan of £250,000 would not be sufficient to work two coal mines.  If the coal and other deposits, of which Mr. Kent spoke, existed, it was the business of the people to endeavour to attract capital to work them.  He believed that in two years' time the Commission would have completed its work.  If the Commission was not going on satisfactorily it would, of course, be their duty to end it.</P>
<P>SEAN MACENTEE (Monaghan South) said that since the Commission was appointed the Members of Dáil heard nothing from them, and unless they went around the country in the wake of the Secretary they could get no information. An ad interim report on milk production had been issued and was on sale before some of the Members were aware that it was being issued.  He suggested that Members should get advance copies of all such reports.</P>
<P>R. SWEETMAN (Wexford North) said that it was a pity that a greater number of the Members did not attend the Commission.  With regard to the method of issuing reports, his opinion was that they should take a very comprehensive view of the country's resources and this would take some time.  Some reports would be out quite soon.  The report on coal deposits, which would be a very valuable one, was in course of preparation.</P>
<P>The FINANCE MINISTER stated that the Ministry were almost as much out of touch with the Commission as the Member for South Monaghan.  Both the Fishery and Agricultural Departments had found great difficulty in getting certain information which they required for their work.</P>
<P>C. COLLINS (Limerick West) said that the Deputies who were in close touch with their Constituencies could get more information in these districts than they could from the Commission. As one who had been up against the difficulty of finding money for practical purposes he would object very strongly to the proposed increase of salary to the Secretary of the Commission.  He did not think there was any impression prevailing in the country that the Dáil were going to find money to finance undertakings.  What they did think was that the Commission would afford suggestions and advice.</P>
<P>SEAN MACENTEE (Monaghan South) asked whether they would have a guarantee that the Secretary of the Commission would keep the Members of the Dáil in touch with the doings of the Commission.  Any report issued should, as a matter of course, be forwarded in advance to the Members of the Dáil.</P>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT, replying, stated that every Member of the Dáil <Col N="176"/> should be supplied with a copy of the report on milk production, and with copies of every report issued by the Commission.  He believed that the Commission was doing invaluable work, and to expect results from a Commission with so much work upon its hands in so short a time was expecting too much.  He remembered Commission after Commission coming to Ireland, but not one of them ever got down beyond the crust as this Commission was doing.  It was all very well to say that there was coal in variour parts of this country, but there was coal and coal&mdash;there was valuable coal and there was also coal that could not be worked profitably.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS complained that the report on milk production did not contain any practical suggestions.  There was evidence taken at Dingle on the subject of the Fishing Industry, but he did not see that it helped very much.  He agreed that the work should be tackled immediately. They could not afford to wait for two or three years.  He was not against the increase of salary, but something should be done for it.</P>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT stated that the object of the Commission was to report as to where the mineral deposits and other resources existed and the best means for working them.  He did not agree with the Deputy for North Wexford that the Commission would sit for five years, and he did not agree either that its labours could be concluded in twelve months.  It should be borne in mind that there had never been a geological survey of this country. This Commission was trying to do the work of a geological and industrial survey.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR DEFENCE, continuing the debate, pointed out that every Member of the Dáil should have got a copy of the Milk Production Report. It was quite evident that some of the Commissioners and their Secretary did not quite understand what their functions were.  There was one Member of the Commission present&mdash;the Member for North Wexford&mdash;who had told them that the Commission was going to develop into a semi-ministerial body. He should like to have an explanation of that statement.  From what had been referred to in the course of the debate it was quite clear that the Commission actually regarded themselves as a Ministry.  They had passed a resolution to the effect that certain documents and minutes of evidence acquired by them should not be accessible to anybody except the Commissioners, with the result that Mr. Etchingham could not get a copy of the evidence taken in the course of a fishery enquiry in the South to enable him to carry on his duties.  He wanted this report for a certain purpose, and the Secretary, acting under a certain resolution which the Commission had adopted, could not give it until after the request had been submitted to a meeting.  He believed that the work Mr. Figgis was doing was worth £500, but he objected to increasing Mr. Figgis's salary when the salary of the Members of the Ministry was only £350.</P>
<P>P. O'KEEFFE (Cork North) moved an amendment:</P><P>&ldquo;That the original motion be deferred until next meeting of the Dáil and pending a report from the Commission.&rdquo;</P>
<P>M.P. COLLIVET (Limerick City) seconded the amendment.</P>
<P>Professor EOIN MACNEILL (Derry City and National University) said that the investigations of the Commission were being directed on two lines.  One was as to what resources existed and the other was as to what practical steps could be taken to utilise them. There was a difference of opinion regarding the exact powers of the Commission. The matter was discussed at a meeting of the Standing Committee and as a result it was referred back to the Ministry to decide whether the Commission should report as to the practical steps necessary to utilise the various industrial power resources of the country.</P>
<P><Col N="177"/> The Chairman of the Commission took a rather limited view of their province. If unsatisfactory reports had been issued it was because of this limited view.  It had since been made clear to them that they are empowered and expected to go beyond a mere scientific report as to what materials and resources there were and to do everything short of getting into the business of establishing industries. That was the present view of the Commission. If copies of the reports were not sent to the Members of the Dáil it was owing to a mistake.</P>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT stated that he moved the adoption of the motion in accordance with the unanimous resolution of the Commission and he was in full sympathy with it.  He believed that Mr. Figgis was worth more than £500 per annum to the Commission.</P><P>There was evidently some prejudice against Mr. Figgis, but whatever he was or was not, he was a very hardworking man, and the salary of £500 now proposed was probably equal to £250 before the war.  It was a mistaken analogy to compare his salary with that given to the Ministers.</P><P>After further discussion the amendment was put to the House and was negatived on a vote of 18 for and 20 against.</P>
<P>PADRUIG O MAILLE (Connemara) moved a further amendment:</P><P>&ldquo;That the salary of the Secretary to the Commission be increased to £450 per annum.&rdquo;</P><P>This was not seconded.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR DEFENCE moved a further amendment:</P><P>&ldquo;That the salary of the Secretary of the Commission be raised in common with the salaries of the Ministers to £500 per annum.&rdquo;</P>
<P>T. MACSUIBHNE (Cork Mid.) seconded this amendment.</P>
<P>J.J. WALSH (Cork City) raised the point of order that this motion could not be introduced without notice, but was over-ruled.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR FINANCE asked the Minister for Defence to withdraw the amendment.  It could be subjected to a good deal of criticism.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR DEFENCE refused to withdraw.</P>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT submitted that the Speaker could not accept a motion to increase the salary of Ministers which did not appear on the agenda. This motion did not appear and was therefore irregular.</P>
<P>The SPEAKER said that he had already ruled the amendment in order.</P>
<P>T. MACSUIBHNE (Cork Mid.) asked permission to withdraw from seconding the amendment.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR DEFENCE said that in order to relieve the situation he would withdraw his amendment on condition that it would be brought forward at the next Session of the Dáil.</P>
<P>JOSEPH MACGUINNESS (Longford) moved to amend the original motion by substituting therefor, &ldquo;that Mr. Figgis be given a bonus of £100.&rdquo;</P>
<P>PADRUIG O MAILLE (Connemara) seconded the amendment.</P><P>The amendment was put and carried by 14 votes for to 11 against.</P>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT thereupon rose to withdraw the original motion altogether from the consideration of the House.</P><P>The amendment was put as a substantive motion and defeated on a division by 18 votes against to 11 votes for.</P><P>After further discussion as to the position thus created, The Speaker submitted the original motion introduced by the Acting-President for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; decision.  On a division the voting was 17 votes for and 15 against.  The original motion was therefore declared carried.</P>

The country was in such a state at the present time that the people looked to the Republican Government for their law and equity, and in a very short time they would have ousted the English Courts altogether. It was therefore necessary to take immediate steps to set up Courts throughout the country which would be competent to hear every class of case similar to the cases dealt with in English Courts of Petty Sessions and Courts of County Sessions and Assize so far as Civil Jurisdiction was concerned.</P><P>He therefore moved for the necessary authority to enable him to establish such Courts and confer the necessary Jurisdiction upon them.</P>
<P>Dr. J. RYAN (Wexford South) seconded the motion.</P>
<P>D. KENT (Cork East) asked whether the Courts were going to confine themselves to civil cases?  He mentioned a case that occurred in Cork when the Volunteers took over a house and damaged it.  He asked that compensation should be made in such cases.  He suggested that a sum be handed over to the Volunteers to recompense the people who sustained loss of that kind.</P>
<P>A. MACCABE (Sligo South) did not agree with some of the details of the scheme for the establishment of Arbitration Courts.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS explained that the scheme had been devised according to the experience gained in the working of Republican Courts in Clare and elsewhere.  The matter did not arise, however, on the motion now before the House.</P><P>After further discussion the motions were put and carried.</P>

<P>The MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS moved:</P><P>&ldquo;WHEREAS it has come to our knowledge that claims to farms of land (Dairy and Agricultural and Residential Holdings worked by the Occupiers) have been and are being made in parts of the country, such claims being based on the fact that the claimants or their ancestors were formerly in occupation of the property so claimed.</P><P>&ldquo;AND WHEREAS these claims are, for the most part, of old date, and while many of them may be well founded others seem to be of a frivolous nature and are put forward in the hope of intimidating the present occupiers.</P><P>&ldquo;NOW IT IS DECREED BY DAIL EIREANN IN MEETING ASSEMBLED</P><P>1.  &ldquo;<i>That</i> the present time, when the Irish people are locked in a life and death struggle with their traditional enemy, is ill-chosen for the stirring up of strife amongst our fellow-countrymen; and that all our energies must be directed towards clearing out&mdash;not the occupier of this or that piece of land &mdash;but the foreign invader of our country.</P><P>2.  &ldquo;<i>That</i> when the national triumph has been achieved&mdash;immediately the Republic has received recognition and finds itself unhampered by enemy Armies of Occupation, steps will be taken by legislation of An Dáil and otherwise, to do justice and equity to all those who have suffered wrong in the past through the power and operation of England's unjust laws.</P>
<P><Col N="179"/> 3.  &ldquo;<i>That</i> pending such recognition no claims of the kind referred to shall be heard or determined by the Courts of the Republic unless by written licence of the Minister for Home Affairs.</P><P>4.  &ldquo;<i>That</i> in the meanwhile claimants may file particulars of their claims with the Registrar of the District Court in which the property is situate.</P><P>&ldquo;AND IT IS FURTHER DECREED</P><P>&ldquo;<i>That</i> any person or persons who persists or persist in pressing forward a disputed claim of the nature above referred to shall do so in the knowledge that such action is a breach of this Decree.

They were merely out to create a state of anarchy which ought to be put a stop to.  It was put down in Kerry and Clare and in parts of Cork, when the members for the Constituencies there took action and issued announcements in the press condemning these claims.</P><P>It was now suggested that the Dáil authorise the issue of this decree in the form of a Proclamation for circulation all over Ireland.  The knowledge that the Dáil had put its foot down would effectively prevent any amount of trouble in connection with these matters.</P>
<P>FIONAN O LOINGSIGH (Kerry South) seconded.</P>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT suggested that clause No. 2 of the motion be omitted.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS accepted this suggestion.</P>
<P>P.J. WARD (Donegal South) asked if this would do away with all claims to land?</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS replied that it would not interfere with claims to land which were being used as ranches and demesne lands.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR DEFENCE stated that the Constituency that he represented deemed to be a place where every second farm was a grabbed farm.  The Ministry had come to the conclusion that this was the best way to deal with these claims.</P>
<P>B. O'HIGGINS (Clare West) hoped that the Proclamation would have a very good effect.</P>
<P>JOSEPH MACDONAGH (Tipperary North) was in agreement with the provisions of the motion.  There was no doubt that if this movement was allowed to go on the energies of the people would be diverted to a struggle for land.  Provision had been made in the motion for dealing with exceptional cases.</P>
<P>P.J.

<P>The MINISTER FOR FINANCE moved:</P><P>&ldquo;That six branches of the Bank be established for which a sum of £25,000 is hereby voted.&rdquo;</P><P>When the Bank was instituted it was found that one institution in Dublin only would not have the same national significance as an institution with branches in various parts of the country.  Without this extension of the Bank they could never hope to get established in such a way as to entice customers to avail of the Bank for accommodation for Deposit and Current Account business.  The Minister outlined the location of the proposed branches and the preliminary steps that had been taken to secure suitable sites in these places.</P><P>The estimated expenditure involved was:&mdash;</P><P>Purchase and equipment of premises, £15,000.</P><P>Cash for Tills, £5,000.</P><P>Working expenses, etc., £5,000.</P>
<P>SEAN MAC AN TSAOI (Monaghan South) seconded the motion.  He regretted that there was no provision made for a Branch in Ulster.  He would suggest the establishment of a Branch Bank in Monaghan or Fermanagh.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="REPORTS AND MINISTERIAL MOTIONS. -" RHead="ESTABLISHMENT OF INCOME TAX DEPARTMENT">
    <Title>REPORTS AND MINISTERIAL MOTIONS. - ESTABLISHMENT OF INCOME TAX DEPARTMENT.</Title>
<P>The MINISTER FOR FINANCE moved:</P><P>&ldquo;That a Department for the collection of Income Tax be instituted by Dáil Eireann, and that all persons who pay the Income Tax to that Department which otherwise they would pay to the British Government be indemnified against losses caused by distraint or otherwise in agreed circumstances, discretionary power being given to the Dáil Income Tax Department to refuse such taxes as it deems inadvisable to accept.&rdquo;</P>
<P>JOSEPH MACDONAGH (Tipperary North) seconded the motion.  He stated that instructions had been issued by Somerset House in London to the effect that no distraints in respect of Income Tax were to be made and no final notices to be issued, and that Collectors were to be as polite as possible.</P><P>He suggested that there should be no definite instructions against filling up returns as it would be of assistance to know the amount of the demand made.  He explained the English Department's procedure in issuing Demand Notices and said that the people to whom notices of charges for Income Tax were issued could be told by the Department now proposed to be set up what proportion of that charge they should pay, and he suggested that they should pay something less than that under the English demand.  This was preferable to giving a rebate afterwards. It would be an easy matter for their collectors to take up the money that Republicans did not wish to pay into the English Government.</P><P>As regards the collection it was likely that the English Government would try to make examples of people in different districts who would pay into the Irish Republican Treasury, but arragements could be come to whereby there could be no sale of the goods seized and no transit.</P><P>He estimated the sum that would be raised by the Irish Treasury in this way would approximate to £1,000,000 per year, and he did not think the indemnities would be anything like half that sum.</P>
<P>T. MACSUIBHNE (Cork Mid.) considered that not alone was the proposal a useful one, but it was practical business as well.  He supported the motion.</P>
<P>J.J. WALSH (Cork City) said that excess profits amounted to about 4½ million pounds per annum.  He considered this tax as mischievous as the other, and it should not be left outside the present proposal.</P>
<P>JOSEPH MACDONAGH (Tipperary North) held that excess profits and Income Tax were the same thing, and he was sure the proposal was meant to include both.</P>
<P>EOIN MACNEILL (Derry City and National University) was in substantial agreement with the proposal.  If it could be shown to the people that they could get half their taxes remitted it was likely that the proposal would meet with success.  If the people were asked for the same amount by them as by the English Government they would be less likely to pay into the Irish Treasury.  It would be much better that the amount payable to the Republican Government should be only 50 per cent. of the claims issued by the English Government.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR DEFENCE was of opinion that the whole scheme was contingent on an agreement with Labour. If there was no arrangement with Labour how were they to prevent the English Government from seizing the goods of people as they wished.</P>
<P>The FINANCE MINISTER replied that an arrangement with Labour was desirable, but Labour could not be approached until the scheme had first been passed.  If it was decided to go ahead and collect the Tax the first step would be to force the withdrawal of English Collectors of Taxes.  Of the <Col N="182"/> hundreds and thousands of taxpayers who would refuse to pay to the English Collectors it would be attempted to make a few examples in certain districts in order to break down the scheme.  He would prefer to charge the whole tax as it would be incurring no more liability than the taking of half or any less sum.  A system of rebate could be arranged later.</P>
<P>SEAN ETCHINGHAM (Wicklow East) was entirely in favour of the proposal provided that Labour would support it.</P>
<P>EOIN MACNEILL (Derry City and National University) suggested that the proposal be amended to read that the Ministry be empowered to set up such a Department.</P>
<P>The FINANCE MINISTER would not accept this amendment from a business point of view.  To refer the matter back to the Ministry was only a way of putting it off when the Dáil did not wish to come to a decision.</P>
<P>SEAN MAC AN TSAOI (Monaghan South) agreed that this matter should not be referred back to the Ministry.</P>
<P>The MINISTER OF DEFENCE stated that the most important consideration of all was whether the Dáil was able to carry out decisions come to.  He suggested that the question be left to the Ministry to carry out if they saw it was feasible.</P>
<P>The FINANCE MINISTER observed that they were not proposing to enforce the payment of Income Tax, as the Defence Minister apparently thought.  Any arrangement that could be made with Labour would be made.  The scheme was a feasible one and could be carried out.</P>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT stated that there was one point that should be kept in mind.  The Dáil could not make a Decree, contingent upon some circumstances or other.  If the motion was passed, the Ministry would be responsible for taking steps to give effect to it.</P><P>After further discussion the motion was put and agreed to.</P>

The price to be paid for such Stock shall be £65 sterling for each £100 Stock so taken up.  The Trustees are further authorised to make such arrangements with the Corporation as will secure the re-purchase by the latter of the stock at the earliest possible date, and for this purpose may arrange to hold said stock pending such re-purchase in which event it shall not be lawful for the Trustees to dispose of the stock in any other manner whatsoever. The price to be paid by the Corporation and accepted by the Trustees on the repurchase of the stock shall be that above mentioned as payable on the issue of the stock, namely £65 sterling for each £100 stock.</P><P>&ldquo;It shall be the duty of the Trustees before taking up any stock to enquire into the purpose or purposes to which the proceeds of the issue of the stock are to be applied and the Trustees shall before taking up any stock satisfy themselves that such purpose or purposes is or are such as warrant the raising of money by loan for their accomplishment. They shall also be satisfied before taking up any stock that the Corporation shall have taken all the necessary steps to secure that the stock so issued and taken up shall be properly charged upon the rate and revenues of the City of Dublin. The total amount of stock to be taken up by the Trustees under this authority shall not exceed in any calendar year from the date hereof the nominal value of £300,000, nor shall the total amount of stock to be taken up under this authority exceed in the aggregate one and a half million pounds.&rdquo;</P><P>He stated that the Dublin Corporation was one of the most solvent in the world.  If that Corporation accepted the offer of the English Local Government Board to provide money on loan and for housing purposes, they would not get the subsidy in lieu of rent namely, £1 7s. 6d. per £1.  The interest on the English Loan would work out at 10½ per cent.  Borrowing from that source would therefore mean a tremendous loss annually.  If the Corporation got this loan, which was not a large one, it would be repaid at the end of 13½ years.</P>
<P>MICHEAL MACSTAIN (St. Michan's, Dublin) seconded the motion.</P>
<P>The FINANCE MINISTER said that he had been considering a suggestion that the sum of say £500,000 out of the proceeds of the Loan in U.S.A. should be put aside as a permanent investment so that that sum would be always available for carrying on the Government if anything extraordinary happened.

<P>DESMOND FITZGERALD (Pembroke) moved the adoption of the report of the Department for Foreign Affairs.</P>
<P>FIONAN O LOINSIGH (Kerry South) seconded the motion.</P>
<P>J.J. WALSH (Cork City) complained that there was less information in this report than could be obtained from the Press.  He asked why no steps had been taken before this to get into Diplomatic relations with the Bolshevik Republic, and also why there was no mention made of the appointment of a Representative to Germany.</P>
<P>The ASSOCIATE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Count Plunkett) in reply stated that they had now got authority to appoint Representatives to Russia.  They had been in communication with Germany for some time.  The news from that country was very discouraging, but latterly they appeared to be regaining their old discipline.  It was now proposed to get a Consul out there.</P>
<P>JOSEPH MACDONAGH (Tipperary North) asked for information as to the differences between the President and others in the United States.  He presumed that all the members of the Dail who were there were on the side of the President and subject to his directions.</P>
<P>THE ASSOCIATE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Count Plunkett) stated that the friction in America was mainly caused by those who were endeavouring to use the Irish Question for the purposes of American Party Politics.</P><P>After further discussion the motion for the adoption of the report was put and agreed to.</P>

    <Title>REPORTS AND MINISTERIAL MOTIONS. - LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMISSION.</Title>
<P><Col N="185"/> The SUBSTITUTE MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT stated that the matter of determining a policy for Local Bodies had been referred by the Ministry to the Dáil.  His view on the subject was that there must be war with the English Government, and that it was a question whether they should choose to have this war now when they were in a state of unpreparedness or whether they should wait for some months later when a uniform scheme would be in readiness to place before the Local Bodies to meet the altered conditions. He granted that the period of preparation would be bought at the price of an apparent sacrifice of consistency. At first sight it would seem that the straight thing to do was to break with the English Local Government Board immediately.  If he were not responsible for the situation that this would create he was sure he would vote for it.  It had been suggested to him that the country wanted that.  The country was organised and disciplined to-day and it would be news to him to hear that big issues were to be decided at Strokestown or Clonakilty and not by the Dail.  His opinion as set out in the report was arrived at after a close consideration of the question.  If the Dail now decided contrary to that opinion, he could only hope that his opinion was wrong.  He moved:</P><P>&ldquo;That a Commission of experts he set up to enquire into the possibility of carrying on local administration without financial aid from the English Government, to report as to reforms and economies in local administration and particularly in the Poor Law system that would enable Councils to meet altered financial conditions if it is decided to break with the English Local Government Board.  That this Commission report not later than the first day of September, 1920, and that pending consideration of its report no action be taken by Public Bodies except such as the Minister for Local Government may authorise.&rdquo;</P>
<P>A. MACCABE (Sligo South) seconded the motion.</P>
<P>T. MACSUIBHNE (Cork Mid.) said that they were playing for position. By adopting the Declaration of Allegiance to Dail Eireann the Councils had put themselves in the position of declaring war.  It was only a question of when the crisis would arise.  It was now for the British Local Government Board to make the next move.  The question of minutes and Auditors was not a vital one.</P>
<P>The SECRETARY FOR FINANCE said that the forwarding of the minutes to the English Local Government Board would be a recognition of their authority. They could not give that body any public act of recognition.</P>
<P>The SECRETARY FOR LABOUR said that it was making a farce of the thing to send minutes to the English Government.</P>
<P>The DIRECTOR OF FISHERIES said that once the resolution of Allegiance to Dail Eireann had been adopted the English Government could no longer be recognised.</P>
<P>J.N. DOLAN (Leitrim Co.) stated that Leitrim County Council by striking an amended rate had started the clean cut and opened the fight.  The present temper of the Country was that the English Government would not be allowed to carry on at all.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR DEFENCE stated that guerilla warfare appealed to him. The bringing about of the clean cut was certainly a very serious responsibility. There were, for instance, a very large number of people who would be only too glad of an opportunity not to pay rates.  If word were sent out to such people by the enemy not to pay, and if rates were refused, a very serious position would be created.  They could bring about chaos in the enemy camp if they take to guerilla tactics, but they would bring about chaos in their own ranks if they force the issue.</P><P>After further discussion the motion was put and carried on a division by 24 votes for to 13 against.</P>

<P>The DIRECTOR OF TRADE AND COMMERCE moved:</P><P>&ldquo;That the Dail authorise the Ministry to promote the establishment of an Import and Export Company and to invest in it if they see fit, a sum not exceeding £150,000.&rdquo;</P><P>He stated that the reason for such a large investment by the Dail was to ensure that they would retain control of the Company.  It might be possible by floating a holding Company to secure control by investing a smaller amount, and this was being gone into. As long as the Dail controlled the Company it could not be bought up by any English concern.  The Director also said that the agents of this Company could assist and co-operate in maintaining the consular service of the Dail which was at present costing a large amount.  The main ideas underlying the scheme were stated in his report.</P>
<P>EOIN MACNEILL (Derry City and National University) seconded the motion.</P>
<P>The FINANCE MINISTER observed that a very large amount of money had been voted at the present session.  He agreed that the formation of a Company such as that outlined was very desirable.  He did not like voting sums of money if they were not available, but when they got the funds from America he thought they should go into the scheme.  He suggested that the Director of Trade and Commerce should get the advice of old experienced financial hands to work out the scheme for the Holding Company, and he thought that if the amount required to be invested could be brought down to about £50,000 the thing should be gone on with.</P>
<P>D. KENT (Cork East) suggested that the Ministry should be empowered to deal with the matter.</P>
<P>THE MINISTER FOR DEFENCE asked if they were to be empowered to use the £150,000 provided the funds were got from America?</P><P>The motion was agreed to.</P>
