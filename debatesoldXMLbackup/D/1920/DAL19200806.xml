    <Title>RESIGNATION OF DEPUTY FOR SOUTH-EAST CORK.</Title>
<P>THE DEPUTY SPEAKER read the following letters and cablegram from DIARMUID LYNCH (Cork South East):</P><P Just="Center">(Copy Cablegram).</P><P>&ldquo;New York.  Have mailed letter Hales transmitting resignation as member Dail Eireann.&rdquo;</P><P>(Signed).  &ldquo;DIARMUID LYNCH.&rdquo;</P><P>(Copy Letter to Speaker).</P><P>&ldquo;A Chara dhil:&mdash;</P><P>&ldquo;Herewith I enclose copy of my letter of this date addressed to the people of South-East Cork, from which you will note that I have resigned as Teactaire Dail Eireann for that constituency.  The reasons which impelled me to that course are stated therein.</P><P>&ldquo;Irrespective of other aspects of the case, I am happy to feel that this action on my part will afford the Government of the Irish Republic a fresh opportunity of functioning as such in the matter of conducting the election of my successor to An Dail Eireann.</P><P>&ldquo;Please convey my congratulations to my old comrades on their progress in defeating the usurping English Government in Ireland, and my best wishes for your continued and complete success.</P><P>&ldquo;Long live the Irish Republic!</P><P>&ldquo;With kindest personal regards.&rdquo;</P><P>(Signed), &ldquo;DIARMUID LYNCH.&rdquo;</P><P Just="Center">(Copy Letter to People of South-East Cork).</P><P>&ldquo;A Chairde:&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;The honour which you conferred on me in my absence from <Col N="189"/> Ireland by electing me, unopposed, as your Representative to Dail Eireann at the General Election, December, 1918, is one which I shall ever gratefully remember.  In being thus honoured by the citizens of my native district, without solicitation or desire for office on my part, I have reason to feel a pardonable pride.</P><P>&ldquo;While fully appreciating the confidence which you have reposed in me, I realised at the time of my election that the English Government having deported me from Ireland through the exercise of its naval and military power, it would prevent my return thereto until such time as the Irish Republic secured its due recognition.</P><P>&ldquo;In full knowledge of how important it was that the representative for South-East Cork should be on the spot in Ireland to attend to the affairs of the Constituency and of the Nation, I seriously considered resigning at that time the position of Teactaire but concluded that my resignation then would have been an embarrassment inasmuch as the Dail had not yet perfected laws governing such elections.</P><P>&ldquo;Differences have arisen since July, 1919, between President de Valera and members of Dail Eireann now in the United States on the one hand, and the recognised leaders of the movement here on the other, as to the proper conduct of the campaign in America for the recognition of the Irish Republic.  My judgment in this matter, based as it has been upon an intimate knowledge of conditions in America, was generally in agreement with the American Leaders.  This circumstance has governed my actions as National Secretary of the Friends of Irish Freedom, and has furthered my determination to immediately tender my resignation as a member of Dail Eireann.  The only consideration which deterred me from giving effect to that determination was that my action might have been misconstrued by the enemies of the Irish Republic, and heralded as a break in that splendid unity which has marked the progress of the Republican Government in Ireland.</P><P>&ldquo;Now, however, it has become evident from letters apparently written by officials of the Irish Republican Government at present in America, captured by the English Government on the person of a man named Barry and published in the Boston, Philadelphia and Chicago papers, that my resignation may at this time be properly offered without adding to the risk of such misconstruction.</P><P>&ldquo;I decline to permit my actions here or the actions of those men who have consistently worked for a generation in America for the establishment in Ireland of a form of government similar to that which prevails in these United States, from being made the subject of controversy and possible dissension in my Constituency. Without acquaintance with conditions in America, you, my friends, cannot possibly understand the American attitude, nor, in particular, the position of those who through the years have borne the brunt of the fight here.  It would not be fair to ask you to express an opinion on the merits of the controversy which now diverts the attention of the supporters of the Irish Republic in this country, and it would be unwise to inject it into South-East Cork.</P><P>&ldquo;The foregoing reasons impel me to hereby resign my position as Teactaire Dail Eireann representing the Constituency of South-East Cork.  I am forwarding a duplicate of this resignation to the Speaker of An Dail Eireann.</P>
<P>&ldquo;In thus definitely severing my official connection with you I desire once more to tender to all my old constituents my sincere thanks for the very great honour conferred on me in my election as <Col N="190"/> your Representative to the first Congress of the Irish Republic, and I beg to assure you of my continued interest in your welfare and in the cause of the entire Irish Nation.</P><P>&ldquo;No matter what vicissitudes the future may have in store for me, I shall always cherish with pride the part which I had the honour to fulfil in the councils of those who made &lsquo;Easter Week&rsquo; possible and solidified the foundations of the Irish Republic.  It is permissible for me now to speak with a certain amount of freedom in these matters, and it may interest you to learn that during those eventful years prior to &lsquo;Easter Week&rsquo; I was one of the selected few in whose hands lay the destiny of the Irish Republic; that my unalterable belief in the necessity of re-baptizing the ideals of Emmet, Tone and Mitchell in the blood of men strong in the faith of Irish Republicanism in order to preserve the National Soul of Ireland, guided me to the right course of action; that my voice and influence were invariably in favour of the Irish Nation reasserting itself in arms before the existing favourable opportunity had passed.  Results have justified my judgment and I am happy in this knowledge.</P><P>&ldquo;I now feel more free to continue my efforts here for the recognition of the Irish Republic on lines which long and practical experience in America have shown me to be for the best interests of the Irish Cause.</P><P>&ldquo;I pray God to preserve the unity and magnificent courage of those who in Ireland are battling against the brutal militarism of England; may He give light to those citizens of the Irish Republic who are as yet irresponsive to the Proclamation of &lsquo;Easter Week&rsquo; that &lsquo;The Republic guarantees religious and civil liberty, equal rights, and equal opportunities to all its citizens, and declares its resolve to pursue the happiness and prosperity of the whole nation and of all its parts, cherishing all the children of the nation equally, and oblivious of the differences carefully fostered by an alien government which have divided a minority from a majority in the past.&rsquo;</P><P>&ldquo;With renewed assurance of my esteem and my interest in your welfare, and a special word of grateful remembrance to those splendid comrades in South-East Cork who in less enlightened days stood unflinchingly for the principle of Irish Republicanism.</P><P>&ldquo;Is mise, le meas mor,</P><P>(Signed), &ldquo;Diarmuid Lynch.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT observed that as the letter of resignation was addressed to the people of South-East Cork, the next step in the matter lay with the South-East Cork Executive of Sinn Fein.  The Dail, of course, would accept the resignation.  Personally he was very sorry, but they had no alternative.  From advices received from the United States he understood that the friction was for all effective purposes at an end, as 99 per cent. of the people there had rallied to Mr. de Valera.</P>

    <Title>ACTING-PRESIDENT'S OPENING STATEMENT. - NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE ENEMY.</Title>
<P>THE ACTING PRESIDENT referred to statements appearing in the Press as to negotiations with the English Government or offers to negotiate.  These statements were altogether without foundation.  There had been no negotiations. If the English Government offered to settle the Irish &ldquo;Question,&rdquo; the Dáil was the only body competent to deal with any such offer.</P>

<P>He understood that His Lordship Most Reverend Doctor Mannix was due to arrive in Liverpool on Saturday, 7th August, or on the following day.  He suggested that a deputation from the <Col N="191"/> Dail should meet him on arrival, and that the deputation should be composed of the Deputy Speaker, Count Plunkett and Mr. MacDonagh.  (This suggestion was unanimously agreed to.)</P>

<P>As a result of negotiations with the Farmers' Union and the Labour Party both parties were now willing to abide by the decision of a tribunal set up by Dail Eireann regarding the question of Food Supplies.  This question, which at one time threatened to lead to grave trouble, would now be amicably settled.</P>

    <Title>ACTING-PRESIDENT'S OPENING STATEMENT. - BELFAST.</Title>
<P>A very serious crisis had arisen in Belfast.  The position brought about there was that practically speaking the majority of Sinn Fein workers had been driven out of employment.  The people in Belfast were very anxious that the Dáil should take action on the matter. If the Dáil assented he would suggest that this question, which was of very great urgency, should be taken as the next business.</P><P>The House agreed to this suggestion.</P>

    <Title>BELFAST.</Title>
<P>SEAN MACENTEE (Monaghan South) presented the following memorial signed by representative citizens of Belfast, which he had been asked to lay before the Dáil:</P><P>&ldquo;We, the undersigned, members of the Belfast Corporation, and others, representing the views of Irish Republicans (and many others) in that city, beg to call the earnest attention of the Dáil to the war of extermination now being waged against us, and we appeal to you to stand by us in the struggle.</P><P>&ldquo;We assume that you have read the press reports of the pogrom which started on July 21st with the violent expulsion from work of well over 5,000 people; of the murders wrecking, looting and wholesale eviction of families.  The situation for expelled workers grows worse daily, and all signs go to show that the persecution is to be continued with unabated vigour.  No one, not being in Belfast can have any adequate idea of what our people are suffering now and must continue to suffer.</P><P>&ldquo;From the first, the promoters of these outrages have been publicly declaring that they are out to fight Sinn Fein, and drive it from the North-Eastern Pale.  Already thousands of young men from every county in Ireland have been forced to fly, and thousands of others are idle here with destitution staring them in the face.  The only condition on which they will be permitted to work is that they sign a declaration of loyalty to the British Government.</P><P>&ldquo;We earnestly appeal to Sinn Fein, through the Dáil to take up this straight challenge, and fight Belfast&mdash;the spear head of British power in Ireland.  The &lsquo;Loyalists&rsquo; have repeatedly declared at public meetings and in the Town Council that this time they are not fighting Popery as such, but Sinn Fein, so that mere sectarianism does not enter in.</P><P>&ldquo;We suggest that Sinn Fein can strike back with powerful effect by a commercial boycott of Belfast. Drastic action of this kind has already been taken spontaneously in various places, but the movement ought to be made national and thorough.  The chief promoters of Orange intolerance here are the heads of the distributing trade throughout Ireland.</P>
<P>&ldquo;We further suggest that the most effective action Sinn Fein can take (to make Belfast realise that it is in Ireland and must be of Ireland) is to secure that its supporters throughout the country immediately withdraw all accounts from Banks having their Headquarters in Belfast, and transfer them to Banks with Headquarters in other parts of Ireland.  This action is of vital importance.  It will deprive Belfast merchants who mostly either support or assent <Col N="192"/> to this war on Irish Nationalism, of the fluid capital on which their business, through the medium of Belfast Banks, is largely run.</P><P>&ldquo;Other additional measures will doubtless suggest themselves to some of the gentlemen of the Dáil. The above will meet with the fullest approval of nearly 100,000 people in Belfast.</P><P>&ldquo;It should be strictly enjoined that Protestants in other parts of Ireland are not to be molested in any way on account of the actions of their co-religionists in Belfast. But, of course, those of them who are in business must be given to understand clearly that if they continue to get their goods from Belfast firms they cannot dispose of them to Sinn Feiners.</P><P>(Signed),</P><P>&ldquo;Joseph Cosgrove, T.C.</P><P>&ldquo;D. McCullough, T.C.</P><P>&ldquo;A. Savage, T.C., P.L.G.</P><P>&ldquo;Jer. Barnes, T.C.</P><P>&ldquo;Jas. McEntee.</P><P>&ldquo;Dr. Moore.</P><P>&ldquo;Dr. Jn. Doherty.</P><P>&ldquo;Mrs. A. McCullough, P.L.G.</P><P>&ldquo;Jas. Connolly.</P><P>&ldquo;Dated, August 5th 1920.&rdquo;</P><P>There were 5,000 or probably 10,000 people driven from employment in Belfast and now without any means of livelihood, and there was no prospect that any proportion of that number would be allowed back to work within a year. The Dáil was the body purporting to exercise all the functions of government in Ireland and in every part of Ireland, and he appealed to the Dáil as the only custodian of public order to take such steps as would prevent a recurrence of any similar outbreak.</P><P>This outbreak was more than a purely sectarian matter.  It was the first direct attack made upon the Irish Republic.  It was the first open act of Rebellion against the Republic, and they should be prepared to deal firmly and strongly with such acts.</P><P>He quoted an extract from the &ldquo;Belfast Newsletter&rdquo; which in its issue of the 22nd inst. stated that this was not a move against Catholics but against rebels who belonged to an organisation which was engaged in murders.</P><P>He said he had a duty to the people of Belfast, who, as a consequence of the establishment of the Republic had been made the subject of bitter persecution and repression there and he urged that Military measures should be used against those responsible for that persecution.</P><P>They were not in a position at the moment to take military action, but there was the more potent weapon of the blockade.  By this means they could break the prosperity of Belfast. The trade done with Belfast in the North of Ireland, as indicated by the value of cheques cashed in Belfast in one week amounted to about £200,000 per week or ten million pounds per annum.  This amount did not include the trade done by the branches of Ulster banks in the South and West, which probably amounted to an additional five million pounds.  That was to say that the whole distributing trade of Belfast with the rest of Ireland amounted to fifteen million pounds annually.</P><P>He therefore moved:&mdash;</P>
<P>&ldquo;Whereas in the City of Belfast an organised and long premeditated attack has been made upon loyal citizens of the Irish Republic, or those held to be such, wherein and whereby citizens of this Republic were murdered, many more greviously injured, and some 8,000 or 10,000 driven from employment and denied the means of livelihood; whereas this violence and disorder has been condoned, if not actively incited, by the civic authorities of the City of Belfast; and whereas it has been declared by the said civic authorities, those who planned and carried through the attack, and by the organs of the Press which profess to speak on their behalf, that these things have been done in support of and in alliance with the enemies of the Republic; it be and is hereby declared that an embargo be laid upon the manufactures of the <Col N="193"/> aforesaid City of Belfast; that all trade and commerce with it by citizens of the Irish Republic be forbidden and that the Government of the Republic calls upon all its loyal citizens to rigorously enforce the provision of this decree until such time as the Government and Legislature of the Republic may otherwise decide.&rdquo;</P>
<P>PAUL GALLIGAN (Cavan West) seconded the motion.</P>
<P>E. BLYTHE (Monaghan North) was entirely opposed to a blockade against Eelfast.  Such action should be taken against individuals only.  To declare an economic blockade of Belfast would be the worst possible step to take.  If it were taken it would destroy for ever the possibility of any union.  Belfast could not be brought down through the banks.  They were there as a Government, and they could not afford to range any section of the citizens against them.  The basis of every trouble in the North was sectarian.  It was that fact that made possible the fury of the anti-Catholic forces there.</P>
<P>A. MACCABE (Sligo South) suggested that the motion on the agenda in his name should be considered in connection with the matter.</P>
<P>COUNTESS MARKIEVICZ (St. Patrick's, Dublin) would be in favour of the blockade, if it could be made effective, but she was not convinced that it could be. To declare a blockade would be playing into the hands of the enemy and giving them a good excuse for partition.  It was even possible that this was a trap on the part of the English Government to cut off trade with Belfast and so make Ireland into two trading centres.  The arguments put forward by the Deputy for South Monaghan were not enough to warrant such action as he proposed.</P>
<P>E. BLYTHE (Monaghan North) moved as an amendment:&mdash;</P><P>&ldquo;That the Ministry be directed to consider what action can be taken by way of a commercial embargo against individuals responsible for inciting to the recent pogroms in Belfast.&rdquo;</P>
<P>COUNTESS MARKIEVICZ (St. Patrick's, Dublin) seconded the amendment.</P>
<P>D. FITZGERALD (Pembroke) was of opinion that the Belfast Pogrom was an attempt to exterminate the Nationalist population there.  The Republican movement had been gaining ground in Ulster and to adopt a blockade against Belfast would be to vote for partition.</P>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT said that the was not speaking on behalf of the Government.  He was voicing his own views.  He disagreed with both the resolution and the amendment.  The resolution was practically a declaration of war on one part of their own territory. If the proposed scheme of dislocation were passed and published it would be an admission that Belfast was outside Ireland.  The situation did not permit of delay.  There were five or six thousand men, representing 40,000 people, thrown out of work, and there was no likelihood of their getting back. A printed form had been prepared which it was sought to compel every Catholic workingman to sign, and which contained a repudiation of Sinn Fein.  It was a case where they could not stand aside. There were twelve or thirteen million pounds paid annually into Belfast Banks from Leinster, Munster, and Connacht, and the middle-class employers depended on this money to keep their business going.  That could be cut off.  If they held up the banks it would bring the Unionist gentlemen to their senses very quickly.  He would have the same objection to any other employer in any other part of Ireland imposing a test on his employees as in Belfast.  He considered that it should be declared illegal for any employer to impose a test on an employee.  If the Belfast employers refused to comply within seven days, then a blockade of Belfast could be declared. In this way they could cut off the whole of Belfast for a period.  A white list could then be made out of the firms who refuse to impose any test.</P>
<P>T. MACSUIBHNE (Cork Mid.) agreed with the Acting-President in view of the urgency of the matter.  It would however, be a mistake to deal with it on a temporary basis.  Any attempt to settle <Col N="194"/> the problem permanently would have to be undertaken along constructive lines. The establishment of co-operative factories to provide employment for Republicans who could be induced to settle in Belfast would be a big step towards the solution of the problem.</P>
<P>JOSEPH MACGRATH (St. James's, Dublin) suggested that the Trades Congress be asked by the Ministry to open negotiations with the employers for a settlement.</P>
<P>M. COLLINS (Cork South) spoke of the effect which a boycott of the Belfast Banks would have in Belfast.  He protested, however, against the attempt which had been made by two deputies from the North of Ireland to inflame the passions of members.  There was no Ulster question.</P>
<P>LIAM DE ROISTE (Cork City) was opposed to economic boycott as it would mean having to purchase English-made goods instead of Belfast-made articles. Economic penetration was the solution of the Ulster question.</P><P>After further discussion the amendment was put and defeated.</P>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT then moved as a further amendment:&mdash;</P><P>&ldquo;That the imposition of political or religious tests as a condition of Industrial Employment in Ireland is hereby declared illegal, and that action be taken by the Ministry to prevent such tests being imposed in Ireland.&rdquo;</P><P>After further discussion, this amendment was accepted by SEAN MACENTEE (Monaghan South) and was put and carried.</P>

    <Title>COMMISSION TO INQUIRE INTO ENGLISH ORGANISED OPPOSITION TO REPUBLIC.</Title>
<P>A. MACCABE (Sligo South) moved the following resolution standing in his name:&mdash;</P><P>&ldquo;That a commission of this body, with power to co-opt, be appointed to consider the Ulster question.&rdquo;</P><P>&ldquo;That its terms of reference be:&mdash;</P><P>&ldquo;To discuss and devise measures for dealing with present or future victimisation of nationalist workers in Belfast and the North of Ireland generally.</P><P>&ldquo;To consider the East Ulster question with special reference to the demand of the corner counties for local self-government.</P><P>&ldquo;To inquire into the feasibility or advisability of putting before the country a scheme of federalised Government with the county as the Unit.</P><P>&ldquo;To ascertain how far the objections of the people of Belfast and the corner counties to an Irish Republic may be met by a liberal scheme of devolution based on this idea.&rdquo;</P>
<P>T. MACSUIBHNE (Cork Mid.) seconded the first part of the resolution, but suggested that the terms of reference be left to the Ministry.  The proposer accepted this.</P><P>Objection having been taken to the use of the words &ldquo;Ulster Question,&rdquo; it was agreed that the title of the Commission should be settled by the Ministry, and the resolution was adopted subject to these amendments.</P>

<P>The SECRETARY FOR HOME AFFAIRS presented his report and moved its adoption.  He, however, asked permission to withdraw for the present the proposals contained therein relating to:</P><P>(1)  Censorship of cinemas.</P><P>(2)  Scales of compensation payable to workmen killed or incapacitated in the course of their employment.</P><P>These matters could be taken up at the next Session.</P>

    <Title>REPORTS AND MINISTERIAL MOTIONS. - INCREASE OF RENT.</Title>
<P>The SECRETARY FOR HOME AFFAIRS moved the adoption of a decree limiting <Col N="195"/> increases in rent as follows:&mdash;</P><P>&ldquo;IT IS HEREBY DECREED:&mdash;</P><P>1.  &ldquo;That no landlord of any dwell inghouse shall compel a tenant to quit his holding or terminate or refuse to renew the tenancy of any tenant if the tenant shall pay a reasonable increase of rent.</P><P>2.  &ldquo;A &lsquo;reasonable increase of rent&rsquo; shall mean:</P><P>(a)  An amount calculated at the rate of 6 per cent per annum on the expenditure on the improvement or structural alteration of the dwellinghouse (not including expenditure on decoration or repairs).</P><P>(b)  &ldquo;And in addition any increase in the amount payable by the landlord in respect of rates over the rates paid in respect of the corresponding period which included the 3rd August, 1914.</P><P>3.  &ldquo;That pending further legislation the Secretary of State for Home Affairs, with the approval of the Ministry, be empowered to make such Regulations as the Ministry shall deem fit to carry out the provisions of this decree.</P><P>4.  &ldquo;This decree shall be deemed to have come into operation as from the 1st July, 1920.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The SECRETARY FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT formally seconded the motion.</P>
<P>M. STAINES (St. Michan's, Dublin) stated that the English Act was unjust to the tenants and that the proposed decree was unjust to the landlords. There had been very little done in the way of structural alterations during the war, and there was practically no increase possible under this head.  The cost of repairs had increased about 400 per cent. since 1914, and there was no provision in the decree for an increase of rent to meet this.  The landlord should also be allowed the difference between the mortgage rate of interest prevailing now and that in force in 1914.</P><P>He suggested as an amendment to the proposed decree that a new clause be added granting an increase of 20 per cent. on the amount of the net rent on 3rd August, 1914.</P>
<P>The SECRETARY FOR HOME AFFAIRS declined to accept the amendment, and after further discussion it was agreed, on the motion of T. MACSUIBHNE (Cork Mid.), seconded by J. DOLAN (Leitrim) that the question be referred to a Committee consisting of Messrs. Staines. MacDonagh, Dolan, MacGrath, and Duggan, to report in the course of the Session.</P>

    <Title>REPORTS AND MINISTERIAL MOTIONS. - DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS.</Title>
<P>The ASSOCIATE SECRETARY FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (COUNT PLUNKETT) in the course of an oral statement, dwelt on the nature of the recent dispute between certain people in America and the President.  These people thought that they in America had a right to dictate the policy of the Republic.  The President naturally held a different view. The Irish Cause could not be used as a lever by any particular parties or politicians in America.  The trouble was now practically over.  The President was sure of his ground, and the greater volume of Irish opinion in the United States had rallied to his support.</P><P>In Italy Mr. Hales was continuing his work.  Mr. Gavan Duffy was still at Paris, and for some time Mr. Sean T. O'Kelly had been successfully combatting English intrigues in Rome.  Slow progress was being made in the organisation of relations between the Republic and Austria and Germany.  The manufactures which Ireland might be able to get from these countries were treated by England as &ldquo;key&rdquo; industries and therefore could not be imported into Ireland.</P>
<P>P. O MAILLE (Connemara) asked (1) What likelihood there was of Mr. O'Kelly's returning to take up his duties as Secretary of the Gaelie League? and (2)  If the letter of resignation of Mr. Diarmuid Lynch had been received by the Dáil?</P>
<P><Col N="196"/> The DEPUTY SPEAKER, replying to the second query, said that it was clear that copies of the letter had been supplied to the Dublin Press.  Two copies had also been sent to himself.  Mr. Lynch's letter had been read to the House that morning before the member for Connemara arrived.</P>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT, replying to the first query, said that Mr. O'Kelly was ill at present, and had been ordered to take a few months' rest.  He did not think that he would be home for some time as he was still required at Rome. Of course if his health did not improve he would very likely have to come home.</P>
<P>CATHAL BRUGHA (Waterford County) said that Mr. O'Kelly should be consulted in the matter before a definite reply could be given.</P>
<P>T. MACSUIBHNE (Cork Mid.) moved the adoption of the Report of the Department for Foreign Affairs.</P>
<P>J.J. WALSH (Cork City) said that it was time that the Dáil took steps to have vacancies in their body filled.  He asked for further details regarding Mr. Lynch's letter, and as to what policy, if any, had been adopted towards Russia.</P>

<P>THE SECRETARY FOR FINANCE read his Report, and moved its adoption.</P>
<P>THE ACTING-PRESIDENT seconded the motion.</P>
<P>P. O MAILLE (Connemara) suggested that the manufacture of poteen should be brought under the supervision of the Government, and that a tax should be imposed upon its manufacture rather than that the stills should be broken up. The Government should also be authorised to impose a quality test.</P>
<P>T. MACSUIBHNE (Cork Mid) raised the question of licences generally. People had applied to him for auctioneers' licences and offered to pay the tax on them to the Republican Exchequer.</P>
<P>J.J. WALSH (Cork City) asked the reason for the non-payment of a grant of approximately £150 to the Belfast Comhairle Ceanntair in connection with the expenses of the General Election.</P>
<P>SEAN MAC AN TSAOI (Monaghan South) said that there was now a greater need than ever for establishing a Branch of the Agricultural Loan Bank in one of the Ulster Border Counties.</P>
<P>The FINANCE MINISTER, replying to the different queries, stated that he would not recommend that they take money for licences in individual cases. Arrangements would have to be made to deal with the question generally.  The issue of auctioneers' licences was under consideration.</P>
<P>With regard to the payment of the Belfast Election Expenses the position was that at the October Session a sum <Col N="197"/> of £1,300 was voted to defray outstanding expenses in connection with the General Election.  This money was voted at the request of the Standing Committee of Sinn Fein, and on the understanding that the money would only be employed to pay such accounts as were authenticated by the Election Committee. If the authentication were forthcoming in this case there would be no difficulty in paying the amount due.</P><P>No Branches of the Bank had yet been established.  It was necessary to begin in localities where there was a likelihood of large deposits being secured.</P>
<P>SEAN MAC AN TSAOI (Monaghan South) said that the advance to the Belfast Comhairle Ceanntair should be paid.</P>
<P>L.T. MACCOSGAIR (Kilkenny North) stated that certain items of the account submitted were not connected with the business of the General Election at all, and that the account could not therefore be certified.</P>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT said that this matter was out of order.  It was a question for the Sinn Fein Executive.  All the Election Expenses' Accounts had been paid, and the matter closed for some time before this account came in.  It appeared that those who had sent it learned that there was money available for the paying of debts in Belfast.</P><P>The Report of the Finance Department was then put and adopted.</P>

<P>THE DIRECTOR OF TRADE AND COMMERCE read the joint Report of the Departments of Industries and Trade and Commerce, and moved its adoption.</P>
<P>J. MACDONAGH (Tipperary North) seconded the motion.</P>
<P>J.J. WALSH (Cork City) stated that at no time in Irish history were Irish industries so neglected as at present. This was due to their failure to rouse the Irish people to a sense of their duty. He referred to the decline in the trade of Irish-made matches and cigarettes, and to the reduction of the staff in a tin factory in Ringsend.  Over 100 employees had been dismissed from Paterson's works.  A similar condition of affairs to that in Dublin obtained throughout the country.  Notwithstanding that Mr. Blythe was devoting a lot of time to the organisation of a dressed meat factory in Waterford, which would employ possibly 1,000 hands, the bacon industry showed a decline of 5,000 in the number of hands employed within the last few years.  He feared that the Department of Trade and Commerce was paying too much attention to foreign markets and neglecting the home markets. He emphasised the necessity of conserving the home market for Irish products.  He suggested that Mr. Blythe should have the support of a strong Committee of the Dáil.</P>
<P>COUNTESS MARKIEVICZ (St. Patrick's, Dublin) agreed with the Senior Teachta for Cork City.  The fault lay in the fact that they did not advertise <Col N="198"/> enough.  The Dáil should give money for advertising purposes.</P>
<P>J.J. CLANCY (Sligo North) said that the fault to a great extent lay at the doors of the manufacturers themselves, who did not send travellers regularly to important centres.</P>
<P>J. O'MAHONY (Fermanagh South) and D. O BUACHALLA (Kildare North) complained that Irish goods were very poorly supported in mnay instances both by distributors and consumers.</P>
<P>LIAM DE ROISTE (Cork City) asked for a definite decision as to whether money might be spent on a propaganda campaign in favour of Irish industries.</P>
<P>SEAN MAC AN TSAOI (Monaghan South) asked what steps had the Department taken to draw the attention of the newly-elected Republican Councils to the fact that it was their duty to support Irish manufacturers.  Arrangements should be made to co-ordinate the requirements of Irish public bodies so as to encourage manufacturers to cater for these.</P>
<P>The SECRETARY FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT referred to the report presented by the Local Government Department at the previous Session, which dealt with this co-ordination.  Support of Irish industry and manufacture was advocated in the first instructions issued to the local authorities by the Department.</P>
<P>A. MACCABA (Sligo South) stated that there was £200,000 spent on steam-rolling machinery annually by public bodies in Ireland, and suggested that the question of having this money spent at home should be taken up at once.</P>
<P>R.M. SWEETMAN (Wexford North) suggested that the Dublin Industrial Development Association should be asked to compile a list of firms willing to stock Irish-made goods, and urge their members to deal with these firms.</P>
<P>R. O MAOLCHATHA (Clontarf) suggested that a league on the model of the Fainne for the support of Irish manufactures might be established.  If people were to be directed to support home manufactures, a definite basis should be laid down.  Schedules should be prepared showing list of articles made and consumed in Ireland articles not manufactured for which materials were available in Ireland, and articles that cannot be manufactured in Ireland. He referred to the proposed Mater Hospital National Exhibition, which was to take place next year, and in which a special section was to be devoted to the encouragement of home industry.</P>
<P>C. O HUIGIN (Leix) stated that sufficient use had not been made of the Sinn Fein Organisation for the spread of propaganda in regard to the consumption of Irish-manufactured articles.</P>
<P>A. MAC CABE (Sligo South) moved:</P><P>&ldquo;That the issue of a new edition of the Buyers' Guide be financed by the Dáil.&rdquo;</P>
<P>COUNTESS MARKIEVICZ (St. Patrick's, Dublin) seconded this motion.</P><P>The motion was talked out.</P>
<P>SEAN ETCHINGHAM (Wicklow East) thought that the proposal to start the manufacture of steam rollers was not a feasible one.</P>
<P>MICHEAL O COILEAIN (Cork South) thought that the blame for the backwardness of Irish industries rested not so much with the consumer as with the manufacturer.  The manufacturers did not study the needs of the Irish consumers, and the consumer was expected to take whatever was offered to him.  It was questionable whether it would not be better to have some of the manufacturers out of the country.  He suggested that a return be made of all the requirements of the Poor Law Unions in Ireland. Such a return would be a guarantee to Irish firms, and they could improve and extend their plant.  Irish manufacturers could not afford to speculate without some guarantee that there would be a continuous demand for their products.  The Local Government Department should take the initiative in this matter through the General Council of County Councils.  In any negotiations with firms Labour should be consulted, as they could not support any firm which &ldquo;sweated&rdquo; its employees.</P>
<P>The DIRECTOR OF TRADE AND COMMERCE stated with regard to the matter <Col N="199"/> of supplies to the bacon factories that arrangements had been come to whereby the question of the number of pigs to be exported would be submitted to a tribunal to be established by Dáil Eireann; the representatives of the Farmers' Union and of Labour had agreed to abide by the decisions of this tribunal. He had written to Liam de Roiste, of the Cork Branch of the Industrial Development Association to the effect that if a scheme for advertising Irish-manufactured articles was put forward it would be favourably considered.  That was a different matter, however, from the proposal that they should subsidise the Cork Branch of the Industrial Development Association.</P><P>The Report was then put and carried.</P>

Referring to the agrarian outbreak of last March, he said that they had to provide Land Courts as a temporary expedient to prevent general anarchy.

    <Title>DEPARTMENT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT. - Local Government Commission.</Title>
<P>The SECRETARY FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT submitted the report of the Commission on Local Government.  He stated that the New General Council of County Councils were being called together on the 12th inst., and the question of the finances of Public Bodies would be considered there. The Grants made by the English Government to public bodies in Ireland was about one-eighth of the total revenue of these bodies.</P><P>Some scheme must be devised to make up the loss caused by the stoppage of these grants under the terms of the recent circular issued by the English Local Government Board.  Labour should be willing to give whatever assistance was required to prevent the seizure of the property of the people.  Some Councils would be very badly hit.  In Dublin there were three large contracts in progress and there would be no capital to finance them.  He moved the adoption of the report.</P>
<P>S. O DOLAIN (Leitrim) seconded the motion.</P>
<P>P. O MAILLE (Connemara), referring to the proposal contained in the Clare County Council Scheme, that the loss of grants should be met by levying portion of the land annuities on present occupiers of holdings, said that if land annuities were forwarded to the English Land Commission minus the deductions in respect of the withheld grants, they would probably not be accepted.</P><P>He asked what gurantee had the Rate Collectors that the English Government would not prosecute them for the recovery of the money collected by them in rates.</P>
<P>ART O CONCHUBHAIR (Kildare South) asked if it were intended that the position of the Committees of Agriculture be considered by the Commission.  He was informed that a sum of £200,000 was involved, and that the English Department did not wish that anything in the nature of a break should occur.</P>
<P><Col N="204"/> C. O HUIGIN (Leix) said that the financial status and position generally of those Committees had not come in any special way before the Commission.  He would regard the work of the Commission as very incomplete if the position of these Committees were not considered.</P>
<P>T. MACSUIBHNE (Cork Mid.) said that there principal concern was to get in sufficient money to enable them to function.  In dealing with this question for the County and Borough Councils, they were covering all.  It had been suggested that Unionists might refuse to pay rates.  He was quite satisfied they would not.  Unionists who sought the protection of the Republican Courts would pay the rates and an extra tax for protection if required.  The farmers would be quite willing to pay their land purchase annuities to the Republican Government.</P>
<P>ART O CONCHUBHAIR (Kildare South) said that the Committees of Agriculture were more or less distinct.  They had staffs of their own and a considerable portion of their funds was paid direct to them from the English Department of Agriculture.</P>
<P>C. O HUIGIN (Leix), referring to the question of the Teachta for Connemara as to the payment of Land Purchase Annuities, said that if it were decided to have these annuities paid into the Republican Exchequer, there should be no deductions made.  As regards the Rate Collectors, the position of these officials would be made perfectly clear by their first formally resigning and then being reappointed.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS pointed out that the only people who could prosecute the Rate Collectors were the County Councils.</P>
<P>S. MAC DONNACHADA (Tipperary North) submitted that the most urgent question for the Local Government Department was that of Housing.  The question of floating a loan for this purpose secured by the rates and guaranteed by the Dáil should be considered.</P>
<P>C. O HUIGIN (Leix) said he was well aware of the circulars which had been issued by the English Local Government Board offering money for Housing, but they had not come along with the money. This was the case even before the Councils declared allegiance to Dáil Eireann.  It was a question as to whether a special rate should not be raised for Housing.</P>
<P>The SECRETARY FOR FINANCE observed that the payment of Land Annuities to the Republican Exchequer was not one of the immediate things to be done.  There were some cases where the annuities had only a few years to run, and it would not be good business to withhold them.  This matter should be further gone into before any action were taken.  The report was of course subject to elaboration by the Commission.</P>
<P>J.J. CLANCY (Sligo North) referred to the fact that British Government Stocks to the nominal value of half a million pounds were held by public bodies, and asked what should be done with them.</P>
<P>The SECRETARY FOR FINANCE suggested that the people who bought these stocks should be surcharged with the loss sustained by selling them.  It would be a loss to sell them but it would be a greater loss to keep them.</P>
<P>The ACTING-PRESIDENT pointed out that it was proposed in the final paragraph of the Report of the Commission that public bodies on a certain day should &ldquo;call&rdquo; on all young men to join the Republican Army.  If the Dáil considered that it was necessary for the defence of the country that this be done the Dáil and the Dáil alone was competent to issue such a decree.  If the report was adopted as it stood, it would mean that they were conferring on the local bodies the power of determining National Policy.</P>
<P>The SECRETARY FOR DEFENCE did not agree.  It was merely assisting the Defence Department to get recruits.</P>
<P>A. MACCABE (Sligo South) said that he had already suggested that each County Council be empowered to enrol a Local Police Force.</P>
<P>The SPEAKER ruled this out as irrelevant.</P>
<P><Col N="205"/> After some discussion it was decided to substitute the word &ldquo;advise&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;call&rdquo; in the final paragraph of the report.</P><P>The report was then put and agreed to.</P>

<P>S. O HAODHA (Cork West) asked for information as to the amount of money given to the West Carbery Co-operative Fishing Society and as to the steps which had been taken to see that the money would be profitably expended.  He understood that there was a big loss in the trading.</P>
<P>S. O MATHGHAMHNA (Fermanagh South) asked for information as to the number of Societies established and the profit or loss, if any.  Money was advanced by the bank in one certain district, and he understood that the result showed a net loss of over £12,000.</P>
<P>LIAM DE ROISTE (Cork City) and S. MACDONNACHADHA (Tipperary North) also referred to the management of the West Carbery Co-operative Fishery Society.</P>
<P>The DIRECTOR OF FISHERIES read the report of the Auditors on the accounts of the West Carbery Society, from which it appeared that the loss on trading was £2,874 6s. 5d.  The Society had been badly managed.  The Arklow men had sustained such losses that there were 15 boats idle as a result, and the men had gone into the mercantile marine.  Mr. G. O'Brien, the Bank Inspector, was going down to Baltimore to report.</P>
<P>The ACTING-SPEAKER suggested that Messrs. Hayes, O'Mahony, MacDonagn and Collins be appointed a Sub-Committee to enquire into the matter and report to the Ministry.</P>
<P>SEAN O HAODHA (Cork West) said that this suggestion would not meet the case.  Local people had not been consulted when the money was given.  He believed that there was dissatisfaction with the Organiser.  The man who was originally sent down knew nothing about fishing.</P>
