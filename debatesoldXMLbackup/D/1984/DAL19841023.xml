    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the specific duties assigned to the Government press secretary, and the salary, emoluments and conditions of employment attaching to the post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been the case with his predecessors in the post, the Government press secretary is required under his contract of employment to perform any duties assigned to him from time to time by the Taoiseach as appropriate to his position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In practice his work consists principally <Col N="2" /> of ensuring that the media are kept informed of Government decisions and policies and of securing from Ministers and Departments information sought by the media in respect of the activities of these Ministers and Departments.</P>
    <P>The Government press secretary receives salary at a rate equivalent to the maximum of the Civil Service assistant secretary, at present £26,054 per annum, and in addition, a contribution equal to 12 per cent of salary is payable towards the cost of superannuation.  In accordance with the general practice introduced by me when I first took office as Taoiseach in June 1981, the appointment will, <Col N="3" /> unless terminated by notice, last for the duration of the present Government only.  The position is wholetime and he is not allowed under his contract to engage in or be connected with any outside business. Customary arrangements apply in relation to sick leave and annual leave and he is subject to the usual Civil Service regulations relating to official secrecy and integrity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the recent activities of the press secretary in denigrating the alternate British Prime Minister, the leader of a major political party there?  Would the Taoiseach care to comment on the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach say whether this type of activity comes within the specific duties assigned to the press secretary of the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>A question on this matter was received and after adjudication it was disallowed.  Is the Deputy questioning the ruling of the Chair?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The question was addressed to the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It was disallowed by the Chair on the grounds that the Taoiseach had no responsibility for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I shall try my question to the Taoiseach.  Is he aware of the recent activities of the press secretary? An article was clearly identified as having been written by the press secretary and does the Taoiseach condone this sort of activity where, as I said, his press secretary denigrates the Leader of the Labour Party &mdash; a man who is very likely to be the next leader of the British Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I am aware of the review and I have read it.  It was a very <Col N="4" /> good review, written over the press secretary's own name.  There is no reason why any civil servant should not, in his private life, write about matters of general concern. I do not recall that in the past when, for example, Myles na gCopaleen or Thomas Kinsella or others in the Civil Service were writing, questions being raised about it.  I think it quite appropriate that anybody in the Civil Service should use his or her talents to write about matters of which he or she has particular knowledge or a particular interest in.  The review was a good one and did not, in my view, denigrate Mr. Kinnock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Taoiseach is losing his marbles.  The Taoiseach has gone off his rocker.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach say whether he gave approval to the article by his Government press secretary before it was submitted for publication in the Sunday newspapers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Good heavens, no &mdash; no more than the Leader of the Opposition approved of the writings of Anthony Cronin when he was working for him, I presume.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Not on political matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach say whether he thinks it appropriate for a Government press secretary to engage in this sort of attack on this type of leader and whether he agrees that a public servant should engage in attacks on political leaders in this country also?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no attack made on any political leader.  The Deputy either did not read the review or, if he did so, he must have read it with an extraordinarly closed mind.  The review contained no attack on Mr. Kinnock.  It was an interesting and relevant examination of the role of the politician under <Col N="5" /> modern conditions.  I wish more people would write on politics in those terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach say what experience the press secretary has to write such an article in which there was a direct attack on the Leader of the British Labour Party?  How competent is he and whence did he get his competence?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>To get back from Deputy Kelly to the Taoiseach's reply, would the Taoiseach not agree that nowhere in his reply was there contained any reference whatever to the matter of a press secretary using his assignment and having as terms of reference for his mandate the right to engage in public controversy either at home or abroad in regard to public political figures at home or abroad?</P>

      <P>I want the Taoiseach to repeat his original reply.  Would he not agree, if he does not wish to do this, that nowhere in his official reply is there any reference to an incursion by the press secretary into the area of public controversy as being part of the mandate of the press secretary of the Government?</P>

      <P>It was a specific question. We have been listening to many third-rate answers from the Taoiseach.  I want to know why this sort of nonsense was not included in the Taoiseach's official reply to the question put down by Deputy Collins.  Nowhere in his reply is there any reference to this extension of the press secretary's mandate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department and Córas Tráchtála are continually watching the external trading environment and offer advice and assistance to exporters experiencing difficulties in any market.</P>
      <P>Through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade for 90 per cent of our trade and through joint commissions with state trading countries which are not members of GATT, we seek to ensure that there is no discrimination against Irish exporters.</P>
      <P>My concern at the need for the removal of technical barriers to trade within the EC led me to have two Internal Market Councils included in the EC programme during the Irish Presidency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="8" />
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that an appreciable degree of harassment is being accorded to the import of Irish goods into some of the EC countries, notably France and to a lesser extent Italy?  Has the Minister had any list of complaints to his Department or to the Minister for Communications and, if so, what is he doing about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite sure what category of goods the Deputy is referring to.  The Deputy may not be aware that until now telecommunications equipment has not been subject to the same rules as far as discriminatory purchasing is concerned as were other forms of equipment.  In other words, it was possible for members of the EC to specify that they could buy only material purchased or processed within their own countries for their telecommunications network.  I am glad to say, however, that at the meeting of the Market Council of the EC which I chaired last week this policy is now changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that at the port of entry, notably in France and to a lesser extent in Italy, drivers of trucks bearing Irish goods into Europe are harassed and interfered with and presented with technical obstructions and difficulties in the import of these goods? Has the Minister any information about that and, if he has, could he say what steps are being taken in the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not heard of specific complaints of the type mentioned by the Deputy.  I am aware, of course, that it is always possible, operating within the strict letter of the law, for people to make trade difficult and there is a limit to what one can do by means of law to stop that and seek political commitment from the Governments concerned that this will not continue to occur.  I would appreciate if the Deputy would draw to my attention any instances he has in mind.  However, the myriad of paper that must be filled up by people exporting within the EC is in itself something of a bureaucratic barrier to trade, <Col N="9" /> and I am glad to say that at a meeting of the Market Council of the EC which I chaired two weeks ago agreement was reached to substitute for the numerous documents that now have to be filled one single document which will have to be filled in respect of exporting goods.  This is a major step forward which will facilitate intra-EC trade and something which we in our Irish Presidency of the EC can be somewhat pleased about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism when it is proposed to introduce legislation to deal with continuing difficulties attached to limited liability in company law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill, aimed at eliminating the abuse of limited liability and general malpractice in the activities of companies, which has been fully prepared in my Department, is complex.  I have completed a thorough examination of the proposals and will be seeking Government approval within the next few weeks for drafting by the parliamentary draftsman.</P>
      <P>I am making strenuous efforts to ensure that it is introduced as early as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this legislation has been promised for two years and that his predecessor in office is already on the record of this House, and has made public statements outside the House, saying the very same thing as the Minister now says, that it is almost ready in the Department?  Is it not true that it has not yet been drafted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is not the case. What my predecessor said is correct.  My predecessor had brought this Bill to a very high state of preparation.  Since taking office I have been examining this Bill carefully in the light of a number of questions one of which is the incorporation of a certain new method which arises from the publication of the Cork report in the UK which brings forward quite a number of suggestions in regard to malpractice which I think will be useful to incorporate in this Bill, and this was another aspect.  However, I am glad to say that the question of these matters is now completed and I expect that the Government will be considering this matter within the next week or two with a view to making a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that the Cork <Col N="11" /> report to which the Minister referred was already in the Department before his predecessor stated that the legislation was already prepared?  Is it not true also that major changes have taken place in the drafting of this legislation since he took over the office as Minister and that a complete turn-around is taking place in this legislation because of certain matters that Deputy Cluskey would not and will not agree with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot comment on when the Cork report arrived in the Department.  However, it is appropriate that in matters of this kind &mdash; seeing that we do not introduce major company Bills very often; the last one of a comprehensive kind was introduced in 1963 &mdash; we should act on the most up-to-date suggestions as far as is compatible with our wishes.  There is no question of it being a complete turn-around.  This was natural as is the case in the course of the passage of any Bill, quite apart from internal considerations in the Department and certain matters examined in the light of the particular question.  At this stage, in any event, all of this is to be approved by the Government and it would be premature to say what might or might not be proposed until such time as the Government have made their decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it was detrimental because in practice this change is something that is almost certainly &mdash; unless there is a problem with the EC &mdash; going to come into effect. In any event, people making industrial projects know that there is a certain leave time between having the project ready and the grant falling to be paid.  For instance, if we had been able to designate those estates the day after nobody would have been in a position to avail of them for about six months because it would have taken that amount of time to bring forward the type of projects that would avail of them, that would not have gone ahead if they were not there.

      <P>I can refer the Minister to the names of people in the various directives.

      <P>I do not accept that there has been any undue delay in regard to this matter.  In making a submission to the EC in regard to designation it is necessary to produce a fairly substantial amount of socio-economic data in support of the application.  It is not simply a question of making a decision on 10 May and writing a two-line letter to Vice-President Davignon, or whoever, saying. &ldquo;By the way, Stevie, we want this thing through next week&rdquo;.

That is below the national average.  In the year 1983 unemployment figures in Skibbereen decreased.  That was something that did not happen on a widespread basis throughout the country.  However, there remains a significant unemployment problem in the area and that is why the IDA are continuing to promote actively the remaining unit and the 11.5 acre site they have there.  The filling of the two units is an indication of the measure of confidence in the area.  I hope that continues to be the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Flynn is aware, County Mayo has been designated for the highest level of grant since the foundation of the IDA.  That is in recognition of the regional disadvantages from which the county suffers in terms of distance from markets and so on.  The effect of this is to be found in the fact that unemployment levels in Mayo have not been increasing at as high a level as those in other parts of the country, for instance in the five-year period up to January 1984, unemployment in Mayo increased by 64 per cent as against a <Col N="26" /> national average of almost 135 per cent. For the calendar year 1983, while the national average for unemployment was 16 per cent the increase in unemployment in Mayo was 5 per cent.  Despite those figures there remains a considerable unemployment problem in the area. Increasingly in Mayo as elsewhere, there is a desire on the part of the people concerned to help themselves.  What was being acknowledged by the function which took place in Westport yesterday was what can be done by people in the county to help themselves in establishing not only workers' co-operatives but enterprise centres.  I take this opportunity of complimenting the people involved in that local initiative and also the people of the area generally for the efforts they are making, with State assistance, to help themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's figures would suggest that Mayo has not suffered in terms of unemployment to the same extent as have other parts of the country but would he accept that the reason for the figures being somewhat lower than for other parts of the country is that there was always rampant emigration from Mayo and that, even after a lull, it was easy for that trend to recommence?  I would point out to the Minister that almost 200,000 square feet of empty factory space, together with an unemployment figure of 7,000 which is made up in the main of people in the under 25 age group, is causing a serious imbalance in the population structure in the county. It is necessary, not only to congratulate those who are trying to help themselves but to create a climate in which it will be easier for people to take such initiatives on a wide scale.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is correct.  The success of a number of small entrepreneurs in establishing business in Mayo indicates the contrary.  One could regard the 191,000 square feet of factory space as an indication of the recessionary times we are living in but it can be regarded also in another way, that is, as a major State investment in Mayo which offers an opportunity for any industrialist wishing to establish there.  Any such person would have no problem in terms of suitable premises.  I am confident that the significant investment which this factory space represents will bear considerable fruit in the near future because there has been a quickening of interest in investment in all parts of the country.  I am confident that much of this space will be filled within the next 12 months.</P>

      <P>My function in this matter is the administration of price control on the selling prices of petroleum products.  The objective of current policy in this regard is that the pre-tax prices of petroleum products here should relate to pre-tax market prices elsewhere in the European Community so far as possible as is consistent with maintaining availability of supplies.  In so far as competition does not achieve this objective price control mechanisms will continue to be applied.  In line with this policy, a new system of monthly reviews of petroleum product prices was, on the advice of the National Prices Commission, introduced in June 1984.  As indicated in the national plan, the system is designed to generate greater competition and is structured so that Irish prices will move in line with international market prices.  Full details of the new system and the monthly reviews under the system are contained in the monthly reports of the National Prices Commission which are circulated to Deputies.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the prices of petroleum products, and of petrol in particular, have been falling in many countries in Europe, especially in <Col N="29" /> the past month, and can he indicate why we must be subjected to price increases in this essential commodity on a monthly scale and why there was yet another increase yesterday morning following three in the past three months?  Has the Minister any proposals for dealing with this provision?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is well aware, while prices in terms of the dollar are falling, the value of the dollar is increasing. One factor can counteract the other.  I am aware of the various moves which have been made in regard to oil prices in dollar terms and, even in the most sensitive system, there is some delay in incorporating them in prices here.  If they indicate a significant and lasting reduction in the spot price it is hoped that they will be incorporated in prices in the next monthly review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that this continuous spiral of price increases for petrol is pricing us out of the market, not just in the area of tourism, but in regard to competitiveness on the industrial front as well?  Can he not do something about our contractual arrangements internationally and about our purchasing and storage arrangements to stabilise prices in this vital area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Much as I would like to stabilise the prices in this area it is not possible to do so in a commodity where prices are so variable and volatile in the outside world.  All these products are brought into this country and if we attempted to stabilise prices here we would have to subsidise the products at some times and tax them at others to <Col N="30" /> achieve stability and it would not be feasible administratively.  The Deputy probably mistakes the purpose of the new price control regime if he thinks it was designed to reduce prices.  It was designed to ensure that prices would move in line with spot prices internationally reasonably soon after the movement took place in the spot price, thereby having an independent external check on the prices that would be charged in this country.  This replaced a system where companies importing to this country put in applications based on allowable costs and were allowed increases at much more infrequent intervals which meant at times that Irish prices were way above the prevailing world price for quite a long time, indeed sometimes below it.  It also had the inherent defect that the companies were able to put in perhaps their most expensive recent purchase of petrol as the allowable cost of the petrol going to Ireland, thereby, theoretically at least, being able to claim a higher price than perhaps should have been given on the basis of what the consignment coming to Ireland actually cost.  This got us into an administrative tangle which our present regime got us out of, as the price is related to movements in spot prices over which individual oil companies have no control.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> There is every reason for public concern about the circumstances in which the late Peter Matthews died in Shercock Garda Station, County Cavan, two years ago.  I share that concern and I share also what I am sure is the wish of every Member of the House, that is, the wish to ensure that whatever action is desirable in the public interest will in fact be taken.  More time is needed, however, to determine what the best course of action is.  In principle, I would have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending to the Government that a public inquiry be established to examine witnesses on oath.  I cannot, however, proceed to do that without first carefully examining whether such a course of action would be likely to do more harm than good as would be the case if, for instance, it appeared likely that such an inquiry would not be able to establish the facts to any greater extent than they are already known and if, in addition to that, it appeared likely that the holding of the inquiry would itself operate to prevent other action being taken which ought to be taken or <Col N="36" /> to cause undue delay in the taking of such action.</P>
      <P>The position about formal inquiries, whether judicial or administrative, is complicated by the fact that two members of the Garda Síochána have, separately and before separate juries, been acquitted of charges of injuring Mr. Matthews.</P>
      <P>No possible public purpose would be served by the commencement of a course of action that might superficially and immediately appear popular if in fact it were clearly foreseeable that such a course would end in stalemate or worse, as would be the case if, for instance, something were done that would invite High Court proceedings to have the action quashed.  It is therefore necessary to take care to ensure that the right decisions are made and to take whatever time is needed to ensure that that care is in fact taken.  In the meantime, I can say for the information of the House that Mrs. Matthews has commenced civil proceedings in the High Court seeking damages for the death of her husband.  On the information available to me, I think it may be taken that the State will not contest liability and that the only issue that will arise will be the amount of the damages which will either be agreed or be determined by the court.  All that is possible on the personal level is for me to say how much I and all members of the Government and I am sure all Members of the House regret this most unfortunate event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To sum up, therefore, my position is that I am fully conscious of the seriousness of what has emerged and equally I am fully committed to the proposition that whatever action is right and likely to be in the public interest will in fact be taken.  In this context may I say that I regret that the Leader of the Opposition in what was otherwise, according to the accounts in the newspapers, a carefully balanced comment in Cork, should have introduced what appeared to be an element of party politics into this matter when he sought to contrast the picture obtaining under a Fianna Fáil Government with that which obtained under a Coalition Government.  The fact is that <Col N="37" /> the death of Peter Matthews occurred during the period of office of a Fianna Fáil Government but it would be an absurdity for me to try to suggest that that Government were in some way to blame for it. Of course they were not; and I hope and believe that both sides of the House will agree to treat it in a non-party way.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, a Cheann Comhairle, in view of the link being drawn between those matters and the recent Kerry case, I could be permitted to add a few words about the Kerry situation, especially as it is a matter in which the House would have an interest.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> In view of the link being drawn between these matters and the recent Kerry case, I would like to add a few words about the Kerry case, especially as this is a matter in which the House could have an interest. The position since I spoke here last week is that the senior Garda officers assigned to the preliminary inquiry have been endeavouring, so far as the allegations of pressure to make admissions and so on are concerned, to ascertain from the members of the family in question what exactly is alleged to have been done and by whom.  This is essential information in view of the obvious fact that if the allegations are well founded the possibility of criminal charges, perhaps very serious charges, against individual members of the force will arise.  Any other approach to the matter might end in a situation in which the facts might have been ascertained but on which the taking of legal proceedings would have been made more difficult, or perhaps made even impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While recognising that what I have to say may be one sided in that it is the position as it appears from the stand point of the Garda authorities rather than the <Col N="40" /> family, the House is entitled to know that as far as the Garda authorities are concerned they have found it very difficult to obtain details.  I am informed that they were first asked by a solicitor for the family for unqualified guarantees that nothing that might emerge would lead to any prosecution of any member of the family.  The Garda were naturally unable to give such a guarantee although they did emphasise that they had no reason to believe that such a development would arise.  That apparently was unacceptable.</P>

The Garda were naturally unable to give such a guarantee but they did emphasise that they had no reason to think that <Col N="42" /> such a development would arise.

The most recent development that I am aware of is that those statements, or rather most but not all of them, have again been promised for tonight.</P>
      <P>The position in the Kerry case is different from the Cavan case in more ways than one, not least in that in the latter case, as I have said, two members of the force have been acquitted by a jury.  On the information available to me at present, the position about the Kerry case is relatively straightforward in that if the preliminary Garda inquiries cannot clear up the matter, and be seen to have cleared it up, I would think it possible that a formal sworn inquiry would be justified.  I will repeat that: I would think it probable that a formal sworn inquiry would be justified and, I hope, would be likely at least to achieve the objective of establishing the facts.  However, this is not something to be embarked on unless it emerges that the inquiries now taking place are not successful.</P>
      <P>Naturally I am fully alive to the fact that in any assessment of the success of those inquiries one of the criteria to be met will be the need to provide public reasurance.

What I have been attempting to communicate is this: on the question of the judicial inquiry into the Cavan case, if it is foreseen that the matter would end with a conflict of evidence then we would have wasted a lot of time and money.

Further, will he indicate if the gardaí who were present in the station on the night when Mr. Matthews died are still on duty, if they <Col N="45" /> are still arresting people and what is going on exactly in that regard?

Certainly there will be no delay in the investigation of these matters.  On the question of whether gardaí were suspended, the position is that when criminal proceedings are initiated against a member of the Garda Síochána he is suspended from duty.  I know that the garda who was acquitted recently has not been reinstated.

With regard to the third course of action, I understand a Minister for Justice has certain powers under an Act &mdash; I am not sure if it is an Act of 1924 or 1925 &mdash; which enables him to nominate someone, for example, a senior counsel to carry out an investigation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a second time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to exclude agricultural leases from certain provisions in the Statute Book which might be regarded as inhibiting the development of leasing as part of our land tenure system.  At the same time, the opportunity is being taken to include a group of provisions of a technical nature aimed at tidying up some existing, largely domestic, land settlement operations and functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is now a growing awareness that our owner-occupier system of land tenure is rather rigid and inflexible and that it seriously retards the pace of structural change.  Land owners persist in holding on to land long after they are able to work it fully.  It is quite evident that this <Col N="136" /> attitude which attaches unwarranted status to the mere possession of land contributes, to a very substantial degree, to the rigidity of our land structure.  If agriculture is to make its optimum contribution to the economy, then it is the use to which land is put that is of importance. The rigidity in the system must be replaced by mobility.</P>
    <P>Since coming into office, I have given particular attention to the problem of increasing the rate of land mobility.  I want to ensure that more and more of our unused land is put into production by being channelled into the management of those willing and able to work it to its full potential.  One of the most promising ways of doing this is, in my view, through the encouragement of land leasing.</P>
    <P>The programme of reform of landlord-tenant relations in Ireland saw the tenant advance from the position of occupation at the whim of the landlord to himself becoming the owner of the land.  The process began around 1860 with a series of Statutes which granted progressively more rights to the tenant until the balance of advantage lay with him over the landlord. Following the successful struggle of the Irish farmer to gain ownership of his own land, there was a natural determination to ensure that the old system of landlordism should not be revived. Accordingly, the Land Commission were given the power to control leasing and the legislation favouring the tenant remained on the Statute Book.  This emphasis on ownership led to a situation where possession of land, <i>per se,</i> tended to be regarded as an end in itself and more important questions of user and management tended to be overlooked.  The instinctive and basic motivation of land holders was the determination to retain control of their holdings.  Because the legislation was so much orientated towards the tenant, the adoption of leases, even of a short- or medium-term nature, came to be seen by land holders as a threat to their secure ownership of the land.</P>
    <P>This situation led, in turn, to the adoption of the 11-months letting system as a source of revenue for those who were <Col N="137" /> unable or did not wish to work their lands themselves.  As this is merely a licence to use lands for a certain limited purpose for a certain limited period it does not constitute a letting in the full legal sense and is not, therefore, governed by the existing landlord-tenant legislation.  If, therefore, we wish to persuade those at present letting under the 11-months system, and any other farmers for whom the arrangement might be beneficial, to turn to leasing instead, then an obvious requirement is to repeal any legislation which might appear to act against their interests.  This is precisely what I propose to do in this Bill.</P>
    <P>In my view it is obviously right that a prospective lessor should have the assurance that, when the lease has expired, he will be able to resume possession without fuss or legal complications.  Any apprehension about claims under law for tenancy interests, compensation, and so on, would present a serious, if not decisive, deterrent for a lessor.  Because of this I considered it proper that those statutory provisions in the old legislation which seem to favour the tenant unduly during the course, or on expiry, of a lease should be identified and revoked.  This course was recommended in the report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on land structure reform and accepted in the 1980 White Paper on Land Policy.  The effect of the present Bill, therefore, will be to give equal status to both lessor and lessee and to enable them to come together and agree between themselves on the terms of the lease without any over-riding statutory provisions.  I might add, in passing, that two model leases are widely available at the moment.  One was drawn up jointly by the Irish Farmers' Association and Allied Irish Banks working in co-operation with the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland and the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors.  The other model was drawn up by the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society. These documents are, of course, models only.  The precise provisions to be included in any individual lease, will, as I have said, be a matter for the parties concerned in each case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="138" /> I will now outline briefly the sections of the old Acts which are covered by the Bill at section 3 (1).  The intention is that these enactments will not apply to a lease of agricultural land made after the Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>Sections 70 and 71 of the Landlord and Tenant Law Amendment Act, Ireland, 1860, provide for reinstatement of a tenant if he pays all arrears and costs within six months of the execution of a decree for possession and applies to the court for reinstatement.  It is felt that a lessee who is in breach of the terms of his lease and against whom a decree for possession has been executed should have no further claims on the leasehold and that the lessor should be entitled to resume undisputed possession of his land. Subsequent minor amendments of these provisions contained in section 13 of the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881, sections 7 (3) and 30 (2) of the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1887 and section 16 of the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1896, are also provided for.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 and 7 of the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act, 1870, provide for the payment of compensation for disturbance by a lessor.  There is legal advice that ejectment of a tenant on expiry of a lease could be regarded by a court as disturbance.  As indicated already, one of the main aims of the Bill is to ensure that it will be the terms of the lease itself which will govern the relationship between the lessor and lessee.  If the lessor is forced to take ejectment proceedings in order to regain possession of his property on expiry of a lease, then he should not be put at risk of having to pay compensation to the lessee.</P>
    <P>Section 4, Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act, 1870, provides for a claim by a lessee, on quitting the lease, for compensation for improvements carried out by him on the leasehold.  Such improvements might have been carried out against the wishes of the lessor, or be of no value to him.  Again, it seems much more appropriate that the arrangements for improvements, as agreed between the parties, including compensation, if any, <Col N="139" /> should be determined by the lease agreement itself.</P>
    <P>Section 1, Land Law (Ireland) Act. 1881, gives the lessee the right to sell his interest in the leasehold.  Here, also, I feel that the parties themselves should prescribe the terms of the lease, including any provisions regarding sale, subdivision or sub-letting by the lessee as they may agree.</P>
    <P>Section 4, Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881, provides that a lessee from whom a lessor demands an increase in rent is entitled to compensation, to be fixed by the court, in respect of the fall in sale value of the tenancy in consequence of the increased rent.  It is probable that this provision was primarily in respect of tenancies based on the simplest documentary, or even verbal, agreements. Modern leases would normally make provision for adjustments of the rent during the term of the agreement, so that the questions of the lessor &ldquo;demanding&rdquo; an arbitrary increase would not arise.</P>
    <P>Section 13, Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881, permits a lessee to sell his interest within six months of the execution of a decree for possession for non-payment of rent.  The intention here is to ensure that the lessor is entitled to retain undisputed possession of his property on termination of the lease for whatever reason.</P>
    <P>Section 22, Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881 renders void an agreement by a tenant to contract out of any rights conferred on him by statute provided the holding concerned has a PLV not exceeding £150.  Because of the Supreme Court decision declaring the PLV system to be unconstitutional, it is possible that this provision is no longer operative.  However, it is included here in order to put the matter beyond doubt.  The intention is that, as already indicated, the terms of a lease will be those agreed between the parties and will not be subject to overriding statutory provisions.</P>
    <P>Let me emphasise here, once more, that this Bill is not, and was never intended to be, a great charter for the promotion of leasing.  It has one simple purpose and one only.  That is to deal <Col N="140" /> with the purely legal constraints which are at present inhibiting the making of leases.  It is a small but very fundamental piece of legislation which will clear the legal difficulties and enable us to proceed on an all-out effort to promote the leasing system and I would ask Deputies to debate it in that light.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that the removal of these inhibiting provisions will not, of itself, succeed in getting leasing established as a normal farm management practice.  However, it will help clear some of the worries farmers have in regard to leasing their land.  It will now be open to those looking for land to lease and those willing to make land available to come together freely to agree on the conditions which should attach to each letting.</P>
    <P>The major task still facing us is to get people to see that the letting of their land for a term of years is a very simple and profitable option for those who are unable, because of age or other reasons, to work it.  There is, of course, an amount of such land available at present.  Here I have in mind not only those who are already letting under the 11-months system but also those many farmers whose concern for their land would not allow them to risk its exploitation under seasonal lettings.  Such a farmer would see an advantage in making a leasing arrangement with a neighbour whom he could trust who would not abuse the land and would hand it back in prime condition. Neither have I in mind only smallholders, especially those in the west.  I can see great advantages in leasing for farmers with good holdings in the prime farming areas such as the Golden Vale or any other prime farming area.</P>
    <P>Even with the way cleared by this Bill it will take a great amount of promotion to get the concept of leasing accepted. Considerable progress has already been made.  My Department are taking a positive role in promoting it.  Area officers have been assigned specifically to the task of promoting and encouraging leasing in their areas.  They are fostering discussion and interest and are co-operating with farming organisations, co-operatives and other national and local bodies who are <Col N="141" /> anxious to bring potential lessors and lessees together.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1984, contains a provision for new rules for the assessment of means for social assistance in cases where land is leased.  Previously, income from leasing of any kind of property was based, broadly speaking, on the capital value of the property while income from 11-month lettings was taken to be the actual rent received.  Under the new rules rent received on foot of bona fide leases of agricultural land will be treated in the same way as rent from 11-month lettings for the purpose of assessing income unde the Social Welfare Acts. This has removed what I considered to be a serious obstacle to the adoption of leasing.  Before I leave the subject I would like to say that I am at present considering other factors in leasing, including the impact of social welfare schemes and of taxation as well.  Of course, the budgetary constraints under which we work at present will limit the options to be explored.</P>
    <P>It has been claimed that, in introducing this Bill, I am bringing back landlordism to this country, that I am ignoring the lessons of history.  In my view, the people who make these claims are themselves ignoring the fact that conditions now are in no way comparable to those which existed in the 1800s.  At that time almost all our land was owned by a comparatively small alien class and Irish tenants were completely dependent on them for the renting of the farms they had.  It was to protect the helpless tenants that this legislation we are talking about was introduced. Today we are talking about Irish farmers who own their own land.  If one of these wishes to lease his land are we to regard him as a modern-day Lord Leitrim or Castlereagh?  I hardly think so.  What I see is an Irish farmer coming together with his neighbour to lease his land, an arrangement working to their mutual benefit.  At present this legislation stands in the way of such an arrangement. If we are to be serious about promoting leasing it seems to me obvious that we must remove this great stumbling block.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="142" /> Before dealing with sections 4 to 14 of the Bill I should like to mention the recent Government decision to abolish the Land Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission was, of course, entrusted by successive Governments with the task of carrying out land policy.  It is one of our oldest State agencies set up in 1881 mainly to fix fair rents.  As our land code developed the commission became the body responsible for dismantling the landlord system by the transfer of ownership of their holdings to the tenants. This was done by way of advances repayable over a long term.</P>
      <P>Since that programme neared completion in the thirties, the main activity of the commission has been the acquisition of land for redistribution to smallholders. In the operation of this policy, it was necessary to reconcile the purely economic aim of maximising agricultural production with the social aim of protecting and improving the fabric of rural society. This activity has had a considerable impact.  The enlargements it provded were of vital importance in a great many cases in helping small farmers to stay on the land.  The only real alternative for many of them would have been emigration. However, it is an activity which has, in recent years, encountered increasing difficulties, for two main reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Firstly, very few large estates now remain available for acquisition and the acquiring of smaller farms, while requiring the same time-consuming and complex legal procedures to complete, makes little overall impact on structural improvement.  Secondly, though land prices and interest rates have dropped recently they are still at a level which puts the ultimate cost to the allottees beyond that which any normal farming enterprise could carry.  This means that the Land Commission have been forced to dispose of land for very much less than its original cost, with consequent loss to the Exchequer. Because of these factors, the scope for direct acquisition of land has been <Col N="143" /> very much curtailed and the amount being acquired has diminished steadily over the past few years.</P>
    <P>I want to make it very clear, however, that the abolition of the Land Commission will not mean the abandonment of a land policy by this Government.  The aim of Government land policy is, as declared in their national plan, to ensure that land is in the hands of those best able and willing to work it to its maximum potential. The fact is that, since responsibility for the Department of Lands was transferred to the Minister for Agriculture in 1977, land policy has been a function of that Minister since.  The Department of Agriculture as part of its ongoing work continues to be responsible for land policy which will be concentrated, generally on measures designed to increase the rate of land mobility.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with sections 4 to 14 of the Bill.  As I said earlier, the opportunity is being taken to streamline some land settlement procedures and to facilitate revesting and the exchange of land.  For example, up to now, there has been the power, in exchanges, to accept registered land only.  It would facilitate the distribution of lands on hands and, generally, facilitate schemes for rearrangement, if this power to exchange was extended to include unregistered land where the exchange has a right to vacant possession.</P>
    <P>Another proposal is to provide for the dissolution of the Irish Church Temporalities Fund, the extinguishing of charges on land payable to that fund and the validation of the ending of payments to the fund as from 28 September 1975.  The history of the fund, very briefly, is that under the provisions of the Irish Church Act, 1869, the temporal property of the Established Church, including its revenue, passed to the State.  The Act also set up the Church Temporalities Fund into which the former revenue of the Church was paid.  In 1881 the administration of the fund devolved on the Land Commission.  Over the years the process of compulsory redemption of charges on <Col N="144" /> lands which were the subject of proceedings under the land purchase Acts brought about a huge reduction in the income accruing to the fund and the collection of rents became uneconomic.  By 1975, the rental income was reduced to about £1,000 and collection of the remaining rents was ceased.  The section also provides that the assets, now standing at about £3 million in Government securities and cash and any future sums that accrue, will be paid into, or disposed of for the benefit of, the Exchequer, as the Minister for Finance may decide.  Section 14 and the Schedule to the Bill provide for repeal of various enactments. These repeals are required in connection with the disolution of the fund.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed to provide that the term &ldquo;prior mortgage&rdquo;, mentioned in section 80 of the Building Societies Act, 1976, does not include charges on land to secure payment of a purchase annuity, a land reclamation annuity or any other annual payment arising from operations under the land purchase Acts.  Under section 80 of that Act, a building society may not give a loan on a property subject to a prior mortgage unless that mortgage is in favour of the society.  The effect of the present proposal will be that the existence of any land purchase annuity or annual sum or land reclamation annuity will not prevent a building society from advancing a mortgage on a property subject to such a payment.  As a major proportion of land is subject to land purchase annuities the effect of this provision will be to greatly simplify the process of setting up a building society mortgage.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I should like to emphasise that whilst the encouragement of leasing is an integral part of a comprehensive land reform programme, it is nevertheless only a first step in the formulation of such a programme.  I have in recent months, been examining critically a number of aspects of the land problem that seem to me to be of particular importance.  The problem of late inheritance and the need to give smallholders a fair chance to compete for land coming on the market in their locality are matters of fundamental concern.  Some progress <Col N="145" /> is already being made in encouraging group purchase of land, the rearrangement of fragmented holdings and the division of commonages.</P>
    <P>It has been estimated that some 80 per cent of all land transfers take place as a result of inheritance and succession. What is most desirable here is that successors come into possession of land at an age when they are still sufficiently receptive to the up to date ideas and practices that will enable them to work it efficiently. Unfortunately, this is not what is happening.  In far too many cases, farmers delay transferring their lands until they are themselves aged and their successors are no longer young.  Naturally, individual family circumstances will dictate the time and manner of the disposition of property, but we must seek ways which would contribute towards lowering the average age of succession.</P>
    <P>I am having a look also at the possibilities for partnership arrangements or phased transfer of management between owner and heir.  In general terms, I incline to the view that the problem of late succession and inheritance is not one in which legislation is likely to make a major impact.  Nevertheless the budget decision to extend for a further year the stamp duty exemption for transfer of land to young farmers is an example of the kind of positive influence that can be exerted by the State in this area.</P>
    <P>I have been considering also whether there might not be a case for regulating or controlling the sale of land that comes onto the open market.  I am convinced that State intervention in the open market is essential in eliminating undesirable land purchases and in giving developing farmers and qualified landless persons an opportunity to compete for the purchase of land with some hope of success.  Related to this would be the encouragement already being given for joint purchase by small groups of farmers where such land comes up for sale.  By coming together to purchase as a group the individual farmers are given purchasing power they would not otherwise possess. I am very happy with this trend to date.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="146" /> Apart from what I have touched upon. there may be other aspects of the land situation which should be considered and I would welcome the views of the members of the House on these.  Land policy has been virtually unchanged for a long time.  It is clear to me and is, now generally accepted that the aim of future policy must be to create the conditions which will stimulate the optimum level of structural change, thereby ensuring that land is in the hands of those best able and willing to work it to its maximum potential. Leasing will have a very important part to play in this area in the future and I have no hesitation in commending the Bill to the House as an important measure designed primarily to encourage the wider acceptance of leasing.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that if the Bill is passed farmers can be categorically assured that if they lease land the legislation will be such that they will be entitled to get their land back on the expiry of the lease.  That is a fundamental principle contained in the Bill.  Heretofore I could not give that assurance.  When this Bill becomes law every farmer who decides to lease land will be able to get it back when the lease expires.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> In his speech the Minister said he was convinced that State intervention in the open market was essential in eliminating undesirable land purchases and for giving developmental farmers and qualified landless persons an opportunity to compete for the purchase of land with some hope of success.  No Minister in his right senses would make such a statement when the Government of which he is a member abolished the Land Commission a few months ago.</P>
      <P>The encouragement which has been given for joint purchase is a step in the right direction.  However, it is not today or yesterday that this happened.  It has been in operation for a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Bill does is remove some of the legal and technical obstacles to leasing.  The primary purpose of the Bill should be to encourage land leasing but it does not do that.  It would appear that <Col N="147" /> the problem has been looked at in a strictly legal context.  The problem of land ownership and leasing cannot be examined in isolation.  These problems must be viewed in a wider context.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced that the Bill dealing with social welfare will remove the anomalies which exist regarding land leasing. I ask the Minister to elaborate on this aspect in his reply.  The social welfare system, income tax code and availability of credit are all concerned.  The decisions taken in these areas will determine if long term leasing will have an impact on our farm structure.  Unless we face reality we are wasting our time debating this Bill.</P>
    <P>We have been promised this Bill for quite some time.  We were led to believe since the Minister took office in December 1982 that it would encourage our young progressive farmers to lease land from those who because of age or for other reasons cannot actively run their farms.  This Bill is a bitter disappointment to those people.  It contains nothing that will enable them to compete with larger farmers seeking land on the conacre system.  We must face the fact that to implement any worthwhile leasing scheme we will have to spend some money.  The amounts need not necessarily be very large.  While there would have to be some contribution from the State, some funding might be made available under one of the various EC schemes or structures.  However, whatever money is spent in this sphere will be well spent because the increased production from the land leased will more than repay the initial outlay.</P>
    <P>We must realise that the problem of land leasing not only impinges on the farmers directly but represents a social problem also.  If our young and intelligent people see no future in farming because of their not being able to obtain land to make their existing holdings viable, many of them will move to off-farm jobs.  Apart from adding to the problem of unemployment that would result in one of two possible outcomes for our farm structure: either the larger farms would be made bigger because of the squeezing out of the <Col N="148" /> smaller family farm or we would return to an almost mere subsistence level of low production farming such as was the case 30 or 40 years ago.</P>
    <P>The reception given to this Bill is a reflection of how effective people expect it to be.  I have not seen in any publication, not even in the <i>Farmers Journal</i> or any other such publication any welcome for this Bill.  Instead, the point is made repeatedly that the Bill is certainly not of a progressive nature and is not what was anticipated when the Minister launched this crusade about two years ago.  The Bill is being treated largely for what it is, a non-event.  For months we have been promised measures which would improve land mobility and help the smaller progressive farmer to acquire the extra land he needs so urgently but there is nothing in the Bill to enable him to compete with large farmers, with business interests or speculators.  We must realise that a small farmer cannot compete on the open market with such opponents.  If he is to acquire the land he needs he must be given financial assistance.  Alternatively, certain restrictions might be introduced to discourage those without a farming background or training to acquire land.</P>
    <P>Apart from catering for those farmers who need extra land it is important that some provision be made to train properly young people who wish to embark on farming as a career.  Again, this Bill offers no hope in that direction.  The possibility of procuring financial help for them from the EC should be investigated fully.  As suggested in an earlier White Paper the introduction of some farm sales surcharge should be considered.  I will be dealing later with those suggestions as outlined in the 1980 White Paper.  Such a surcharge should apply only to the sales of sales of large farms and estates and the revenue collected should be used in total to assist developing farmers to purchase land.  This could be in the form of a direct payment or of an interest subsidy.  In our opinion a land Bill should have two main goals.  It should be designed to bring about the maximum production possible from every acre and it should provide as <Col N="149" /> many people as possible with employment, both on family farms and in the food processing industry.  I cannot visualise this Bill making any significant impact in either of those respects.  That is why I find it so disappointing.</P>
    <P>The rate of change in Irish farm structure has been very slow.  The average size of farms has been increasing only slightly. There are still in the region of 80,000 holdings of between ten and 40 acres. This illustrates that the rate of land mobility in Ireland is very low compared with that in other European countries.  The amount of land in respect of which there is a change in ownership is less than 4 per cent of our total arable acreage and of all land transfers only about 15 per cent changes ownership on the open land market.</P>
    <P>Those figures are significant.  They should be taken into consideration by the Government and should be considered in the context of a Land Bill that would be far more acceptable than the one before us.  It must be noted, too, that there was no indication of a land policy for the next three years in the plan announced recently.  Surely, in a country in which agriculture is the basis of the economy, a policy of land utilisation and mobility should have be given priority in any plan.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in order to increase land mobility and to make land available to young and aspiring farmers, we must focus on older occupiers.  The objective must be to promote earlier transfer of farms to the younger people.  This calls for an attractive retirement policy which in turn necessitates an appropriate social welfare and health policy.  Our policy in this regard was clearly set out in the White Paper of December 1980 which was laid before each House of the Oireachtas. We aimed at devising a system whereby as much as possible of our agricultural land would be channelled towards the progressive small and medium farmer who is making the best possible use of existing holdings and to young people with an acceptable level of agricultural training and experience.  Our idea was that the Land Commission or some other land agency equal to them <Col N="150" /> would play a vital role in that policy.  Now there is no such agency to monitor the sales of land or to ensure that the land will go to the people whom we considered would be best able to put it to its full use. For our part it was not merely a question of talking about land leasing: we were prepared to do something about it.</P>
    <P>The Government have taken a number of important decisions such as the opening up of the land market to non-EC nationals, suspending the compulsory acquisition powers of the Land Commission and promising to repeal various sections of Land Acts.  I am not necessarily against those moves but I am against not having a well thought out and coordinated policy to replace them.  Our criticisms were directed at the overall policies, not just one aspect of them.  We support land leasing subject to proper controls.  Later on I will be mentioning the part we have played in land leasing while in Government.</P>
    <P>There is a serious problem of land under-utilisation in many parts of the country.  Land leasing is only one of a number of policy instruments which can be used to tackle this problem.  This party are in favour of land leasing as part of an overall land policy and subject to proper controls as contained in the 1980 White Paper on land policy.  The Government appear intent on disregarding those controls.  It is important that strict controls are maintained so as to ensure that land is made available to farmers who are trained to work and to prevent land being purchased by non-EC nationals, non-farmers, large farmers and speculators. Assistance must be given to small farmers, funded perhaps by a surcharge on the purchase of land, in other words to help the progressive farmer, particularly the young farmer, to purchase more land if this is feasible and profitable.</P>
    <P>Retention of the powers of the Land Commission with regard to compulsory purchase and approval in advance of all land transactions should be required and there must be an improved farm retirement scheme.  These proposals form an integrated policy of which land leasing on <Col N="151" /> a one to one basis is merely one element and not a general aspect.  The Government seem to be intent on creating a free for all.  The Land Commission, which is now to be abolished, had their compulsory acquisition powers suspended.  Since there will be no upper limits on the acquisition of land by an individual or company and no penalties either, there is nothing to prevent a wealthy individual or company buying dozens of farms and then leasing them to agents and farmers on their terms.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise what is meant by a one to one basis on land leasing.  It means land leasing on the basis of one landlord and one tenant but not on the basis of one landlord and perhaps dozens of tenants which would not and never will be acceptable to the Fianna Fáil Party.  I should like to emphasise that we are not against land leasing but the introduction of land leasing, if not handled with proper care, could cause social problems in future.  You cannot lightly disregard or run over the deep instincts and traditions of the Irish people in respect of land and expect to get away with it easily.  I must warn the Minister that a tenant interest will be created with the introduction of land leasing on a wide scale unless we have certain safeguards which will combine in times of poor agricultural yield to seek reductions in rent, to prevent eviction or non-payment of rent and to change legislation which is at present on the side of the land owner.  To insist on the absolute right of the land owner, even after decades of tenant occupation, is unrealistic and inconsistent with social equity.  It would be far better to go for a limited and controlled form of land leasing on a one to one basis and to develop it slowly and naturally rather than to allow, perhaps by default, a counter revolution in land policy which will only store up problems for the future which, thankfully, we do not have today.</P>
    <P>This Bill has not a shred of policy to improve the mobility of land.  It is only tidying up administrative verbiage.  Its sole impact is on words.  It is a paper exercise without any meaning.  I ask the <Col N="152" /> Minister to have another look at the basic principle outlined in the 1980 White Paper on land policy.  There should be a proper leasing scheme so that full use of land which is under-utilised can be made. In order to encourage the transfer of land to younger people, there would be a retirement annuity under the farm retirement scheme which is attractive and acceptable.  If my memory serves me right I think it was the present Government who abolished the farm retirement scheme.  Bad as it was it was better than having no scheme as is the case at present.  The success of a land leasing scheme depends on a proper retirement scheme, bearing in mind social welfare, tax codes and so on.  Furthermore, a retiring farmer should not be prohibited absolutely from participation in the business of the farm and the retiring farmer's entitlement to social welfare should not be adversely affected by the transfer.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The transfer should allow a certain participation by the lessor in farming if possible. The need for land for young and aspiring farmers cannot be over-emphasised but this Bill does not give any hope in this direction.  The national plan does not contain any hope either.  The main land use problem is the extent of under-utilised land and conditions pushing many farmers into a marginal position.  To promote land mobility through leasing is not a simple matter, but very complex.  The present policies do not promote it to any significant extent.  The problem is aggravated by the lack of job opportunities off the land.  There is need for a comprehensive, coherent policy between agriculture, land, social welfare and fiscal policies.  At present some of these are hostile to one another.  There could be some hope if an attractive retirement scheme could be drawn up and introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will support this Bill in so far as it goes but it is not the answer to our serious land mobility problem.  On returning to <Col N="153" /> government we would have as part of our policy the function of introducing a properly structured, well thought out land Bill which would incorporate all aspects of what I have just outlined.  We would take into account in a large way the safeguards and the very fine proposals that were outlined in the 1980 White Paper on land policy.  That White Paper had positive land policies and positive suggestions.  I recognise that certain changes are needed such as land leasing and the opening of the land market to EC nationals.  This last step was inevitable due to our entry to the EEC.  The White Paper carefully laid out the necessary safeguards but they are completely absent from this Bill.  This party are not against land leasing on a one-to-one basis and we appreciate the useful role it can play.  However, I am anxious to avoid a situation where a person or a company could buy up a number of farms and lease them to tenants.  This would be a reconstitution of the landlord system.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on land policy proposed a whole range of safeguards which have been ignored by the Minister in this Bill.  In the interests of the House I will give details of some of these proposals. All purchases of land exceeding £5 rateable valuation should require the consent of the Land Commission.  The PLV system has now been shown to be unconstitutional but I am sure it could be replaced by something else such as the adjusted acre system which was to have been carried out by the now defunct Land Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Secondly, there should be a surcharge on land purchases by non-farmers and part-time farmers and on full-time farmers over and above a certain rateable valuation. There should be special assistance to progressive farmers to enable them to acquire land.  There should also be retention of powers of land acquisition by the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="154" /> The White Paper stated:</P>
    <P>To abandon the compulsory machinery would be to accept, if not encourage, bad husbandry.</P>
    <P>Of course we recognise that the good use of land is more important than the ownership but the Minister has removed powers which the White Paper expressly states should be retained to ensure the good use of the land.  The Minister seems prepared to adopt a completely inadequate approach without the necessary safeguards.  The opening up of the land market to EC citizens was to take place only in the context of these safeguards.</P>
    <P>The Minister's approach will be applauded by the monied interests with the fat cheque books, the speculators who invest in land.  It will be a cause of concern and frustration to the progressive farmers, to the young farmers who want a chance on the land and to the small farmers.  At a time of high unemployment the family farm structure is the best guarantee that employment both on and off the farm in agricultural services, support and processing industries will be maintained to the greatest extent possible. Every effort must be made to ensure that the best possible use is made of every acre of farmland.  Methods of taxation and distribution of grant aid must be devised which will encourage farmers to use their land to maximum production.  The whole area of land transfer must be tackled. This should include a programme of long term leasing which I have outlined and which should have some financial input from the EEC as well as a contribution from the State.</P>
    <P>Greater use should be made of our marginal land and the pros and cons of afforestation should be examined.  Some form of farmer-State co-operation might have a role in such an area and might afford the owner a steady income.  Such development should have a particular place in small farm areas.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is the basis of our economy and it is vital that we optimise every resource, both human and natural. Despite rumours of oil and the growing importance of natural gas our farmland <Col N="155" /> is still our greatest natural resource.  Land use and land ownership have always been very emotive issues in Irish life and politics. This can be partly explained by the different motives and viewpoints of people regarding the whole land question.</P>
    <P>The most usual view taken of land is as a limiting factor in food production. The use of the available land to maximise production and increase national prosperity is clearly of the utmost importance. The use of land for non-agricultural purposes such as development, forestry, recerational facilities and so on is another area with major implications for the environment and the country.  However, it is the question of land ownership and transfer which is most important.  The problems of land sale, farm inheritance, retirement and land leasing are all components in this great difficulty.  The magnitude of this problem can be appreciated when we see that over the past 20 years the average farm size has increased by only about 8 per cent.  This is a very small change considering the major effort made by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>The farm retirement scheme has had minimal effect in getting land into the hands of young progressive farmers.  This was mainly because the scheme was not attractive enough to encourage older farmers to transfer their farms.  Many who availed of this scheme later regretted doing so as they saw their benefits devalued. In areas, other EC schemes were in effect encouraging and supporting farmers to retain their farms in direct competition with the retirement scheme.  This is another area we should look at.</P>
    <P>The popularity of the conacre system, where land is rented for 11 months, is not conducive to either land mobility or, indeed, maximising production.  Too often this land is taken by larger farmers who can work on very tight profit margins as their home farm partly subsidises the land which they rent.  The smaller farmer with a greater need for extra land just cannot compete in this situation.  I would like the Minister to look at this area.</P>
    <P>There now appears to have evolved a <Col N="156" /> much keener awareness of the advantage of long term leasing of land with the safeguards I have already mentioned. This view has been expressed recently by farmers, the co-operatives, the banks and even by the Government.  The real problem arises when we examine how this can be made attractive to both the farm owner and the potential occupier. We have seen some Government Ministers and even the Taoiseach, propounding the view that long term leasing is a good thing but we have heard nothing about the mechanism for getting such a scheme off the ground.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that for a programme of land leasing to have a significant effect there has got to be a financial incentive built into the scheme.  What type of incentive or subsidy this is to be and where it is to come from is what we should now be discussing.  I have no doubt that any funds put into getting land into the hands of our many young progressive farmers would be a marvellous investment for the nation.</P>
    <P>The Government should certainly have some financial input into such a scheme. They might also be joined by the lending agencies who would have a lot to gain from an expanding agricultural industry. There would have to be a cast iron guarantee that any assistance introduced would not be suddenly terminated.  It must not suffer the same fate as befell the farm modernisation scheme and other schemes introduced by this party &mdash; the artificial insemination subsidy, the lime subsidy and so on.  This Government must not repeat their performance by setting up farmers in a long term lease with large financial commitments and then pull the rug from under their feet.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil believe that the major part of any such investment should come either directly from the EC or under one of the Community-backed structural programmes. Specific grants are already available to help young farmers at minimal cost but they have been spurned by the Coalition.  This Government have also spurned many other subsidy schemes available from the EC.  Such grants and subsidies are commonplace throughout <Col N="157" /> Europe and it is inexcusable to deprive our aspiring young farmers of these supports. I know the Minister agrees with me and he is well aware of these aids which are available to us.  He is working under a great strain but these aids could be availed of at very little cost and this would make his task and the task of promoting land leasing here far easier than it is at present.</P>
    <P>I believe there is an urgent need for the formation of a small group of top level people representing the farm organisations, the lending agencies, the co-operatives, the advisory and research institutes and the various Government Departments involved to monitor land mobility, land leasing and land transfers. I strongly urge the Minister to set up such a group.  This group would quickly draw up a countrywide land leasing programme which could be adopted and implemented &mdash; and I stress adopted and implemented.  There is no point in producing yet another report to gather dust. Such a group could also issue proposals on the whole question of land sales and land transfers.</P>
    <P>The area of land utilisation is of vital importance to an agricultural country like Ireland and a clear and pragmatic policy is urgently needed rather than the pious aspirations we had in the recently published plan.  With the recent fall in land prices the time to implement such a scheme was never more opportune.  This opportunity must not be missed.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I would like to say that this party have been deliberately and unfairly misrepresented in relation to our policy on land tenure.  Let me put the true picture on record.  Our policy was clearly and unequivocally set out in the White Paper laid before each House of the Oireachtas in December 1980.  We aimed to devise a system whereby as much as possible of the country's agricultural land could be channelled to progressive small to medium farmers who are making the best possible use of their existing holdings and to young persons with acceptable agricultural experience <Col N="158" /> and training.  We have been misrepresented in regard to our attitude to leasing. We were the first to propose a standard type of leasing capable of general use which could be adapted to meet special circumstances and which would provide adequate protection for both the lessor and the lessee.  Now the present Government have dropped some of the most important safeguards which we had built into the White Paper.</P>
    <P>The compulsory acquisition powers of the Land Commission have been withdrawn.  I would remind the Minister that the Land Commission operated as a very effective social safety valve even in otherwise explosive situations.  Tensions have already arisen in relation to land in some areas and they could be dangerous if allowed to develop.  I want the Minister to be very careful to avoid a new form of landlordism which could be brought about by lack of adequate safeguards in the system.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years the conventional wisdom among many in agriculture was that the demise of the Irish Land Commission could not come quickly enough.  These calls were of tremendous benefit to the Government who were very keen on eliminating all national aids to agriculture.  For that reason, I am not in the least surprised by the recent Government announcement regarding the abolition of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly changes were needed in the whole area of land use and distribution, but I would seriously question the motive behind the Government's recent decision.  I am convinced that the sole reason for implementing this particular cutback is to reduce expenditure for farming.</P>
    <P>If one examines the action of the Minister and his colleagues over the past couple of years, their intentions are as obvious as they are despicable.  There have been cutbacks all along the line; the farm modernisation scheme was axed, the lime subsidy dropped, the AI subsidy was halved and charges were imposed for farm advice, farm services and so on. Simultaneously we had increases in levies, new charges for farm advice, the <Col N="159" /> closing of the RHE colleges and, of course, the imposition of the super-levy, which now has a chain reaction in farming.</P>
    <P>We were promised a Land Leasing Bill which would make a significant impact on land transfer and use.  If such a Bill had been introduced then, the scaling down of the Land Commission might have made some sense if its objectives were to be attained by other means.  The Bill put before the Dáil by the Government was an absolute disgrace.  It was an insult to all those who had heard and believed what the Minister for Agriculture and his junior Ministers had promised. I do not believe that this Bill, as drawn up, will have the slightest effect on land mobility.</P>
    <P>It is in this context we must view the demise of the Land Commission.  In effect, there is now no mechanism for the thousands of progressive small farmers to acquire additional land.  What I find equally disturbing is that there is no awareness at Government level of the serious implications of such a gap in our farm infrastructure.  In addition to that, there is the serious situation where large tracts of lands will now be purchased by big farmers, business men and speculators at the expense of the small and medium-sized family farm.</P>
    <P>I doubt if the Minister can be satisfied with this present situation and, if he has been pressurised by other Government Ministers into conceding a sop to the Labour Party, then I would suggest that he should now do something urgently to retrieve the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is long overdue and I hope it will clear up once and for all the difficulties that inhibit the development of leasing as part of our land tenure system.  If agriculture is to make its rightful contribution to the economy &mdash; I have no doubt it will, given a proper chance &mdash; it is the use to which land is put that will be of importance.  It is vital that the rigidity in the system be replaced by mobility.  The legacy of our historic land struggle has left us with the <Col N="160" /> most land-locked tenure system in Europe.  Our land is occupied by the second smallest proportion of young farmers in the EC and the second largest proportion of elderly farmers in the Community. We also have a growing proportion of part-time farmers.  Only in Italy is the situation worse.  Therefore, it was vitally important for the Minister to take the onus of introducing a Land Bill that is second to none.  We have not had its likes since the foundation of the State.</P>
      <P>The need for land reform here is as critical as it was in 1870 when the first tentative measures were taken to replace the landlord-tenant system that operated since the 17th century.  That was the result of British colonisation.  Today the system of land tenure provides for more than 90 per cent owner-occupancy and this is seriously impeding the pace of structural change in Irish agriculture.</P>
      <P>The total agricultural land here is approximately 17 million acres.  Of this some 10.5 million acres are in grazing and pasture, 1.14 million acres are in cereals and other crops, 2.6 million acres are in rough mountain grazing and 750,000 acres are in woods and plantation.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may pick up some useful information from those statistics that could help him to bring forward some kind of policy as good as the one introduced by the Minister.  However, I think the Deputy will have to go a long way before he reaches that stage. The remaining 2.17 million acres are put to various other uses.  There is a general misconception that the massive land resources are mobilised through the land market each year, but that is far from the truth.  The reality is that only 400,000 acres, or a mere 3 per cent of the entire acreage, changes ownership each year. Of that amount 84 per cent changes hands by way of inheritance gifts, 14 per cent by way of purchase on the open market and 2 per cent through purchases by the Irish Land Commission.  The land market <Col N="161" /> accounts for only 0.6 per cent of the total land in the country changing hands each year and that amount is so small that land mobility is not affected substantially.  If we are serious about the problem and about maximising our agricultural resources, we must adopt new measures.</P>
      <P>I was amazed to hear Deputy Noonan criticise the good points in the Bill.  To my mind it is a stepping stone to a restructuring of land that will bear fruit as far as our economy is concerned.  If we are serious about improving land mobility we must try to have new measures to improve farm structures but in a way that will not interfere with the &ldquo;three F's&rdquo; that were hard-won generations ago.</P>
      <P>Land is a very valuable commodity.  I can guarantee my friends across the floor of the House that our planet is not being enlarged.  Therefore, it is up to us to ensure that in our part of the planet every acre of agricultural land is utilised to the fullest.</P>

      <P>We will do that in the Deputy's area as well.  In Ireland the average farm size has increased by only four acres from 52 acres to 56 acres in the past 20 years.  Under whose Governments?  Mostly Fianna Fáil. Despite the hundreds of thousands of acres divided by the Land Commission and the 14 per cent reduction in the number of farmers during that period, the average size of the family farm increased by only four acres in 20 years. That is proof of the pudding.  The system we operated for the past two generations was futile from the point of view of making viable farm holdings available to the farmers of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sixty per cent of all Irish farms are still <Col N="162" /> less than 50 acres, well below the level of being deemed to be capable of providing a viable income to farmers under the EC directives.  Half the farmers of Ireland are over 55 years of age.  One-quarter of all farmers in Ireland are over 65 years of age and they account for about 5,000,000 acres of agricultural land or approximately 30 per cent of our total agricultural land acreage.  One-quarter of the farmers of Ireland who are over 65 years of age are the owners of 5,000,000 acres of land.  They did not get an opportunity to lease their land.  They were afraid of the 11-months system.  They could not get the tenants out if they remained on for two or three 11-months periods.  Therefore the problem remained with us down through the years.</P>
    <P>At least we have the guts to tackle the problem.  The Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, brought in a Bill and he outlined in no uncertain fashion that any person who leases his farm need not be worried if it is done under the terms of the new leasing agreement.  The statistics I have quoted are clear evidence of the late age of the retirement and succession characteristics of this country.  They underline how the owner occupancy of land tenure encourages farmers to hold on to their land to an advanced age and slows up the rate of mobility.</P>
    <P>Taking into consideration all the EC countries, Ireland shows the slowest rate of increase in farm size over the past 20 years.  In France, Holland and Britain where owner occupancy does not prevail as it does in Ireland, the annual rate of change is five times greater than it is in Ireland.  One quarter of all the agricultural land of Ireland is now being farmed on a part-time basis.  Of the owners of the 247,598 holdings of over five acres recorded in a survey conducted in 1975 by the Institute of Farm Management, one-half, or to be exact 51.6 per cent, are described as part-time farmers.  Breaking the figure down to province level, in Connacht 50 per cent are part-time farmers, in Munster and Leinster 35 per cent are part-time farmers, and in the three counties of Ulster three out of every five farms <Col N="163" /> are run by part-time farmers.  Statistics show that the stocking rates on part-time farms are only half those on full-time farms, and the gross output is only half as well.</P>
    <P>There is also evidence that part-time farming is increasing.  Since 1973, the acreage under part-time farming has increased by one-quarter of a million acres and the number of part-time farmers has increased by 6,000 since 1973. The lack of an invigorating land policy limits the opportunities for entry into farming with the drive and ability required to achieve high level productivity. In view of that, it is essential for us in Government to provide opportunities for our young able farmers to lease or rent land.  I hope this will be brought about by this Land Bill which we are now debating.</P>
    <P>Farmers tend to hold on to their farms to an advanced age.  Heirs are generally in their mid-thirties when assuming control and they retain ownership to a very late age.  Irish grassland is a resource with more potential than Whitegate gas, Waterford oil, Navan ore.  When the last litre of oil is drained from the Celtic Sea oil wells, agriculture will still play a prominent part in our economy, It was neglected for far too long by successive Governments since the foundation of the State.  It is a pity that the slogan of the first Minister for Agriculture, the late Paddy Hogan, of one more cow, one more sow, one more acre under the plough, was not adhered to by successive Governments.</P>
    <P>In the late forties, the fifties, and the early sixties we were told industrial development was the keynote to success in Ireland.  Alas, what has been the result? Factories closing one after another.  We are proud to say that the only factory of any consequence we have in south-west Cork, the Ballineen milk factory is going from strength to strength, built on a solid sound agricultural foundation.  It is a pity that the emphasis placed on industrial development was not placed on building up our farmers as they should have been built up to take their place with their counterparts in the EC.</P>

      <P>The situation facing policy makers is quite simple.  They <Col N="165" /> should regulate the land to improve market mobility.  Only 0.6 per cent of the land changes hands every year.  Change of ownership can come only from early retirement and early inheritance, which certainly stimulate mobility of ownership.</P>
      <P>The Norman invasion which brought about the dispossession of the native landlords by English colonists led to the flourishing of leasing.  The three classes of tenants were the bó-airí or affluent cattle owner who never owned land, but rented it, secondly, the saor-chéilí or free tenants, and the bond tenants, who were always poor.</P>

      <P>The Land Commission was originally set up under the Gladstone Act, 1881 as a rent fixing body.

Not alone have the Land Commission failed to keep pace with technological change, but no serious attention has been paid by politicians of any parties for the past two or three decades to keeping in line with the needs of the second half of the twentieth century. As a result, we were left with the Land Commission, a very costly bureaucracy making little or no contribution to land ownership mobility.  The greatest culprits of all times were the Land Commission themselves.</P>

      <P>When they took over the estates they rented them out to farmers with adjoining lands, having neighbours bidding against each other, leading to exorbitant land leasing prices.

    <P>The cost to the State and the taxpayers of Land Commission staff acquiring an acre of land in 1983 was £400.

      <P>That is a well known fact, and Deputy Walsh can go back to his and my constituency and find clear evidence of such things happening.  They did happen and Deputy Walsh is pretty well aware of it.</P>
      <P>The Department of Agriculture should still retain the right of compulsory acquisition when the commission are so advised by ACOT or where it would alleviate the congestion of small farms.  That right should never have been thrown away.  I am appealing to the Minister to retain that element of compulsory acquisition in the new Bill.</P>
      <P>The State are subsidising the Land Commission with regard to tax differences between the purchase price and the annuity charged, to the tune of £70 per acre.  Land must be made available to young energetic farmers.  I was amazed at Deputy Noonan's criticism of certain sections of the Bill, on the grounds that landless men and women will now get an opportunity of acquiring land.  Does the Deputy want to debar farmers' sons who have been classed as landless men for the past 30 or 40 years of an opportunity of leasing an extra farm and of making a living because their parents might be too young to hand over the farm?  These people could lease a farm for ten years and work it as trained farmers.  Deputy Noonan should think differently.  This Bill will give that type of man an opportunity of making a livelihood out of agriculture, the profession in which he was born and bred and which he loves so well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The four main points for increasing land ownership among young energetic farmers are: first, farm inheritance from <Col N="168" /> one generation to the next; second, an effective farm retirement scheme; third, that the 858,000 acres of land currently let on an 11-month system be changed to an 11-year system, if possible.  That would mean that the 5 million acres of unproductive land will play its part in the economy and we will have a viable agricultural industry and a viable farming population making a living where they should get the opportunity of doing so.</P>
    <P>Regulating the open market or sale of land to potential young development farmers is most important. Countless thousands of land-starved, young, energetic, well-trained farmers' sons are being debarred from participating in and making a living out of the land.  Therefore, it is most important that the new element being introduced in this land leasing Bill cater for that section.  The Land Commission were oriented towards traditions of the past but they had not the capacity to initiate new policies.  Apart from a few exceptional instances the commission as such are no longer used to implement public policy.  Indeed, you could describe the Land Commission, established 100 years ago, as now archaic because they were muzzled by red tape departmental bureaucracy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Definitely we did not appoint him.  We did not get a chance of doing so.  Despite the fact that half our farmers are over 55 years of age, a quarter of them aged 65 and both groups account for five million acres of agricultural land, no attempt has been made to introduce a decent farm retirement scheme.  One was introduced which did not get off the ground.  I would describe that scheme as feeble.  It never appealed to the public or the farming community and it was a dismal failure.  Only 39 farmers out of a total of 400 applicants accepted the scheme.  It was restrictive and unattractive.  I was amazed to hear Deputy Noonan say again that that scheme should have been retained.  There would be as much good in retaining a lame duck scheme.  It proved of very little benefit to the elderly section of our farming community.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I will be appealing to politicans to bring in a decent farm retirement scheme whereby elderly farmers could be induced to hand over their farms to their sons and daughters and have some little income available to them.  Such a scheme should be brought <Col N="170" /> in where it would not interfere with social welfare pensions that would accrue to people of that age.  Too many benefits were lost by the people participating and that is why the scheme introduced never got off the ground.  Therefore, a new, invigorating scheme is needed.</P>
      <P>We need also to broaden our horizons if any of the five million acres owned by farmers over 55 years are to be mobilised for restructuring.  It is estimated that 858,000 acres are rented each year by farmers.  That is almost one million acres. The attractive features of legalised land letting are as follows: (a) long term leasing allows freehold ownership to be retained (b) it encourages long term planning and development (c) it allows the leasing farmer to invest in farm development rather than in heavy commitments to farm purchasing (d) it guarantees the land owner a realistic rent for a fixed number of years.  Demand for land leasing comes from three categories: (a) productive farmers with small acreage (b) sons and daughters from average sized farms where the parents are still young, and (c) landless young farmers who qualify through farm apprenticeship schemes or other EC classes, and I ask Deputy Noonan to take note of that.</P>
      <P>The master lease agreement offers a number of attractive elements: (a) the owner gets a reasonable income; (b) it gives the tenant security over the land which he has leased; (c) it guarantees rent reviews and an arbitration structure for any dispute; (d) it allows specified improvements on rented farms; and (e) it allows financial adjustment for improvement work on farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another major aspect inhibiting land division is the question of commonages throughout the west in particular from Malin Head to Mizen Head.  Coming from that area of south-west Cork I know only too well the serious inhibition commonages are to developing fully the mountainside of that area.  As well as that, it is very bad for the eradication of cattle disease to have herds of perhaps nine or ten different neighbours grazing on the rough mountain pasture slopes unprotected and mingling with one <Col N="171" /> another.  Surely in the interests of disease eradication this is not practical for agriculture. It is a well known fact that if those mountain commonage pastures could be divided and fenced in then the farmers who own them would be enabled to maintain, fertilise and lime them properly and get a better income from that part of their farms which is not playing its role as far as the income from such holdings is concerned.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to consider seriously the need for the division of commonages and if at all possible to include it in legislation within the Bill or in future legislation.</P>
    <P>It is important that where the majority of shareholders of a commonage agree to the division the rights of the majority of those land owners should be taken into consideration, and the Department should be empowered to make the necessary division to satisfy everybody concerned. As I have said, one million acres of land is being let under the 11-months system here in Ireland.  Why not let it for a period of ten years instead of 11 months?  This would have a major effect on income from that land.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the leasing of land in Europe.  In France and Belgium tenants have the right to pre-emption in the case of sale while in the Netherlands they have the right of first preference to buy on the open market.  The normal tenancy period in France and Belgium is nine years and in France in special cases long term leasing of 18 to 25 years is legal. Such leases cannot be renewed when the tenant reaches the age of 65.  The legal tenancy period in the Netherlands is six years for parcels of land and 12 years for viable farm units.  The tenancy limit in Germany is nine to 12 years while the normal period in Italy is 15 years.  The latter applies to what Italians describe as <i>coltivatori diretti,</i> the direct farmers.  In Belgium 71 per cent of land is leased while in Holland 48 per cent of land is leased.  In France 46 per cent of agricultural land is leased while in Britain 47 per cent is leased.  A total of 29 per cent of agricultural land is leased in Luxembourg while in Germany 22 per cent is leased. <Col N="172" /> In Italy 18 per cent of agricultural land is leased but in Ireland 6 per cent is leased. If it is practical to lease that amount of land in other EC countries it must be practical to do so here.  I have no doubt that when this Bill is in operation our percentage of leasing will increase to the European average.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in his budget earlier this year rightly extended for a further year the stamp duty exemption in the case of the transfer of land to young farmers.  We introduced that scheme and I appeal to the Minister for Finance, and the Minister for Agriculture, to continue it if at all possible for a further five years, or at least for the duration of the plan. The scheme has proved of great benefit to young farmers.  It was a great attraction to those parents anxious to hand over their farms to their children most of whom had completed an EC farming course and studied various methods of farming.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan expressed the view that the Bill would not help solve farming problems but I challenge him to outline what his party has done in the last two generations to alleviate the problems.  By their actions they will be judged.  It is obvious that his party did not do anything to arrest the problem.  Minister Connaughton has tackled that difficulty.  The Land Commission served a useful purpose but in latter years it was bedeviled by red tape, bureaucracy and political interference.  It is well known that the staff of the Land Commission will be incorporated into the Department of Agriculture.  I have no doubt that they will give keen advice on land leasing and other matters relating to land.  I have no doubt that any future directive in regard to land issued by the Department of Agriculture will have been approved by the former officials of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan announced that the Bill did not contain a shred of mobility. My response to that is &ldquo;There are none so blind as those who do not wish to see&rdquo;. All Members must be aware that this is the only piece of legislation that has been introduced since the foundation of the State that will create the mobility needed <Col N="173" /> for viable agricultural production.  It is amazing that such statements can be made here.  It is an indication that some Members do not realise the importance of the legislation for the agricultural community. My advice to Fianna Fáil is to face up to their responsibilities.  The Government have a responsibility to produce legislation dealing with land leasing. It is the responsibility of any genuine Opposition to support such legislation and ensure it works for the benefit of Irish farmers.</P>
    <P>Does Deputy Noonan want to leave the five million acres of land that are lying idle in such a condition for the next decade growing briars, bushes, thistles and ragwort?  Is that his policy for the furthering of agriculture?  Any person with common sense would welcome this land legislation with open arms and respond by saying, &ldquo;God bless you Paul Connaughton for such well needed legislation&rdquo;. I was amazed to hear Deputy Noonan say that the only thing that the Coalition did in the last 18 months was to eliminate the lime subsidy and cut the AI subsidy in half.  It is well known that his party when in power in 1982 in formulating their budget proposals had taken a decision to eliminate all lime and AI subsidies.  It was fortunate that they did not get an opportunity of including that in a budget.  The Coalition are paying half of the AI subsidy out of the national Exchequer to help farmers.  I should like to ask Deputy Noonan if he is aware that former Deputy James Dillon was responsible for bringing up the lime content of our soil.  In 1948 he got the lime lorries rolling to the fields of Ireland and kept them rolling for almost 35 years.  He realised the importance of lime to our soil.  A lot of lime has been ploughed into the land of west Cork since James Dillon got the first lorry load rolling in 1948.  I can guarantee the Deputies opposite that it will be ploughed into that land in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>I should like to praise the Minister, Deputy Connaughton, for his sound and virile approach to a problem that has existed for a long time.  Men of the calibre of Deputies Paul Connaughton, Minister <Col N="174" /> of State at the Department of Agriculture, Paddy Hegarty, Minister of State, and Austin Deasy, Minister for Agriculture are the only salvation farmers have today if there is to be some future for agriculture.  Remember that it is better to light a match than curse the darkness. Remember that the first step forward has been taken with the introduction of this Bill for a Second Reading.</P>
    <P>This Bill will bring about the formation of a sound agricultural policy.  It will bring about the dream of many a farmer for the past two generations who has been crying out for a land policy.  Above all 5,000,000 acres of land, which has been lying dormant and not playing its part in the economy, will become mobile.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not easy to follow that speech which was well interlaced with statistics relating not only to Ireland but to Europe.  In his speech the Minister of State spoke about promotion.  I compliment him on what he has done in the last two years.  I have no doubt he is sincere and has put a lot of hard work and hours in providing a land policy.  As long as the present attitude of the Department of Finance exists the Minister will be promoting himself and his policy because there will be nothing but hostility from that Department.  That was shown clearly in the <i>caveat</i> they entered into the four year plan for agriculture when they said that everything was alright as long as it did not cost money.  Unfortunately for farmers and the agricultural industry, the Department are calling the tune and it is not a very pleasant one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the measures in the Bill to remove some of the obstacles to the early transfer of land.  Land leasing is very attractive to young farmers.  The money which would be spent on the outright purchase of land can be put to better use in developing the holding in question, stocking it and so on.  It is better to lease or rent a farm for a number of years from a neighbour than to purchase one outright with the help of a bank or the ACC who are not very pleasant landlords. They hold the title to a considerable amount of property.  I would prefer <Col N="175" /> to see a neighbour leasing his land to a young farmer's son.  Lease arrangements could be drawn up which would be mutually satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The measures in the Bill will give adequate safeguards to both the lessor and the tenant regarding the return of ownership to the lessor on the expiry of the lease, fairness of rent, provision for review of rent and some compensation for the lessee who provides farm buildings or improves the holding in some way. There is also provision for arbitration in case any differences arises between the lessor and the lessee.</P>
    <P>Not enough land is available either by way of conacre or letting.  It accounts for roughly a million acres.  The vast bulk of land is either underutilised or transferred too late in the day for young people to make use of it.  Positive encouragement must be given in this area if we are to make progress.  It was disappointing for everyone, including the Minister who has put such an amount of work into this, that some measures were not introduced in the recent budget or Finance Bill which would have given positive encouragement to people to make better use of land and to transfer it earlier.  That area must be tackled and is a prerequisite to a successful leasing system.</P>
    <P>At present there is virtually no encouragement for people to give up their land. The social welfare system generally does not encourage it.  The farm retirement scheme has not been a good experience for people in that annuities did not keep pace with social welfare benefits and allowances.  Until we have a system which makes it attractive for landowners to transfer their land we will not make any real progress in better utilising land.  A farm retirement pension scheme is obviously vital.  People who are 55 or 65 years of age are often very willing and anxious to hand over, if not the ownership, the management of their farms to younger people.  However, when they apply for the non-contributory old age pension, the pension officer is not very impressed with any legal arrangement to transfer management of the <Col N="176" /> farm.  Ownership has to be transferred also.  This is a constraint on the transfer of farms, especially family farms, to young people.</P>
    <P>A considerable amount of land remains underutilised but if the tax arrangements were in any way favourable, owners of such land would be willing and perhaps, very glad, to transfer its management. Land policy must be all about putting the management of land into the hands of dynamic young farmers who are prepared to implement new ideas.  Deputy Sheehan tells us that we could quadruple our output of beef and milk.  Since we are in a considerable bottleneck with the level of production on both those counts, I see no prospect of increasing the output.  I should hope that when more land is taken over by younger people they would be innovative and engage in the kind of quality produce for which there is a market, even if that means engaging in new areas of produce instead of depending on the old system.  There is a market for the good food that can be produced from the good land we have.  A stroll around any supermarket either in Dublin, in west Cork or elsewhere will convince one that we import a considerable quantity of food which could be produced at home.  I should hope that the transfer of the management of land to younger people would mean a discontinuance of the importation of such massive amounts of food.  We are importing foodstuffs to the value of about £800 million.  That is shameful.  The success of any scheme that may be drawn up for the better utilisation of land will depend on the better utilisation of the produce from that land.  It is not good enough to produce more and to have all the young dynamic farmers getting the best from every acre if we expect the taxpayer to subsidise the produce in some way, whether by the system of intervention or of exports to third countries.</P>
    <P>An essential element of any land utilisation policy must be a well co-ordinated food policy.  If the country needs anything more badly than that, it is some degree of co-ordination of the various aids to agriculture.  In some cases there are even conflicting schemes.  We do not need <Col N="177" /> more plans or proposals but we do need some indication of where we are going in terms of agriculture.  In this way the farmers, the processors and the people marketing the produce as well as the Department will be on the same wavelength. I shall not delay the House by going into detail on that aspect but unfortunately it is an area that is very much unco-ordinated.</P>
    <P>Provided that our land resource is used properly, it is a very valuable asset.  We have about 12 million acres of land and if one takes an estimate of about £1,400 per acre we are talking of a renewable resource of the value of about £16 billion. Utilisation of that resource must be a prime consideration in terms of Government policy.  To the extent that the legislation before the House will have the effect of dismantling some of the legal constraints on the mobility of land, I welcome it.  There are some fairly timid steps in the direction of land leasing being taken by a number of co-operatives and they are to be lauded for their pioneering work in this respect.  It is a typically Irish situation that there are a number of master leases available.  One hopes that when this matter is finalised there will be a single master lease and that there will no longer be the situation that, as the late Brendan Behan might have said, the first item on the agenda for every meeting represents a split or a difference.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his tussle with the Department of Finance regarding going a step further and encouraging the better utilisation of land and of land produce.  This will not be easy having regard to the attitude of the Department of Finance.  I should hope, also, that when a proper leasing scheme is available most of our farmers, particularly those in the west, will still be in farming.  I say this because I am not convinced that the present client-based advisory service policy for the 40,000 to 50,000 best farmers is in the best interest of a land leasing or a land utilisation programme. That policy is outlined at page 10 of the four-year plan for the development of agriculture.  It is spelt out clearly also in the proposals for the National Planning <Col N="178" /> Board and more recently in the national plan.  I submit that those farmers in the top sector could very well afford to pay for any advisory service they might need. Let us not forget the other 100,000 farmers who are less well off and who are operating within such constraints as lack of finance, poor quality land and so on. Are we to cut off essential advisory services to those farmers?  Anyone in ACOT or in any other such body would reply that there will be a service available to everybody.  We cannot have it both ways. We cannot provide an advisory service for everyone who requires it and at the same time have a priority client-based list.  In the Castletownbere Peninsula, for instance, the adviser has been replaced by an answering machine.  That is no substitute for a good sound agricultural adviser who goes out to a farm and advises a young farmer who is either taking over a farm from his parents or is leasing one from a neighbour.</P>
    <P>There will be other constraints following the recent developments in respect of the super-levy quota.  It appears that the quota will be based on farms.  That means that if a lessee is interested in a farm in respect of which there is no quota, he will have problems in the event of his wishing, for example, to transfer some of the dairy herd from his parents' farm.  One would hope that some national reserve of the milk quota would be provided both for people leasing land for the first time or for landless people wishing to engage in agriculture.  That is an essential part of any land policy which wants to utilise land in a comprehensive way.  Developments which take place in any aspect of farm production, especially in milk production, have to be catered for.  I hope and expect that to allow leasing to flourish and to make an impact here some percentage of the quota under the super-levy arrangement should be made available to younger farmers.</P>
    <P>There are many other aspects of the farm retirement scheme to which I should like to refer but the main element is that farmers should be encouraged to retire earlier and not debarred from social welfare benefits.  Some of the ancillary <Col N="179" /> benefits to social welfare benefits are as attractive as the benefits themselves in some cases.  In cases of under-utilised land the lessor should get some kind of tax advantage.  I was very pleased to find in the proposals for a plan that there was a recommendation that there should be a tax break on income earned by people who lease land to younger farmers.  It was disappointing that that radical recommendation was not incorporated in the final plan <i>Building on Reality</i> but perhaps the architects of the plan did not feel it was a realistic proposal.  It would encourage people who want to lease land to get some kind of tax break for doing so.  I ask the Minister to look at that recommendation again to see if it could be included in future policy.</P>
    <P>Of course there should also be provision for people who give up land for leasing to be able to invest the money in some body such as the ACC or some other agricultural finance agency, again with a tax break on the money invested because we all know that if you invest money with any of the commercial banks or the ACC you are penalised for doing so once you earn £50 in interest.  There is no encouragement; the farmer might as well hold on to the land and do subsistence type farming on it rather than leasing it and putting the money into a financial institution.  People leasing land should not be penalised for investing their money and I hope facilities will be made available whereby bodies like the ACC could give preferential interest rates for the money and make it available to give new impetus to farming at a reduced rate of interest.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why the ACC could not have lending facilities available for young farmers in the same way that local authorities or building societies have for people buying new homes.  It should be possible to get long-term, fixed interest at reasonably attractive rates for younger farmers because, with the best will in the world, there is no way in which a landless young man can stock and develop a farm of a size which would be necessary to provide an income without <Col N="180" /> reasonable finance at a reasonable interest rate.  If you take even 50 to 60 dairy cows at £600 each as an initial investment, you are talking about a sizeable amount of money and with current interest rates, especially those which applied over the last year, it would not be possible without incentives to have a meaningful land leasing and land utilisation policy.</P>
    <P>As the previous speaker pointed out, there is quite a lot of data available on land leasing in other European countries and it is quite common there.  Owner occupancy is peculiar to the extent that it is 90 per cent in Ireland.  The best of the incentives and encouragement in Europe should be looked at and applied to Ireland.  The policy of encouraging increased production and better utilisation of land will lead to catastrophe if there is not a concurrent policy of better utilisation of the products from farming. A national food processing and marketing policy is a vital and necessary adjunct to the policy of land utilisation.</P>
    <P>Regarding tax concessions and other elements causing constraints on the transfer of land, there was a measure in the Finance Bill on capital acquisitions tax which brings me back to the uncoordinated approach to everything nowadays. It will do nothing for the transfer of land.  The cumulative thresholds under the capital acquisitions tax will certainly discourage the transfer of land to people outside the immediate family.  A threshold of £150,000 for an inter-family transfer is attractive but when you talk about nephews or relatives outside the immediate family there is a threshold of £10,000 or £20,000 with pretty severe rates of tax also which is no encouragement to a land owner to transfer his property to younger people.  For a comprehensive land policy, to encourage earlier transfers and to make it possible for owners nearing retirement to make the transfers, they must not be penalised to the extent that they are at present under the provisions of the Finance Act, 1984.  That is an area which must be taken care of under a meaningful land policy and I would hope that when the legal <Col N="181" /> constraints of this legislation are out of the way those aspects would be tackled.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions of the Bill but I must express my disappointment that there is not positive encouragement by way of tax and other incentives for early retirement, earlier transfer and the uptake of available land by younger people.  This financial encouragement is vital because too little land is coming on the market.  To make any kind of impact nationally we must tackle the underutilised land in the hands of people who for one reason or another are unable to work it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of contributing on this Bill.  I compliment the Minister of State for all the effort, thought and hard work he has put into this important aspect of agriculture since he came into office almost two years ago.  The <i>Farmer's Journal</i> and all newspapers carrying reports on agricultural activities highly praise his endeavours in this regard and it remains for this House to discuss the Bill and give it support.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested by those opposite that this is a feeble attempt to promote the mobility of land.  That is a matter which can be better gauged at some future stage.  It is a very welcome exercise. It is the first time that any Minister has had the courage to face what is regarded as an extremely sensitive area without causing ripples or failing to make a start in achieving what was originally intended.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a legalistic document designed to eliminate some of the anomalies that might arise if land leasing were to proceed along the lines that have been suggested in various model leases.  The second part of the Bill is a tidying up operation in relation to the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all too familiar with the landlord and tenant system, the effect it had on the farming scene and how it retarded the growth of farming well into this century. The system was completely dominated by the landlord up to 1860 and the complete and dominant control was watered down until at the turn of the <Col N="182" /> century several small Acts mentioned in this Bill, sections of which are now being repealed, gave almost total control to the tenant.  The landlords felt that the tenants had more control of the land than they had and the 1903 Act gave most of the land to the Irish farmers.</P>
    <P>We had an annuity system which was tackled in the thirties.  While at the time it caused severe ripples on the farming scene and almost brought about the collapse of farming, nonetheless there was a great measure of justification for the approach of the then Government in that regard.  We had a situation where land was held almost totally by the farmers themselves.  We are now faced with the difficulty of transferring that land so that it can be properly utilised by energetic, able young farmers.</P>
    <P>There is a deeply held concept that under no circumstances should a farmer be put in a position where his land is under threat.  Therein lies the difficulty in relation to the leasing of land.  The 11-month system has been useful and most land which is not used directly by a farmer is let out in that way.  Deputy Sheehan gave an interesting list of statistics in relation to the leasing system which operates in the EEC and elsewhere.  For this scheme to be successful we will have to eliminate the threat of land being confiscated by the lessee at the end of the day. The Minister has given that assurance categorically in the Bill.  Anybody who wishes to engage in the leasing process need have no fears with regard to getting the land back at the end of the period of the lease.  The point has been made by those opposed to the Bill and opposed to the concept of leasing that we are going back to the days of the latter half of the nineteenth century when the landlords were in control.  If that fear is put into the minds of people who have land we will never succeed in achieving the objectives of this Bill.</P>
    <P>It behoves politicians and farming organisations to support the scheme because it has much merit. It will ensure that land which is grossly underutilised will be put to better use.  Various <Col N="183" /> incentives must be provided to ensure that it will be attractive to the person leasing the land but the major difficulty lies in the fact that the farmer must feel secure as the owner of the property.  Land is sacred in the minds of most people and very few people will sell land purely for the sake of it.  Therein lies the difficulty for this Bill.  The modern attitude is one of caution.  Caution has been expressed by the major farming organisations but a good PR job has already been done.  I had hoped that the Bill would have attracted more farmers to consider the leasing of land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;That Dáil Éireann condemns the halving of the subsidies on bread, butter and milk at this time because of the serious and widespread hardship caused to the poorer and weaker sections of the community and calls on the Government to restore the subsidies immediately to their previous levels.&rsquo;</P>
      <P>It will be difficult at this stage to recreate the atmosphere that prevailed during the first few days of August when the House had gone into recess, and we were told that things were relatively on target, that plans were going right and that the national plan would be produced before the end of September.  We understood that we would be debating whatever was in the national plan when the House met in October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The poorest sections of this community will long remember 2 August 1984 as one of the harshest days in our history.  It was on that day that the Government turned the screw on social welfare recipients and the poorer sections of the community. These cuts were said to be part of the national plan which had been brought forward for various reasons, among them <Col N="184" /> the position of the US dollar.  That position prevailed a few weeks earlier, on 5 July, when the House adjourned but the Taoiseach did not refer to it in his closing speech on the Estimates.</P>
    <P>As well as the cuts in the food subsidies the Land Commission was abolished and the malicious injuries scheme was abandoned. People will now have to pay for malicious damage to their property, but tonight I am primarily concerned with the cuts in food subsidies and the effect they will have on the poorest sections of the community.</P>
    <P>One of the main complaints about the cut in these subsidies was the way they were announced.  It has been argued that different Governments made such announcements in the same way but in my view this is completely wrong and should never happen no matter who is in power.  Last week many loyal civil servants were ridiculed by members of this Government when we were discussing the national plan but in August they were sent out to explain what could not be explained.  I admit that people are entitled to their annual leave but it was very wrong to leave it to four civil servants to explain the position to the country.  That should never have happened, and it should never happen again.</P>
    <P>The decisions of that day added 2p to the pint of milk, 8p to the pound of butter and 8p to a loaf of bread, giving a saving of £20 million out of billions of pounds that are spent on public and other types of expenditure.  We were told last week that cutting food subsidies had been discussed at the Cabinet meeting and that the decision was made on that day.  These cuts hit particularly social welfare recipients and the less privileged in our community and they had a dramatic impact on those people.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that these cuts have not affected certain sectors of the community as badly as Fianna Fáil and others, including Government backbenchers, said at the time.  Deputy O'Hanlon asked a question about the effects these cuts would have on the health boards.  The Minister said that it cost the Eastern Health Board £80,000, the Midland <Col N="185" /> Health Board £23,000, the Mid-Western Health Board £30,000, the North-Eastern Health Board £30,000, the North-Western Health Board £49,000, the South-Eastern Health Board £50,000, the Southern Health Board £87,000, and the Western Health Board £73,000.  At the end of that question the Minister said there were no funds at his disposal which would enable him to provide a special extra allocation for health boards to meet the extra charge.  He went on to say that health boards were informed in December 1983 that their 1984 approved allocations were intended to cover all price movements in 1984.  That seemed to infer that the people who drafted the budget were to be inspired that a decision would be made nine months later and that they should take account of that in their budgets. Does this mean that in future health boards, when submitting their budgets, should take into account that disastrous decisions such as cutting food subsidies may be made by the Government?  Is the Minister saying that the health boards should have known in 1983 that the Government intended to halve food subsidies in August 1984?  Because of these cuts the health boards are short of approximately £500,000.</P>
    <P>Late in August statistics dealing with household budgets showed income bracket by income bracket how much everybody spent on almost everything. The poorer people &mdash; social welfare recipients and the less well-off members of out society &mdash; spent 20 per cent of their total disposable income on bread, butter and milk.  The Government's figure of .5 per cent was totally inaccurate, but I will cover their figures in a few moments.</P>
    <P>I would like to put on the record comments made by various Deputies, not just Fianna Fáil Deputies but Government backbenchers and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  These cuts were denounced as scandalous.  Senior members of the Labour Party said that these cuts were callous because they would seriously damage the most disadvantaged people in the community.  They said these cuts were a savage attack on the working classes and poorer larger families would <Col N="186" /> have to bear the brunt, and the measures were enough to cause a tremor in society. Now, a few months later, all this seems to be forgotten.</P>
    <P>Bread, butter and milk are the staple diet of the poor but the Government did not take that into account.  They are the major source of nourishment for children, but again the Government did not take that into account.  At a time when there is mass unemployment of 200,000, and the take-home pay means that almost one million people are on the breadline, the Government saw fit to chop 20 per cent off their spending.  This was totally unreasonable and callous.  This measure was not thought out.  These cuts were announced when people were going on holidays when the easiest thing for the Government to do was to hit an area which did not have a pressure group.</P>
    <P>It is our job as an Opposition to put forward the case for those who cannot do so on their own.  It is our job to prevent the Government from continuing to hit at the poorer sections.  Last year members of the Government parties voted against them.  The Government have imposed huge increases in the price of coal and they introduced VAT on clothes. All of this was done to balance the books, to satisfy the economists and to make people in the Central Bank, the Bank of Ireland and the World Bank happy.  We are back to 5 per cent inflation, foreign debts seems to be in line and manufacturing exports are good, but how has all this been achieved?  Before the summer the Taoiseach in a statement to the House referred to all of these things but he did not say it would be done on the backs of the under-privileged, the workers and the deprived people.</P>
    <P>The national plan spells out how savings will be made.  There will be a cut in respect of maintenance to houses and many jobs in the area of health will go. The attitude is to hit the defenceless people.  It is a callous and disgraceful way of doing business.  Before the summer recess this House voted millions of pounds to various semi-State bodies. These amount were voted through almost on the nod because it was essential that <Col N="187" /> this be done before the recess.  The way the ordinary working-class people are being treated by this Government is disgraceful, all the more so when part of that Government are members of a party who are supposed to be concerned about such people.  They have turned their backs on the workers and they can be considered traitors.  They continue to implement Government policies that have caused hardship to many under-privileged and last week they spelled it out again in the national plan.</P>
    <P>The Government may say that the family income supplement which will affect 35,000 people out of 1 million families will change things but the people will not be fooled.  The sad thing is that all of this is being done by a so-called caring and liberal Government who said they would bring in policies to help the less well-off and the deprived people.  Their policies have meant cutbacks and savings and all of this has been achieved on the backs of the working classes.  The Labour Party have reneged totally on all they ever stood for.  This is very clear from the national plan and the trade union movement have told them so.  Their back-bench Deputies have an opportunity now to vote with Fianna Fáil on this issue. Unfortunately it will not bring down the Government but they will have an opportunity to register their protest and to put their money where their mouth is, if all those statements that were made in the hazy, sunny days of August meant anything. I ask them to support this motion, to reject the policy of the Government in this matter and thus prevent this disgraceful situation occurring again which will happen if the national plan is followed.</P>
    <P>When the cuts were announced the question was asked how social welfare recipients and the less well-off would survive. The answer from the four civil servants who braved the media and the country that night was that the 7 per cent or the 8 per cent given to social welfare recipients would help them to keep in line with inflation and would also cushion the effect of the cut in food subsidies. That was not the case.  Even in the better <Col N="188" /> years of 1977 and 1978 when unemployment was about 70,000, Fianna Fáil kept the food subsidies but at a time when unemployment is in the region of 220,000 the Government have removed part of the subsidies.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the removal of the food subsidies has not had the same effect on all sectors of society.  Poor people gain substantially more out of food subsidies than do the rich and until an alternative system is found it was morally wrong and callous to remove them.  While people in the top 14 per cent income bracket spend over 1 per cent on bread, butter and milk the poorer people spend from 5 to 7 per cent of their income on those commodities. The figure given of 0.5 per cent may have been correct for the top 14 per cent, although I do not think it was, but in respect of other sections it was wildly inaccurate.  An effort was made to pretend it would have only a negligible effect but that was totally wrong.  That was probably the reason that people who should have explained their action were long gone and could not be found for several weeks.</P>
    <P>This Government love to come forward with good news and they delight in their public relations but on that night they ran away.  The average urban householder spends 1.84 each week of their disposable income on bread and those at the lower level spend 7.53 per cent of the little they have on that item.  How can that be reconciled with the Government's figure of 0.5 per cent?  For the less well off the effect of the reduction in bread subsidy meant an increase of 1.28 per cent in their shopping for that single item. The average household spends 2.29 per cent of their disposable income on milk but the lowest group spends 8.39 per cent. On the other hand, the rich have been affected only to the extent of 1.33 per cent.  These figures were taken from the household budget survey.  The increases have hit the less well-off to a much greater extent.  The family income supplement which is meant to cushion them has been a total failure because it ignores the many people who should be included.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="189" /> The Government must also be criticised for their proposals with regard to children's allowances.  Last week I argued against abolishing the various schemes that put money into the mother's hand which is the important thing.  The Government may say that the money is still going into the household but one of the important benefits of the scheme for children's allowance was that it gave the mother money to buy essential foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>The Minister of Health has said there will be no extra money in the Exchequer when all the schemes are taken together. While some of the less well-off may benefit, many of the 1 million people on the breadline will not benefit.  We will wait and see what the budget proposes. I have no doubt that those in the lower and middle income brackets will suffer. When the Minister was in the House last week I asked him to clearly state the position and to state if the Minister for Health had given wrong information.</P>
    <P>In their two years of office this Government have followed plan after plan and scheme after scheme.  They have hit those in the category whom the Labour Party traditionally helped.  Deputy McLoughlin condemned the cuts.  He said they were immoral, wrong and callous and were hitting at the deprived and the under-privileged. What has he got to say about the national plan?  What has he to say about the cuts?  The family income supplement will not help the less well-off. Help towards the maintenance of houses is now gone and this is a further cutback on those who cannot afford it.  All of these issues show clearly that the Government have now found a soft way of balancing their books, a way to satisfy the economists, to control the various interests they want to impress, the people who say that you judge how well you are doing by inflation being low and unemployment high, social welfare recipients being taxed, bringing children's allowances into the net, as if every person who is unemployed is some type of a gangster and as if they were parasites on the Irish nation.  Those are the people who are out there suffering.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="190" /> Are Fine Gael Deputies and Labour Deputies in particular unaware of the hardship which exists at present?  Are they aware of the huge poverty problems in society?  Are they aware that people are on the breadline, that the queues in hospitals are growing day by day?  Are they aware that several hospitals have closed wards and others have extended their waiting lists, that outpatient services have been curtailed?  Are they aware that a substantial section of the community have to carry the burden?  Do they not care about these people?  Have they no policies to take those people out of the terrible predicament they are in?  Do they wish to keep on taxing and squeezing them and taking away whatever benefits they have?  There is a cut in medical cards.  More people are being taken out of the health services as if those services were overstaffed and as if because we are spending a good deal of money on the health services they no longer need staff. Anyone involved would tell you otherwise.</P>
    <P>I quoted figures today from the health boards.  Other schemes in the health boards are also affecting under-privileged and deprived people, people suffering hardship.  I will be very interested to hear the Minister for Finance explain how he made those decisions and how £26 million out of the billions that are spent could not be found elsewhere.  I will be interested to hear what input the Labour Ministers had, how hard they argued for the less well off and what they will do in the next budget to supplement family incomes in a real way.</P>
    <P>Will the members of the Labour Party come through the lobby tomorrow night with Fianna Fáil to reject a bad decision by a bad Government and show the Irish people that this House and their party in particular have some credibility?  If they do that, the Labour Party will have a future.  If not, they will be seen to be falling into the trap of the monetarist, Reaganite, Thatcherite policies which are being pursued.</P>

He should tell the House where he is going from now on and what the national plan, the cuts and the policies they are pursuing are doing for working class people.  Where is the light at the end of the tunnel for the <Col N="192" /> people on the poverty line?  What are the positive policies for the 200,000 unemployed? What are the policies for the 66,000 young people?  What is the policy for the people whose social welfare benefits are now coming into the tax bracket?  Children's allowances are to be taxed.  Medical cards are being taken from people day by day.  The cuts are in the working class areas.  There is no development, no progress.  There are no new schemes in the working class areas. There is no money for youth development, for sports, for recreation.  The Minister should explain to this House how the Coalition Government can continue with such harsh, ruthless, callous policies.</P>

      <P>On the point raised by Deputy Haughey, since it is not a point of order, as far as I am aware there is a long-standing tradition in the House that, as a courtesy to the House, if a member of the Government is reading from a prepared script, a copy of that script is distributed to Members.  It is also a longstanding tradition, as far as I am aware, that if a note &ldquo;Check against delivery&rdquo; appears at the top of the script there is no obligation on the person delivering the script to stick only to that script.  It is an assistance to Deputies, but I cannot think that it should be accepted as an absolute and tight constraint on the remarks he might wish to make.  Deputy Haughey knows that extremely well, being a noted exponent of the extempore remark even when he has a script in his hand.  I will ignore that remark.  During the debate on the economic and social plan <i>Building on Reality</i> I stated to this House in the presence of Deputy Ahern that the &ldquo;Tadhg an dá thrá&rdquo; syndrome was rampant among the Opposition.  I can only say that that syndrome is very visible and is obviously eating away at the body of the Oppostion on the other side of the House.</P>

We were accused by the Leader of the Opposition and the spokesman on Finance of having made too little progress in reducing the level of current expenditure.  That was <Col N="194" /> fair enough.  It was a criticism which was made by a number of independent and reputable economists, people the Opposition pray in aid when they produce their own national plans.  We are asked tonight to consider a motion which condemns us for having taken action to reduce current expenditure, action which was not alone considered by the Opposition but was actually canvassed by them at one stage. I know this will irritate Deputy Ahern and perhaps others on the Opposition benches, but I want to refer to a Green Paper called &ldquo;Development for Full Employment&rdquo; published in June 1978&mdash;&mdash;</P>

At the same time it would be wrong to discontinue them abruptly since this would give a noticeable boost to inflation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We now know the importance to be attached to statements and <Col N="195" /> documents released by the present Opposition. I wonder how many of their documents they want to throw out so soon after publication.  I picked that passage from the Green Paper deliberately because the sentiments in it are ones with which I totally agree.  The same thing applies to the statement about subsidies. It is a great pity that the Opposition should choose to turn their backs on one of the few things in their record in recent years that show a little ordinary economic sense.  We owe it to the House and the Irish public to discuss specific decisions taken to reduce public expenditure in the context of the overall aims and objectives of the Government's plan.</P>
      <P>We have already had a very full and frank, although &mdash; in all honesty I must say &mdash; not a very constructive debate on the plan.  I do not intend to go over all that ground again.  Instead, I will concentrate my remarks on the emphasis laid in the plan on the need to correct the imbalance in the public finances.  I must emphasise that our determination to do so is linked to the need to free sufficient resources to enable us to fulfil the two central objectives of the plan, firstly, to achieve the maximum possible increase in sustainable employment, and secondly, to halt the rise in taxation, both direct and indirect.</P>
      <P>Discussion of economic policy since 1981 has been dominated by the need to correct the imbalance in the public finances.  At that time, Government expenditure so far exceeded revenue that an unsustainable explosion of public debt was threatened.  This threat has abated because of the decisive and tough corrective action taken by this Government but the fundamental problem still remains. We are spending considerably more on current public services than we can afford, or than the community is willing to pay for through taxation.  We must, therefore, reduce expenditure to a level that can be financed on an ongoing long-term basis, by available tax resources. We must also reallocate expenditure to areas where it can make the maximum possible contribution towards employment creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="196" /> Increasing taxation is not a viable solution to this problem.  Taxation has been increased very considerably in recent years, and now amounts to about 10 percentage points more of gross national product than in 1977, notwithstanding the increase in GNP since then.  Tax levels are commonly perceived to be too high, particularly in the PAYE sector and there is considerable pressure for a reduction in the tax burden.  By driving a widening wedge between nominal incomes and take home pay, and by adding to inflation, taxation is also seen as adding to costs in our economy and disimproving our international cost competitiveness which is crucial to a nation as dependent on trade as we are.  Further increases in taxation, therefore, would in the Government's judgment be inimical to the provision of much needed employment.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to halting the rise in the tax burden clearly limits their budgetary options considerably. Many ask why we cannot borrow more and indeed, some members of the Opposition may advocate and have advocated in the last week such a course. Borrowing has always been available as a short-term let-out, but we have learnt the hard way that borrowing is merely deferred taxation.  It has to be paid for in the end.  We have seen extensive borrowing over the past decade which was used to fund current expenditure and questionable investment projects which did not generate additonal revenue sufficient to service the loans.  Consequently the level of national debt has increased relative to GNP and the servicing of that debt diverts more and more of our national resources each year that might otherwise be used, for example, for employment creation or the further development of social services.  It is the Government's intention, as set out in the plan, to halt the escalation in debt relative to GNP and to put a stop to the increasing preemption of much-needed resources for debt servicing.  The more borrowing school does not provide an answer to the problem that we face at the moment.  On the contrary, it would, in fact, serve only <Col N="197" /> to increase further the problem that we will face in future years.</P>
    <P>Persistent imbalance in the public finances has also contributed to imbalance in the economy as a whole.  Total domestic expenditure has exceeded domestic resources by a wide margin in recent years.  The excess is measured by the balance of payments deficit.  This exceeded 10 per cent of GNP in each year from 1979 to 1982.  It has since been reduced considerably, now to 5 per cent of GNP.  However, given the composition of domestic demand it could not be sustained at that level.  For this reason also some reduction in public expenditure is warranted.</P>
    <P>The inescapable conclusion from this analysis &mdash; an analysis which, as I pointed out during the debate on the plan was common in large part to this Government's plan and to the document known as <i>The Way Forward,</i> now apparently being written out of the history books &mdash; is that a downward adjustment to public expenditure is essential.  There remains the question of how rapid that adjustment should be.  It should be sufficient to halt the rise in the debt relative to GNP and so offer the prospect of stopping the increase in the debt service burden at prevailing interest rates and of a reduction in that burden should interest rates fall.  Originally, the Government adopted a target of eliminating the current budget deficit by 1987 and so of reducing borrowing to the level required for worthwhile and remunerative capital investment projects.  However, the adverse international economic conditions since 1981 have made achievement of that original target much more difficult. With interest rates so high and the economy just coming out of recession, we decided that it was not desirable to reduce public expenditure and raise revenue to the extent required because the deflationary effect of that course could have sapped the vitality of the economy for some years to come.</P>
    <P>We believe that the strategy set out in the national plan is the minimum required to halt the deterioration in the public finances.  That strategy involves tough <Col N="198" /> decisions.  We could have attempted to avoid these by assuming that rapid economic growth could come to our rescue. That, indeed, was the formula adopted by the gentlemen of the Opposition when they were putting forward their last observed plan in October of 1982, the one on which, as I have said, they now turn their backs.  To assume that more rapid economic growth would resolve the problem would have been simply to renege on our responsibilities in relation to the Irish electorate.</P>
    <P>This Government believe that they should set out their priorities for spending public moneys and to show how these priorities support their broad objectives, particularly on the employment and taxation fronts.  This has been done more explicitly than ever before in the recently published national plan.  Information is given there on the proposed allocations for all areas of public expenditure for the period of the plan.  This shows that this Government take planning seriously. The scale and the composition of public expenditure have a major impact on the economy and we are determined that that impact should be beneficial and lasting.</P>
    <P>Deputies on the other side of the House may choose to ignore that background; they try to put up a smokescreen; we hear words like &ldquo;Thatcherite&rdquo;, &ldquo;Reaganite', &ldquo;monetarist&rdquo; and all the other tired old clichés every time we have an economic debate in this House.  They all show one thing, that the Opposition would rather find a cute name, a nice label, for the policies which they had not the guts to implement themselves than come forward with a constructive alternative. Against that real economic background which those gentlemen on the other side themselves analysed in 1982 and came to broadly the same conclusion as we did but had not the guts to carry it through &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Against that background we have to look at individual spending decisions like a reduction in the food <Col N="199" /> subsidies which we are discussing here this evening &mdash; not that Deputy Ahern spent much time working on them.  It is widely accepted on both sides of the House and by objective commentators that Exchequer subsidies on food or other consumer goods which benefit rich and poor alike are a very inefficient and expensive way of effecting a transfer of resources to the less well-off.  Under the present subsidy scheme, the taxpayer contributes towards everyone's consumption of bread, butter and milk, without regard to individual or family income.  The wealthiest family's purchases of these foods are subsidised at the same rate as those of the poorest families. Such a mechanism is unfair and wasteful of the taxpayer's money.  I would think that those who are genuinely concerned about the less well off would wish to see their standard of living protected in a much more direct way and in a less wasteful fashion.  On that score long-term social welfare payments have increased in real terms by over 50 per cent since 1972 while short-term payments have seen an increase of over 40 per cent in real terms over the same period.  It is through such improvements in the social welfare code that the interests of the less well-off can be best served, rather than through universal subsidies.  The social welfare increases in mid-1983 more than matched inflation to mid-1984, and the further increases introduced some weeks prior to the change in food subsidies will be more than adequate to cover the rate of inflation expected to mid-1985, including the impact of the change in subsidies. The impact in the case of working families with low incomes has been offset by the introduction of the family income supplement, entitlement to which has been brought forward to 1 September 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other justification for food subsidies, that of reducing the general rate of inflation, which had considerable merit when subsidies were introduced in 1975 with inflation at 21 per cent, has far less weight now when inflation is so much lower and still falling.  Our inflation rate <Col N="200" /> fell to less than 8 per cent last August, the lowest it has been since November 1978.  In fact, the rise in prices in the quarter to August last was the lowest quarterly increase since August 1977. The House should also note that despite the reduction in food subsidies, food prices actually fell slightly in the last quarter.  No one can claim then that the trend of food prices has led to a decline in anyone's standard of living.  There is no basis for Deputy Ahern's claim that our action on food subsidies caused serious and widespread hardship.  I might add that it was with some amazement that I heard Deputy Ahern criticising policies that lead to a reduction in the rate of inflation.  Is he now trying to tell the House that those who are least well off and are low paid have no interest in seeing inflation brought down when that is the main problem they have to contend with over recent years?  It seems extraordinary that the Opposition speaker&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The annual savings in expenditure resulting from the subsidy reductions of last August will be of the order of £46 million.  The savings for the remainder of this year will be of the order of £16 million, not £26 million as Deputy Ahern kept referring to earlier. This is another example of a certain unpreparedness on the part of the gentlemen on the opposite side to do even the most basic sums when they talk about economic matters.  We will not in future have to ask the taxpayer to foot this bill and I think this House would be unwilling to reimpose this burden on his shoulders. No one can argue honestly that we should not have saved this money and hold, at the same time, as Deputy Ahern does, that taxation is too high.  Deputy Ahern <Col N="201" /> calls for the restoration of the subsidy cuts.  He should accept that he is also calling for higher taxation.  Where does he think this higher taxation should be imposed?  Are he or any of his colleagues going to come along with a proposal during the rest of this debate to impose an extra £46 million worth of taxation next year?  Does Deputy Ahern wish to tell the House and the people that Fianna Fáil do not want to see the burden of taxation stabilised but would rather see it continuing its inexorable upward march?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In other measures detailed in the plan, the Government's commitment to the socially disadvantaged is crystal clear.  Major initiatives are being taken in the provision of employment schemes, with particular emphasis on the most disadvantaged of all in the labour market, the long term unemployed.  The new social employment scheme and the alternance scheme will offer new hope to thousands of the long term unemployed. In education, which is getting relative priority under this plan, special funding is being provided for disadvantaged areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="202" /> In the area of social welfare and income maintenance, major strides have been made over the last two decades in introducing and extending schemes &mdash; and I say that in compliment to all the Governments we have had in that time &mdash; and in substantially raising the living standards of beneficiaries both in real terms and relative to those of the employed population.  In recent years. however, budgetary constraints and the need to provide for a sharp increase in the numbers unemployed have reduced considerably the scope for further improvements.  The overall budget constraint will continue to operate over the period of the plan.  Furthermore, demographic factors will require a significant increase in social welfare expenditure, but this Government stand by the commitment in their programme on coming into office to keep long term social welfare payments in line with inflation and to keep short term unemployment and disability payments in line with take-home pay.  In all, the provision for Exchequer-financed social welfare expenditure will increase by 28 per cent by 1987 over the expected 1984 out turn or by over one and a half times the expected growth rate in total public expenditure.  That shows clearly the relative priority that we give to the social needs of those people who most need the assistance of the rest of the community.</P>
    <P>In the 1984 budget, we relieved taxpayers with incomes below £5,000 per annum, or £96 per week, of the special income levy.</P>
    <P>The family income scheme, now being introduced, will provide selective social welfare support for families where the head of the household is an employee with low pay.  This counters a weakness which has existed heretofore in the social welfare and tax system.</P>
    <P>A new child benefit scheme will be introduced which will unify into a single payment State support towards the cost of rearing children.  This will be designed to channel available resources to those most in need.  On this scheme Deputy Ahern &mdash; perhaps he has not read much about the scheme or listened to what has <Col N="203" /> been said about it &mdash; indulged in what would otherwise be pure scare tactics.  It is not a scheme designed to save money. It is designed to concentrate available funds on those who most need them.  It is not a scheme designed to tax people who do not have a tax liability.  It is not a scheme designed to push people at the bottom of the scale out of benefit and Deputy Ahern is well aware that that is not the case.  It is a scheme to concentrate, to target the resources that we make available through the taxpayers' contributions in favour of the people who need them most.  If Deputy Ahern and Fianna Fáil do not wish to do that let them stand up in the House and say that they are against social justice because that is what it means.</P>
    <P>We have found out two things about Fianna Fáil tonight.  First, they are for more taxation and, secondly, they are against social justice.  If that is what they wish to say let them come out and say it unamibigously.  There is no need to talk for 25 minutes, as Deputy Ahern did, rambling around and beating around the bush.  If that is what they want to say they should come out and say it straight so that everybody will know where they stand.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Government have introduced these new schemes gives the lie to any allegation that we are uncaring in our approach to economic and budgetary policy or that we think only in fundamental economic budgetary fiscal targets. We do not.  We have made very substantial efforts in a most difficult time to press ahead with social improvements.  The national plan recently published puts forward the minimum steps to halt the deterioration in the public finances and does so in a way that is protective of the less well-off in out community.  In addition to that, and in spite of the scarcity of resources, it allows for the continued development of social policy in health, education, social welfare and housing.  It is in this context that the reduction in food subsidies must be viewed.  The poor and the disadvantaged must be safeguarded and protected in the most effective manner possible.  This can, <Col N="204" /> should and will be done through more careful channeling of resources to those genuinely in need rather than by indiscriminate provision of food subsidies to all and sundry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern early in his statement suggested that the plan, and the measures in relation to food subsidies, showed a concern by the Government &mdash; the tired old refrain from that side of the House &mdash; to balance the books and satisfy the economists.  I wonder how many people who will benefit from the family income supplement will think that we are introducing that to balance the books and satisfy the economists.  How many people who have benefited from the very real commitment of successive Governments over the years to increase the real level of social welfare payments which is what we have done over a long period think that that was done to satisfy economists or balance books?  That is not what it is about at all.  Our concern is to make sure that out of the resources available the greatest possible amount is used in favour of those who have the greatest need.</P>
    <P>The motion tabled by Deputy Ahern, in spite of all that has gone before, in spite of all that his party said in their plan of October 1982, in spite of the debate we had in the last two weeks on the national plan, aims simply to turn back the clock.  It would be more honest if his motion said that what Fianna Fáil are proposing is more spending, more taxation and less social equity.  That is what Deputies opposite are really saying.  I have a feeling that that is not what they want to say, that Deputy Ahern, and many of his colleagues, have real concern for the social disadvantaged and less well-off members of out community.  I appeal to them not to let their concern with the buzz words, the smart-Aleck phrases, the Thatcherite business, get in the way of making sensible decisions about public expenditure, sensible and progressive decisions of the kind we have put out in our plan.  If they could only do that I suspect that they would be happier in their job.  They would know that they were not turning their backs on what they stood for a short few years ago.</P>

It launched a new phase in what might well be described as their austerity programme.

The Government have made a consistent and concerted attack on the less well-off sections of our community since they assumed office.</P>

    <P>The Fine Gael and Labour partners in Government seem to have frightfully short memories of what happened to their budget of January 1981.  They seem to have forgotten that it was the reduction in food subsidies and the extension of VAT to clothing and footwear which brought that Coalition down.  By their decision to halve the subsidies on butter, bread and milk they are striking hardest at the poor, the unemployed and their families and those who work for low pay. For many families with young children bread, butter and milk account for a sizeable part of their weekly budget and the price increases now imposed will add greatly to the intense financial strains <Col N="206" /> being placed upon their limited resources.</P>
    <P>The crude and insensitive way in which the announcement was made, on the eve of the August Bank holiday weekend, by civil servants when the Taoiseach, and his Ministers, were in far-off lands getting a little sun on their backs, clearly emphasises how callous, crude and uncaring the Government are.</P>

      <P>Nobody would be surprised at the input of Fine Gael into such a callous decision because that party has been noted since the foundation of the State for their uncaring attitude to the poor and underprivileged.  The Right-wingers of Fine Gael care little or nothing for the poor, unemployed and sick.  They have always been remembered by the less well-off for cruel decisions they made in the past.</P>

      <P>All the Minister need do is ask any old man or woman how the reduction by Fine Gael many years ago of 1/- on the old age pensions affected them and they will tell him what they thought of Fine Gael.  The so-called social alliance between Fine Gael and Labour is presenting itself as an alliance in which Labour have been engulfed by the power and insatiable greed of Fine Gael who are inflicting more and more hardships on the most deprived section of the community. In so doing Labour have abandoned the people they pretend to represent.  I use the word &ldquo;pretend&rdquo; advisedly because Labour are pretending to represent the people who voted them to Dáil Éireann.  They have made a mockery of the promises they made prior to the last election and the previous elections. They have abandoned their pre-election promises.  They have sold out to Fine Gael for one purpose &mdash; the attainment <Col N="207" /> of power and the maintenance of that power.  Labour have literally bitten the hand of those who fed them and they are prepared to continue, indefinitely it seems, in an unholy alliance with Fine Gael which has caused a great degree of sadness among those who were foolish enough to vote for them.  They are behaving like lambs being led to the slaughter and they have lost any social conscience they may have had.</P>
      <P>The decision to halve the food subsidies merely demonstrates the failure of Labour to influence the Reaganite-Thatcherite economic policies of Fine Gael.  We all know that milk, butter and bread are the basic foods used by the less well-off sections.  We know that to afford them in adequate quantities even before the removal of half the subsidies was proving a very difficult and trying exercise for many of those people.  We are all very much aware that these simple basic food items are essential for small children.  The insensitivity of the decision cries out for vengence and I have no doubt that the public will have vengence on both Fine Gael and Labour at the next opportunity. Let us hope it will not be too long.  How spineless the Labour Party and the Labour Ministers have become.  People in the streets in rural towns and villages are asking what has happened to the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>The birds in the trees are singing it now.</P>
      <P>In their 1982 election document entitled <i>Where Labour stands &mdash; Jobs, Equality and Justice with Labour</i> they state:</P>
      <P>The main Parties propose massive cuts in Public Spending falling especially on Health and Social Services and affecting the weakest in the Community. Labour rejects utterly any policy that makes the poor, the unemployed, the sick, the homeless and the young bear the brunt of corrective measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="208" /> Fine Gael's 1981 election programme states:</P>
    <P>Fine Gael will subsidise foodstuffs to the extent of price increases of Bread, Sugar, Butter, Milk, Cheese and Flour will not exceed half the price norm during the anti-inflation programme.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Government 1981-86 states:</P>
    <P>With a view to holding back price rises during the critical period to March 1983 the Government will, during this period, subsidise key foodstuffs &mdash; bread, flour, milk, butter and margarine &mdash; to the extent necessary to hold down future price increases in these products to a maximum of 6% a year, with no further increases in these products in 1981, and will impose no taxes on food, gas, coal or electricity &mdash; including no increase in the fuel tax on electricity.  Additional subsidies arising from this process will be maintained beyond the date of March 1983, linked to continuing pay norms.</P>
    <P>How can any member of the Labour Party who has any concern for those whom he or she represents vote in favour of this horrendous decision announced before the August bank holiday weekend? How can a Deputy such as Deputy Bell vote for it?  Any Member of the Labour Party who votes for this must have a very loose and elastic conscience in relation to social justice.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputy Michael Bell will not forget or renege on the views he expressed in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 5 August last.  He clearly and unequivocally stated:</P>
    <P>The Labour Party is being swamped in the current administration and now is the time to get out.  The halving of the food subsidies has been the last straw.  It now appears that decisions have just been handed down at Government level.  The subsidy cuts are but one of a series of decisions that are being made by the Government which are anti-Labour and anti-trade union. The Labour Party has been left to carry <Col N="209" /> the can and as a result is in total disarray.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that Deputy McLoughlin will agree with every word Deputy Bell said because if they were in disarray then they are in much greater disarray now. Let us hope that the conscience which prompted Deputy Bell to make these statements on 5 August will be as true and as just a conscience when he has the opportunity in this House tomorrow night of expressing his real dissatisfaction with the decision.  He will have an opportunity of voting one way or the other and we will carefully scrutinise what he does. I have no doubt that his constituents will do likewise.</P>
    <P>We have had in the past far too many incidents of Labour Deputies in particular, and some Fine Gael Deputies, indulging in Jekyll and Hyde politics. When they were here in the Dáil they voted for harsh, insensitive decisions and then raced down the country in their motor cars and cried their way around their constituencies, whinging and whining and shedding crocodile tears, saying they did not have any hand, act or part in these cruel decisions.</P>
    <P>I would remind them of a major decision taken in this House shortly after this Government took office.  The leader of the Labour Party and then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Spring, introduced legislation which gave county managers uncurtailed powers to impose charges for any service provided at any time.</P>

      <P>The Government have made much play about their intention to reduce inflation but in halving these subsidies they have added half a percentage point to the CPI.  Prior to the removal of half the subsidy the price of milk was 21p per pint; it has now risen to 23p.  A pound of butter was 94 pence but it has risen 8 pence to £1.02 and bread has risen from 47 pence to 59 pence.  The Government have been stupid and insensitive enough to think that these items which they have put beyond the reach of many people are less important than a bottle of whiskey.  That alone indicates that they have lost touch totally with reality.  Instead of producing some document that would indicate that they had returned to some semblance of reality they have produced totally unreal policies. I wonder how my good friend, the Minister for Health and Social Welfare, <Col N="211" /> regards all of this.  He used to be very concerned about this whole question of food subsidies and he referred to them on many occasions.  One of these was 15 June 1978 when he said it was strange that every time a Coalition Government left office food subsidies were abolished. Again, on 15 November 1978, as reported at column 1081 of the Official Report, the Minister for Health said:</P>
      <P>Those who benefit from food subsidies are the large families, the poor and the elderly.  Proportionately they spend more of their ordinary income on food than any other groups...</P>
      <P>He continued:</P>
      <P>Food subsidies are proportionately a very small item in the national budget. It will not break any Minister's calculations to continue them, if necessary, for the next 20 years.</P>
      <P>Further, he continued:</P>
      <P>The previous Government selected three staple items of food, items of basic household expenditure, and decided to limit the subsidies to them .... The fact is the subsidies on the three items I mentioned should be increased in line with inflation.</P>
      <P>He wanted the subsidies increased and expressed the view that they should not be cut for the next 20 years.  The Minister went on to say:</P>
      <P>If the Government meddles stupidly, and unnecessarily, with food subsidies there will be a negative backlash from the trade union movement...</P>
      <P>He continued:</P>
      <P>There is nothing more likely to infuriate the average industrial worker who is currently paying 85 per cent of total income tax receipts than to find that the price he, his wife and family have to pay every Saturday to the baker for bread and the dairyman for milk, will be substantially increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a debate on a motion calling for the <Col N="212" /> restoration of food subsidies and tabled by Deputy Desmond, he said, as reported at column 168 of the Official Report for 17 October 1979:</P>
    <P>... so that the living standards of those most affected by this regressive policy, namely the poor, the elderly, the unemployed, the under-privileged and large families, are not further eroded.</P>
    <P>He continued:</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly about the question of food subsidies.  I think it was a hallmark of the approach of the Government which was socially wrong; it was reflective of a philosophy that I just do not like and could not support and which in the long run will prove to be erroneous.</P>
    <P>In the light of these very strong and apparently sincere views, though I am inclined to put inverted commas around the word sincere at this stage, one wonders what has happened to the social conscience of the Minister for Health and Social Welfare.  The concern he expressed at that time for the poor, the elderly, the unemployed and so on seems to have long since been forgotten and the Minister seems to be more intent now on inflicting as much suffering and hardship as possible on these people.  He seems to be obsessed with inflicting more hardship on the community generally.  We all know his attitude to the health service.  He is tearing apart a health service that has been excellent.  We understand the decision to halve the food subsidies to have been a collective and unanimous decision of the Cabinet.  Consequently, we note that the Labour Party have turned their backs on the promises they made to the electorate.  There must be many free and easy consciences on the Government side of the House.</P>
    <P>Another Deputy who held very strong views on the matter of food subsidies was Deputy Cluskey.  He expressed views which apparently he understood to be the views of those whom he represented. Speaking in this House on 13 March 1979 and as reported at column 1344 of the Official Report, Deputy Cluskey said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="213" /> Possibly it was one of the most anti-children acts committed by any Government over a long number of years.</P>
    <P>He continued:</P>
    <P>... there are tens of thousands of children who even before the removal of food subsidies were not adequately fed.  This act by this Government will ensure that many more thousands of children will go to bed hungry at night...</P>
    <P>I hope that Deputy Cluskey is as concerned about the health and care of young children as he was at that time and that he has not forgotten the poor and the underprivileged.  He, too, will have the opportunity tomorrow evening of showing whether he is consistent.  We will be carefully taking note of his actions tomorrow evening.  No doubt his constituents will be anxious to hear how he votes on this motion.</P>
    <P>I expect that some Members of the Labour Party will try to justify the Government decision and will tell us that the family income supplement will compensate the poor and the underprivileged for the halving of food subsidies.  We know that that will not be the case, that it is merely another attempt by the Government to deceive not only the House but the public generally.  About 32,000 families will benefit from the family income supplement but we know, too, that 460,000 families receive children's allowances.  What is supposed to happen to those 430,000 families who will not be receiving any supplement to offset the removal of food subsidies?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Children's allowances are being increased from £12 to £30.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Government will take some of that back by way of taxation.  Those 430,000 families will not be any better off.  Many of them are on the breadline.  They are finding it impossible to feed their families adequately because of the policies of the Government, because of the policies of people <Col N="214" /> like the Minister for Finance and of the Minister for Health and Social Welfare and because of the failure of the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism to provide jobs.  Many of the families I am talking of belong to the new poor.  They are in addition to those lower-paid workers.  I am talking of those halfway in the middle-income group who are not eligible for any of the State benefits. They are struggling to meet their house mortgage repayments.  They are struggling to meet hire purchase payments on cars which they need to travel to their work.  They are struggling to pay school fees and now they are being asked to pay more for such essential items of food as bread, butter and so on.</P>
      <P>What will the family income supplement do for these unfortunate people? What will it do for those unfortunate enough to be unemployed?  The unemployed labour army have been and will be ignored by the Government when they distribute the famous family income supplement. I wonder is it because the Minister and the Government no longer have any interest in those who have to avail of social welfare benefits.  Is that why he considers them to be ineligible for this supplement?  It is becoming increasingly obvious that it may well be and we all know that this is the first phase of the Government's attack on the poor and underprivileged.  We know, because they have stated in their magic plan, that they are going to get rid of food subsidies altogether before their term in office ends &mdash; that is if they last much longer.  If you are unfortunate enough to lose your job or be on the dole, are members of the Government callous enough to believe that you do not deserve to be fed and that you are not worth feeding?  Are they trying to perform political euthanasia? That may well be the case.</P>

      <P>Deputy McCarthy has kept people busy going through files for him.  I notice he was reading from a prepared script and I am not sure if he found all the quotations himself.  I should like to quote from another document published by his party in 1978.  They said it was not envisaged that food subsidies would become a permanent feature and that the more appropriate approach would appear to be to phase out subsidies over a period of years.  That was published in a Green Paper by the party to which the Deputy belongs so we can all play this game of quoting one another against one another but it does not really achieve very much. The quotations made by the Deputy from debates in this House in 1978 and 1979 took place in a completely different situation from that which prevails now.  The external debt was nothing at that time compared to what now obtains largely because the Taoiseach who took over the leadership of his party and the country at that time did not have the courage to do what he identified in a very well remembered television address as being necessary to take the country's finances in hands at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember seeing that address and I said to myself: &ldquo;I may not particularly agree with this man but at least he knows what is wrong and I think he is going to do something about it&rdquo;.  Whether I agreed with him or not I thought it would be good for the country.  He did nothing about the financial problems which he identified.  Debts piled up and it is the interest on those debts which is now <Col N="216" /> draining away the money from this country which could be used to continue the payment of food subsidies.  Action should have been taken by a responsible government at the time, led by the present leader of the Opposition, followed I presume by Deputy McCarthy, if they had had the courage to do what they knew was necessary.  They did not have the courage to do so and I regret to say that they have no right to criticise the consequences now in terms of Government decisions of their own manifest and cowardly failure to tackle the financial problems in 1979 and 1980 when it was plain as a pikestaff to every government in Europe that we were heading into a recession and that if governments did not take action to trim their sails they would find themselves in a situation where they would be effectively deprived of their economic independence.</P>
    <P>Practically every other government in Europe in the period 1979 and 1980 changed their financial tack.  They abandoned policies of irresponsible borrowing which had characterised governments throughout Europe during the seventies, with one foolish exception, that led by the present leader of the Opposition in this unfortunate country who continued policies, as they do today, which were totally out of date.  The one thing that strikes me as relevant about that party is that it is fighting, as Deputy McCarthy proved, the battles of 1932.  He even dragged up the old age pension issue of the 1932 budget.  Could any party be more out of date, more out of touch with the concerns of the eighties than to have to drag up issues like that to validate their criticisms here?</P>

The party opposite have been perpetrating an irresponsible myth: all the Government need to do is spend more money which will solve the problem.  It is that irresponsible, paternalistic attitude which urges the spending of more money without bothering about where it is coming from, the attitude pursued by Fianna Fáil, not alone in the fifties but in the seventies also, which is the cause of the country's plight today and has made <Col N="218" /> the removal of food subsidies necessary. If the Fianna Fáil Government had taken the necessary action in 1979 or if they had not engaged in an irresponsible policy of trying to spend themselves out of a boom in 1977 we would not need these economies today.  What is happening today is the direct and inexorable consequenses of the cowardly policies of the party opposite during their period of office.</P>

The effect of the regulations made on 1 August 1984, is that the one year rule no longer applies in the case of &ldquo;one-off&rdquo; houses or in a case where an applicant for a grant was precluded from furnishing his application to the Department due to unavoidable delay on his part in obtaining the necessary tax certificate.</P>

      <P>An application for sanction to raise a loan for the provision of a new branch library in Drogheda was received from Louth County Council in 1981.  The application is being considered in conjunction with a number of other applications for loan sanction for library projects.  Due to the heavy demands on available capital for such essential purposes as housing, sanitary services and fire stations, only limited financing can be provided for libraries at present, and this limits the rate at which projects can be released.  It is not possible in this situation to make a specific commitment but I would hope that loan sanction for the Drogheda project can be given reasonably soon.</P>

      <P>I am fully conscious of the economic effects of the use of competing imported building materials not only in relation to the public building programme but also in so far as private building in general is concerned.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are prohibited by the obligations of EC membership from insisting on the use of Irish materials and products in building contracts and for the same reason it is not open to me to refuse to sanction a contract because it is proposed to use imported materials.  However, it has been brought to my notice from time to time that there was a need to ensure that certain imported products used in local authority contracts should be of appropriate standard.  Accordingly, in those cases, I have required local authorities to ensure that only products certified as complying with the relevant Irish standards are used where such standards have been laid down by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  It is, of course, a matter for individual local authorities to take action at local level if they have reasonable doubts about the standard of any products being used in works where they are involved, either financially or otherwise.</P>
      <P>I would also like to say that there is a responsibility within the building industry on designers, specifiers and contractors to ensure that Irish materials generally are not denied a reasonable opportunity of participation and that the design of projects is not such as to preclude the use of Irish materials.  I have communicated my concern in this regard to local authorities.</P>

Any tax which may have been overdeducted from the taxpayer's earnings from the date on which she commenced employment is refundable to her by her employer when the certificate is put into operation.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, in addition to a retirement pension, the taxpayer is also in receipt of a social welfare invalidity pension. Both pensions are chargeable to income tax.  In accordance with standard practice, the aggregate tax-free allowances under PAYE for the current year, 1984-85, are reduced to take account of the social welfare pension which is paid gross, the tax attributable to it being recovered under PAYE from the retirement pension by means of the restricted tax-free allowances.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to determine whether the taxpayer is in receipt of all the tax-free allowances to which he is entitled as he has not submitted fully completed returns of income for a number of years. In the circumstances, the inspector of taxes has issued a 1984-85 return of income to him for completion.  This will enable the appropriate amount of tax-free allowances for that year to be determined.</P>
      <P>Pending receipt of the completed return, his tax-free allowances have been amended to take account of a reduced restriction in respect of his social welfare pension.  An amended certificate of tax-free allowances will be issued shortly. Any tax which may have been overdeducted from the retirement pension since 6 April last is refundable by his former employer on operation of this certificate.</P>

      <P>In 1979 in response to an urgent request from the Revenue Commissioners for additional accommodation, the Commissioners of Public Works rented Elm Court, Cork, it being the most suitable building available having regard to location, space and lease conditions.  The building was designed as open plan and, to meet the needs of the Revenue Commissioners, partitioning and electrical adaptation works were carried out and floor covering was provided.  The total cost of fitting out these offices was £157,608.  The Revenue Commissioners occupied the offices in 1980 and vacated them in August 1984 when their accommodation in the newly erected Government Offices at Sullivans Quay was ready for occupation.  This coincided with an advantageous break in the lease.  Furniture and carpets and other moveable items such as doors, kitchen equipment, etc. were removed for reuse elsewhere. The light fittings are owned by the landlord and thus were not removed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two reservations to be borne in mind in providing the estimates required by the Deputy.  Firstly the Health Services (No. 3) Regulations, 1983, applied to all persons in the 16 to 25 year age group and the information which is readily available applies to persons in that age group.  Secondly information is not readily accessible on the number of persons who would have become entitled to medical cards if the Regulations had not been made.</P>
      <P>Bearing these constraints in mind, it is estimated that the withdrawal of medical cards from the 16 to 25 year age group will save approximately £1.9 million in 1984.  A saving of about £3 million is estimated for 1985.  It might be noted that the greater part of this saving will be offset by increased numbers of persons from other sections of the community becoming entitled to medical cards.</P>

Indeed, it was made quite clear to all health boards that there would be no additional funds available, for the purpose of supplementing the original allocation of any health agency.  Consequently no specific requests for funds for this purpose were received from health boards.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="83" /> Under the legislation governing the supplementary welfare allowances scheme the cost of the scheme is shared between the local authorities and the Department of Social Welfare.  Local authority contributions are paid directly by the local authorities to the health boards who administer the scheme and there is no provision whereby the Department can make payments to health boards in cases where local authorities fail to comply with their statutory obligations under the scheme.</P>
    <P>The provisions relating to the financing of the scheme were amended in the Social Welfare Act, 1983, so as to provide a more equitable sharing of the overall cost of the scheme as between local authorities and the Exchequer.  It is clear however that the system of financing is still not operating in a satisfactory manner and that health boards are in many cases experiencing considerable difficulties in obtaining payments due to them by local authorities in their area.  The situation is being reviewed by the Department concerned with a view to improving the system of financing and ensuring that health boards are adequately funded to carry out their obligations under the scheme.</P>

      <P>The person concerned appealed against the disallowance of his unemployment assistance claim on 10 April 1984.  The appeals officer also decided that his means derived from the profit from his holding and the capital value of a second home exceeded the statutory limit.  He was notified accordingly on 30 May 1984.</P>
      <P>He applied again for a review of his means and the case was referred to a social welfare officer for further investigations. Extensive inquiries were recently completed after which a deciding officer assessed him with means in excess of the statutory limit and he was notified accordingly.

      <P>Two of the conditions for receipt of a contributory old age pension require the person concerned to have <Col N="91" /> contributions paid in respect of at least 156 weeks of insurable employment and to have a yearly average of at least 20 reckonable contributions over the period from the beginning of the 1953 contribution year or from the beginning of the year in which he entered insurance, whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before reaching pension age.  The insurance record under the number supplied in this case shows that the claimant entered into insurable employment in 1973 and that only 60 contributions were paid in respect of him since that time.  He does not, therefore, qualify for old age contributory pension.  A copy of his insurance record has been sent to him.  He was notified of the decision on 4 May 1984. His entitlement to an old age non-contributory pension was also investigated. He also fails to qualify for this pension as his means exceed the statutory limit.</P>

      <P>One of the conditions for receipt of a deserted wife's payment is that a husband must have left his wife of his own volition.  It is the function of a deciding officer to make decisions relating to entitlement based on the information available including the reports of the Department's social welfare officer.  In this case the deciding officer held that the foregoing condition was not satisfied by the person concerned and disallowed her claim.</P>
      <P>The case is being reviewed at present and a social welfare officer will call on the person concerned again at an early date in order to assist in further clarification of the facts surrounding the separation.

      <P>Fuel vouchers for the urban fuel scheme have now been issued to all post offices in the Dublin area by Dublin Corporation which is responsible for administrating this scheme in that area. Persons entitled to vouchers in respect <Col N="102" /> of weeks since 5 October 1984 received them in some cases on 19 October and, if not, will receive them on 26 October. Because of work in connection with a review of the scheme earlier this year by the Department there was some delay in initiating the necessary administrative arrangements for the 1984-85 season.

      <P>The sheep subsidy schemes in operation this year are (1) the 1984 sheep headage scheme in disadvantaged areas and (2) the 1984-85 EEC ewe premium scheme which is open to flock owners in all areas.

Only ewes (including hogget ewes) that have lambed already or are visibly pregnant at inspection will be eligible for 1984-85 premium.  On this basis and apart from the usual winter losses on which premium has never been paid, no reduction in the total amount payable to Ireland should arise.</P>
