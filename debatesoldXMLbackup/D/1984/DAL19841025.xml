      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Orders of Reference of the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism, constituted pursuant to the Order of Dáil Éireann of 6 July, 1983 be amended as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>By the insertion of a new paragraph as follows:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(5)  Subject to the consent of the Minister for the Public Service the Select Committee shall have the power to engage the services of persons with specialist or technical knowledge to assist it.&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to extend the powers of the committee to enable them to engage the services of persons with specialist or technical knowledge to assist them.  The committee welcome the agreement of the Minister and of the House to the extension of these <Col N="482" /> powers.  We on the committee have been very busy and we feel that there are a number of areas with which we could deal more adequately if we had certain consultancies available to us.  One of these, for instance, would relate to the area of parental responsibility which is under discussion at the moment.  We are anxious to have this aspect gone into in some depth.</P>
    <P>There is the question also of people going to prison because of debts and also the problems arising from delays experienced in court and other areas, too, which the committee would like to consider.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the Third Report of the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism: The decriminalisation of certain offences under the Vagrancy Acts.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>To put the motion in perspective, the committee have already brought one report to the Dáil, that was the report on neighbourhood watch.  I am glad to be able to say that we have had very good relations with the Garda in relation to that report and that the pilot studies which the Minister and the Commissioner have been engaging in are going fairly well.  We are anxious that these studies would advance more rapidly during the months ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We consider our first report to have been very valuable.  The report we are talking of today is our third report.  Our second report deals with the role of customs officers in the control of drug trafficking.  That report will be before the <Col N="483" /> House shortly though in a sense it has been before the House to the extent that it was availed of during discussions on the Misuse of Drugs Act.</P>
    <P>We expect a further report, our report on controls on private security firms to be finalised, if not next week, during the following week.  Another report that we will be bringing before the House relates to our visit to Scotland Yard.  In that respect we have prepared a fairly detailed report which we think will be useful to Members.  That, too, will be available next week.</P>
    <P>There are being prepared also by the committee reports on three other areas. One of these is on the matter of drug-related crime.  Members will appreciate that this is a very important area.  It is one the committee considered should receive priority.  We have also almost completed our report on community policing which is the much broader aspect of policing in the community and beyond the narrower concept of neighbourhood policing.  We have brought before the House already our report on the neighbourhood watch system.  We are also studying the question of Garda recruitment and training.  It is in this whole context that we bring this report to the House today.</P>
    <P>I am pleased, as chairman of the committee, to have the opportunity of moving this motion.  I wish to pay tribute to all members of the committee for the effort they are putting into their work and for the forthright way in which they are discussing the problems confronting us.  It is as a result of that attitude that a number of important matters have been highlighted and I am confident that we are making reasonable progress in the various areas.</P>
    <P>The fact that sleeping rough and begging are criminal offences was brought to the immediate attention of the committee by the Simon Community.  In their submission they recommended that these offences be removed from the area of criminal law.  The Simon Community devote their energies to the care and welfare of homeless people.  They are of the view that begging and sleeping rough are <Col N="484" /> in the main social problems and should be dealt with by society in a humane and sympathetic manner.  They estimate that there are about 3,000 homeless in the Twenty-six Counties and a further 1,000 in Northern Ireland.  As no official figures are available it is not possible for us to comment on the Simon figures.  However, the Simon Community meet more than 1,000 homeless people in their night shelters each year, while other homeless can be found sleeping rough or in hostels or other night shelters.  They are found, too, in prisons and in psychiatric units of hospitals.  It is clear from the evidence that the Simon Community put before us that there is a serious problem in this area.</P>
    <P>The Vagrancy Act of 1829 which applies to Ireland contains various provisions in relation to other matters as well as begging and sleeping rough.  The Act provides:</P>
    <P>Every person wandering abroad or placing himself or herself in any public place, street, highway or passage to beg or gather alms or causing or procuring or encouraging any child or children so to do, shall be deemed an idle and disorderly person within the meaning of this Act, and....  Every person wandering abroad and lodging in any barn or out-house, or in any deserted or unoccupied building, or in the open air, or under a tent, or in any cart or wagon not having any visible means of support and not giving a good account of himself or herself... shall be deemed to be a rogue and a vagabond, within the true intent and meaning of this Act.</P>
    <P>Both these offences carry a maximum penalty on first conviction of a fine or three months imprisonment.</P>
    <P>The Garda Commissioner's Report on Crime for 1983 shows that proceedings were taken against 412 people under the Vagrancy Acts.  While begging accounted for 164 proceedings a breakdown of the other offences is not available but it is considered that sleeping rough accounted for a significant proportion.</P>
    <P>It seems that the Simon contention that <Col N="485" /> being homeless is a crime is borne out in that people are being pursued by the Garda under the criminal law.  However, society feels that it must be protected from the activities of persons who beg and sleep rough, especially if this is done persistently.  We are all aware of instances where the Garda do not prosecute people but rather request them to move on and to desist from begging.  While many people may have to beg in order to acquire food, there are others who have some means of support and yet resort to begging.  Some form of sanction must be available to society to deal with offenders who in certain cases cause more than just a visual offence.  Some, by their persistence, can jostle and intimidate people.</P>
    <P>There are many other individuals and organisations involved in helping the homeless.  None of these made any submissions to the committee on this topic and the members felt that it would be very worthwhile to hear what they have to say on this question.  Do they see a problem with the law as it stands at present?  Is it possible that a more discretionary approach to the exercise of the powers under this Act would alleviate the problems encountered at present and yet leave the legislation in existence to cope with the more serious or persistent type of offender?  If any person is interested in letting us have their views they should communicate with the Clerk to the Committee.</P>
    <P>After our meeting with representatives of the Simon Community we began to consider the views they expressed to the committee on the desirability of decriminalising begging and sleeping rough.  We learned that this topic was also under consideration in the Law Reform Commission and that progress had been made towards producing a working paper.  We felt that it would be very useful if the deliberations of this body were available to us before we took a definite line in relation to these offences.  Members of the House generally had asked for views in relation to this area since the question was raised and they were looking for background material.</P>
    <P>With regard to the position in the <Col N="486" /> United Kingdom, the laws relating to vagrancy and other street offences were considered by a Home Office working party on vagrancy and street offences who produced a working paper in 1974 and a report in 1976.  The Home Affairs Committee of the House of Commons using the working paper and report as a starting point, considered this topic, had meetings with the police and organisations for the homeless and produced a report on vagrancy offences in May 1981.</P>
    <P>The position was the same as exists here at present except that in the case of sleeping rough an amending Act in 1935 provides that the defendant must have declined to use free shelter or must have caused damage.  The Home Affairs Committee went on to accept that the criminal law must play a part in controlling the activities of beggars and vagrants.  However, they recommended that the penalty of imprisonment for such offences should be abolished and this was done in the United Kingdom Criminal Justice Act of 1982.  Therefore, the United Kingdom have abolished the penalty of imprisonment for such offenders.</P>
    <P>Because of the fact that the Law Reform Commission are examining this topic the committee decided that it should await the outcome of their deliberations before taking any final decision on the proposal to decriminalise begging and sleeping rough.  Nevertheless, the members are concerned that while there is often a need to remove persons from begging and sleeping rough there should be an alternative to imprisonment.  Some intermediate facilities, such as a hostel, should be available and only in the event of failure to avail of such facilities should resort be had to imprisonment.</P>
    <P>An excellent example of society dealing with these problems, rather than through the criminal law, is the action taken by the Dublin Itinerant Settlement Committee, with the financial support of the Eastern Health Board, to provide accommodation at Trudder House for boys and at Derrlossary for girls in County Wicklow.  The majority of these young people had formerly been begging and sniffing glue in O'Connell Street. <Col N="487" /> They came from broken homes in both the itinerant and settled communities. They have an example by providing facilities and staff and have proved that a number of those glue sniffers and young people who are wandering about and begging, especially in O'Connell Street, can find a new way of life.  This was done first for boys and, very recently, for girls. They have been running this programme for the past few years and it is working very well.  I hope it continues to be successful, although one cannot expect miracles. I have no doubt that this is the direction we should be taking not only in this area but in other social problem areas where people are sleeping rough and begging. These young people now have an opportunity to grow, learn and develop in a positive and constructive environment. The majority no longer constitute a legal problem.  The report also indicates where solutions might be found for many adults who are at present begging and sleeping rough and to whom the Vagrancy Acts can be applied.</P>
    <P>This report is submitted to Dáil Éireann for the information of Members and to provide some background information in relation to the law on this topic as it stands at present.  It will enable Members of either House to be better informed of the position in relation to the offences of begging and sleeping rough if and when such matters arise in either House.  We have left our final conclusions on that matter until we receive the report which we believe will be available shortly from the Law Reform Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> First I should like to welcome this report which arises from a submission made by the Simon Community to the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism.  The report deals with a particular area of the Vagrancy Acts, namely, the effects of the criminal law in so far as it relates to homelessness and vagrancy.  If I might clarify the position &mdash; the Vagrancy Acts, as they are called, are not in general concerned with vagrancy as the term is understood today, <Col N="488" /> but deal to a large extent with conduct which is not particularly associated with homelessness or vagrancy.  For example, section 4 of the Vagrancy Act, 1824, which is the only section of that Act which applies to Ireland, contains offences which are divided into four categories. Firstly, we are primarily concerned with those offences which are committed largely by &ldquo;vagrants&rdquo;, such as wandering abroad without any visible means of support and failing to give a good account of oneself.  The second category includes offences against what used to be called the &ldquo;Poor Law&rdquo; such as failure to maintain your wife and children. Thirdly there are offences committed by professional criminals such as being found in possession of house breaking equipment, and finally, section 4 of the 1824 Act includes offences against public decency and morals.</P>
      <P>In the context of homelessness the offences which have received most public comment are the offences of wandering abroad, or &ldquo;sleeping rough&rdquo; as it is more commonly known, and begging, the latter being contained in the 1847 Vagrancy Act.  The offences of loitering with intent &mdash; until it was held to be unconstitutional in the case of King <i>versus</i> A.G. (1981) Irish Reports &mdash; also aroused public comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had reason to consider these offences on a number of occasions since I became Minister, firstly in the context of a parliamentary question in relation to the Vagrancy Act, 1824, which is at present on the Order Paper of this House, and also in the context of a Private Member's Bill which was introduced in Seanad Éireann and which proposed to repeal certain offences in the 1824 Vagrancy Act.  Without wishing to pre-empt my answer to the parliamentary question I have mentioned, the view that I have formed in relation to the Private Member's Bill is the same as that formed by the Select Committee and expressed in paragraph 4.3 of the report we are now discussing, that is, that as the Law Reform Commission are at present examining the law on vagrancy it would be premature to consider making any <Col N="489" /> changes in the law in this area prior to the receipt of the commission's final recommendations.  Quite an amount of work, I understand, has been done in the commission on the matter and I understand that a revised draft working paper on the Vagrancy Acts is before the commission at present for their consideration.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate the concern of the Simon Community and others in relation to the plight of the homeless &mdash; and I would like to take this opportunity to express my own appreciation of the work of the Simon Community in this area &mdash; their present proposals to decriminalise homelessness and begging have not resulted from the kind of comprehensive review of the law which one can expect the Law Reform Commission to provide. Such a review which would take into account both the social and criminal aspects of the matter would appear to be necessary before embarking on amending legislation.  I know that the committee's view is similar to that.</P>
    <P>Before finishing, I would like to refer to one matter.  The report expresses the view that resort should be had to imprisonment in a sleeping rough case only where a person liable to be charged refuses to avail himself of hostel accommodation. In this connection I would like to advert to the fact that health boards have a responsibility in law to provide institutional assistance for a person who is unable to provide maintenance for himself or his dependants.  This assistance can be in the form, for example, of casual wards, provision of hostels or, alternatively, the giving of grants to voluntary bodies to provide hostels.  There is, however, some overlapping of responsibilities between health boards and housing authorities.  In an effort to clarify their respective roles, an <i>ad-hoc</i> committee was set up some time ago by the Minister for Health, as Deputies will probably be aware.  I understand that the report from this committee is imminent.</P>
    <P>Finally, arising out of a comment by Deputy Woods, the Garda do not maintain separate figures for the different types of offences under the Vagrancy Act.  A random check within the inner <Col N="490" /> Dublin city area, where the majority of sleeping rough offences are committed, revealed that there were no such prosecutions in 1982 and that in 1983 there were eight.  That might help in some way to give an indication of the range of prosecutions and the scope of the problem in that sense.  There is not a large number of sleeping rough prosecutions, from that indication.  The House may be interested to know that in 1983 there were some convictions also for begging.  However, the attention of the House is directed more to the sleeping rough prosecutions than to the others.</P>
    <P>Again I should like to thank the committee. We shall be awaiting with interest the final report of the Law Reform Commission on this subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-West):</i> I should like very much to welcome this report and to thank all those who worked on it, particularly Deputy Woods.  I am very concerned, indeed, at the number of people who are homeless in this city and look forward to the day when they will be able to get a home.</P>
      <P>Many citizens of this city have expressed the same concern as I feel about the number of people begging on the streets, many of whom are itinerants.  They do not come from poor families.  Some are brought in very expensive cars and placed in different positions around the city to collect money.  Not alone do they do that, but many are involved in stealing handbags and intimidating people going about their business.  I hope to see the day when that will end.  You do not see that in any other city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am even more concerned about the number of people who are not homeless but can be seen around the city at evening time and at weekends and who, when you park your car, approach you.  Many do not want to pay them but feel they have no option.  They are afraid that when they come back to their cars they will find them damaged.  I do not know of any other city in the world where this attitude is tolerated.  The Garda and the Minister have a responsibility in this field.  I have <Col N="491" /> brought this to the attention of the Minister's predecessor and of the Garda Commissioner and to date nothing has been done about it.  I understand that the people of whom I am speaking have no authorisation whatsoever from the Garda Síochána or from anybody else to act in that fashion.</P>
    <P>The citizens of this city should be free to come and go, park their cars and go around the city, perhaps shopping, without being intimidated by anybody.  If there is a need for this type of parking service the Garda Síochána or the Minister would appoint people to do it.  In one part of the city one of those people was operating in the middle of the day, directing people to park cars illegally and a traffic warden came along and put tickets on those cars.  That is very unfair to the car owners.  Anybody who comes to visit in a hospital or to attend a social function or a football match in Croke Park should not be approached by such people.  Many visitors are horrified by this.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the streets of Dublin are cleared of these nuisances. If this type of service is required, the Minister and his Department could give authority for its operation.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to see that as far as possible all those who are begging around the city are prevented from so doing and that the Garda take immediate action. There is also the high rate of pickpocketing, with organised gangs operating and posing a very difficult job for the Garda. More plain clothes gardaí should be put on the beat to try to eliminate this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The committee have spent a good deal of time considering a number of different matters and this is one of the reports which they have issued. I regret to say, as vice-chairman of the committee, that this is probably one of the weakest, and perhaps will be the weakest, to come from the committee. This is mainly because of the lack of submissions from bodies other than the Simon Community and because of the <Col N="492" /> absence of the Law Reform Commission's report.  We are all awaiting this report.  Perhaps if the Law Reform Commission did not get themselves caught up so much in banning foreign divorce, for example, and gave more attention to some more immediate problems such as vagrancy and begging, we would be able to proceed here with legislation to deal with this important area.</P>
      <P>The report is urgently needed and I put out a plea to the Law Reform Commission to bring it forward.  With that report and the submissions which have been received, we will have the legislative requirements to deal with this area.</P>
      <P>There is a problem with begging in the Dublin area.  It has been remarked on by many foreign visitors, mainly Americans. Sometimes also one meets people when abroad and one is told that one of the things recalled about Dublin is the number of people begging on the streets, which can be very embarrassing.</P>
      <P>I do not want to come down on anybody who is in need.  However, my experience, from people who come to my clinic, is that the State have the machinery to assist them through supplementary assistance, if not through the social welfare system.  In many cases it is an abuse because many of the people who are begging are not in financial need.  It is a type of business income which is organised, in some cases by the parents of very young children.</P>
      <P>This is a very distasteful area to get into and it is not a very pleasant area to look at, but we must deal with it fairly. It is very easy to come in here and condemn all those who are begging, but when we try to give these people premanancy within the community by some form of settlement, by trying to integrate them into the community and by getting them to change their social behaviour, the Deputies who have very definite views about begging are the same people who will resist any form of settlement of these people in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise there are many people begging on the streets of Dublin who should be stopped because it is not a case of poverty, but if we want to stop parents <Col N="493" /> sending their children out begging, we must try to integrate these families into the community.  That means settlements, halting sites, and having these children attending school with our children.  The Deputies who want the beggars off the streets are the most vociferous in resisting itinerant settlements in any part of their constituencies.  If we are not prepared to have settlements and halting sites in our communities we cannot expect these people to become integrated in our community.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the offence of loitering with intent was unconstitutional. That is a sad fact because one of our biggest problems outside the inner city is the gangs of youths, who are neither homeless nor vagrant, congregating, abusing and intimidating women and children, and particularly old people, and the Garda do not have the power to move them on.  These gangs congregating at certain points are regular occurrences. We had the teddyboys and the punks era and then things settled down.  The offence of loitering with intent was found to be unconstitutional at a time when the population had settled down.  We should look at this area again because it would be a great help if a garda could tell a group to move on.  This would mean that we would not need to take these people before the courts.  This could be a very effective way of dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>I do not see the point in imprisoning people who are homeless.  This is simply providing them with a place at great expense when we should be providing for them at a much lower cost.  The committee asked if this offence should be decriminalised.  I think it should, except if it is an offence which endangers somebody, or is an offence against decency, against children or something like that. Prison is not the place for the homeless.</P>
    <P>I suggest that somebody in the Department and the clerk of the Select Committee of the Dáil prepare an index of these reports.  There is no point in the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism making a series of reports; hopefully another report will come before the House next week.  If we had <Col N="494" /> an index of these reports we could request information on progress which has been made and when we want to see what action has been taken in specific areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the report. This committee have devoted a lot of time to preparing this report.  They have covered community watch, drug-related crimes and so on.  This is another report which will be welcomed by the House. The committee were wise to wait until the Law Reform Commission had examined this problem and their report was made known.  With so many people identified as homeless, this is of great concern to all, particularly legislators who are very involved in taking decisions to deal with that problem.</P>
      <P>Many groups and organisations are playing their part on behalf of the homeless and they must be complimented.  This is a growing problem and many reasons can be given for that &mdash; people have opted out of society, broken homes, children who have left home, separated parents, problems which result from excessive drinking and so on.  Society in general is affected in one way or another by the problem of the homeless.  One can walk down any street in our larger cities and one will find people begging on the streets, lying on the ground, hats in front of them, looking for money.  This is a sad sight.  It could be said that it is an indictment on each and every one of us that this problem exists.  Unemployment is another contributory factor.  How do we deal with the problem?  We had very welcome submissions from the Simon Community, but all the other agencies and association which are playing their part in dealing with the homeless should get together and submit a report to establish and identify the size of this problem.</P>
      <P>The committee were wise to await the outcome of the working party report of the Law Reform Commission.  Any views submitted to us will help us to make our final report.  Our committee have done a great deal of work.  We met right through the summer recess but our work is not finished with this report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="495" /> Drugs are a major problem.  Sometimes it is said the problem applies only to the larger cities but it also affects the urban areas.  Many of the people who are begging on our streets are doing so to get money for drugs.  We must be concerned that children as young as nine years of age have been begging on the streets of Cork.  Many of these nine year olds to 12 year olds travel by train from Dublin and this is where the responsibility of parents come in.  Some of those chidren were itinerant children.</P>
    <P>I am glad the report sets out the importance for us as a community of tackling the problem.  We must try to improve the lot of the homeless and the people classified in this report as beggars.  For many of them prison is not the answer. The Garda sometimes find that there is no place for them to go but prison.  I feel sorry for the Garda Síochána in such situations.  It has happened that when people were taken to prison they could not be admitted because there was no room.  The problem is exacerbated by taking many young people to court.</P>
    <P>This report will be welcomed by all.  I hope that at a later date the committee will bring forward a more comprehensive report so that the community will realise it is also their problem.  The homeless are people like ourselves who, for one reason or another, have opted out of society. Many of them come from broken homes. We must be sensitive about the way we approach the problem.  For the majority prison has not been the answer.  It is an indictment of us that so many young people are put into prison because there is no other place for them.  We must consider seriously the building of hostels and institutions where these people could be given the necessary care and attention. Of course I realise that there are people who commit crime and the law must take its course but there are others who, through no fault of their own, have drifted into begging.  These people need our help and we must let them see we do not regard them as outcasts.  Progress has been made in many areas of life but we seem to have fallen down with regard to <Col N="496" /> these people.  I welcome the report and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L.T. Cosgrave Mr. L.T. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other speakers in welcoming the report.  While it may be somewhat lightweight with regard to recommendations I hope the fact that it has been brought before the House will highlight a problem that has become particularly acute in a time of recession.  By discussing it in this House I hope there will develop a deeper awareness in the public that something must be done.</P>
      <P>We are looking at an Act that is 116 years old and it is not before time that there was some review of it and its implications. We are only too well aware of the problem, particularly in our larger cities, of people who are homeless and those who are loitering and begging. Many of them have fallen on hard times and they have accepted this way of life as their lot but there are also the more organised people who beg and who, although not homeless, loiter for one reason or another.  All of us know of the children who beg in O'Connell Street.  Some of them are there of their own will begging for money, and at times they go further than begging and approach people with a view to relieving them of their wallet or handbag but some of them have been sent to O'Connell Street by their parents.  We have to consider where these parents are and also whether it is an organised campaign.</P>
      <P>Basically the problem is a social one. As the Minister said, at times there is overlapping between housing authorities and health boards and some people seem to fall between the two.  The health boards seem to think it is the responsibility of the housing authority and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee have been somewhat light with regard to recommendations but various aspects had to be considered. There was a submission from the Simon Community and that was quite useful.  I hope that at a future date we will have further submissions from other bodies and there is also the expected report from the Law Reform Commission.  I hope that <Col N="497" /> the committee will be able at a future date to come forward with more definite proposals for the Minister's attention.</P>
    <P>It is not easy to have definite legislation for this area.  Many practical things can be done.  In general we are not talking about people who are criminals in the accepted sense of the word.  We are talking about people who generally like to keep to themselves.  Sometimes they may be rather a nuisance if they have had a few drinks too many or if they wander around looking for money but generally they are not a great threat to society.  To a certain extent it is clear that fines or imprisonment is not the answer for fairly practical reasons.  Unless it is a very minor fine the people concerned will not be able to pay it and they will probably end up in prison.  While imprisonment may take them off the streets for the night we cannot forget that our prisons are overcrowded.</P>
    <P>Most people think those who have committed real crimes and who are a menace and a threat to society should be put away rather than these people. Unfortunately due to the problem of overcrowding, prisoners have been getting out of jail a day or two after they were sentenced to quite long prison terms.  It has implications for the Garda who have taken weeks and months to put a case together when they see that Joe Bloggs who was sentenced the previous day is back in the area and ready to resume his career as a criminal.</P>
    <P>Imprisonment should be a measure of last resort.  We have to consider supplementing the help we give to the various bodies like the Simon Community.  I should like to pay a special tribute to the Simon Community for the tremendous work they do.  They give great assistance to many people who might otherwise die. We must listen to what these voluntary bodies are saying to us.  They have many good points to make.  They are experts in the field and they know the practical difficulties.  We want to look after these people to the best of our ability and, in order to do so, we need to give practical help to the various voluntary bodies if we are to succeed in tackling the problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="498" /> It has been suggested that a person on a minimum social welfare payment cannot afford to stay in a hostel or indeed to keep himself.  Perhaps some low cost national hostels should be provided.  This possibility has to be examined.  I welcome the report, weak as it may be.  It is necessary at this stage to give further consideration to the problem.  I hope the various reports which this committee have made will be acted upon.  Mention was made of the necessity for control on security firms. These are practical every day problems which may not be the largest problems facing us in comparison with our growing crime problem.  I hope that when we look at these reports in six or 12 months or in two years, we will be able to say they were acted upon by the Government.  If the committee system is to be a success there is no point in leaving their reports to gather dust on the shelf.  It is important that when the work is done and the problems are outlined, action is taken by the relevant Ministers, by the Government and by the House.</P>
    <P>To a certain extent the committees have been a success.  Their true success will be judged on the benefit they are to the public either in saving taxpayers' money or in creating a better environment for us all.  As I said, I welcome the report.  It is important that we listen to the various bodies.  The Minister mentioned a report due shortly from the Department of Health.  It is clear that in some cases there is either an overlapping or a falling short in the roles of the respective bodies whether they are local authorities or health boards.  We have to do something practical for homeless people and about the problem of begging.  We must give practical help to the bodies whose main work is to assist these people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to endorse the statement made by our chairman, Deputy Woods, and to align myself with the other members of the committee who have spoken in support of the decriminalisation of certain offences under the Vagrancy Act.  Society response to the problem of vagrancy has been inadequate in that we have not tackled the cause of <Col N="499" /> the problem, but rather punished unfortunate victims who cannot fend for themselves. The pure capitalist system is a filter system producing a colander effect, with the fittest staying in and the remainder dropping to the bottom.  The problems thus created have been left to voluntary and religious groups to pick up the pieces.  Society chooses to ignore the problem, hoping it will go away.  As it becomes more consumer orientated and selfish, it does not want to be bothered with the victims of this system who are very often the feeble, the weak, and the sick.</P>
      <P>In the submission's comparison between the years 1898 to 1956 under the category, living on prostitutes' earnings there were no prosecutions since 1898 because it was classed as not applicable. There were no prosecutions in 1956 whereas, under the category, gaming, there were 38 proseuctions in 1898 and in 1956 it was classed as &ldquo;not applicable&rdquo;. It is suggested that these two categories should be transferred to the criminal law. In a case of the offence of living on prostitutes earnings I suggest that a very severe penalty such as that handed down to drug pushers should be applicable.  It is proposed that gaming, which is regarded as an offence under the Vagrancy Act, should also be transferred to the criminal code.</P>
      <P>The modern form of gaming would be equivalent to gaming machines and lotteries and I regret to see that it is the intention of the Government to allow a lottery under the recently published national plan.  I would regard this as a retrograde step mainly because, in my view, the Government would be entering an area which was formerly considered to be of a criminal nature and the effects it would have on people, on gambling here generally, and on the poor in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will reserve my detailed comments on that for the Bill when it is submitted but I should like to say that lottery is another form of taxing the poor.  It is not the wealthy who buy lottery tickets and the table of the wealthy is not depleted if <Col N="500" /> tickets are purchased.  It is the poor, the helpless and hopeless who speculate money allocated for food and other essentials on lottery tickets.  As the prize increases so will the amount speculated. If, for example, tickets are sold for £1 each and the prize rises to £1 million in any one draw, then the odds are one million to one.  Certainly, no regular punter or, indeed, the wealthy who are usually also the educated, will take a chance at those odds.  It is again back to the poor.  I will be urging the Government to steer clear of that course of action.</P>
    <P>We leave many of our social problems to religious and voluntary groups.  Education is a good example.  People who are not able to fend for themselves have been left aside.  The hostels do a good job but they do not have the necessary means and the support of the community.  As people become more comfortable in their standard of living they are less likely to help others who are less fortunate.  The more consumer orientated they become the less they become involved in their neighbours' problems and hence we have a broken down society which we are trying to patch up.  We are not going the right way about it.  We do not seem to tackle the causes very well.</P>
    <P>The committee's proposal is a modest one.  I agree with Deputy Woods that the committee is working extremely hard and as a cohesive unit.  It has an important role to play and a heavy programme ahead.  I hope the Minister will take into consideration these submissions and others which will come in the future.  I would wish to include in my remarks our excellent secretary, Mr. Brady, who has done an excellent job for us.</P>
    <P>Regarding the problems mentioned in the Simon Community submission, it seems very clear that the community welfare officers will not pay those who are sleeping out.  Different approaches are taken to people who sleep out or beg. Very often they are regarded as an eyesore by other members of the community. As society continues to drive past and ignore the homeless or those begging, the problem remains unsolved.  We have left <Col N="501" /> it to the Garda to perform a very unpleasant task which I am sure they are not keen to perform except that it is part of their duty.  I am sure they would prefer society to solve the problem rather than pass it to them.  These problems are conveniently ignored by people who are in a more comfortable position than these unfortunates.  They drive through from wealthy areas to poorer areas with their eyes closed to the problems and they do not like to meet these people in the street or passing over O'Connell Bridge because it reminds them of society's &mdash; and consequently their own &mdash; responsibility to its less fortunate members.</P>
    <P>There is reason to believe that some of the begging is contrived.  Nevertheless it is extraordinary that people should go so far as to say that these people should not be supported because they are well off, as if Members here would be willing to exchange places with them.  Such comments are made frequently about people on social welfare or drawing the dole.  It is said that they are almost as well off as those who are working.  This is an unfair and ridiculous comparison made daily by people who should know better.  Even if people do manage to get some form of support from social welfare it will not make them comfortable or, by any stretch of the imagination, well off.  They will still be struggling to survive, existing instead of living.</P>
    <P>We should work towards the objective of wiping out vagrancy from our society. The way to do it is to improve facilities and amenities, create employment prospects, to improve the standard of living and to become involved.  It would take very little effort on behalf of the community, even on a voluntary basis, to get rid of it.  I am not suggesting that the finger be pointed at the Government or at any Government Department.  It is society's responsibility, but it is conveniently ignored.  The better off people prefer to go home, watch colour television or drink pints of Smithwicks in a lounge bar and watch plenty of sport. They ignore the homeless, the drug problem and the problems of youth.  They do not become involved in their local youth <Col N="502" /> club or scout organisation.  With the youngest population in Europe &mdash; 50 per cent being under the age of 25/30 &mdash; the problems are compounding on a daily basis.  This will eventually bring down the standard of living which the better off people already enjoy.</P>
    <P>It is opportune that this proposal should be submitted to the House.  It gives us time to reflect on it in the light of the Law Commission's impending report. It is also an indication of what select committees can usefully do in ferretting out problems in our society and bringing them before the Legislature.  I hope we will address the problem and solve it in the near future.</P>
    <P>Drink and homelessness are tied up together and this fact is mentioned in the report.  The Simon Community refer to regular, heavy drinkers as people who need medical attention and who should not therefore come under the vagrancy laws and be subject to terms of imprisonment. This is an area we are inclined to ignore.  People are beginning to realise that it is a very serious problem which needs urgent attention.</P>
    <P>I am sorry for the Government that less revenue has been generated due to the falling off in drinking but nevertheless I am delighted at the social improvements for families and the consequent improvement in health and welfare, which do result in savings for the State.  I am not so sure that it is a good idea to reduce the prices &mdash; I see questions on the Order Paper asking to have them reduced &mdash; if we gain more revenue as a result of more people drinking.  Drink is a problem especially with young people who eventually can end up on the streets and be subject to these laws.  Certainly we will have a healthier society if we have less pressure on people to drink.  I welcome the new sense of responsibility that has come about in the last number of years which is the real cause of the reduction in drinking, and the price has nothing to do with that.</P>
    <P>As a public representative I realise that the homeless are not generally eligible for public housing.  This is not a simple problem.  I know from experience that <Col N="503" /> there is a tendency for people deliberately to live in caravans or cars or on the side of the road in order to get some form of housing.  Generally in the Dublin area at least the health board or the local authority try to supply them with some form of accommodation.  Usually it is not a house; it is likely to be a flat and not always in the most desirable of areas, but it is a form of solution.  One weak point here which Deputy Cosgrave mentioned is that there are not many suggestions as to how to solve the problem.  There are some small hostels with back-up services but they are very few.  In this area a big improvement could be brought about with a very small amount of money.</P>
    <P>Visitors to our shores do not understand why they see children begging on the streets.  I was standing at a presbytery on St. Stephen's Green one day when an American came up and asked the housekeeper to take in a lady who had a child with her and who was begging.  He wanted the housekeeper to do something for her because he could not understand why this was happening in this society.  Of course, the housekeeper was nonplussed and did not really know what to do.  We continue to ignore this not very taxing but enormous problem.  We should decriminalise the vagrancy laws in such instances and then set about attacking the problem finally.</P>
    <P>I had the unusual experience in the last year, which I doubt if any other Member of the House has had, of bringing a delegation to the Minister for the Environment to ask him to hurry up the allocation of moneys for the setting up of an itinerant site in the Blanchardstown area because the community there were anxious to get their allocation of itinerants that had been agreed by the county council for different parts of Dublin. They had prepared schooling and creches and had obtained volunteers to help to get the itinerants housed quickly and attending school and to help to integrate them into the community.  It took two years for the Department to respond and the county council to provide the money and the site.  At last it has been done, but <Col N="504" /> it shows that if people are prepared to tackle the problem they can solve it if they put their minds to helping the less unfortunate neighbours and friends.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to dwell too long on this, but I appeal to members of the public to become involved in youth clubs.  It is almost impossible to get adults to supervise youth clubs.  Many problems result from children being unsupervised.  Perhaps the children come from broken homes, the parents are out at work or they are in communities and areas where there are very few facilities and the result is that they have no properly supervised activities.  My experience has taught me that while people are willing to contribute money towards projects and youth clubs, very often they are not willing to contribute their time for transport or supervision or becoming involved for half an hour, an hour or a night a week.  I ask people to think carefully about that because it is one reason for the problems of vandalism, crime and drugs.</P>
    <P>One reason for removing these laws would be that they would not be used at all as a last resort or a fall back on which to charge a person.  Accepting the submission to be made by the commission, we would do everybody a favour if we get rid of these laws.</P>
    <P>The document &ldquo;Why the Vagrancy Laws of 1824 Must be Repealed&rdquo; produced by the Simon Community says, and I quote:</P>
    <P>These offences are the product of the social conditions of the poor and destitute.  They are absolutely inevitable so long as the homeless cannot get housing or social welfare.  The term `vagrancy' is offensive.  Homeless people are simply ordinary people with an acute accommodation problem. They are not wild, aggressive lunatics who must be locked up &mdash; an image which the term vagrant reinforces.</P>
    <P>They are often unemployable, uneducated, maybe drop-outs, people who have temporarily lost their way in life, who perhaps cannot cope and do not understand what is happening to them <Col N="505" /> particularly when they are taken into court, locked up or put in a room.  That must be an awful, claustrophobic, terrifying experience, and one can understand why very often they end up talking to themselves sitting in some back alley or on a park bench or walking around with their total possessions on their bodies, perhaps several overcoats or bags like the women in New York.  Generally they are gentle people who need help and on whom society has turned its back in its quest for consumerism, comfort and high standards of living.  These people do not represent something that we want to push down the back streets or to cover up because it is too uncomfortable for us to look at.  The answer to the problem is to help these people and the resources required for that are not very great.  In conclusion I should like to quote what the Simon Community said:</P>
    <P>To repeal the Vagrancy Act would be a small measure of justice for a much oppressed group of Irish society. It would be a statement that the problems of the homeless were at last being recognised.  It would remove the stigma of medieval laws on people who need help, not condemnation.  It would be a small but significant measure of social reform in the direction of humane and civilised values.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution on this third report of the committee regarding the decriminalisation of certain offences under the Vagrancy Act will be brief. One good thing about the report is that it brings to the attention of all Members the existence of the type of people referred to in it.  Those people exist in spite of the fact that we live in a relatively affluent society.  The problem seems to have increased and been exacerbated by modern living conditions rather than being improved.  One has only to walk through any of our cities or towns during the day or at night and see the number of children begging and the many destitute middle-aged people who are sleeping <Col N="506" /> rough to realise the extent of the problem. The report rightly suggests the decriminalisation of certain aspects of the problems that arise from their situation. With regard to the begging offence it is felt that the law is to some extent a deterrent and that is as it should be.  The problem is that alongside begging there are associated problems such as drug-taking and the possibility of falling into a way of life which is completely undesirable for young children.  Naturally, it follows in many cases that these children end up taking drugs and sleeping rough. Ultimately, they fall into poor health. They are a sad reflection on our society and our way of life.  I do not know what visitors to our shores think when they see such sights, particularly in the capital city.</P>
      <P>I accept that various organisations such as the Simon Community have done tremendous work for these people but there is a need to do a little more.  The health boards are very involved also in assisting such people.  The report deals also with housing.  One of the reasons for many of these problems relates to social attitudes. The problem does not arise necessarily from any intention on the part of the people concerned to become criminals but is as a result of the conditions into which they are born and in which they live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of housing the report points out that five or six local authorities will not consider rehousing able-bodied single people because, under the terms of reference of those authorities, such people are not considered eligible for rehousing.  That is sad and that should be looked at.  I accept that some local authorities had another look at that matter.  It is quite simple and relatively inexpensive to house such people in a semi-permanent location by way of a chalet or what is commonly known as a demountable dwelling.  Such accommodation has been provided in many counties and has proved very effective.  The homeless individual who may have lost all hope of owning a home of his own has been given a place to return to each night. <Col N="507" /> If more local authorities provided such accommodation, and the matter was pursued by health boards, it would be one method of alleviating the problem of homelessness for such people who are not considered eligible for local authority housing by virtue of their status.  I have had to deal with this problem on a number of occasions but the local authority I was concerned with were prepared to resolve the problem.  That good example should be taken up by more local authorities.</P>
    <P>The report also deals with the question of the unfortunate individuals found disorderly while drunk in a public place.  In fact, as the report points out, it is not possible for such people to be disorderly while drunk in a private place by virtue of the fact that they do not have a fixed abode.  It is interesting to note the cost to the State when a person convicted of disorderly behaviour while drunk is sentenced to a week in prison.  According to the report the cost of transferring such people from one place to another and detaining them in prison for three days is £1,000.  The law in regard to such cases is in need of review.  That sum of £1,000 would be better spent in providing facilities through the Simon Community, health boards or the other voluntary organisations concerned about the poor and destitute.  If the money was spent through those organisations it would help to eliminate the problem rather than wasting it on an attempt to carry out a penalty which is irrelevant as far as helping those individuals is concerned.</P>
    <P>Reference was made in the report, in regard to those found sleeping rough, to two categories of persons.  We are all aware of those who are harmless and do not cause a disturbance to anybody. There are others who, by virtue of the severity of their problem, become somewhat offensive and a nuisance to people. More resources should be allocated to monitor the problems of such people and ensure that the young are not allowed to sleep rough for too long or get into an environment where drug-taking, wine drinking and so on are encouraged.  That <Col N="508" /> sequence should be interrupted by some corrective influence through the health boards or some other social service.  It is essential to interrupt the sequence by some agency rather than to leave it to the criminal law because, though the criminal law can impose penalties, it cannot reduce the problem or discourage people from falling into that pattern.  Ultimately, of course, the criminal law can do much to improve the general situation.  I thank the committee for their report.  It is to be hoped that their recommendations will be noted so that we legislators will be able to help to bring the process of decriminalisation into the 20th century.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the committee which considered the proposals of the Simon Community I fully endorse the views expressed in the report.  I will make just a few comments on the proposal that the sanction of imprisonment be removed for begging and sleeping rough.  The committee observed that people can be sent to prison for three months for first offences.  No information has been furnished as to the extent to which this sanction has been used, either imprisonment or fines.</P>
      <P>I have had a look at the Garda Commissioner's Report for 1983 which showed that 115 persons were convicted of such offences and a further 126 were convicted of other offences under the Vagrancy Act.  The report did not give any indication of the penalties imposed by the courts for the offences because the courts do not publish any details.  It has not been possible to obtain statistics in regard to these cases, and when statistics are available from the courts they cover different periods.  In that year the figures were for 1 August to 31 July.  That is completely different from the calendar year used by the Garda Commissioner and by the prison authorities.  However, I have been able to ascertain the numbers sent to prison for begging and sleeping rough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit it is time that the treatment of crime would become streamlined so that the three groups involved, the <Col N="509" /> Garda, the courts and the Department, would come together to provide a comprehensive approach to what is happening today.  Other voluntary groups, including the probation service and the new community service group should all become involved in this.  I realise it must be a long term objective but I recommend that the Minister for Justice would be enabled to make a start in this matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan has spoken about section 2 (9) of the Vagrancy Act.  Apparently people can be without food or shelter and yet be ignored by local authorities.  This is a very sad reflection on our society.  Local authorities have an obligation to provide accommodation for all homeless people.  Dublin Corporation have as a policy the practice of placing single people who are homeless and over 50 years of age on the general housing list and if there is medical or social evidence in support of their case they will possibly be rehoused in low priority accommodation.  I am pleased to inform the House, that following representations from the Simon Community, Dublin Corporation have agreed to reserve 50 flats initially of housing stock in high demand areas for single homeless people who are recommended by the Eastern Health Board or hostel personnel.  This is a direct move by the housing authorities to play their part in housing single people who need it.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the Simon Community and others involved in assisting and giving shelter to homeless people. Those who work with those organisations are a shining example of man's humanity to man.  They must be encouraged and supported.  Though I do not support people who beg in the streets, I would draw a distinction between those who beg and those who seek alms.  Late at night, when I meet an old person, lady or gentlemen, who is seeking alms for a night's shelter I see in them a reflection of my Creator.  Unfortunately we have to wait for the Law Reform Commission report. I hope the report will take all those things into account so that the small number of people who through no fault of their own <Col N="510" /> cannot provide accommodation for themselves will be looked after.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make only four brief points.  The report has a number of references to ways in which this problem could be solved.  First of all, one must ask where the buck stops.  Essential responsibility, apparently, is not assigned to any one Department or agency.  The report states that the recognition of homelessness is shifted from health boards to local authorities and back to the health boards. At present it is too easy for all of us to say it is not our problem, and to pass the buck to somebody else.  Until that essential administrative statutory responsibility is given definitely to one area it will continue to be far too easy for all of us to slide out of this responsibility, which is what I call this Irish apartheid.</P>
      <P>The Vagrancy Act, 1824, needs to be updated.  Section 4 of that Act states:</P>
      <P>Every person wandering abroad and lodging in any barn or out-house, or in any deserted or unoccupied building, or in the open air, or under a tent, or in any cart or wagon ... and not giving a good account of himself or herself ... Every person found in or upon any dwelling house, warehouse, coachhouse, stable or out-house or in any enclosed yard, garden, or area, for any unlawful purpose ... shall be deemed to be a rogue and a vagabond, within the true intent and meaning of this Act.</P>
      <P>I can see the whiskery magistrate of the peace pounding his desk at the unfortunate scraps of humanity dragged before him daily in a different era and age.  That is not appropriate legislation for what I hope is the relatively enlightened and civilised approach we should have towards the difficulties of our brothers and sisters.  I hope the report will act as a launching pad for changing the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In case it might be said that the report of the Law Reform Commission is awaited, that is a strategy, and it does not absolve us of responsibility for doing what is right.  I used to think at one time that commissions and bodies were set up <Col N="511" /> to allow Governments to have a satisfactory holding answer while they preoccupied themselves with the day-to-day fire brigade action which unfortunately constitutes so much of government in these difficult times.  It is not a way of avoiding responsibility.  Regardless of the Law Reform Commission's report there is a problem today and a need for urgent action.  If the action of other Governments following the publication of other reports by the Law Reform Commission is anything to go by, I am not too impressed about the likelihood of urgent action following the report which is pending though I have no doubt that there is goodwill on the part of the Minister involved.  I would not like anyone to believe that as soon as the Law Reform Commission report the sun will shine on a bright new dawn for travelling people.</P>
    <P>The committee's report states at paragraph 4.2:</P>
    <P>The Committee are aware that there are a number of other persons and organisations who take an active interest in the welfare of the homeless. However, none of these individuals or groups have made a case to the Committee. The Committee would be very anxious to obtain the views of persons involved with the homeless on the question of whether the offences of begging and sleeping rough should be removed from the scope of the criminal law.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the chairman of the committee might elaborate on that.  I am surprised that none of these individuals or groups made a case to the committee.  I do not know if they were asked individually or if they just failed to respond.  I am aware that there is a great deal of public handwringing about this area but when it is boiled down there is not a lot of commitment by a fair number of people although there are honourable exceptions.  These have been already mentioned.  It is obligatory on groups and individuals who have repeatedly expressed concern and interest to co-operate fully with the committee in their work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="512" /> I wish to make a positive suggestion to the committee which they might consider. We are dealing with a very difficult problem.  It has been part of our history and national psyche for centuries.  At one time the Irish race were vagrants of one kind or another.  We find it hard to prise ourselves away from that.  We have a residue of problems which must be handled sensitively and carefully.  I would be the last person to rush in with an urgent, administrative solution to what is a fundamental problem affecting people's attitudes, mentality and culture.</P>
    <P>If we are to make a real start at solving the problem we shall have to deal with the root of the problem.  We must try to wean the young people away from a lifestyle which, by common consent, will not allow them to fulfil their human potential and robs society of the contribution they could make.  How can we wean them away if that is accepted as a reasonable approach?  One of the difficulties is the mobility of the people.  It should be possible, however, for schools in selected and specified places to have a curriculum specifically designed to cope with the problems of travelling children.  The committee could consider the possibility of paying a small grant which would relate directly to the attendance of young children in those schools for specified periods. We should encourage, by economic means if necessary, sending these children to school.  An ordinary school would be alien to their background and culture. It would not be satisfactory or fulfilling for them.  They need a school where their needs &mdash; nutritional needs, clothing and so on &mdash; could be dealt with in a sensitive way.  They could begin to learn that there is a road out of their present morass.  They could come in contact with the world of learning, books and self-respect and all the things which make us different from the animal.</P>
    <P>We could show them that there is hope for them and a systematic way in which they can be taken care of.  I am not talking about bludgeoning, threatening or intimidating them but about winning their confidence and showing them we respect them as people.  A whole new world could <Col N="513" /> be opened up to them by encouraging their attendance in the educational milieu however it is structured.</P>
    <P>I spoke to an itinerant person who had a problem and I referred him to an agency which would help him.  He told me he did not know how to find his way to the agency and I told him to go down such and such a street.  He said he could not read the street signs.  This came as a shock to me because we do not think in those terms.  We are dealing with a huge problem and it must be dealt with at many levels.  We must win the hearts and minds of young people and show them that there is a better way of life for them and that we are caring enough to structure our educational requirements to ensure they can enter into them, be comfortable and become better people.  If we can win this generation, the problems of future generations will solve themselves.  I offer those points to the committee with respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a problem in relation to the question of begging in our streets.  We have submissions made by the Simon Community who are concerned about a particular type of individual known as vagrants &mdash; that is a word they would like to see changed &mdash; and popularly known as winos as opposed to itinerant families who beg from tourists and other people outside of hotels and so on.  It is important to separate the kind of problems each possesses.  After 77 years it is necessary to change some of the laws relating to vagrancy.  The people known as winos must be catered for and it is important that there should be proper institutions for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tribute has been paid to the Simon Community for the work they are doing and the deeply sincere way they feel about this problem.  In relation to the question of begging no longer being a crime, that would be a retrograde step. This is one of the biggest problems we <Col N="514" /> have to face in our streets.  Not so long ago a 14 year old girl was robbed by some itinerant children.  She had a bag of sweets in her hand and they snatched it away from her.  She went after them and got her bag of sweets back.  She was lucky that she was not badly beaten up.  One of the deepest hurts I felt occurred one day when I was sitting in my car at St. Stephen's Green.  A little itinerant child who looked no more than ten or 11 years old &mdash; the child might have been older because the growth of many of them is stunted &mdash; asked me for money.  I asked him if he was hungry and he said he was. I then got out of my car, went into a shop and brought a bar of chocolate which I gave to the child.  However, as I was getting into my car he flung the chocolate at me, shouting that he wanted money. Obviously he had been left in the area to do a job &mdash; to beg for money.  We must be very careful when considering the whole question of the decriminalisation of certain offences under the Vagrancy Act so that we do not allow a situation to arise in which we give further licence to many of these itinerants to go into the city centre and hold people up to ransom. We must strike a balance as between the &ldquo;wino&rdquo; and the itinerant.</P>
    <P>I am on the Joint Itinerant Settlement Committee of Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation so I am fully aware of the efforts being made by those bodies in this area.  It is all very well to be very charitable in what we have to say about itinerants and other homeless people but there are some who would take full advantage of any change in the laws on vagrancy.  That is why I am issuing a warning to the committee to be very careful in their deliberations on this question. I hold the philosophy that one should never turn away someone who asks for help.  Deputy Keating was in a position to be able to direct to a suitable place the person who asked him for help. As the Deputy has told us, in that case the person was unable to read.  Not many people would be aware of where to direct such a person.  They would probably direct them to the nearest church.  Great credit is due to those people in the various <Col N="515" /> presbyteries for the work they do for those who seek help there.  I wish the committee well in their deliberations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank those Members who have contributed to the debate.  I could spend a lot of time discussing the various points that have been raised but, while that would take up a lot of time of the House, those points will be before the committee in their deliberations.  We look forward to the early publication of the report of the Law Reform Commission.</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe referred to itinerant children being sent into the city for the purpose of begging for money.  This can be related to the instances I outlined concerning glue sniffing.  It brings us to the point raised by a number of Deputies &mdash; considering each group in the sense that each present their own problems.  There is no simple solution to those problems. They are not problems that the law can deal with simply or effectively.  When the group of glue sniffers were investigated it was found that the reasons for their being in that situation were all different. Some of them being dropped off at a certain time of the day and left to collect money which in turn was collected from them at a later stage.  This illustrates the importance of the work done by the Itinerant Settlement Committee.  It led to giving some of these people a new lease of life and a means of developing their lives but that resulted solely from a recognition of what was happening.  There are enormous social problems involved as well as legal problems in contacting the children and affording them some care without that being a compulsory kind of care.  It is only by teasing out the various problems that solutions can be found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Keating accepted that the Act needs up-dating.  I am sure most people would agree.  The committee have advertised for submissions and they engaged also in contacting personally some of the people concerned.  Some of these people seem to be in a better position than others to respond to such contacts.  The Simon Community have put forward some very <Col N="516" /> good and well-prepared submissions.  We had some difficulty in relation to submissions from the Garda.  There was one period during which the Commissioner was not sure as to what he could talk to us about.  However, we have obtained the views of the Garda so that matter has been resolved.  There is now no problem in relation to the availability of the Garda at private sessions of the committee.</P>
    <P>Our aim has been to highlight the facts and to encourage people to put forward their views.  We in the committee are strongly of the opinion that there should be an alternative to imprisonment.  We believe that the use of any form of imprisonment should only be resorted to after the failure of the people concerned to avail of whatever facilities can be provided.</P>
    <P>The Garda are obliged to enforce the law as they find it.  If they find someone wandering at night without resources they are obliged to take him to the Garda station but having done that they are obliged to follow the case through and bring it to the courts.  The irony of this is that by providing a person with a warm bed and a dry cell for the night the Garda are caring for them in a way in which the statutory caring agencies are not.  There have been many instances in which the Simon Community have secured the help and co-operation of the Garda but in which some institutions have refused help.  Therefore, there is a very good relationship between the Garda and Simon Community workers.</P>
    <P>So far as the committee are concerned, the question of providing intermediate facilities is very urgent, whether these be in the form of hostels, homes or any other.  I have referred to the two separate facilities that have been provided in Wicklow for glue sniffers and which are working extremely well.  There was a difficulty in co-ordinating the response of the different agencies.  That point has been highlighted here this morning.  The Minister has admitted that this is a problem and has expressed the hope that the <i>ad hoc</i> committee set up by the Minister for Health and involving the health boards and housing authorities will bring <Col N="517" /> forward some solutions in this area.  From the contributions from all sides of the House it is clear that there is a need for a very strong co-ordination of the effort. Perhaps it is in this respect that so many of the well-intentioned plans fall.  It is very obvious in such cases as the settlement of itinerants.  I have been involved in such a scheme in my own constituency and I find repeatedly that the lack of resources and of people, too, to continue the job is a real problem.  The will is there but the need is so great that there must be resources to deal with the problem and people must be given the support which they need.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the decisions taken by Dublin County Council recently in relation to the provision of sites but, even if you have the sites, if you do not provide the back-up and follow-up by way of resources and people, it will be difficult to overcome the problems.  It is clear in a high percentage of these problems that if you provide the resources and the back-up you will get very good results.  I was very interested in Deputy Skelly's remarks concerning his constituency.  He said they were very anxious to provide facilities but that it took two years to have an itinerant community and to do the integration work which was needed.  There is a danger that the support which is needed will not be provided and that is something to which this <i>ad hoc</i> committee might direct their attention.  If the help is forthcoming then we can set standards here which people in other countries might be envious of because we have had a variety of experiments in this area which have been very good and far-seeing, even to the extent of providing teachers to travel with the itinerants to ensure that their young people were educated.  We have been quite far-seeing in relation to our trials and the efforts we are making.  However, we do not have sufficient follow through, back-up and continuity.</P>
    <P>I welcome the comments made by Deputies here this morning and the emphasis laid on the need to co-ordinate the work of local authorities and health boards.  Several comments were made <Col N="518" /> about the role of the voluntary agencies in this area and the very important work they perform.  The Simon Community were mentioned and everyone seemed to be very impressed by their work.  There are also other voluntary organisations working in this area.  We should recognise that they have a very important part to play in society and we should not deplore the fact that too much work is left to voluntary and religious groups.  Voluntary groups can make a special contribution in this area but they need to be supported.  As Minister for Health in 1982, I set up the National Community Development Agency in an effort to give support to these groups.  That followed long debates in the House about poverty and the supports which were needed.  We managed to make substantial funds available to that group, £2.25 million at that time.  That agency was disbanded by the incoming Government and there is a proposal now to have a poverty agency but two years have elapsed since then.  It does not matter what we call the agency as long as we have one which gets on with the job and have the resources to do so. I am very anxious to see a new poverty agency getting under way and giving support to groups like the Simon Community which got very substantial support from the extra money which was voted at the time.  They can do a great deal of work if they have the resources for specific projects.</P>
    <P>We eagerly await the report of the Law Reform Commission.  We were reluctant to finalise our views without seeing it and I think the Minister accepted that we needed to see it.  We hope we have provided an updating of the position in relation to this area and that it will be of help to the Members of the House in any discussions which take place.  One of our functions is to update the position and to make information available to Members of the House which, in turn, will help them in arriving at decisions.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Gay Mitchell who suggested that we should keep an index of these reports which would enable us to monitor them.  I am very glad he mentioned that point because it is very <Col N="519" /> important and should be part of the normal procedure of the committee. With regard to the question of neighbourhood watch, we had a very useful report which has been accepted by all parties involved but pilot studies are still going on and it is necessary that the committee would report back to the House in the near future as to how development is going.  The report could then be updated and its progress monitored.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the many aspects which were brought up by Deputies here this morning give an opportunity for a much more lengthy response but I am aware that there is another committee report to be discussed.  I should like to thank the Deputies who contributed in the House and I should like to thank those who contributed to the preparation of the report.  I should particularly like to thank the clerk to our committee, Mr. Frank Brady, who has given valuable assistance. Perhaps these people are not thanked often enough in the House.  We have taken note of the points made by Members here and will bear them in mind.</P>

    <P>I am happy to introduce this first annual progress report which summarises briefly the committee's work and activities since our first meeting in September 1983 up to the end of last month.  The report has an index at the back which provides a brief sketch of the many and varied topics discussed and touched upon by the committee during that time.

    <P>The challenge facing this committee working on behalf of the Dáil is a major one involving the review and assessment of virtually all the moneys spent by the State on Government Departments and offices as well as the related non-commercial State-sponsored bodies, a total of almost 60 different agencies.  This process of review and examination is leading and will continue to lead to recommendations on how such bodies can be made more efficient and cost effective and, conversely, how wasteful or obsolete expenditure may be eliminated.  Every year, hundreds of millions of pounds are spent on a variety of programmes of public expenditure.  This is public money, raised through various forms of taxation, and there is a growing conviction among the public, professional commentators and Members of this House, that the public and the State may not be getting the best value for money in many of these cases. The work of our committee, therefore, on behalf of Dáil Éireann, is vital in assessing whether such programmes of public expenditure are justified, whether they are effective if so justified, whether other cost effective alternatives which would meet the objectives of Government policy might be possible and in general to ensure that the public and the Dáil are convinced beyond any reasonable doubt that the public's money is being spent in the best and most efficient manner possible.</P>
    <P>To give an indication of the scale of the problem, let us consider that in the past seven years the proportion of Ireland's GNP taken up by public expenditure has risen from 46 per cent in 1977 to an estimated 62 per cent in 1984.  This year total public expenditure is estimated at almost £9,000 million, being £7,000 million on current expenditure and almost £2,000 million on capital expenditure. This represents a figure of approximately £2,600 for each person in the country.  Obviously a reasonable target, <Col N="521" /> say an improvement in efficiency of a small percentage, whether 1 per cent or 10 per cent, would result in extraordinarily large savings in net terms over a period of years.  For example, an efficiency improvement of 1 per cent on total public expenditure would result in net savings of some £90 million.</P>
    <P>The targets the committee are setting are reasonable and attainable and, with goodwill all round, can be achieved.  The massive problem of public liability which is such a great burden need not necessarily be dealt with by automatic, arbitrary cutbacks but by significant qualitative improvements in value for money.  We can save hundreds of millions if we pursue that concept and all the evidence we have managed to glean in this first tentative year of our existence points in that direction.</P>
    <P>This year £2,376 million will be spent by the Exchequer on pay.  In addition, about £314 million will be paid by local authorities, plus unknown sums by other public bodies, on non-Exchequer financed pay bills.  This total does not include certain other sums which relate to other commercial State-sponsored bodies which do not fall within the jurisdiction of our committee.  These figures show not only the huge levels of public expenditure in these areas but also give an indication of the size of the task which confronts this committee and the House and an indication of the benefits which can be achieved if we pursue reasonable targets in a logical fashion.  We have set ourselves realistic targets so that all Departments, offices and State-sponsored bodies will have been subject to review individually and in depth over a five-year period.  We do not underestimate the size of this task and we are determined to achieve the goals we have set ourselves, using the best methods available to us and without fear of comment on any recommendations we see fit to write into our reports.  This is the first such major review in the history of the State and I hope it will be successful. We are getting extraordinarly willing co-operation from virtually everybody with <Col N="522" /> whom we are coming in contact.  This augurs well.</P>
    <P>For the public generally there is no clear understanding of what public expenditure is truly about.  People see a massive tax bill and they hear about foreign borrowing and public expenditure but to the man in the street there is not automatically a clear understanding of what is involved.  Our committee have thought about this problem and one of the suggestions is that we should try to communicate to the public at large the true cost of public expenditure by the publication of some pamphlet or leaflet setting out clearly in simple language the name and description of each public expenditue progamme and its cost to the State.</P>
    <P>A more dramatic and effective option might be the regular publication of the true cost of all the services which the State provides.  If the local authority tenant, the person receiving mortgage interest tax relief or receiving hospital service benefits knew the true cost as well as the net discounted cost which we all pay, they would clearly understand that the common expression that they are paying a lot of tax and getting nothing for it is simply untrue.  The Government must win the active support and co-operation of the public and the public service administration.  Public education is vital in that area.</P>
    <P>The money being paid out is partly acquired through taxation and partly through borrowing.  In 1984 alone the financing of current expenditure arises from the following percentages: 75.7 per cent from tax revenue, 15.4 per cent from borrowing and 8.9 per cent from non-tax revenue.  Obviously the huge amount raised in tax revenue is a continuing source of concern to the Minister for Finance and the Government as well as the public at large and we are suggesting that a serious onslaught on whatever inefficiency exists or on lack of cost effectiveness will yield all kinds of results, economic, social and political.  The money is spent in a vareity of ways which can also be improved in some cases, but <Col N="523" /> that is not a matter about which the committee are automatically concerned, except to say that it may mean that there will be effectively more money to spend and less need for taxation which, as the Government have clearly outlined, is at maximum levels.</P>
    <P>The work of the committee has proceeded satisfactorily over the past 12 months and we are pleased at progress to date.  That is not to say that we are by any means satisfied that we have worked hard or long enough, but it is a beginning. One of our first tasks was to set about a methodology for an approach to our work.  We adopted a course of action which is set out in detail in our brief annual report.  We decided that the committee would operate principally on two levels and that the main emphasis would be on a detailed consideration and evaluation of all major policy areas of public expenditure and the Departments and relevant State-sponsored bodies, judging the expenditure of those bodies on rational and consistent criteria which apply wherever the normal person or private sector institution spends money.  There would be systematic evaluation of what a programme is about, whether it is necessary, how best to achieve specific results and monitor and evaluate the expenditure. Secondly, we decided to consider specific expenditure items or policies which would arise in the normal course of our work.  These items could be and have been suggested by members of the committee or by members of the public or by other economic commentators.  This process has worked quite satisfactorily to date.  We have been involved in a very wide span of inquiry during the initial months and there has been a very large volume of inquiries of varying degrees of importance or immediacy embarked on in one form or another.  Naturally this involved the committee in many hundreds of contacts with Government Departments and State-sponsored bodies and a flow of corresponsence of one kind or another with private sector organisations and members of the public.</P>
    <P>The committee initiated a detailed <Col N="524" /> analysis of key issues affecting all of the Government Departments and the related State-sponsored bodies.  A systematic analysis of departmental spending and the structures and processes underlying that expenditure has been embarked upon.  We are pleased to be able to report progress on almost all of these inquiries, to have made a number of specific reports already to Dáil Éireann and to be able to say that many of these inquiries embarked upon will be coming to fruition over the next six months.</P>
    <P>During that time detailed and intensive assessment of inquiries set in train with Government Departments and agencies will come onstream.  This arises from the fact that the general systematic approach we adopted was to devise a standard questionnaire which, if responded to by Departments and State-sponsored bodies, would indicate whether key systems were in place, key values of processes were in operation and if we had a 100 per cent response to that inquiry.  The results are being evaluated at present and they indicate where there may be need for urgent examination or review and whether some Departments are more up to date than others.</P>
    <P>During this year the committee have met each Tuesday and this has meant that the work programme we set ourselves is largely on target.  At this point, I would like to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the vice-chairman of the committee, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, and the other members who, given their very busy work schedules, have attended the meetings of the Committee on Public Expenditure on such a regular basis, and the attendance record is available for anyone who wants to see it.  Without their collective assistance it would not have been possible to deal with the volume of business which was laid before the committee at these weekly meetings.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress that despite all those meetings and all that activity, I have yet to hear a party note struck at any of those meetings. That is a tribute to my colleagues on the committee and augurs well for the value of our work.  It also <Col N="525" /> underlines the fact that, as concerned citizens and public representatives, once we have managed to leave this gold fish bowl we are able to get down sensibly and logically to the major work and challenges facing our committee.</P>
    <P>Between November 1983 and February last the committee examined the recruitment procedures of the Civil Service Commission and the Local Appointments Commission.  The report, which was the first to be laid before the Dáil by this committee, highlighted an unacceptable situation whereby costly competitions were held for thousands of applicants for jobs in the public sector while in some cases the actual numbers of vacancies filled was in single figures. As a result of our recommendations the Minister for the Public Service, Deputy John Boland, decided to curtail the number of civil service competitions planned for 1984 on the basis that successful applicants were already available from earlier competitions.  He also accepted other specific recommendations in that report.  That was the first obvious example where tangible savings were effected directly from the intervention of the Committee on Public Expenditure.</P>
    <P>Our second report was laid before the Dáil last May and was entitled &ldquo;Proposal to Establish a Centralised State Agency for Persons Registering for Employment or Training&rdquo;.  This pointed to the need for immediate rationalisation of the multitude of Government Departments and State agencies involved in overlapping and duplicating in the areas of recruitment, training and employment.  The committee felt that there was clearly a need to find out exactly, firstly, what services were being provided by the various institutions under those headings; secondly, what liaison or co-ordination, if any, existed between them; and, thirdly, we were anxious to identify avoidable duplication of those services with a view to eliminating waste in terms of staff and financial resources as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The committee took evidence over several meetings from senior officials from the appropriate Departments and I would <Col N="526" /> like to put on record appreciation for the courteous and co-operative manner in which the many officials involved readily provided information on which we based our second report.  We confirmed that there was fragmentation, duplication and a lack of co-ordination of services for employment and training and this has led to a waste of public expenditure at the time when, as we all know, there are unprecedented demands on taxpayers and the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The committee's recommendations in the report implied some fairly radical changes and improvements which we felt must be implemented to ensure that the most up to date services are available for people who may be seeking training and employment and that they would be provided in a cost effective manner.  We have introduced a mechanism whereby the relevant Department, office or State-sponsored body will after an agreed period have to come back to the committee to report progress on action taken to implement the committee's recommendations, although we do not see it as our job to actually pursue the implementation of recommendations.  Our job is to report to the Dáil and it is the job of the Government of the day to take whatever action they deem appropriate.  However, we are not merely interested in placing the recommendations in this House, we will be asking what happened to them after a certain period.  There were eight specific recommendations on improvements and training in that report and they are available in summary in our annual report.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year the committee decided to undertake an investigation into suggestions that the Office of Public Works' present system of acquisition of accommodation for Government Departments and offices was inefficient and wasteful of public expenditure.  We heard evidence from senior officials of the Office of Public Works who are directly involved in that area.  These officials were extremely co-operative and forthcoming.  A detailed report is in the later stages of preparation.  I believe it will provide material on which future policy could usefully be based and will <Col N="527" /> result in a more cost efficient way of approaching that problem which this year involves a sum in excess of £100 million. I am subject to correction on this, but I think the budget for the Office of Public Works this year is of the order of £130 million and a fair amount of that money will be spent on the question of leasing versus rental of accommodation.</P>
    <P>We also received numerous submissions from organisations and members of the public on matters related to the work of the Committee on Public Expenditure. These submissions are dealt with individually by the committee.  This is a fairly slow process.  The question raised in those submissions are taken up with the relevant Department or State body, the correspondence is then brought before the committee and is pursued appropriately. If necessary, we invite departmental or other officials to talk to us and answer queries and seek further elaboration from them.  The process ensures that the views of the general public on any area of public expenditure will be brought to the attention of the committee and, where appropriate, the concerns expressed in such correspondence will be incorporated in the formal reviews or hearing of evidence when the particular Department or State-sponsored body examination is under way.</P>
    <P>The relationship between the officials who come before us and the committee is very important.  We have had nothing but goodwill from the people who came to us.  In some cases these officials may even have done themselves a disservice by responding with such alacrity to our invitation that they did not have ample opportunity to adequately brief themselves. I want to put on the record that the goodwill of the officials in the Departments is fundamental to the quality of our work.  I want to stress that what we are trying to do is to join with them and the Members of this House to improve the quality of public expenditure and their active involvement and co-operation is sought.  Any public servant who feels that any act or omission by us disadvantages them from participating in that <Col N="528" /> role could have a word with us, privately if they wish.  They would find a ready acceptance of their views.  We see our job as helping these officials to improve systems, not to act as an external watchdog hounding recalcitrant people into improvement.  The active co-operation of departmental officials is vital and they will find a ready agreement from the committee for any reasonable suggestion they make as to a <i>modus operandi</i> for pursuing queries to mutual advantage.</P>
    <P>We depend to a large degree on the goodwill and co-operation of these officials. It is important to state that we are aware that the administrators are implementing policies laid down by Ministers and the Government collectively.  Nevertheless there is an onus on the administrators to ensure that all aspects of public expenditure are controlled rigidly in the interests of the public at large.  In other words, it is not good enough to say that that is a matter for the Minister or the Government of the day.  Surely it would not be suggested that the lack of control, for example, in the area of capital projects is simply the Minister's responsibility. We would probably argue that accounting officers, secretaries of Departments and senior management should take an active role if they have not been doing so &mdash; and I am sure they have in many cases &mdash; and do everything in their power to ensure that public expenditure is not wasted.  I am aware that civil servants are expected to advise Ministers and not simply to wait passively for decisions from above.  If they foresee waste of public expenditure or if they believe it is a possibility it is their duty to say this to their Minister.  That kind of active involvement and co-operation will lead to good results.</P>
    <P>Mention of capital projects brings to mind the fact that the committee have been concerned about major cost overruns on a number of capital projects. Because of the lack of evidence of any real control on capital projects &mdash; a frightening statement in itself &mdash; it has been decided to establish a sub-committee of our committee to examine this area as a matter of urgency.  It is expected <Col N="529" /> that this sub-committee will report back to us within the next two months after which a report will be drawn up and laid before the Dáil.  There is significant room for improvement in this area and I hope in due course that will find voice in the report that will come before the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The areas we have tried to deal with in the past 12 months are indexed at the back of our report.  May I take the liberty of suggesting to other committees that this is a useful device that committees might employ in building up a ready reference for people who may wish to have access to the work of the committees of this House who are doing useful work.</P>
    <P>At our request the Department of the Public Service are arranging for the introduction of a system whereby civil servants will be able to convey constructive suggestions on public expenditure to the committee.  This type of scheme would complement the suggestions and submissions received from the public during the past year.  The purpose is to involve civil servants in working out the proper solutions to the problem.  In many cases they are the people on the spot, who know where inefficiencies or deficiencies arise. Their insight and wisdom is extremely valuable and that must be used in an active way for the benefit of all. Accordingly, the moves being considered by the Department of the Public Service at our request are a step in that direction.</P>
    <P>Our committee are also working on a proposal to introduce an award scheme with a view to encouraging the submission of original papers or theses on subjects of relevance to the committee's work.  Again, this is an attempt to inform and educate the public and to create an understanding about what is implicit in public expenditure.</P>
    <P>We have also been considering the question of establishing contact with a voluntary group of people in the private sector who would be willing to give the benefit of their views and expertise on aspects of public expenditure from time to time.  I think the value of such an arrangement would be that the committee would have access to the collective <Col N="530" /> opinions and advice of those in the private sector who have practical experience of achieving value for money in the day-to-day operation of their businesses.  We hope to clarify the methodology to be used in the very near future and I expect that access to such expert advice will be available early in the new year.  The purpose of this is not merely to help us in our work but to afford an opportunity to those in the private sector who regularly lecture us &mdash; if I may use that word in the nicest way &mdash; on how to run the affairs of State.  Our committee will afford an opportunity and an outlet for such initiative, imagination and wisdom.  We are considering how best that could be done as, for instance, by way of a sub-committee or an adjunct to our committee, working privately to us and to whom we might refer certain issues.  In that context perhaps I should stress that the concerns of Government Departments are very different in nature from the areas of concern to the private sector but there are some similarities in approach and in terms of the systems that would be employed.</P>
    <P>During the year we touched on the question of the need for someone to take on responsibility, perhaps on a formal basis, for looking at public expenditure in a systematic way.  Whether that would be the Comptroller and Auditor General or the Department of the Public Service is a matter of conjecture but it is an area where there seems to be an omission.  I am pleased to say there has been a growing and good liaison with the Committee of Public Accounts.  In the beginning there were obviously some difficulties in clearly delineating the terms of reference and ensuring that there was no overlapping or duplication in our work but that was to be expected with the committee in train for only a few months.  However, I am pleased to say we have established a liaison with that committee on a regular basis.  Regular meetings of an informal nature take place between the chairman of that committee and myself.  The earlier difficulties have been eradicated and we are working jointly to ensure that the <Col N="531" /> terms of reference of our respective committees are being pursued.  That work will be of use to the House and to the country in due course.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased to say that the committee have already established contacts with a number of similar committees in the EEC and in other countries.  The value of such contacts will be that we can learn from an exchange of views of what steps are being taken to control public expenditure in those countries, what systems they have employed and how we could benefit from work they have done where there might be similarities of approach and where there could be lessons we might learn.  That dialogue is useful and could lead to significant efficiencies in our own work instead of forcing us in some cases to re-invent the wheel every time we want to have an investigation.</P>
    <P>The spirit in which the committee have pursued their work has been in all cases to assert our desire to help and, in conjunction and co-operation with public servants, to bring about whatever improvements may be possible.  We believe it is vital to have the active support and co-operation of the public service and I should like to place on record our most grateful appreciation of the co-operation and courtesy which has been extended to us by all of those members of the public service with whom contact has been made in the past year.  That spirit augurs well for the future work and reports of this committee.</P>
    <P>The question of relationships is a matter to which we shall be giving our attention.  It does not mean that there will not be differences of opinion about the recommendations in our reports.  In fact, I would be very concerned if I found that reports from our committee were universally acclaimed by all Government Departments and State-sponsored bodies.  I would think that perhaps we had been doing something wrong.  At the same time, it is important to ensure there is mutual respect and that is a principle we shall be pursuing.  So far we have got nothing but co-operation from such <Col N="532" /> people and it augurs well for the future. On behalf of the committee I should like to pay tribute to the clerk to the committee, Mr. Paddy Judge&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that when we were dealing with the other motion this morning mention was made of officials who are civil servants. Wisdom indicates that it is preferable not to mention civil servants in the House, whether in a complimentary or derogatory way &mdash; lest they might become the subject of controversy in the House.  That would be undesirable and not in keeping with the traditions of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>While respecting what the Chair has said, I agree with the chairman of the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I respect what the Chair has said.  One of the problems we have come across in our work is the question of morale in the public service, of people who do not have clear targets or goals and who see no ready response for extraordinary achievement or outstanding effort, the corollary being that there is no particular sanction imposed if they do not do their job.  It is a symptom of that that apparently we are disposed not even to refer to official work.  In itself that is a problem.  These men and women are entitled to credit and to reward where it is due and to be dealt with in the opposite way when that is due.  Until such time as we can show public servants that we do not see them simply as robots in the way they do their work but as human beings with rights and obligations we will have a problem.</P>
      <P>Our committee can do a lot of work.  I want to put in this <i>caveat</i> or marker at this stage.  I am not sure that we are adequately staffed or have the resources to do so bearing in mind the extraordinary span of our work.  At this point I am not asking for more staff.  Basically we are trying to undertake an enormous volume of work with a staff of three people.  That imposes its own constraints. I am not complaining at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have made a reasonable start.  We intend to pursue our work with vigour <Col N="533" /> and we hope the results will be of use and benefit to the House, the Government and the country at large.  I should like to thank everybody who has made our work a pleasure thus far.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There will not be many points of controversy if any at all between the chairman and myself in our comments on this report.  As he indicated during the course of a very objective and detailed address, that has been the basis on which all of us on the committee have approached our task as public representatives and as delegates from this House trying to discharge the responsibilities which Members of Parliament have.</P>
      <P>The Chairman touched on the first point I want to make.  We have had the experience, if only on a preliminary basis, of the operations of similar committees in other countries.  While we are pleased with the progress we have been able to make, it is quite clear that Committees on Public Expenditure scrutiny, or control, or review in any other country in the EEC have very much more authority, power and functions than we enjoy at the moment.  Perhaps that is understandable in view of the fact that we have been established for a little over a year only.</P>
      <P>If we as Members of Parliament are to develop that role as effectively as we should, and not just as rubber stamps on odd occasions here, on budget votes or matters of that kind, when we all go predictably one way or the other on such matters as food subsidies, we must develop this committee and committees like it to a greater extent.  I understand why the chairman is not looking for extra staff at this stage.  Those of us who serve on these committees should be given such extra support as we require.  There is a glaring difference between the Opposition and Ministers who have available to them the resources of their Departments, scriptwriters, advisers, experts and personal constituency officers.  I am not moaning.  There is a difference between a Minister in that position and a spokesman for the Opposition serving on these committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have one full-time clerk-typist.  I <Col N="534" /> recruit another from my own resources. With an even-handed approach we must have sufficient support to enable public representatives to do what all of us want to do, that is, to develop the committee system.  This work should not be in conflict with the other roles or obligations which we have.  I was scribbling in my office for the past hour-and-a-half trying to prepare for this very important debate. That is not the way it should be.  We should all have available to us experts, research advisers and scriptwriters.  This would enable Deputies, like Ministers, to have a script prepared to be handed out to the press.  Until such time as we get that, the committee system, which I believe is a great new beginning &mdash; and I acknowledge that it was introduced by the Minister, Deputy Bruton &mdash; will never develop to the point we all desire. That would be a matter of great regret.</P>
    <P>I am not pleading for extra staff for the committee &mdash; we have been able to call on assistance from time to time &mdash; but for a recognition that extra resources are necessary for Members of the House to enable them to discharge their role on all the new committees which are emerging and to ensure that when we are at committee meetings someone else will be attending to other business.</P>
    <P>The chairman is right.  We met in plenary session for three hours at least each week and in sub-committee sessions for another two or three hours perhaps.  We have various consultations with people who were preparing reports for us, sometimes over lunch.  Today there is some such arrangement and the chairman will have to leave the House.  Unfortunately I will not be able to attend.</P>
    <P>The whole thing is time-consuming. None of us wants in any way to compromise the very important role of those committees by not having the time or the services.  At the moment we are being stretched to the limit.  I hope that in everything that is planned in terms of the development of the committees it will not be just a case of saying we must have more staff.  We must also recognise the reality that the members of the Government can call on 150, 200 or 250 people <Col N="535" /> to advise them, to prepare documents and whatever else is required, and also to do constituency work.  Members on the other side of the House have not got that balance.  Unless we get it, the committee system is at risk of not developing.</P>
    <P>I represented the committee at a meeting of Committees on Public Expenditure in Rome which was initiated at the instigation of the Italian Chamber of Deputies. It was quite clear from the discussions we had there that in other parliaments they see the role of the committees as of vital importance.  There is not a notion that we represent the public service in the same way as there is sometimes the notion that the public service represent Ministers.  Here there is an opportunity for Deputies in a very reasoned manner to question, to tease out and to criticise, if necessary, actions taken at executive level, or expenditure incurred in the course of administration, or as a consequence of a political decision.  It is vitally important that we insist that that should continue.</P>
    <P>I want to make three or four general points before dealing with some specifics which will illustrate the nature of the work we have undertaken.  One of the significant things to emerge in general terms is that for the first time we have a contact point between the public service and Members of Parliament.  We have an opportunity to meet them face to face and question the basis of advice they have given, to question whether the proposals or procedures they pursue are in the best interests of the control of public expenditure, in terms of leasing office accommodation, or the preparation of a prison development programme.</P>
    <P>For the first time we can now actually meet these people man to man, face to face, flesh to flesh so to speak, instead of the faceless bureaucracy which has in a sense been sheltering behind the Minister in his corporate role.  That is not a healthy way for democracy to function &mdash; that we could not get to the people who made recommendations to Ministers, if not decisions.  Meeting these people has been <Col N="536" /> a development welcomed in this committee, not just by us but unless I am mistaken by a great majority of the public servants.</P>
    <P>It is not just a question of our having the opportunity of criticising the public service.  Equally, what we must encourage in this committee is that public servants would, in a very healthy and outspoken way, also tell us where we, because of our political pressures or response to political moods, create conditions that they find incur extra public expenditure over and above what they would normally recommend.  I hope that we are beginning to recognise that it is a two way process.  There have been already some examples from our committee. Sometimes we may be criticising the public service for undue expenditure and sometimes they can point to the fact that it may have been political decisions perhaps, in the best sense of political, that have given rise to an overrun on proposals which they had made.</P>
    <P>What is emerging from all this is that we are all not just concerned about the amount of money being spent but are particularly concerned &mdash; as the public servants are &mdash; about the quality of the service for the money that is spent. Understandably, having regard to the growth of public expenditure a feeling is rapidly growing abroad that the only focus should be on the amount of the public expenditure programme.  What we have attempted to do, and this will emerge very clearly for those who have had the time to read our various reports, is to look at the quality of the service, particularly where there are overlaps, and there are many; where there is duplication, and there is very much; where there are unnecessary and inappropriate structures, and there is much example of that.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that this is not just an opportunity to attack civil servants or public servants.  That would be a great mistake.  Rather is it an opportunity to give to those who serve in the public service a challenge, a climate and a role that will make their work more meaningful, their jobs more satisfying and in turn <Col N="537" /> evoke from the public perhaps a healthier attitude to the public service.  Up to the moment it must be said that there is a tendency outside to look on all civil servants as living in a cold, dispassionate, unconcerned climate and sheltering behind the Minister in every sense, cloaking and concealing their own responsibilities behind those of the Minister.  What we are entering on here is a beginning, at least, of a change of that pattern which has existed for some considerable time.</P>
    <P>I welcome this whole general development. I would break down into two separate categories the issues we have been considering over the last 12 months.  In the first we could clearly identify areas where in the normal course of administration or, if one wished to put it another way, in the course of bureacratic management, there have been cost overruns that would not be normally a matter of which the Minister of a particular Department would be aware&mdash;and I am not speaking about any particular Government here &mdash; but nonetheless of which he as manager with first responsibility should be aware.  There have been numerous examples of that.  I am talking here about management decisions within the Civil Service incurring great cost overruns.  For instance, there is the question of office accommodation in the Office of Public Works.  It is clear that the procedures applied have been applied by that office over a considerable time.  I do not suggest that those who have had responsibility as Ministers for, or Ministers of State for, Finance have sheltered from their responsibilities but this area is one in which the practices and procedures of the Office of Public Works have cost the State a very considerable amount of money.  The second example is in relation to telephones, although that now is the responsibility of Bord Telecom Éireann. Having listened to the officials from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, we hope what has been said by them will be taken on board by the new Department.</P>
    <P>We have seen examples in the committee where there have been very major losses to the Department, frankly because of the reallocation of personnel <Col N="538" /> from one section to another.  We have seen losses in 1982, for example losses from the public telephone kiosks as great as £1.9 million out of a total of £7.6 million, with receipts at £5.7 million. That shortfall is unaccounted for because of reallocation of personnel due to what may be seen as the public service embargo, or other factors.  That kind of money which should be coming into the public purse is, in fact, unaccounted for and lost to it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Civil Service Commission, of which Deputy Coveney is a very constant and active member, it was not until such time as our committee actually decided to inquire into it, that the absolute necessity for all the interviews, examinations, arrangements and programmes for recruitment into the public service as carried out over the last number of years was questioned, having regard to circumstances in recent time. These appear to be administrative decisions. There have also been consequences of political decisions and in those situations it is not the public servants who should have to come before our committee, but rather the Ministers who are responsible at any particular time, now or in the future, who should be questioned as to why certain cost overruns have arisen.</P>
    <P>The prison development programme had got much publicity for what was given as £12.4 million spent on consultancy fees for paper prisons, as somebody said.  It was not the officials of the Department of Justice who cancelled the prison development programme, it was the Government and the Minister for Finance.  I am not sure if it was the Minister present in the House, but he would be fairly familiar with the matter, who decided in the Government cutbacks to cancel the programmes already sanctioned at an earlier stage.  If we find that £12.4 million expenditure, why should it be the officials of a Department who acted on the instructions of the Minister of the day who should explain to our committee and acknowledge such expenditure on site preparation and consultancy fees when, <Col N="539" /> overhead, the Minister decides to cutback that four point prison development programme, at least for the moment?  In my view, it is sorely needed.  The moneys so far spent will, to some extent, be wasted.</P>
    <P>We have mentioned decentralisation already.  Very considerable sums were expended in consultancy fees.  We have not got conclusions on this and I mention it as an example.  Very considerable sums were spent on consultancy, site acquisition and so on, and when a further decision is taken to cancel all of that I hope it will not be the public servants who will be blamed for that wasteful expenditure for buildings which never surfaced in the final analysis.</P>
    <P>I come to an issue which I am glad to have an opportunity of addressing for the first time in the House to the Minister responsible: the strategy for foreign borrowing which gives rise, whatever way it works, either to a reduction of interest charges or capital repayments, or as in this year a very considerable increase in the burden which the taxpayer to whom we are accountable in this House must meet.  That is a decision for which the Minister for Finance at any one time is responsible and it seems that in that kind of area the Minister for Finance should be answerable, not the representatives, unless and until it appears that the representatives themselves will take these decisions without any reference to the Minister for Finance, which, of course, if not the case.  I will come back to deal with these in detail.</P>
    <P>I said that I had a slight difference with the chairman but I do not want to embarrass him and I hope we will continue on the basis that we have always had.  I agree with the chairman that we have had nothing but co-operation in the appropriate was from almost every Department.  There will always be a healthy conflict between the Executive and the Legislature, between civil servants and public representatives.  Subject to that, in almost every area we have got the co-operation that we expect.  However, there is one major exception and I <Col N="540" /> am not going to conceal the fact that that exception is the Minister at present in the House, not the Minister for the Public Service but the Minister for Finance and his Department.  I express a personal opinion, but let me say, an opinion I now propose to support by facts.  I would like to refer to two examples which emerged from the report that we have published here.  The first was in March of this year and it was not this Deputy who presented it though I was raising that issue at the time.  On 13 March this committee sought the views of the Department of Finance in relation to what was called the black hole problem at the time, and the members of the committee were unanimous in the view that we should have an explanation from the Department of Finance to the committee.  That was repeated on 23 March, and then on 14 April, as far as I can recall, the item was deferred, put off our agenda.  The Minister and the Department of Finance &mdash; in this instance the Minister, who will not occupy that seat forever &mdash; took the view that it was none of our business.</P>

      <P>They raised a section in the Department of Finance of civil servants like any others whom we have asked to come before us, who engage in analysis of the range of loans available to us across the international banking scene. Experts, yes; experienced, yes, and who <Col N="541" /> eventually get into the queue for loans from Germany, the US, Japan, Switzerland or wherever else, and who in turn finally recommend to the Minister of the day the loans that he should draw down. Of course, it is also for a Minister to take a decision that, having regard to currency trends as he sees them, he will advise or direct those officials to seek the preponderance of loans in the particular denominations, in this instance the $US, and if they get some such direction they will follow it up.  We can all have the benefit of hindsight.  Surely if the consequence of decisions to switch to the $US out of the mix of currencies from which we have traditionally borrowed &mdash; the Deutsche Mark, the guilder, the Swiss franc, which is not within the EMS, and even the Japanese yen &mdash; is an extra impact on public expenditure which gave rise to the need to cut food subsidies to the order of £140 million we as a committee, this House as a House, if we have any relevance are entitled to have either those officials, like any other officials come before us or this Minister, like any other Minister, come before us?  I do not mean just the Minister today because these things have a habit of changing, I mean the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said over the last 12 months that this is one area over which the Members of Parliament have no control.  Yes, we have to vote on budgets, and we vote in a predictable way; we pass taxes, and we vote in a predictable way; but we have no role here to scrutinise, question or review the borrowing strategy of the Minister for Finance or his Department. If this Minister will look again he will be aware that not quite two months ago he would have received the first notification of the fact that our committee would like to have an opportunity of having the views of the Minister or his officials. That was 18 September.  The dialogue commenced on the part of the Minister, and to this day we have heard nothing from that Minister formally in relation to it.  When the Minister read the report of the committee as reported in the media <Col N="542" /> he was not slow then to take up correspondence in <i>The Irish Times</i> in which we could still be engaging publicly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order &mdash; or I am not sure if it is a point of order &mdash; the correspondence which the Deputy and I have enjoyed in <i>The Irish Times</i> has illuminated people, including the Deputy, but it is not in response to the publication of this committee's report.  I will deal with the rest of the ridiculous allegations when I make my reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the Minister's memory is affected.  In the course of the correspondence he referred to comments made by me at the Committee on Public Expenditure.  I am really amazed that he does not recall that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The report at paragraph 8.5 states that the committee are considering the question of foreign borrowing in $US and the effect on the level of interest paid in the light of the strength of the dollar <i>vis-à-vis</i> the punt and that the committee's views will be taken up with the Minister for Finance.  However, we have not heard from the Minister for Finance.  Apparently the Minister for Finance will see that he and his officials are above scrutiny or sanction.  I make the point that the Minister for Finance is no different from any other Minister and the officials of his Department are no different from any other officials, particularly when as a consequence of decisions taken by the Minister for Finance it is clear that the extra cost to the taxpayer in terms of extra public expenditure has an enormous impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to give a case in point. Since December 1982 our currency has depreciated against the dollar to the point where we are now at parity although at that time our punt was worth $1.38.  That represents a major depreciation.  Within the same period such depreciation as has emerged against the EMS currencies, be <Col N="543" /> they the Deutsche mark or the Dutch guilder, which we have borrowed regularly, maintaining a mix, has been as a consequence of the decisions of the Minister for Finance to devalue our currency within the EMS.  The market rates would otherwise be the same as they were two years ago were it not for that decision which I opposed at that time.</P>
    <P>The reality is that the repayment costs on loans when they are due, judging by present trends, will be considerably more in respect of dollar borrowings than they would be in respect of Deutsche marks or guilders, or Swiss francs.  The interest rates in the currencies concerned are also a matter of considerable interest here. At the moment the interest rates in the Deutsche Mark or guilder are roughly of the order of 5½ per cent and have been for some considerable time.  That means that the loans we have in those currencies are subject to interest at those levels in contrast to the fluctuating interest rates of the dollar, which are very much higher. We can argue until the cows come home as to whether they will be lower or higher from now on but there are many within the US treasury who think they will be higher.  It is for that reason that I felt, like others, that such decisions taken by a Minister on the advice of a section in his Department which can for better or worse give rise to major cost overruns or, for better, give rise to savings, should be amenable to discussion and scrutiny either in the House or by a committee. The Committee on Public Expenditure would be the appropriate committee.</P>

Who does the Minister think he is?  Having ignored us for six weeks the Minister can now coldly tell us that this is not in our terms of reference.</P>

I am also aware that the clerk of the committee on our behalf wrote to the Minister's Department and that we did not get the information requested.  If the Minister wishes to deny that he may.  If the Minister says that this is not within our terms of reference we should consider whether to ask the Minister for Finance if we have any functions in any other areas if he is to be the person who determines that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I must point out to the Minister that at the time control of public expenditure in all its forms and the review of public expenditure in all its forms was clearly and specifically included by his colleague, Minister Bruton &mdash; I happen to agree with that Minister &mdash; when he set out our terms of reference.  If the Minister tells us that the growth of the interest charges or capital repayments when they come are not a matter of public expenditure I want to know what in the name of heavens they are.  Will we be confined to asking questions of individuals who may have responsibility for relatively small sums but when we get into the billions &mdash; we are all concerned about the growth in the borrowing level &mdash; we do not have any role?  I do not accept that and I do not believe our committee does.  If that is to be the case in future it should be made clear to us now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there are to be explantions we should be told now.  If there are to be justifications the public should be made aware of them now.  If it is to be a consequence of matters over which we do not have any <Col N="545" /> control let it be known.  That should be fully aired and discussed because this will not affect just this administration.  It will affect every administration.  I believe in the supremacy of the House, irrespective of which side we sit on from time to time. I know it may often be uncomfortable for the Executive of the time being, or the Minister of the time being, to have to answer such questions but I do not accept that any Minister can decide for himself what is or is not within our terms of reference.  That is why I made a significant exception when the chairman said we had got co-operation all round.  The clear and significant exception was the Minister and the Department of Finance in the areas I referred to.  I hope the Minister will follow the example of other Ministers when he considers how he should respond to me.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to some of the matters the committee has been able to bring before the public.  I must acknowledge the excellence of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It was as a result of that that we were able to explore matters in great detail.  It is not a matter for political decision as distinct from administrative procedures.  One of the matters we dealt with was the level of our contribution to the European Community.  The options for contributions to the EC exist in either of two systems.  The first is the basis of our VAT returns, adjusted from the data produced by the Central Statistics Office.  The GNP data is the other system.  I must acknowledge at this stage that the Revenue Commissioners appeared before the committee.  I should like to thank them for the views they expressed on the occasion of their visit.  The Revenue Commissioners stated that the GNP data would be less reliable due to inadequate micro-economic information.  In all other member states it is the GNP data which is the base of the contribution to the EC budget.  In our country alone we use VAT returns, adjusted from data from the Central Statistics Office, as the basis.</P>
    <P>It is clear that in one year, 1981, and, possibly, in subsequent years &mdash; we got figures for only 1981 and, perhaps, in <Col N="546" /> this area there is scope for further co-operation and consultation between the committee, the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Finance &mdash; the estimated extra cost to the Exchequer as a consequence of the system of contribution we use, VAT returns adjusted from Central Statistics Office data, was of the order of £17.8 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying that we see an impact of £3.8 million that we should not have had to contribute.  We should ensure that we have reliable blackboard economic information of a kind acceptable to the EC Commission.  Our statistics on macro-economic information are not of such quality as to be so acceptable. Central Statistics take a great hammering these days and while we are placing such reliance in the Government's plan on GNP information it is a matter of grave concern that we should not drop the data information that other EC members give.  To date, as far as we know the system could have cost Irish taxpayers millions of pounds less; it would have been £18 million less in 1981. Surely we should have been able to cope with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that capital development programmes will not vary or be terminated on a change of administration.  For instance, if in 1979 we needed major prison reform we need it even more now.  We have reduced public expenditure as a result of that political decision, and needed prison reforms were not carried out.  The same principle should apply in regard to general decentralisation. A sum of £7.8 million was allocated to erect safer prisons but that has now all been wasted.  I referred to An Bord Telecom.  I cannot hear Deputy Gay Mitchell.  He is not a member of this committee.  Money allocated to a <Col N="548" /> programme of telephone kiosk development was cancelled, although the old system was producing thousands of dud coins.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be waiting for Deputy Mitchell to enlighten me but I hope his contribution will be better than his interruptions.  I was referring to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in 1981-82, particularly in relation to public telephone kiosks.  Total lack of responsibility was displayed.  At that time the gross cost of telephone kiosk development would have been £5.7 million.  The allocation was £4.4 million, a cut of £1.3 million.  In 1982 the allocation should have been £7.6 million but in the event it was £5.7 million, a shortfall of £1.9 million.  The reason in each case was that the necessary cheques were not there because of the reallocation of departmental personnel.  I had hoped that that kind of action would not have been tolerated by any efficient public servants.  I join with the chairman in thanking the public service for the help they gave us.  I would express the hope that whoever is in Government the Minister for Finance will be responsible to the committee.</P>

In his introduction the chairman said that the work of the committee was to review and assess virtually all the moneys spent.  That is not the work of the committee.  It is the work of the Committee of Public Accounts.  This committee have failed to come to terms with their own terms of reference.</P>

      <P>They are supposed to be looking at programmes of expenditure and looking at expenditure so that they can report to the House before the expenditure is made.  Instead of doing that they are duplicating sections of the work of the Committee of Public Accounts.  That is none of their business.  They are doing what their report criticises the Civil Service and Government for doing: duplicating, overlapping and thereby wasting public money.  When the Committee of Public Accounts comes to look at the expenditure of the Houses of the Oireachtas this committee should be the subject of a report by them for wasting public expenditure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in the report which indicates that the committee are doing the job they are supposed to do.  They have been meeting but have not made any progress.  It is a disgrace to call this a progress report. This committee have the potential to be the best committee of the House.  If they were doing their job they would make recommendations to encourage the Dáil to become involved in public expenditure before that expenditure is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise that the committee have a small number of staff.  However, relative to other committees &mdash; take the Committee of Public Accounts, for example, which has the half use of a secretary &mdash; a staff of three is significant.  I share Deputy O'Kennedy's comments regarding the back-up facilities for Members of the <Col N="550" /> House and the development of committees in the House.</P>
    <P>I disagree with the abolition of the National Board for Science and Technology and its merger with the IIRS.  That board could have had its terms of reference extended to service committees.  We need to develop along the lines of the West German committee system without the fear of undermining Ministers but in a way which would strengthen Parliament and help it to hold the executive and the public service responsible.  The Committee of Public Expenditure have a significant role to play in this regard and I hope they will soon pursue the role they should be pursuing.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that the concept of a committee of public expenditure cum a committee of public accounts should be extended to all local authorities.  The Committee of Public Expenditure might consider encouraging local authorities, VECs and health boards to have their own public expenditure committees to examine expenditure in detail before it is made so that members are not presented with estimates over which they have no control.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the comments made by the Committee of Public Expenditure in relation to the Comptroller and Auditor General came about.  He has an unusual and significant constitutional position.  He is an officer of the Dáil rather than the Government and he is obliged to report to the Dáil on his findings, which he does regularly.  The Dáil sends that report back to the Committee of Public Accounts and they go through that report with him and the accounting officer of each Department, who is usually the secretary of the Department.  That is the function of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  He has no other function.  I do not understand the constant invasion by this committee into the work of other committees. If the committee want to do that, I propose that both committees be merged rather than wasting public expenditure. At present they are duplicating and overlapping and wasting money.  At the same time they are telling everyone else to stop <Col N="551" /> doing that.  I should like to go through the report in detail but I understand other Deputies wish to contribute.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Mitchell for cutting his contribution short.  I shall try to do the same.  Our chairman went to a lot of trouble to clarify his lines with the Committee of Public Accounts and he satisfied our committee that he had done so.  The Committee of Public Accounts is an historical one.  It deals with things which have happened in the past.  It is impossible for us in our committee to accept our terms of reference without looking back as well as forward.  Perhaps that is a weakness in the terms of reference but that linkage is there.  Our chairman is very conscious of that.</P>
      <P>The work of the committee could easily be described as some kind of a witch-hunt against the Civil Service but it should not be so described.  Sometimes we are so concerned to get the message across that that is not what we are at, we forget that it cannot be a bed of roses for the Civil Service at times, given our terms of reference. Our terms of reference are so probing that no civil servant can feel completely happy at times about the nature of some of our inquiries.  We sent a circular to all Departments emphasising that the purpose of the inquiry was not to find fault.  We should not give such an undertaking because if we find something we are critical of we should find fault. Civil servants know and accept that.  I am concerned that such statements might blunt the work of the committee.  The Civil Service is made up of mature and able people.  Civil servants know that the purpose of the committee is to find fault, not in a personal but in a constructive way.  I should not like the message to go out that we are so apologetic about hurting the feelings of civil servants that we are not prepared to say we find fault when we do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has to be a constructive tension and constructive conflict between this committee and Departments if we are to make progress.  At the end of the day <Col N="552" /> we are talking about a country which is grossly and severely overtaxed.  We must look at value for money in our public expenditure.  That is what we are about.</P>
    <P>This time next year this House will be entitled to ask us for an audit on what we have done.  The House could ask if we had achieved in our work and with the employment of consultants identifiable savings in public expenditure.  That is the bottom line.  Our chairman has, very expertly, set out a five-year programme of work going through every Department and semi-State body within our remit.  If at the end of five years we have mountains of reports but have not identified areas where savings can be made in every Department we will have failed.  We must have an annual audit of our work showing reasonably anticipated savings which would have been agreed with individual Departments.  We should take stock of that before embarking on an intensive five-year programme.  There are many other individual issues that I should like to comment on but I shall refrain from doing so.</P>

      <P>I am a firm believer in the scrutiny of the executive by the legislature contrary to what Deputy O'Kennedy said here a short while ago.  He made some scandalous allegations that are totally without foundation.  I intend referring to those now though my remarks will have to be rather brief because we are running out of time.  I should like to preface my remarks by reading from the terms of reference of the committee.  They are:</P>
      <P>To review the justification for and effectiveness of ongoing expenditure of Government Departments and Offices and of State-sponsored bodies not included in the schedule to the order establishing the Joint Committee on commercial State-sponsored bodies in such areas as it may select and to report thereon to the House recommending cost effective alternatives and/or the elimination of wasteful or obsolete programmes, where desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="553" /> Perhaps those terms are not as specific as they might be but they are specific enough to show that some of the items raised by Deputy O'Kennedy are not within the terms of reference of the committee.  I wish to make it very clear, and I do not think Deputy O'Kennedy is under any illusion about this, that if there is any matter which he or any other Member of the House wishes to raise with me, any other matter that does not come within the terms of reference of the committee, they have ample opportunity to do so. They have never found me wanting in regard to giving them replies.  Has Deputy O'Kennedy ever found me wanting in giving replies to matters raised by him?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if he has any plans to regulate the price and quality of soft drinks sold as &ldquo;mixers&rdquo; in public houses, and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have decided to defer, for the present, a decision on the recommendation of the National Prices Commission to introduce maximum prices for soft drinks sold in public houses.  I believe that the trade should be afforded an opportunity to curb excessive prices themselves and I understand that some initiative in this regard has recently been taken by one of the vintners' associations.</P>
      <P>I have not received any complaints about the quality of soft drinks sold in these establishments and considering the wide variety of soft drinks generally available I do not see a need for regulation in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Minister is referring to the suggestion by some publicans of reducing the price by 2p to bring the total price reduction of a <Col N="558" /> half one and a mixer to 10p.  Is the Minister aware of the enormity of the profit margin in the mixer area and that the small bottles which can be purchased at 9p per bottle are sold at 40p, 45p or 50p per bottle?  Is the Minister also aware that the dash &mdash; or the splash &mdash; which is the latest implement in the publican's repertoire, costs 20p to the customer whereas the cost to the publican is approximately 2p?  Is he satisfied that any effort is being made to reduce this enormous rip-off by the publican?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring, among other things, to the proposed reduction of 2p.  As far as the levels of profit quoted by the Deputy are concerned, the figures he gave in respect of the bought in cost compared with the sales cost do not reflect the true profit margin in the sense that these, as well as other goods, have to carry a share of the overheads and general running costs of the public house. My information from the National Prices Commission indicate that margins were not in the region of 500 to 600 per cent but between 53 per cent and 56 per cent which, I agree, is very high.  The mixers and soft drinks are probably bearing a disproportionate share of the cost of the overheads and profit element in public houses because of the existence of more rigid controls on alcoholic drinks.</P>
      <P>I considered the question of introducing retail price control for soft drinks but this would have involved setting prices across the board and also setting a differential between bar and lounge prices of approximately 2p.  I felt that it would be better to try to achieve these reductions by greater price display, price information and competition between outlets selling these products.  I have been putting some pressure on the licensed vintners in the course of discussions I have had with them to recognise that there is public disquiet about the level of charges for these products which are nonalcoholic and that the publicans have a social as well as a business responsibility to try to price them at a more realistic level than at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="559" /> My discussions in this area are continuing and I am glad to have the opportunity of availing of this forum to draw to the attention both of the customers for soft drinks in public houses and of those who are selling them that price levels are perhaps higher than they ought to be, in the hope that public pressure and competition &mdash; which will be assisted by the Government's decision to grant licences to restaurants in some places &mdash; may, generally speaking, bring to those in the licensing trade a consciousness that they must be price competitive and consumer orientated if they wish to retain their share of the business.  That is the best approach at present but I do not rule out the possibility of introducing retail price control.  However, competition and public pressure should be given an opportunity to operate first.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is obviously paying attention to this area but I contest his figure of 56 per cent profit.  A publican who buys a very small quantity of these bottles will get them at 18p per bottle but if he buys 100 dozen or more, which is a very small quantity for a medium size public house, he will get them at 9p.  If the Minister can tell me of anywhere that sells them at less than 40p I will be delighted to publicise it.  In relation to quality, the Minister does not seem to be aware that to provide the &ldquo;splash&rdquo;, the publican gets a concentrate to which he adds water to dilute it and make his own mixer.  There is no control over the quality or the amount of water put into the mixture.  It is a complete rip-off because the customers are not getting what they think they are getting &mdash; manufactured red lemonade and so on.  They are getting a make up of the publican's own manufacture.</P>

      <P>The paper conversion operation run by Friedman McCormack International Limited was set up as part of the agreement signed between the IDA and FMI in November 1983.  Essentially the agreement provides for the lease of the appropriate portion of the mill premises for the purposes of a paper conversion operation.  That is the operation currently employing 22 people.  The granting of an option to FMI on purchase of the mill's assets for the purposes of a paper manufacturing operation is subject to compliance with the viability criteria specified by the IDA.  This matter is currently being considered by the IDA but they have not yet reached a conclusion on it.  It is important to note that originally this enterprise was unprofitable and the company which owns the mill decided <Col N="562" /> to close it.  This Government decided to help out in a substantial way but we can only go forward with the development of a paper manufacturing operation on a viable basis.  Until the IDA are satisfied that they have a viable proposition they will not be in a position to sanction further development.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that since those first negotiations took place the viability of the paper making project has substantially increased by reason of very substantial increases in the price of manufactured paper?  Would the Minister agree that the premises at Clondalkin represent a substantial investment of State money, £1 million or possibly more, and that it is essential from the point of view of the taxpayer that this very valuable asset be exploited to the benefit of taxpayers as a matter of urgency?</P>

      <P>I recognise that there has been a valuable investment by the State in this property.  I am pleased to note that the market conditions for paper have improved and that factor will be taken into account by the IDA.  We have a responsibility not to make a mess of this and we must be sure that the project to go ahead is viable.  It will be examined in that context by the IDA.  This is the only long-term way to secure employment. Any course of action which did not satisfy the acid test of economic viability would be unwise for the Government and the IDA.</P>

      <P>A number of the measures which the Government announced on foot of the Prices Advisory Committee Report on Motor Insurance are already in force.  These include increased fines for uninsured driving, increased surveillance by the Garda authorities and the elimination of the double counting of certain social welfare benefits.</P>
      <P>Various other measures are in hands in my own Department and in the other Departments concerned, and I am in communication with the Ministers concerned with a view to the earliest feasible implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="564" /> In regard to the measures which would come within my area of responsibility, the position is that an order will be made in the very near future establishing a representative board to advise on matters such as premium rates, loadings, and the availability of insurance cover.  I will shortly lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas a draft order requiring insurance brokers to identify separately, when billing clients, any service charges made.</P>
    <P>A review of price control procedures has been completed by my Department.</P>
    <P>Special discount insurance schemes cannot be subsidised from the pocket of the general motorist and, so far as is known, no new discount schemes have been established since the Government announcement.</P>

Much has been promised.  His predecessor undertook to introduce a windscreen disc to enable people to determine whether drivers were insured or not.  That was to have been done six months ago but the Minister makes no reference to it in his reply. Would the Minister agree that the need for a quicker response is indicated by the fact that one in five cars is uninsured?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism the steps he proposes taking to deal with the high cost of motor insurance for young drivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>Motor insurance for young drivers is relatively more expensive than that for older drivers because of the accepted practice of applying loadings, to reflect the additional risk which they represent, to the insurance premiums charged to young drivers.  In addition, younger drivers are less likely to be in a position to benefit from no claim bonuses which older drivers will have earned.</P>
      <P>The necessity to charge loadings arises by virtue of the higher incidence of accidents and claims involving young drivers relative to their older counterparts.  The motor premiums advisory committee, which examined accident and other statistics, found that the loadings charged to younger drivers generally reflected the additional risk which they represent.</P>
      <P>The committee of inquiry into the cost of motor insurance which reported in January 1983 considered it entirely legitimate that groups shown to have higher claims experience should pay higher premiums. The committee made various recommendations in relation to the cost of motor insurance generally, a number of which have already been implemented.</P>
      <P>The representative board, which will be established very shortly, will advise the Minister on matters related to premium rates, loadings and the availability of cover.</P>
      <P>If the Deputies are aware of any individual case of excessive rates being charged to young drivers, I will be glad to have them investigated by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that in some cases young people are being asked to pay prohibitive rates? I know a person who was asked to pay £1,000 insurance for a £3,000 car.  Can the Minister hold out any hope that a statutory or some other instrument can be used to ensure that these people, many of whom have had trouble free motoring experience, will be able to obtain insurance at a lower rate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot directly link a premium to the value of a car because it is possible that a car valued at £2,000 may be unsafe or may not be roadworthy.  All insurance companies apply loadings to young drivers for a number of reasons which I have already given in numerous replies in this House, but mostly because the accident rate is substantially higher than in the case of older drivers, and because they do not have experience, they have not earned their no claims bonus.  I have examined all the price applications as closely as possible to try to ensure that the premiums charged are reasonable and I have asked the insurance industry in general to take on young drivers.  I am satisfied that, with a few exceptions, this is being done at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the reason the number of uninsured motorists is so high is that young drivers find it so expensive to get their first insurance and, consequently, are prepared to take the risk of going on the road without any insurance?  Will he indicate when he proposes to comply with the commitment given in this House two years ago by Deputy Barry that his party were going to introduce a comprehensive new policy dealing with insurance for young people under 25 years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am as concerned as the Deputy about uninsured drivers.  I am saying realistically that the price of insurance for young people reflects the higher risk they carry.  The experience of <Col N="570" /> insurance companies who deal with the motorists has been a most unhappy one in recent years.  I have an obligation to ensure that these companies continue to have a pricing structure that is competitive but they must also be allowed to continue in business.  I must balance both considerations as the Deputy who was a former Minister in charge of this Department knows very well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate from the records of the Department the number of young motorists under 25 years who are currently insured and the number who would like to get insurance but who cannot get it at a reasonable cost?  Will he indicate to the House the kind of money the insurance companies have to carry because of the extra liability of young drivers on their books?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the number of drivers under 25 years who are insured.  I wish to tell the Deputy I am satisfied that companies are taking on young drivers and that there is no widespread problem in that regard.  However, I accept there is a problem with regard to pricing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

      <P>If young drivers were complaining to my Department I would be aware of it.  I know there are problems for them primarily because of the price of insurance but I have been advised in at least two independent reports that the premium rates charged to young drivers are justified.  I am not defending the companies but I have an obligation to see that there is a fair balance between the premiums charged and making sure that the companies continue in business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that one insurance company is promoting its business by stating the number of people who will be seeking insurance at the end of each year?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The PMPA administrator proposed a number of changes in the rating structure of the company with effect from 1 September last, equivalent to an annual increase in revenue of 15.3 per cent.  Having referred the matter to the National Prices Commission, I decided to raise no objection to the proposal which was justified on underwriting grounds and necessary as a step in restoring the company's business to a sound commercial and financial footing.  The administrator is under a statutory duty to achieve this objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following implementation of the <Col N="572" /> revised rates, a small number of inquiries relating to renewal premium levels was received by my Department.  However, I am not aware of any particular difficulties being faced by PMPA policyholders, as suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>I should point out that only a small percentage of policyholders will incur premium increases of 50 per cent; among these are taxi drivers to whom the increase approved in July 1983 did not apply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that in addition to the increase of 48 per cent granted by the Department to the PMPA for drivers under 25 years, loading has been increased from 50 per cent to 100 per cent?  Further, is he aware that a motorist with some years accident-free driving experience is paying in the region of £1,265 for insurance on a Fiat 1300?  Does the Minister consider that just and fair?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the decision approved by the National Prices Commission confined the allowance of the no-claims discount on private car policies to those loadings particular to the policyholder, that is, loading in respect of drivers other than the policyholder would not be reduced by the amount of the no-claims discount allowance to the policyholder.  That was a change which I allowed on underwriting grounds.  I am satisfied that the level of premiums for additional driver loadings charged by the PMPA is competitive when compared with other premiums charged by other companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply is rather strange because I have had correspondence from him which confirmed that the driver to whom I have referred has had insurance increased from over £500 to nearly £1,300.  It is not surprising in the present circumstances that young motorists have no alternative but to go to the PMPA and they are being exploited by the PMPA?  Would the Minister like to comment on that?</P>

      <P>Will the Minister not agree that his Department gave permission for a 48 per cent increase across the board for all insured with PMPA and the additional increase which I have mentioned has also been allowed for those under 25 years?  In view of the additional income these excessive increases must mean to the PMPA, are we reaching a situation where the levy imposed on all others insured will be terminated at the end of this year?</P>

      <P>As I said in my reply, for four out of five policyholders the increase will amount to less than 10 per cent.  The pricing structure applied for by the PMPA in relation to private cars was directed primarily towards additional drivers to policyholders.  There was no increase in the basic rate for the policyholder himself.  From my statistics, so far as insurance for private cars is concerned the PMPA are competitive.  No matter what increase I give to insurance companies, it is a competitive market and <Col N="574" /> companies will attract customers only if they remain competitive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if he will indicate the total drawings that have been made on the Insurance Compensation Fund during 1983 and 1984; the present level of the fund; and the expected receipts to the fund from all sources during the present year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Insurance Compensation Fund is maintained and administered by the accountant of the High Court, acting under the control of the President of the High Court.  An abstract of the accounts of the fund for each year ending 30 November is required to be furnished to the Minister by the accountant, and to be published by the Minister. The latest year in respect of which accounts of the fund have been submitted by the accountant is 1983.  The accounts of the fund for the year to 30 November 1984 are due to be submitted to the Minister by the end of February 1985.</P>
      <P>There were no payments out of the fund during the year ended 30 November 1983 and the balance outstanding to the credit of the fund on that date amounted to approximately £36,000.  No contribution by insurers was determined by the Minister in respect of the year 1983.</P>
      <P>For the year 1984, the Minister determined a contribution rate of 2 per cent of gross premium income on all non-life insurers.  The appropriate contributions are payable to the Minister on a quarterly basis during the year.  So far this year a total of £5.3 million has been remitted to the fund in respect of contributions received from insurers covering the half-year to 30 June 1984.  Also, I understand that the accountant of the High Court has, in accordance with his statutory powers borrowed the sum of £30 million for the fund in 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed that a total of £30 million has, with the approval of the High Court, been paid out of the fund to the <Col N="579" /> administrator of the PMPA to enable him to carry on the business of the insurance company.  This amount is an unsecured debt of the insurance company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the full figures for 1984, so I cannot calculate what the income would be.  I suppose one could calculate that if the figure for the half year to 30 June 1984 is £5.3 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>But if the Minister has not that figure, how could he estimate what the outturn will be and what amount of money will be made available to other sources, namely the PMPA, if he cannot estimate what the income is?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated to the Deputy that so far this year a total of £5.3 million has been remitted to the fund in respect of contributions received from insurers covering the half year to 30 January 1984.  That £5.3 million would be 2 per cent of the total of the non-life premiums, so the Deputy can work it out for that half year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps they are.  However, the reason for my asking the question is that the Minister can lead the House in the proper direction on these figures, but he is not able to do so.  We have to make estimates of our own.  That might certainly be an appropriate remark to the Minister at this stage.  Finally, concerning this matter, the Minister says that £30 million has to date been given to the PMPA to help them to defray their liabilities &mdash; I take it part of their accumulated liabilities.  Is the Minister in a position to say, seeing that a drawing was made on this fund in the sum of £30 million, what the estimated total draw on this fund might be to clear the accumulated liabilities of the PMPA?</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the Report:</P>
      <P>Developments in the European Communities&mdash;Twenty-First Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have all become aware in recent days of the catastrophic dimensions of the famine affecting Ethiopia.  I would like to inform the House of what has been done both nationally and through international initiatives to try to alleviate the situation and of what is planned for the immediate future.  The Minister for Defence, speaking on my behalf on the Adjournment last night, outlined some of the actions the Government have been taking during the past few days.  The Government have decided that an additional £250,000 is to be allocated to top up the Disaster Relief Fund, which had already been largely exhausted in responding to disaster appeals during the course of the year, particularly in respect of the victims of famine in Ethiopia and <Col N="638" /> other parts of Africa.  This would equate to the additional sums decided on by some other member countries of the Community.  I need hardly say that this additional money is to be allocated to Ethiopia.</P>
    <P>We are all shocked by the graphic television coverage of scenes of human suffering and starvation, particularly when it affects mothers and children.  It is clear that the international community must respond to this tragedy, and quickly.  The ability of Ireland acting alone to contribute to the alleviation of suffering in Ethiopia is obviously limited.  For this reason the Government have been concerned not only to help to the extent possible from its own resources but also to encourage the mobilisation of international measures through the large scale multilateral agencies with which we are connected, and in particular those of the European Community.</P>
    <P>The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Co-operation with Developing Countries drew attention to the drought situation at a special meeting in August and in particular requested that any Irish aid funds which might become available should be used.  I can tell the House that this will be done to the extent possible between now and the end of the financial year.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, raised the matter at the Council on 17 September and I understand that the Commission is at present looking at what further action can be taken in addition to the substantial actions already undertaken by the Community.  The actions taken to date this year by the European Community have included the allocation of 19,000 tonnes of cereals as well as small amounts of other foodstuffs. It is anticipated moreover, that a further substantial allocation of food aid will be made in the near future.  In addition, six million units of account of emergency financial assistance have been provided. This was used to improve the infrastructure for the internal transport and distribution of food aid and for medicines and other emergency supplies.  Anybody who <Col N="639" /> has seen the television programmes for the last few nights will appreciate the importance of allocating moneys for the improvement of the infrastructure.</P>
    <P>From our own resources, the Government have to date this year contributed £60,000 for the relief of distress in Ethiopia. These funds have been allocated to the programme in Ethiopia by Irish non-Governmental organisations.  The activities funded have included emergency feeding operations and the internal transport of food aid.</P>
    <P>It is implicit in the raising of this matter in the House that there is widespread public concern that everything possible should be done in the tragic circumstances in Ethiopia and indeed elsewhere. This concern is fully shared by the Government.  The potential for co-operative endeavour at the European level and between Government and non-governmental organisation at the national level is an important factor in fashioning an effective Irish and European response.  Circumstances in Ethiopia are grave and I fear this will continue to be the case.</P>
    <P>The following list, on the basis of the information at present available to me which may not be fully up-to-date, gives an idea of the range and scope of the activities of those NGOs</P>
    <P>&mdash;Trocaire has so far in 1984 allocated £200,000 to relief operations in Ethiopia;</P>
    <P>&mdash;CONCERN have some 20 volunteers in Ethiopia and have so far in 1984 allocated some £53,000 to its programme there;</P>
    <P>&mdash;GORTA have so far in 1984 allocated some £28,000 to their programme in Ethiopia;</P>
    <P>&mdash;GOAL allocated £5,000 for a shipment of medical supplies from Ireland to Ethiopia earlier this year.</P>
    <P>The figures I have just given for the individual agencies include both money received from the joint disasters appeal for Africa and allocated to Ethiopia via <Col N="640" /> the individual agencies and money contributed by the public directly to the individual agencies concerned.  It should be kept in mind that there are also other, smaller agencies involved in allocating funds to Ethiopia.</P>
    <P>I would also like to mention the campaign organised by the Irish Farmers Association to collect grain for Ethiopia. Cereals to a value of £50,000 have been contributed and I can inform the House that the Government will pay the cost of transport of this grain to Ethiopia from the funds transferred to disaster relief yesterday.</P>
    <P>Other countries, of course, have been very generous also and the public response in Ireland is echoed in other member states of the Community.  Very substantial allocations have been made from the bilateral aid programmes of these countries.</P>
    <P>The question remains, however, could more be done by Europe, particularly against the background of the excellent grain harvest in Europe this year.  It is important to point out that, contrary to public perception, I, as President of the Council of Ministers, cannot simply instruct the Commission to allocate additional quantities of food aid or emergency funding to Ethiopia.  The heavy cost of funding such actions is, in the first instance, a matter for decision by the Council.  Of course, I will be doing everything within my power to change attitudes and to mobilise further actions.  I am, as President, proposing that the matter be further discussed at a meeting of the Council attended by Development Ministers on 6 November.  I hope agreement can be reached on the allocation of a substantial additional quantity of emergency food aid for Ethiopia and other African countries affected by drought.  I can say also that it is being discussed at this minute in COREPER in Brussels.</P>
    <P>The immediate concern must be to try to save lives at risk within the coming weeks.  Food appropriate for emergency feeding arrangements is, therefore, the immediate priority.  A second priority is <Col N="641" /> to overcome the problems of transportation which are gravely affecting the distribution of food already in Ethiopia.  Of the £60,000 already allocated by the Government to NGOs, £40,000 was earmarked for logistical support to get supplies of food and clothing to the worst affected areas, the balance funded emergency feeding.</P>
    <P>I have started consultations today with the voluntary agencies concerned to determine the most effective use of the new funds made available yesterday.  As I mentioned earlier, the Irish Government's concern at the emerging crisis situation in Ethiopia was raised in the Council of Ministers on 17 September and the matter will be raised again at the Council attended by Development Ministers on 6 November.  It is clear now that the scale of the problem is such that a major international aid effort will have to be mobilised.  The Government will do what they can to promote that effort.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Government Chief Whip for acceding to the request of the leader of my Party to have this debate and I should like to thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs for participating in the debate.  I am aware that the programme in front of him today is a very heavy and important one.  I believe that all Members, and the people we represent, share the great concern for what has arisen in Ethiopia.  That problem did not arise today or yesterday but has been in that country for some time.  The horror of it has been brought home to us all by the television pictures we have witnessed in the last three nights and could not have been better portrayed. It is not possible for any of us to describe to anybody else the horror of the problem.  That shows the power of television.  I am aware from people I have spoken to who would not bother to read the Official Report of the Dáil or Seanad or go beyond certain pages of the newspapers that the television pictures have hit them hard.  They have forced us to a situation where we are now questioning whether we are doing enough.  That question is very prevalent here, a country <Col N="642" /> that has experienced famine and suffered from the effects of famine for many years. There is a genuine desire by everybody to do the maximum possible to help.  I understand that at least 100 people die in Ethiopia every day and the health of many others is destroyed.  There is no doubt that the life expectancy of people in Ethiopia is shortened as a result of what they must go through.  There is an urgent need for immediate action.</P>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister and the Government for making an additional £250,000 to the Disaster Relief Fund.  I am aware of how hard it is to get money in Government in good and bad times but, without trying to belittle what the Government have done, I should like to say to the Minister that if the Government wish to come to the House with a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Foreign Affairs to provide additional funds they will get our wholehearted support.  That offer is not being made to belittle what the Minister has announced today because I consider that effort to be most generous.  We will go the whole road with the Minister if he wants further support from the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem in Ethiopia is urgent. According to one television programme last night people are dying every 20 minutes. The Minister for Defence, Deputy Cooney, last night made it clear to the House that there are logistic problems with regard to supplies of food and medicine to those in most need.  I appreciate that.  As a lay person I have only a little idea of what is involved.  A new approach will have to be adopted.  Deputy Gay Mitchell last evening pointed out to us that we cannot afford to wait for ships to be chartered, loaded and got to ports.  As he pointed out also there may be great difficulty in unloading that food and distributing it to the people in need.  A super effort must be made to organise an air lift to that country.  That is not much to ask when we can send men and women to the moon whenever we like.  If we can send people to outer space to release satellites surely we can organise something through the great powers to get <Col N="643" /> food immediately to the stricken people. One piece of film last night showed a small plane landing in an air field adjacent to a place where 100,000 people were on the verge of death due to starvation. Greater effort is needed.  We are all aware that small quantities only can be transported on such craft but thousands of people are in need of aid.  There is a need for a major effort to help those people.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that as President of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the EEC the Minister for Foreign Affairs will do his best to try to create a greater awareness in the Community of the magnitude of the problem.  I suggest to him that perhaps the next meeting, which has been arranged for 6 November, is too far away to deal with the matter.  I urge the Minister to consider calling an emergency meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers. The Council have the muscle to make immediate decisions to deal with the matter.  Emergency meetings of that Council have been called to deal with issues of less importance.  I suggest that although we are a small nation we can play a major role in getting relief to Ethiopia particularly having regard to our Presidency of the Commission.  A trip could be made to the other European capitals to get political goodwill on our side in our efforts to get something worthwhile done immediately.  We could talk to countries that are richer than us and have facilities above and beyond what we have or can ever hope to have.  Perhaps the Commission might consider a trip to the United States to convince the great American nation of the role they must play in Ethiopia.  They should not, because of distance, feel they do not have a part to play.  Those of us who have visited America will be aware that such disasters are not given the same prominence on American television as they are on our screens.  European news is very scarce on American television.</P>
    <P>We need the help of everybody, particularly the Americans, to get food, clothes and medicine to these people immediately.  The Americans have the <Col N="644" /> facilities to help deal with this problem.  I should like to pay tribute to the voluntary organisations who are doing tremendous work in this country.  I have read the comments of many of them in today's newspapers and their call for more money and supplies.  We should thank God for them because they are doing great work. I hope they get the aid they need to help out.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for lay people to understand that we as Europeans preside over a Community that has one million tonnes of butter in cold storage and that it costs in the region of £1 million to keep it in storage.  We have a huge beef mountain in the Community also.  Beef is being loaded on ships at present for storage in my constituency in the port of Foynes. That beef will be kept in cold storage until somebody wants it or until somebody is prepared to pay for it.  We have a milk powder mountain and many other mountains but we have delayed until now doing anything about the problem in Ethiopia and each of us must share blame for that. We had to wait until our consciences were rocked.  We are making a last minute desperate effort to do something worthwhile at this stage.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister for Defence to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs whom I know is as genuinely concerned as any Member about the position in Ethiopia to make a move on this matter now rather than waiting until November 6.  He might arrange with other members of the Government, or Members of the House, to communicate on his behalf with politicians in other European capitals to get more support and quicker results from the Commission, the Council of Foreign Ministers and those involved in the decision-making process in Brussels.</P>
    <P>There is a big problem involved.  Not alone must the supplies be obtained but they must be distributed also.  I am not an expert in the area of transportation and I do not think any Member is.  We are just ordinary people when it comes to things like that.  However, we are all aware that a huge effort is required. What has been proposed is something to <Col N="645" /> deal with the matter in the short term. As a Parliament we should have more regular debates on such matters.  If that occurred more Members would become involved and there would be greater questioning of policies and programmes. Those debates should not be held for the purpose of saying that one Government did more than another.  There is a heavy responsibility upon us in the West, where God was so generous in giving us plentiful supplies and where so much food is wasted daily.  Food is wasted here day after day.  Now we can do something in the long-term.  We can encourage those who can do something about this.  My message to the Government is to do more.  We are not taking anything away from the generosity they showed today, but if they do more we will help them along the way.</P>

      <P>It was appropriate that the Dáil was allowed to debate the horrific famine in that part of the world in conjunction with the 21st Report of the EC committee.  The Whips are to be thanked for having granted Deputy David Andrews's request.  If I were to contribute to this debate in the manner in which I would do in regard to the general report I would not have the sympathy of the House.  Deputies want to express their concern and their hopelessness in the face of this great human catastrophe in Ethiopia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I should like briefly to speak on the 21st Report, the heading under which this debate is being conducted.  I welcome the chance to discuss it even in an abbreviated form.  The report is a somewhat historic document, ending in 1982.  On the last occasion we spoke on such a report Deputy Collins and I agreed that the Joint Committee virtually had been out of existence for two years and did very little work.  During the past number of months that committee, under the chairmanship of Deputy Collins, have been extremely active.  We have published a number of major reports, including community aid for fuel production, <Col N="646" /> air pollution, environment policy agricultural structures, qualities of opportunity. There is a major report on the last mentioned, and in coming weeks we will be publishing another major report on the implications for Irish fisheries of the accession of Spain and Portugal.  I should like to refer to one matter before I go on to Ethiopia, the enlargement of the Community to include Spain and Portugal, probably attainable before the end of our Presidency.  The events over the past week, especially that of the <i>Sonia</i>, have exhibited dramatically for us one aspect of Spain's membership on our fisheries industry.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the work of the Irish Navy, small but very efficient, in protecting as well as they can our fishing resources.  The events of last week, in gale force winds, exhibited the dangers to which our naval service can be subjected and the high degree of efficiency and bravery which is characteristic of that service.  The problems we face in this matter are enormous.  Spain has a big fishing fleet and it has shown very little regard for international agreements or for the rights of other countries.  Our most dangerous problem would be not the type of agreement that would be reached but the enforcement of the agreement.  We must be very clear on this when the Minister tries to wrap up the fisheries agreement.  I suggest there is scope for greater Anglo-French-Irish co-operation because our interests are so close.  Our fishing areas are at the mercy of the Spanish fleet.  We need co-operation in the policing of the regulations. I do not think that the Spaniards are sufficiently aware of the high feeling in this country or the complete lack of trust we have in the intentions of their fishing fleet.</P>
    <P>However, the House is concerned with more important issues.  We have been given an opportunity to look at the position in Ethiopia.  We are now aware of the position in the past number of years through reports coming back from Irish agencies and voluntary workers.  However, as Deputy Collins and the Minister said, the full extent of what has been <Col N="647" /> happening was only made evident to all of us when we saw the horrific TV pictures the other evening.  It was an example of how TV can be so effective in bringing home to us our responsibilities in regard to what is happening even in a remote country.  Like Deputy Collins, all of us share a sense of disbelief that when there are food mountains and wine lakes and beef and grain and butter surpluses hunger and famine co-exist side by side.</P>
    <P>Last evening the Minister for Defence highlighted the very difficult problems in regard to getting relief to the areas involved.  There are still possibilities, and we should ensure that these problems will not be insuperable.</P>
    <P>All of us understand the reasons for the EC food mountains, but a time comes when humanitarian considerations must supersede all others.  There are times when the laws of economics and of the EC must give way to ensuring the survival of good innocent people whose calamity is no fault of their own.  It is the wish of every Member of the House to speak with one voice for the people of the country to do something urgent in the Community, to show that Europe's face is human and caring.  We hope that if possible our Presidency can give a lead in this.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he cannot just go in and make an order.  He has consistently shown an interest in the problems of the Third World, and he will have the full support of this House and the country, even if it means turning the regulations upside down to ensure that something definite and substantial can be done quickly.  The Committee on Development Aid, chaired by Deputy Owen, have been very effective during the years in educating Members of the House and of the public on the implications and the size of the problem.  That committee will try to ensure that the problem is kept vividly before those who make decisions. I know other speakers wish to offer.  I stress the sense of urgency felt not only by Members of the House but by the country.</P>

      <P>I hope I shall be able to give good example and not hog the time. I express the cold comfort which is ours that television and the media generally have shocked us into sobriety and reality. We are all unanimous in our views.  I join with our spokesman for Foreign Affairs in thanking the Government, the Minister for Defence who spoke last night, indicating that assistance would be given and the Minister for Foreign Affairs who made the realistic announcement today that an additional £250,000 is being provided.</P>
      <P>Our nation has suffered from hunger in the past and we would be critical of nations who stood by and let our people die.  The least we can do as Christians and people who have feelings for our fellow man is to intensify the efforts that have been made towards relieving the distress of the unfortunate people in Ethiopia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people combined and responded to a call in respect of the Colin McStay case where the need was to provide scarce scientific assistance so that the life of one little child could be saved.  It is extraordinary that in a country where there is such sensitivity to the question of apartheid and where for weeks we expressed concern about the Criminal Justice Bill lest some freedom or right might be infringed, until the manifestations we have seen on television came before us we did not realise in full the nature of the tragedy that exists in Ethiopia.  We were prepared to allow the non-government agencies <Col N="649" /> such as Trócaire, individuals like John O'Shea and GOAL, to speak for the people in connection with that tragedy. However, it is never too late to do the correct thing, and in so far as the measures proposed and confirmed and elaborated on by the Minister for Foreign Affairs today are indicative of the great awareness we have, they are to be welcomed and the Government are to be congratulated. The point should be made that it would have been unfortunate if the opportunity had not been given this morning to our party leader to raise this matter, which we hope had some effect on the decision which was made.</P>
    <P>As regards the situation in Europe and elsewhere and the vulgarity that exists in respect of the bountiful supplies of food that there are, unlike the case of Colin McStay where we were searching for that which was scarce, we do not have to make such a search in this case because we know that not only is food available but it is wasted and destroyed.  There is an obligation on us to agree that it should be more appropriately located in another part of the earth.  As Deputy Collins said, we have the technology to do that.  We have the imagination and guidelines which would allow for the transportation of that food.  There is an obligation on us &mdash; when I say &ldquo;us&rdquo; I refer to all those who are better off than the people in that unfortunate state &mdash; to organise ourselves so that food which is not required can be transported to a place where it can save countless lives.  The challenge is no greater than that.</P>
    <P>I am pleased as an Irishman about what the Government have done.  I congratulate them, but while what they have done is magnanimous in its own way, it is not sufficient.  We must continue in our efforts on behalf of the people and, more especially, continue to preach that gospel to other nations who may not have the same history of famine and death as we have or who may not have the same approach to Christianity as we have but who might have greater resources.  We should serve to do for them what television and the media have done for us <Col N="650" /> in shocking us into a realisation of the tragedy of the moment.</P>

      <P>I join with previous speakers in thanking the Minister for announcing that another £250,000 is available.  I should not bring a note of cynicism into the debate but, despite what Deputy Tunney says, if his party leader had taken a look at the opening speech made by the Minister in November 1983 on the 21st report it would have been blatantly clear that this subject is not out of order under this report.  It highlights how little attention we pay to that element of EC policy which affects the Third World.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is sad that it needs graphic and horrific television pictures to bring us to our senses and to bring those who are at the forefront of making policy to their senses.</P>
      <P>I am sure Deputies did not need to see the terrible pictures on television.  Every agency in the country can provide us with these pictures.  My abiding feeling, now that we have an opportunity to talk about this, apart from sympathy, horror and shock, is anger.  I feel anger that it takes such television pictures to bring us to our senses and see what is happening in the world.  Whether we like it or not we are all partly to blame for that.</P>
      <P>The thrust of my anger is towards the Ethiopian Government or Governments who are not facing the problems in their own countries.  Let us analyse why the Ethiopian Government are to be blamed in this instance.  For the last ten years they have been primarily involved in fighting a war.  The plight of the people of Ethiopia has not been second on their list but probably number 102.  They keep up the strength of the army.  Before their eyes they have allowed their country to come to this.  They are not totally to blame, because outside forces have also played a part, as have natural calamities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to have this debate we better not just have it on the surface or as a debate where we express our sympathy. I hope that after this debate we will not <Col N="651" /> forget about what underlies the problem in Ethiopia.  Let us recall that over the last number of years we have had Bangladesh, the boat people, Cambodia and the refugees in Latin America.  We have seen these kind of pictures before on television and have had this kind of reaction.  We will still have them.  Next year we will probably be here discussing Mozambique, Chad or some other African country where the pictures are now coming from and are just as horrific.  That is why I feel angry.  Development education does not seem to be progressing to a point where our aid to the developing countries is in the form of emergency aid.  Until such time as I can pick up a document such as this Trócaire programme for development and find that we are sending relief only for emergencies resulting from acts of nature over which man has no control, I will not believe that development education is penetrating through to those whose job it is to devise such policies. The famine in Ethiopia did not happen overnight.  The problems relating to transporting food around the country did not happen overnight either.  There have been no roads in many parts of Ethiopia for a long time.  We cannot prevent a drought, but last year and the year before people who work in the fields in Ethiopia warned of the danger of famine but those warnings were not heeded in Europe or elsewhere.  It was not until we saw on television in the past couple of nights a film of the suffering being endured in Ethiopia that any action was taken.</P>
    <P>My anger focusses secondly on the EC structures, on the developed world, for their not being prepared to face some of the unpleasant decisions that might have to be taken.  The Common Agricultural Policy helps the developed countries but does it help the developing countries? There is an urgent need for reviewing the kind of policies inherent in CAP, policies which are damaging Third World countries rather than helping them towards a sustainable long-term development.  We may continue with the programme of food aid to Third World countries, but that is not the answer.  If we continue to <Col N="652" /> provide aid by way of cheap food the Governments of those countries will not be prepared to face up to adopting policies that will allow farmers in those countries to produce their own food.  There will be no impetus for them to provide their own foodstuffs.  Therefore, there is a much deeper reason for having this debate.  I am glad to find so many people anxious to participate in the debate.  I suspect that generally for these kinds of reports, the Whips have difficulty in finding Members who are willing to contribute. There is not sufficient interest in the policies of the EC as they affect both us and the wider world.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, my anger is focussed on ourselves as Members of this House.  For too long there have only been about four people here who have had the slightest interest in what happens in the Third World with the exception of those who react to some of these horrific emergencies. The world is no longer a big place in terms of communication and of travel. Those Third World countries can be reached in a matter of hours by air.  The policies that we in Europe adopt and in turn the policies adopted by those other countries will affect us.  That is why we had better start to take note of what is happening out there.  Perhaps, too, my anger extends to the media also.  In August this year I, as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Co-operation with Developing Countries, called a meeting during the Summer Recess specifically to raise the issue of what we were doing in Ireland to help alleviate the problems of the Ethiopian famine.  There were one or two people from the media at that meeting, which subsequently warranted two or three lines in the papers.  Perhaps if I had gone to the meeting with a malnourished and emaciated baby we would have got more publicity, but unfortunately it was not until pictures of the suffering people were shown on television that we woke up to the situation. There are people in this country who are well aware of what should have been done in regard to Ethiopia many months ago or even some years ago.  I am concerned lest this whole matter be forgotten <Col N="653" /> in a week or two when some other big story will be news.  A headline in one of our newspapers in August read that seven million faced death in Ethiopian famine. At least we are reacting now to what we saw on television.  After our August meeting which was attended by Members from all parties, we wrote to the relevant Ministers, to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and to his Minister of State as well as to the Minister for Finance and to the Minister for Agriculture who has taken a very strong line, since becoming President of the Council of Ministers of Agriculture, on the whole area of food aid.  Our letter was to the effect that not in any circumstances should any money becoming available from the multilateral funding in Foreign Affairs go back into the coffers of ordinary Foreign Affairs funding.  We had it on good authority that the multilateral payments were levelling off and that normally the case would be that any funding available under that heading would go into ordinary departmental funding.  I am pleased to hear today that that request was taken note of.</P>
    <P>We invited Mr. John O'Shea, who is Honorary Secretary of the Third World Relief Organisation, GOAL, to attend at our meeting.  He had just returned from Ethiopia and I should like to read some of the report he presented to us.  The submission is dated 17 August and I quote from it as follows:</P>
    <P>Words of mine cannot accurately convey the staggering degree of human misery which I witnessed during a brief visit to the Wailita province of Ethiopia during the past seven days.</P>
    <P>Having been in Kampuchea and Karamoja when famine stalked these lands, I was, I felt, prepared for the ordeal ahead.  I was wrong.  What unfolded before my disbelieving eyes was shocking in the extreme.</P>
    <P>Children so ravaged by hunger and malnutrition that they looked more like ailing old people were everywhere; mothers too weak to attempt to feed <Col N="654" /> their listless children at the feeding stations; hundreds of children being abandoned because their mothers no longer had the will to fight on.</P>
    <P>On Monday I watched horrified as an aid worker pushed back into a child's body, her insides; worms were eating away at her tiny emaciated body.  On another occasion I encountered a man who had lost three members of his family through hunger within a week.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Shea went on to talk about the reasons for the extreme famine in Ethiopia. However, such statements are not new.  We have heard similar statements before.  I plead with the House and with the people who represent us in Europe to try to get through to our fellow members in the EC that it needs a root and branch examination of the kind of policies that we adopt in Europe which will have a rub-on effect for Third World countries.  I should like to see a wider and more relevant interest in the policies that we help to formulate in Europe.  I know that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, as President of the EC Council, has stressed that he cannot personally ride over the other Ministers and demand changes.  He is very conscious that it needs more than just a reaction when horrible calamaties hit parts of the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite what Deputy Owen said in her outstanding contribution, this debate does make the Dáil relevant. We have seen horrifying pictures over the last few evenings on television and, at the same time, the mechanism of the Dáil has worked in the right direction. In the ordinary way, the debate might have been put back for another week or two to accommodate our out-of-date rules.  However, we are entitled to change the rules, and I should like to express my gratitude to the Ceann Comhairle's office for the opportunity of speaking in this debate, which makes this House and Deputies a little more relevant.  Thank God for small mercies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will possibly be repeating what other Members said, but we have a very influential role to play at present because <Col N="655" /> we have the Presidency of the European Community at our disposal and we are serving out the last number of months of our six months Presidency in the context of our rota of duties in that regard.  There was a suggestion by a number of speakers especially by Deputy Gerry Collins as spokesman for Foreign Affairs in Opposition, that maybe &mdash; if I may use the crudity &mdash; the use of our Presidency should be availed of by canvassing the member countries as a matter of urgency before their next meeting, but perhaps that will be too late and there will be another couple of thousand people dead by then.</P>
    <P>Many people were in touch with me about the horrific pictures which they saw on television over the last couple of nights.  I was aware, of course, that in August there was a meeting of Deputy Owen's great committee and, subsequent to that, I was speaking to John O'Shea who has done such exceptional work in his small but very dedicated and idealistic organisation GOAL.  I should like to pay tribute to him for the consistency of the publication of the horrors which are happening on a daily basis on the African continent.  We are talking about Ethiopia specifically, but there are a number of other nations in Africa at serious risk from starvation brought about by drought, maladministration, ideologies and philosophies which may be foreign to us but are endemic on that continent. This debate is not about ideologies or philosophies but about sympathy, hope, concern and action.  We are calling for urgent action today.  In that regard, whilst the sum of money proposed by the Government, £250,000 mentioned by the Minister for Foreign Affairs is a sizeable sum, nevertheless it is not enough.  That brings me to another suggestion by Deputy Collins when he said that a Supplementary Estimate should be introduced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in this House next week to send a realistic sum of money for famine relief.  The sum of £250,000 is a drop in the ocean, albeit a fairly large drop, in a vast ocean.  This <Col N="656" /> side of the House has undertaken to support any Supplementary Estimate introduced by the Minister.</P>
    <P>We have poverty here undoubtedly but we do not have famine.  We are talking about children dying in their mothers' arms and fathers praying over the remains of their wives and children.  I am satisfied that the nation would support the Government in any Supplementary Estimate which they might introduce.  I agree that it is taxpayers' money but I am sure that taxpayers would gladly pay it. We look forward to the Minister's response in that regard.</P>
    <P>I was listening to a radio programme very early this morning and it was suggested that there are 30 million tonnes of grain stacked up in EC warehouses.  We are told that, to date, 19,000 tonnes of cereal have been provided from the EC to Ethiopia.  That is a joke &mdash; between now and Christmas these people are looking for 60,000 tonnes of grain per month to survive.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs should examine the large tonnage of grain in stock.  Trócaire have given a sum of £200,000, Concern have sent 21 volunteers and donated £53,000; Gorta have sent £28,000 and GOAL have sent £5,000.  The Irish Farmers' Association have given £50,000 in cereals, the Government to pay transport costs.  I congratulate all those agencies, which are non-governmental organisations.  They are doing an excellent job, and it is a tribute to the people who organise them that their concern and response should be so immediate.</P>
    <P>On Wednesday next I hope to put questions to the Taoiseach concerning our Presidency of the EC and to suggest that he should ask his EC partners to declare a European Ethiopian crusade.  The Taoiseach should declare next Sunday week as Irish-Ethiopia Sunday.  That would give the people an opportunity to show their solidarity with the starving people of Ethiopia.  I am also appealing to the Government to mobilise the media, non-governmental organisations and churches and to invite other institutions, including our large banks, to contribute to this fund.  I make a special appeal to the <Col N="657" /> schools.  When schoolchildren see their contemporaries dying in their mothers' arms, I am sure their idealism and dedication will be brought into play.  These are areas that the Government might mobilise as a matter or urgency.</P>
    <P>Media coverage over the last couple of days has been fantastic but horrific.  If nothing else it has made this Chamber more relevant, and for that we should be grateful.  Hope is one thing and action is another.  It is action we seek as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>This country is shocked by what it saw and I hope it remains shocked until the famine is over.  We had our own famine over 100 years ago and we have a tremendous moral role to play in leading world opinion in relation to the on-going Ethiopian tragedy.  Let us play that strong moral role.  Let us be the leaders in this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad this debate is being held because the Minister's reply to the debate yesterday was very disturbing.  I know the Minister for Defence was acting on the information available to him at the time, but when he said that we had made substantial contributions and would be making further contributions without any specified amounts it was obvious that the contributions were quite small.  We know now that until this morning our total contribution was £60,000.  I am glad that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has succeeded in getting a further £250,000 for the disaster fund to help Ethiopia, but I must agree with Deputy Andrews that this is not sufficient. It is only a start, and it is a good thing that we are acting immediately.  The Minister must see that this should not be the total contribution of the Irish Government. Various non-governmental organisations have contributed more than our Government.  The total of Trócaire, Concern, Gorta, GOAL and the IFA is £336,000, while the Government contribution is £310,000.  That is not good enough.  The Irish people will not see it as a sufficient response to this enormous disaster by the Government who speak in their name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the EC, the contribution of <Col N="658" /> 19,000 tonnes of grain is miserable.  I heard on the radio this morning that Oxfam, a non-governmental organisation, have contributed 15,000 tonnes of grain to Ethiopia, yet the total contribution of all the EC countries is only 19,000 tonnes.  This is miserable, particularly in view of the enormous stockpiles of food. It is said that a further 25,000 tonnes of grain are to be forwarded during the rest of the year, but that amount is needed now.  The total amount required immediately to save lives is 650,000 tonnes.  We do not expect the EC countries to contribute all of this, but in view of their development, wealth and enormous trade they should certainly contribute more than one-twentieth.  It must be much more.</P>
    <P>The contribution of 1,800 tonnes of milk powder, 640 tonnes of butter oil and 500 tonnes of vegetable oil is just a drop in the ocean.  It is regrettable that the Irish Government have not been able to contribute milk powder, butter and other dairy products as well as their contribution of £250,000.  When one considers the enormous amount of dairy products in EC storage, 1,800 tonnes of milk powder is nothing.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs should emphasise during the course of our Presidency of the EC that it is a disgrace that this should be the total EC contribution.  I know individual EC countries have also made contributions, but our contribution is not sufficient and the Irish people will see that.</P>
    <P>Regarding the general level of overseas development assistance, it is a stain on our country's reputation that in 12 of the past 14 years we have broken our pledge given in the early seventies that we would increase our spending by .05 per cent of GNP annually until the UN target figure of .7 per cent had been reached.  We have not done that and we are still at a figure of .23 per cent.  Even if we now began to keep our promise of an increase of .05 per cent per annum it would be into the nineties before we would reach the target of .7 per cent.  In view of the fact that we have consistently gone back on our word and not met our targets on overseas development assistance, we should make <Col N="659" /> a much bigger contribution to Ethiopian relief.</P>
    <P>We as a neutral nation which has experienced famine and colonialism should be calling for a reduction in the amount of money spent on arms and calling for this money to be used for the relief of disasters which are taking place all over Africa, particularly Southern Africa and in the sub-Sahara region where drought has continued for a decade. Irrespective of what Governments are there and whether there is internal or external strife it is the natural disaster of drought which has caused these famines. The response of the EC should be much stronger.  Regarding the response of our Government, I would hope that the Ministers sees the contribution of £250,000 as just an initial response.  The concern of all Deputies has been brought to bear on the Government to give the Minister this money, but we would hope that this is only the immediate response and that we will respond more positively during the next few weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this matter on the Adjournment last night and I am glad of the opportunity to debate the matter at greater length today.  I welcome the all-party approach.  We are united in our concern.  Lest we are carried away by the problem of Ethiopia, let us remember that solving that problem will not solve the problem of hunger generally in the sub-continent.  There are 24 countries involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole question of foreign aid generally comes into account.  There are very serious questions of morality or immorality and downright sinfulness in the fact that there are food mountains in abundance in Western Europe while people are starving, including children with distended stomachs, only a flight away.  It is not just a question of justice being done; it must be seen to be done. It is obvious that all that food cannot be brought there and that some of it would not be of use, but food like cereals would be of use.  There is something terribly unjust about displaying this outrageous <Col N="660" /> wealth of food while our neighbours are starving a short distance away.  It is ironic that the hierarchies of the various churches concern themselves with such things as contraception when they are talking about morality.  What about the morality of people starving?  Why is there not a concerted effort to do something about it on a regular on-going basis?  We should keep the whole question of world hunger prominently before the politicians and the media, who can help in ensuring that there is an awareness of the problem.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increased aid.  I am sorry it was not announced last night but I realise the Minister for Foreign Affairs was not in the House.  The extra money is very welcome, but I join with other Deputies who have suggested that we should have a Supplementary Estimate to deal with this problem.  We have been reneging on our responsibilities, and that is quite irrespective of which Government were in power.  The Programme for Government commits us to a certain amount of expenditure that is not contained in the plan <i>Building on Reality.</i></P>
    <P>Currently we hold the Presidency of the Community.  How can we ask our partners to contribute more when a country such as Holland is already contributing 1 per cent of GNP and are way ahead of us?  We must hang our heads in shame. Those of us who want to see a world of free enterprise, of democracy and of liberal governments, must fight for that. Most of the countries that are affected by the kind of disaster that has occurred in Ethiopia either have Marxist Governments or have right-wing fascist Governments.  If we want the world to be the kind of place we wish it to be we have to fight against the hunger, devastation and poverty that affects such countries.</P>
    <P>Giving of the surplus we have is not the solution.  We have to give enough to ensure these countries can create the infrastructure they need for trapping water, for storing grain and for distributing food.  A sum of £250,000 will only help for one year and Ethiopia is only one country of 24.  That gives some idea of the problem.  There has to be some kind of structural response.  We have to <Col N="661" /> take action with regard to our own contribution and persuade our colleagues in the EC to allocate a fixed amount that is just and right.  Instead of doing that we have been falling short.</P>
    <P>I mean no disrespect to the committee dealing with overseas development, but I have argued in this House on many occasions for the establishment of a foreign affairs committee.  This would have a higher profile and would have a keen interest in matters such as this, in nuclear disarmament and all the other issues that are of interest to the public.  We have a role to play, and it is my opinion that the committee already established should be elevated or else a separate foreign affairs committee should be set up to allow urgent matters to be raised by the parliamentarians.</P>
    <P>I should like to see our Government and the EC bring pressure at the United Nations and elsewhere to ensure that the Governments of the countries to which we have referred are pursuing economic and military policies consistent with the needs of their peoples.  I need hardly add that the overriding concern of people in such areas is food.  If we send money we know it will go on food, but that does not mean that a military government may not decide to retain a greater proportion of the national budget for military weapons and so on.  I understand that in some countries for political purposes they pursue a cheap food policy with devastating results for the agricultural and rural communities.  Some of the military and economic policies pursued by Governments of such countries need to be looked at.  We should bring pressure on them in the United Nations to ensure that they are responding to the needs of their people.</P>
    <P>One thing that has come through very clearly is that everyone here would be prepared to vote for a Supplementary Estimate.  On behalf of the 120,000 taxpayers who sent me here, I am asking that a Supplementary Estimate be introduced next week to assist in this instance.  We will then build that into our annual contribution to the Third World.  I plead with the Minister to pursue that line.</P>

      <P>I should like to join with the other Deputies who have spoken of the enormity of the disaster we have seen on our television screens in the past few nights.  It was one of shocking poverty and deprivation.  I have been approached by many concerned constituents in the past few days, by people in the medical and nursing profession and by ordinary people in the street, and all of them have asked what this Parliament and Government intend doing about this dreadful disaster in Ethiopia.  It is reassuring for a new Deputy to see that the Dáil has the ability to respond quickly to a major problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the allocation of £250,000. From the feedback I am getting I can assure the Government there will be no petty remarks made by the public with regard to the fact that money can be found in this instance, even though they have been lectured about belt-tightening and a shortage of money on the national scene.  People are displaying a great compassion which is typical of our nation and they are quite prepared to give full support to the Government in making funds available for this major disaster. It has pricked our consciences and has woken us up to the fact that in spite of our difficulties we enjoy a standard of living that would be envied by the majority of people in the world.  Some 60 per cent of the world's population live below the breadline, and the fact that we are in the other 40 per cent should make us feel grateful.  We owe it not just to the Ethiopians themselves, but also to the dedicated crew of Irish workers who have voluntarily given part of their lives, and in some cases their lives, to try to ensure that people get a meagre amount of grain, or whatever, every day to keep them existing rather than living.  The Irish Government should continue to respond and show our solidarity with our people who are working out there, the voluntary agencies, the religious, and so on.  They should show that the Christianity which permeates our Constitution and which is part of the Irish ethos is recognised and expressed in immediate and urgent aid <Col N="663" /> being sent to this stricken part of the world.</P>
    <P>I support the comments made by Deputy Andrews.  More can be sent and more should be sent.  There will be no backlash from people outside this House about the amount of money sent if we can send any more.  People realise the gravity of the situation.  I know it is only a short-term measure.  I agree with other speakers that we should consider how we can cope in the long-term and what role we can play.  We should use our Presidency and the fact that we are a neutral nation not involved in world politics in Ethiopia or anywhere else to lead boldly in this field so that our Presidency can be a time when Ireland can be thanked by many of the civilised nations in the world for playing our role honourably and effectively in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go over the ground covered by other Deputies.  I support everything said commencing with the opening speech by the Minister and also what Deputy Collins said.</P>
      <P>Deputy Collins focussed on the fact that because of our Presidency of the EC we have an opportunity to try to prevent a continuation of the misery, deprivation and sheer inequality in these countries.  I hope we will not use stop gap methods and show a tremendous amount of compassion and sympathy, and once the regional problem is solved sink back again and forget the problem.  This is an opportunity for us to make sure something is done in the long-term.</P>
      <P>We all know that years ago the Brandt Report pointed out that unless we in the wealthy north compared with the deprived and disadvantaged south were willing to give more than our overflow the problem would not be solved.  I agree that we are not even giving our overflow capacity. It is obscene when one thinks of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will have to start talking seriously about more equal distribution so that we are not constantly giving the crumbs that fall from the rich man's table.  The Treaty of Rome promised that the whole concept of the EC would be that the stronger, <Col N="664" /> more developed and richer countries would discriminate positively in favour of regions within the Community.  This was encapsulated in the Regional Fund.  We must think of a much broader aspect of that and have, as it were, a world regional fund.  The European Economic Community could broaden the ideals of the Treaty of Rome and provide a fund on a global basis.  We have the right and responsibility to call on very rich nations like the United States to play their full part.</P>
    <P>I do not want to enter into politics, but if the amount of money and machinery sent to deprived countries was matched by an effort to develop the people and their land, what a different world we would have.  We have a moral opportunity to do that.  We are all doing a bit of conscience searching.  The Lomé Convention has not lived up to the objectives for which it was set up.  That is a matter of sadness to people who have been involved in the Lomé Convention.  We have been careful to make sure that it does not make tremendous demands on the developed world as against the developing world.  We have been very careful to make sure that the trade agreements we have signed do not encumber us in the matter of raw materials within the technology of the different countries.  We will have to start looking at this.</P>
    <P>We have the research and development to enable us to do this.  Up to recently we could put down a great deal of what happened to us to acts of God because we did not have the scientific knowledge to anticipate them.  One of the advantages we have got from space travel and space experimentation is that we have satellites tracing world climatic changes.  Vast sums of money were spent on enabling us to do that.  We should now be anticipating changes of climate and buttressing up the people who will be suffering from those climatic changes. We have failed dismally to do that.  This Ethiopian tragedy was anticipated months ahead.</P>
    <P>Unless we take long-term measures we are only giving a bit of conscience money. That is not good enough.  As the Brandt <Col N="665" /> Report pointed out, we will suffer from it morally and we will suffer from it politically in the very near future.  We must see how we can build up these nations technologically.  This will take sacrifices. It will take political and structural changes.  We should cut through some of the red tape enveloping the release of supplies which could be sent to Ethiopia as of now.  We must take account of the incredible logistics of getting the food there.  We have pledged our support and we may need to give more money, but for every £50,000 value in grain it takes the same amount to transport it.</P>

      <P>Deputies Lyons, Wyse, E. O'Keeffe, Wallace and M. Ahern have been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the question of the Verolme Cork Dockyard.  They have 20 minutes between them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to express my appreciation and that of my colleagues to the Chair in allowing us to raise this very serious matter on the Adjournment.  The published decision to close the Verolme Cork Dockyard at the end of November warrants immediate action on the part of the Government.  As the Chair is aware, we have tried to raise this matter on a number of occasions, but that is now history.  We have been given this opportunity to express our views on the matter and we appreciate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I contend that there are very considerable possibilities of ship repairing and other works that could and should be carried out in this dockyard.  It would be nothing short of a national scandal if it were not allowed to continue in operation.  A unique situation applies in the matter of this Cork dockyard.  At its closure date, it would be in a position to discharge all its responsibilities to its creditors in full, have sufficient funds to pay redundancy money to the remaining workers in the <Col N="666" /> yard and still have money left to repay what is outstanding to Fóir Teóranta.  I am sure that the Minister, the Government &mdash; and everybody else for that matter &mdash; must realise that that unique position in modern business terms would amount to one of the most unsatisfactory close-downs of all time.  The obvious implication is that with such resources the company could afford not to close down.  I contend that there is not a shipyard in the entire world at this moment in such a position.</P>
    <P>I indicated earlier that considerable possibilities existed for the yard in ship repairing.  They also have offshore field development facilities, apart altogether from the building of rigs.  There are many alternatives open to the dockyard.</P>
    <P>It is my understanding that the dockyard presented the Government, last May I think, with at least five options that would allow them to continue trading, but all options were refused by the Government.  Since then, efforts have been made to resume talks with the Department and the Government on the possibilities for the yard, but up to now those talks have not taken place.  I am asking the Government to ensure that talks take place, with a view to ensuring that employment provided by work in the yard is safeguarded.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the fisheries protection vessel now nearing completion in the yard, known as the P. 31, was designed and constructed in Verolme Dockyard from the keel to the last brush of paint with the aid of EC funding.  What is very disappointing and disconcerting is that we are led to believe that our Department of Foreign Affairs gave no encouragement, but rather the very opposite, to the management of the dockyard to sell this quality boat to nations around the world. If that is the case, I must condemn that attitude.  If something like the P. 31 can be produced and is a marketable product, there are nations, barring one or two for obvious reasons &mdash; and there I might mention South Africa &mdash; where we could market this quality boat and so retain work in the dockyard.</P>
    <P>It must be said that the dockyard's <Col N="667" /> strategic location is of immense importance to the nation.  The facilities of the yard include the most modern, sophisticated equipment and an outstanding machine shop.  Is it the intention of the Government &mdash; and I hope that it is not &mdash; to allow all the machinery, equipment, cranes to rust and rot due to inactivity for lack of co-operation from the Government? What about it if the Government have to subsidise the yard?  Every shipyard in the world is subsidised by the national government.  Are we to allow the skills developed over the years by the workforce to be thrown on the scrap heap, along with the machinery, gear and equipment?  Is it not true to say on examination &mdash; and I hope that the Government and the Minister will examine the situation to the fullest degree &mdash; that there are immense possibilities for this dockyard to remain in business?</P>
    <P>We may have lost some ship repairing business for various reasons which I have not time to go into now because my colleagues wish to contribute as well, but let people sit down around the table and work out a strategy and a structure for the survival of this dockyard.  It can and would be done if there is a will to do it. I charge the Government with responsibility to ensure the continuation of this dockyard and to examine all the possibilities. If we have to diversify from ship building, and I am not satisfied at this point that we ought to, the ship repairing element should be sufficient to keep the yard going with plenty of employment for the professions and skills that I have already mentioned.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, in the interests which I have outlined, of the workforce, the equipment, the strategic location, the fact that it is our only ship building yard, the immense possibilities with proper input, to ensure that it is kept open and in business for the employment content, for the spin-off industry and for its value to the nation.  Perhaps present circumstances are dictating short-term decisions, but is it not reasonable to expect that, whatever deficiency may exist at present in the ship building business, the <Col N="668" /> wind of change could come and we would be left without a dockyard to adapt to any work available?  Even at present there is sufficient case for Cork dockyard to be kept open and people kept in employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste this morning in the House if any arrangements had been made to meet the management of Verolme Cork Dockyard to discuss the present situation. Unfortunately I did not get any reply. When the Minister is replying to this debate, I hope that he will give some indication as to the Government's mood in this respect.  We visited Verolme Cork Dockyard recently and we felt that there they were hoping for a meeting with management and Government Ministers. Surely an industry such as this cannot be allowed to go to the ground without first examining all options for its survival.  I am aware that management submitted a number of options to the Minister's Department for consideration and yet they are awaiting a reply to their proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here is an industry employing a very highly skilled staff for ship building and engineering construction.  It has taken many years to develop this standard of skill and craftsmanship for those employed there.  Another important aspect must be kept in mind.  We must remember not alone the skills and craftsmanship there but the very large number of young boys who served their apprenticeship there and have now taken up secure employment in other industries. Let us not look back and see the years of existence of this industry being just cast aside as if they made no contribution to the welfare of our economy.  Old established industries like Verolme Cork Dockyard are to close because of lack of Government action.  It is felt in Cork that no action is being taken by the Government to save this industry.  We know that there are labour relations problems in the dockyard, but I put it to the Minister that you will always get unrest among workers when there is no such thing as security in their employment.  In any industry where <Col N="669" /> workers are living from day to day without security in their employment you are bound to have unrest.  You have only to look at the number of places in this country at the moment where unrest exists because they have not got that security which is so important for workers to enable them to give their effort and dedication to the welfare of our industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also aware that this ship is unique.  I understand it is the only one of its kind in the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>That ship could have been sold at the price for which it was built and we could have built a similar ship in its place.  Let no one deny that.  That ship, so unique for its purpose, could have been sold and a further order could have been given to the dockyard to build another ship of similar design.  I am asking the Minister who is here now &mdash; he was not here this morning &mdash; what arrangement he is making to meet management to discuss a number of options which could ensure a continuation of this very old and important industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been many closures in the Cork region over the past couple of months and the Government were not directly involved with them. The appeals we made at that time fell on deaf ears, but the closure of Verolme Cork Dockyard is something that the Government can prevent with commitment and sincerity about the problems of the Cork area.  I am not asking the Government to prop up a lame duck but to become involved in the prevention of that closure.  I and many people, particularly the management of the dockyard, are convinced that the yard has a future if it can get over its present difficulties with co-operation from the Government. In the past on numerous occasions the dockyard had difficulties, but because Governments at that time realised the asset the dockyard was not alone to the Cork region but to the nation as a whole <Col N="670" /> and the part it was playing as a shipyard and its benefit to the nation, ensured the assistance necessary was given to the yard in order to enable it to continue to play its part, which is so important for all of us.</P>
      <P>Mention has been made by my colleagues of the skilled labour force that has been built up over the years.  If that is to be lost to this nation it will be a scandal, and it will be an indictment of the Government and the Minister if he allows it to happen.  Having met management this week and having listened to their side of the story, I am convinced more than ever that we must keep the dockyard open.  If the Minister says that ship building is not on because of the depression in ship building throughout the world I will accept that, but diversification can take place and the dockyard can continue to play a role in the repair of ships.  We are developing off-shore services, rigs are coming in here to develop off-shore oil and gas.  Ships, boats and service vessels are being used every day out of Cork port to service those rigs, and they can play a part if the dockyard is given the opportunity to diversify in co-operation with the Government.</P>
      <P>Financial assistance is needed.  The dockyard is due to close on 30 November and nobody would be owed a penny.  All the creditors, Fóir Teoranta and so on will be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there any concern in this country? Not a shipyard in the world, which has been mentioned here, is in this situation. Management are committed to keeping the dockyard open.  I say to the Minister here that he has an obligation not just to Cork but to the nation to ensure that that valuable service which it has played for many years in the development of our shipping is not allowed to close.  The work done there can stand up to any ship building in the world.  The ships built there are a credit to the workforce.  We are making this appeal and we are not being political. We met the management last Monday and they outlined the situation to us.  The Minister can play a part now to ensure that Cork Verolme Dockyard continues to play its part on behalf of the nation and <Col N="671" /> not add to the unemployment problem in Cork about which the Government and their local spokespersons have been expressing so much concern.  This is a project the Minister can do something about.  Other projects we mentioned were not the direct responsibility of the Minister, but we are testing the sincerity of the Government in regard to the Cork region this evening.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give this matter serious consideration.  He should meet those concerned in an effort to ensure that the boatyard continues to play its part in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated Government policy on this in the House on 1 June 1983, and it was to the effect that our policy would have to be geared to assisting the company to win orders on the open market.  To that end the Government were prepared to offer the maximum production and credit subsidies acceptable to the EC.  Those subsidies could cost the taxpayer £15 million on a £30 million individual building contract, and they were and have been available since to Verolme.  The Government were prepared to offer that amount of taxpayers' money, up to the very maximum allowed by the EC, if Verolme could win orders on the open market for ships.  They did not do so and, naturally, not having done so, closure now faces them.  That, unfortunately, is a direct consequence of the very serious situation which obtains in the world shipbuilding market at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that there is a gross excess of supply over demand in every sector of the world shipping fleet, with the result that laid-up shipping in 1983 exceeded all previous records.  In other words, shipping laid up and ready to enter the market if there is any improvement in rates represents 13 per cent of the entire fleet. That clearly indicates why people are not keen to build more ships.  Many ships are not in use but are waiting to go into use if there is any improvement in the market.  Frankly, and unfortunately, <Col N="672" /> Verolme were not able to win orders in that situation.</P>
    <P>I do not see how any more could be done.  It may be suggested that the Government should ignore the market situation and through some means give an order to Verolme to build a ship even though the market is as I have indicated. All Members, aware of the financial situation of B &amp; I and Irish Shipping, two State-owned companies, know they have not the capacity to place orders for ships at present.  Likewise, in so far as fishery protection vessels are concerned, the fact is that the Department of Defence and the European Commission accept that, in the light of protection measures initiated since 1978, the present mix of ships and aircraft, including the patrol vessel now being completed, will provide an adequate protection in the medium term. There is no immediate demand for a ship to be built under that heading either.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the wider markets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the wider markets I should like to point out that serious efforts were made, with the assistance of the Department of Foreign Affairs, by the shipyard to find orders for the specialist fishery protection vessel now being completed.  However, in spite of the best efforts made, no orders were forthcoming.  Unless somebody is prepared to pay for a ship there is no point in building it.  As I understand it, nobody, including people from the places mentioned by a senior colleague of the Deputy opposite was prepared to make any offer of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suggestions have been made that we should continue ship repairs at Verolme. This is the burden of the five options made by Verolme.  I am advised that the cash loss which would be sustained by the company in 1985 in so doing would be between £1.6 and £2.1 million and that this does not take into account depreciation. It would also be subject to the risk that the losses could be higher.  That money would have to be found by the taxpayer if that were to continue.  I do <Col N="673" /> not think Deputies can have such confidence in the market or, indeed, in the capacity of the taxpayer to find additional sums of money, that one could be justified in continuing next year to incur such losses in the hope that, perhaps, in the following year things might get better.  I do not believe there is evidence that the yard in its present condition, under its present system of ownership, would be capable of obtaining a different result.  One would be into a prospect of continuous and repeated injections of funds by the taxpayer which clearly the taxpayer cannot afford.</P>
    <P>There is also the added question of the dredging that would be necessary if the yard were to continue beyond the end of 1985, and that would amount to a further cost of £700,000.  In the light of all the foregoing I believe the only responsible action is to allow the company's plant to close.  It must be remembered that these decisions will be taken by a privately owned company.  The company's plan to close the yard should be allowed to proceed with a view to doing everything possible in the aftermath of the closure to attract a private sector interest to a renewed and viable ship repair operation on a new structural basis and on the basis of a new system of ownership.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we are not happy about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the only way viable jobs can be secured.  I do not believe that to prolong the present structure by the injection of more State funds on a drip-feed basis, such as Deputies opposite seem to be suggesting, would offer long-term viable jobs or a long-term viable future to anyone.  Regrettably it is the case that a clean break must be made so that conditions, hopefully, can be created in which, on a new basis, viable operations can recommence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding in respect of the proposals put up by the company in regard to repairs is that the prospective losses would be as I have described.  Those losses would have to be subscribed to by the State from taxpayers' resources, but that money is not available.  However, if after closure a third party can come in, adopting a different approach from the present company, and if that third party can recommence operations, that will be most welcome.  One is not in a position, I regret to say, to give any guarantees that that will happen.  Unfortunately, there is not the possibility of further taxpayers' money being made available in regard to the type of operation there at present.</P>

      <P>Ireland does not share bottom place with Greece in the EC table of Government funding of research and development. Ireland in fact occupies ninth place in the <Col N="587" /> table.  It has to be borne in mind that Ireland has little or no expenditure on research in the areas of space, nuclear or defence, unlike most other EC member countries who have a heavy commitment in these areas.  A welcome development is the recent upswing in research and development in industrial firms, which the Government would be concerned to develop further.</P>
      <P>In the matter of co-operation with European firms in the area of research and development, important successes have been achieved in the level of Irish participation in the ESPRIT programme (European Strategic Programme for R &amp; D in Information Technologies) and the EC energy programmes.  This level represents a more than adequate return on our investment in the programmes.  A similar situation applies in the case of participation by Irish firms in the work of the European Space Agency.</P>
      <P>New important EC programmes in biotechnology and in basic technological research in support of industry, particularly textiles, are in the pipeline.  These programmes will provide further opportunities for co-operation with European firms.

The Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act, <Col N="590" /> 1983, did not become law until July 1983 and this, and other factors which delayed the issue of demands for domestic water charges in urban areas in 1983, had a material influence on the amounts collected by the end of that year.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 440 and 441 together.  Action against a member state for overfishing in excess of its quota is primarily a matter for the Commission of the European Communities.</P>
      <P>I am informed that fishing for mackerel by the Netherlands in Community waters has been stopped because that country has reached its quota.  Indeed fishing by certain other member states for other quota species has also been stopped for the same reason.  I consider that such actions clearly demonstrate the importance of the quota system as a Community conservation measure and the need for its retention in an enlarged Community.</P>

The relevant equipment and material used in such installations is normally available from building and engineering suppliers.</P>

      <P>According to the yearbook of the Irish Aquaculture Association production of farmed oysters, mussels, salmon and rainbow trout in this country exceeded 7,000 tonnes in 1982 and exports were valued at almost IR£4 million.  Indications are that output for 1983 will be much higher.  I agree that there is considerable scope for increased production here and my aim is to encourage and accelerate that development.</P>

    <P>Substantial financial assistance is of course available for the development of fish farming.  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara operates a national mariculture grants scheme under which generous grants are <Col N="595" /> available for both pilot and commercial scale projects.  In areas under its jurisdiction Údarás na Gaeltachta operates a scheme under which grants of up to 60 per cent of capital expenditure are available for suitable fish farming projects. Grant assistance of up to 50 per cent of capital costs is also available from the EC under the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (FEOGA) for suitable commercial scale projects.  For freshwater fish farming grants are available from the Department of Agriculture under the farm modernisation scheme.</P>

      <P>While the purchase of the lands in question was originally under consideration as far back as 1979, it was not possible to finalise the transactions as the vendors did not have proper title to the lands.  However, following their recent registration as owners, negotiations for purchase have been reopened and subject to price agreement now being reached there will be no avoidable delay on the part of my Department in completing the deal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. O'Toole)</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of grants payable under this scheme each year depends on the degree of planting undertaken. While I am not clear as to the basis for the figure of £5.4 million mentioned, it is true that the response to the scheme to date has been generally disappointing despite the attractive grants offered.  In this context the absence of a strong private forestry tradition is no doubt a major contributory factor.  The Department is continuing its efforts to publicise the scheme.</P>

      <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, empowers local authorities to develop or to secure the development of land and to take specific measures to facilitate industrial and commercial development.  In addition to and arising from their statutory role in planning the physical infrastructure of their areas, and thus providing a necessary basis for local and regional development, local authorities are closely involved with development agencies such as the Industrial Development Authority which have a regional dimension to their activities.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the primary thrust of the Government's development policy is contained in the recently published plan <i>Building on Reality, 1985-1987.</i> Within the context of that plan it is the Government's intention that the development potential of all areas be maximised by the fullest co-operation between local and regional interests and official development agencies.</P>
      <P>Development at any level requires, <i>inter alia,</i> the active involvement and support of all interests at that level.  The Government, therefore, welcome such involvement and are pleased at all times to receive submissions from local and other interests.</P>

      <P>The domiciliary care allowance is payable only in respect of severely physically or mentally handicapped children between the ages of two and 16 who are living at home and who require from another person constant care or supervision substantially greater than that which would normally be required by a child of the same age or sex.  A person in respect of whom a domiciliary care allowance is payable would not normally be in full time education after the age of 16.</P>
      <P>The regulations governing payment of a disabled persons maintenance allowance require that a person must be medically certified as being substantially handicapped in undertaking work of a kind which, if he were not suffering from the disability, would be suited to his age, experience and qualifications.  Persons in full time education would not therefore meet these criteria.</P>
      <P>Obviously the situation is not a very satisfactory one and I have asked my Department to examine the position of young people who remain on at school to see whether their position could be improved.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether the prescribed relatives' allowance applies to persons aged between 16 and 66 who are in receipt of disabled persons' maintenance allowance, where the breadwinner does not work but devotes his time to looking after the disabled person; and, if not, if he would not consider this is substantially cheaper for the State than having a paralysed person in State care.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The prescribed relatives' allowance does not apply to persons in receipt of disabled persons' maintenance allowance.  A disabled persons's maintenance allowance is payable to a person, who by reason of a specified disability is, in the opinion of a medical officer of a health board, substantially handicapped in undertaking work of a kind which, if he were not suffering from the disability, would be suited to his age, experience and qualifications. A person in receipt of a DPMA would not necessarily be in need of full time care and attention by another person.</P>
      <P>With regard to whether the costs of paying additional allowances would be cheaper than State care, the position is that it would be impossible to say with certainty that in all cases it would be less expensive.  It would be necessary to know in individual cases what the degree of handicap is and the type of care and attendance required, before making definitive statements on costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The extract from my speech to which the Deputy refers conveys my belief that as the output of dairy products by major producers such as the Community and the United States is more closely aligned to market demands for these products, there must necessarily be an improvement in the world dairy market.  It will obviously be some time yet before a perceptible market improvement occurs and prices rise from their current depressed levels.  However, given recent predictions that milk output this year in both the Community and the United States will show a 3 per cent decline when compared with 1983, it is clear that we are already on the road to restoring makrket balance.</P>
      <P>In the longer term, this is in the best interest of all concerned with the Irish dairy industry and I naturally hope that the industry will take full advantage of the improved market conditions when these come about.</P>

      <P>As announced in the National Plan, the Government have decided to make a fresh onslaught on bovine disease, particularly TB.  Substantially increased funds, including an additional provision for stock replacement, will be made available over the next three years, subject to a number of radical changes in the existing schemes.  These changes, set out in paragraph 7.36 of the plan, include: direct nomination by my Department of the veterinary surgeons to carry out all testing (other than 30 day testing); payment directly to the veterinary surgeon who carries out the test; removal of infected animals for slaughter within ten days of notification; establishment of a central epidemiology unit in my Department; tighter official supervision of trading at marts; and strict enforcement of all procedures and prosecution in all cases of detected breaches of the law relating to disease eradication.  I believe that these measures will enhance the prospects for a successful eradication campaign.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="626" /> for Agriculture if he plans to involve his Department directly in efforts to replace imported food products with home-produced products; the steps he has taken so far; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is constantly involved in efforts to replace imported food with home-produced food products.</P>
      <P>One of the problems identified in various reports on import substitution is the poor presentation and marketing of Irish food in comparison with imported products, particularly in the vegetable sector.  Various steps have been taken to remedy this situation.  A sum of £100,000 has been provided this year for the establishment of a national potato co-operative. Following discussions between my Department, ICOS and the IFA, the Irish Potato Farmers Co-operative Society Ltd was registered last March and 12 potato producer co-operative groups throughout the country have also been registered.  A further sum of £120,000 has been provided for priming grants in the potato sector to enable firms to qualify for FEOGA grants under Regulation 355/77.  I have also received Government approval for the introduction of legislation for the registration of growers and packers of potatoes for sale and I expect to introduce this legislation in the House in the present session.  These measures are designed to bring about better organisation of potato production and marketing and should enable Irish suppliers to compete more effectively with imported produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards horticultural products generally, my Department is providing £75,000 over a three year period towards the salary and administrative costs of a market co-ordinator for the glasshouse industry.  This should help to regulate the marketing of horticultural products.  The Minister of State at my Department has also held meetings with supermarket owners with a view to (a) identifying the gaps that exist in the supply of Irish food products to retail outlets and (b) seeing what can be done to eliminate these gaps. These meetings centred mainly on horticultural <Col N="627" /> products and further meetings are planned.</P>
    <P>With regard to import substitution of food products generally, the recently published national plan accords a high priority to import substitution in the food sector.  In the consideration of applications for industrial grants, priority will, in future, be given to products involving import substitution.  In this regard it might be noted that many of the projects aimed at import substitution in the food sector also qualify for FEOGA grants under Regulation 355/77, which can bring grants up to 75 per cent in the disadvantaged areas of the West of Ireland and 50 per cent elsewhere.  In the final analysis, however, it is a matter for the industry itself to avail of the very satisfactory range of grants available from national and EC sources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he feels that the availability of one agricultural office for every 11,000 farm holdings in the west, compared to one office for every 3,300 farm holdings in the rest of the country is having an adverse effect on the number of western farmers availing of the western package and other schemes designed to increase the productivity of farming in the west and the action he proposes to take in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the number of Department of Agriculture offices in the west of Ireland, and the number of officials operating from these offices, are sufficient to provide an effective service to farmers wishing to avail of the western package and other schemes designed to increase the productivity of farming in the west.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture the reason no payment has been made to date under the calf-to-beef scheme part of the western package, for which £8 million has been provided over a ten year period from 1981; and if he agrees that the calf-to-beef scheme would be more beneficial if the money was paid as a direct bonus, as farmers would not then have to borrow before becoming eligible for aid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The calf to beef scheme did not come into operation until June 1982.  The interest subsidy is payable at the end of the first and second years following receipt by ACOT of a completed claim form together with evidence of compliance with the terms of the scheme.  Making allowance for the time needed to process applications and check claims the first payments under the scheme will not be made until 1985.  Interest in the scheme has however, been disappointing and consideration will be given in the EC review next year to changes needed to render it more effective.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="634" /> for Agriculture the reason, even though the western package provided £7.9 million per year over a ten year period for land improvement concerning hill and mountain pasture improvements, intensive and less intensive lowland reclamation (other than drainage), only £4.6 million has been spent since 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Work on intensive lowland reclamation under the Programme for Western Development (Western Package) is well on target.  The same cannot be said, however, for the less intensive lowland reclamation or for work on the improvement of mountain and hill pasture and divided commonage where the size of the unit on which work is undertaken is only about half of that envisaged and uptake has been less than anticipated.  The programme is due for review by the Commission of the EEC in 1985 and consideration will be given to any changes considered necessary in these elements to make them more attractive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture the steps he plans to take to correct the imbalance which has been allowed to evolve in the administration of the western package between 1981 and 1984, namely, the fact that the programme for western development is having little success in achieving its primary aim of boosting agricultural production in the west of Ireland, as spending on direct farm investment is running way behind target compared with spending on other parts of the scheme such as infrastructure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture the reason, even though it was planned to spend £13.7 million each year for ten years under the western package to increase agricultural output in the west of Ireland by direct farm aid covering on-farm development, land improvement and the promotion of calf-to-beef schemes, only £4.8 million has been allocated to farmers in the three-year period since 1981.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 485 and 487 together.  Each of the measures comprised in the western package was designed with the same objective in mind, that is the stimulation of the development of agriculture in the west of Ireland. The infrastructural elements are an essential part of the package and their success is vital to the success of the package as a whole.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my replies to his specific questions in relation to the land improvement, orientation of production and calf to beef elements of the package.  I am hopeful that in the course of next year's review of the package changes can be made in these schemes which will render them more attractive and more effective in achieving the overall objective.</P>

      <P>The orientation of agricultural production element of the programme for western development (western package) did not come into operation until June 1982, and while the response to date has been below expectations, there is evidence of increased farmer interest in the current year.  The programme is due for review by the Commission of the EC in 1985 and consideration will be given to changes in the orientation of production element with a view to making it more attractive.</P>

    <P>To date, 1,371 of these farmers have satisfactorily completed the prescribed periods of compliance with the requirement of not selling milk (five years in the case of the non-marketing scheme and four years in the case of the dairy herd conversion scheme), while 15 farmers have been disqualified because they resumed milk production before the end of the compliance period.</P>
    <P>My Department do not have information on how many of the 1,371 farmers have resumed the production and sale of milk as they are entitled to do or how many of the other applicants have resumed milk production since the date of their last check inspection.  If any of the latter are found on inspection to have done so, they will of course, be disqualified.</P>
