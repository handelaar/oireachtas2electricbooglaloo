      <P>The Deputy will be aware that on 20 October 1983 the Minister for the Environment informed the Joint Committee on Building Land of the Government's view that the Attorney General, in view of his constitutional position as legal adviser to the Executive, could not provide legal advice to the Joint Committee.  The complexity of the constitutional issues raised by the Kenny Report was such that the examination of these issues by successive Attorneys General was not completed until August 1983, when a 69 page advice was made available to the Minister for the Environment. The Attorney General offered a summary of his advice on a personal and confidential basis to the committee but this offer was not accepted.  However, the advice of the legal adviser to the Department of the Environemnt was made available to the committee.  In view <Col N="1498" /> of the complexity of the issues to be decided on, I am satisfied that there was no unreasonable delay.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that it took a very long time to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; and that such lack of action might be seen by the public as a stalling exercise?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it will not be seen in that light under any circumstances as the issues involved are extremely complex. They were undertaken by three Attorneys General over a period of changes of Government and were brought to a conclusion last August by the present Attorney General.  The committee were informed on the resumption of the Dáil in October.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>As chairman of the committee which was kept waiting seven months for the Attorney General's opinion on the contents of the Kenny Report, could the Taoiseach make it clear whether the Attorney General is legally precluded from giving advice to any group other than the Government as it now seems that it was wrong for the Minister to have indicated to the committee at an early stage that the Attorney General's advice would be made available to them?  This has happened in this Dáil on two occasions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A question, please, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that Deputy Quinn, when he was Minister, also gave advice to another committee to the effect that the Attorney General's opinion would be made available to the committee hearing the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1983, which was sent to a Special Committee of the House? On two occasions Government Ministers indicated that the Attorney General's advice would be made available to a committee of this House.  That opinion was not subsequently made available and the reason given was that the Attorney General could not legally give advice to anybody <Col N="1499" /> except the Government.  Would the Taoiseach avail of this opportunity to state the correct position so that we will not be led astray again by Government Ministers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue did not arise until relatively recently with the expansion of the committee system in the Houses of the Oireachtas and, consequently, had not come up for decision. That accounts for the fact that Deputy Ray Burke when he was Minister in May 1982 made the offer of the Attorney General's advice to this committee.  When Deputy Quinn was Minister he repeated the offer in March 1983.  He was relying on the fact that the offer had been made by the previous administration.  Subsequently, when advice was prepared and put forward it became clear that the Attorney General can only advise the Government formally.  However, he offered on a personal and confidential basis a summary of his advice to the committee and endeavoured to be as helpful as he could within the limits of his office. The position, which was confused originally by Deputy Ray Burke when he was Minister, has now been clarified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Barrett,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dún Laoghaire):</i> There were 6,468 persons on the live register at all local employment exchanges in County Galway on 2 January 1981, of whom 2,772 were registered at the Galway city employment exchange.  The corresponding figures on 31 December 1982 were 9,292 and 4,419 respectively.</P>
      <P>A special analysis of the live register according to area of residence is carried out on a quarterly basis for the months of February, May, August and November. On 18 November 1983, the latest date available, there were 9,901 persons on the live register at all local employment offices in County Galway, of whom 4,780 were registered at Galway city employment exchange.  Of the 4,780 persons on the live register at the Galway city exchange some 2,600 were resident in Galway city and the remainder were resident in other areas of County Galway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been told today that on 18 November 1983 there were 9,901 persons unemployed.  Yet in a question I put down two weeks ago I was informed that the latest figure available was 10,169 people unemployed in the county on 30 December 1983 and I wish to know how the Minister can reconcile those two figures.  The unemployment <Col N="1502" /> figure on 31 December 1981 was 6,823 but in the reply I got two weeks ago I was informed by the Minister it was 7,630.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> There is some confusion here.  The reply given to the previous question tabled by the Deputy did not refer to area of residence and I think that is where the confusion arises.  I must admit I was slightly confused myself until I went into the matter more deeply.  In reply to the Deputy's question today, I repeat that a special analysis of the live register according to area of residence is carried out on a quarterly basis.  The figure of 10,169 represented people on the live register at all local employment offices in County Galway on 30 December 1983.  The analysis with regard to area of residence is carried out on a quarterly basis and we do not yet have that analysis for December 1983. I am giving the Deputy the latest figures for area of residence, which is November 1983.  The figure for December 1983 is a total figure for the county and is not broken down into area of residence.  The confusion here is that people who sign on at employment exchanges need not necessarily be resident in the city in which they register.  In other words, a person from County Galway can register at the city exchange but that does not imply that he is a resident of Galway city.  It is merely a question of convenience that he registers in the city.  The figures given to the Deputy on the last occasion were accurate but they were not in relation to area of residence.  The figures were in relation to the total number of unemployed in the whole county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State accept that in the two-year period from January 1982 to January 1984 there was almost a 40 per cent increase in the number of unemployed for County Galway? Does he consider this is an acceptable increase?  Are there any proposals to do anything about this level of increase?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he is aware of the practice of some firms in letting full-time staff go and replacing them by young people on work experience programmes financed by AnCO; the steps his Department are taking to end this practice; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Work experience programmes, as such, are not undertaken by AnCO.  However, in-company training forms part of some of AnCO's training schemes for the unemployed and is designed to complement the learning that takes place when people are in full-time training.  The maximum period of such training is at present four weeks.  It is AnCO policy not to give an employer a succession of such trainees which would prevent permanent vacancies from being filled.  It is also AnCO policy not to place such trainees with employers who let go full-time staff.  I endorse this approach and can confirm that a similar guideline is operated by the National Manpower Service of my Department in the operation of their work experience programme.</P>

      <P>While the Minister may not have complaints about full-time employees being replaced by trainees, has he complaints of companies or individuals employing people who replace trainees by other trainees, thereby avoiding the possibility of filling permanent vacancies?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concern of the House about the possible abuse by some employers of this scheme in the form of cheap labour and the exploitation of young workers.  For that reason the guidelines exist.  From the information available to me here I have no specific complaints.  It is not AnCO policy to provide a succession of trainees to a company and that would seem to close off the possibility referred to by the Deputy. However, I repeat the offer I made to Deputy De Rossa, namely, if any Deputy has specific complaints I would be more than pleased to act on them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The enterprise allowance scheme was introduced on a pilot basis on 19 December 1983, and originally was limited to 500 places.  However, because of the very positive response to the scheme, the Government decided to extend it and not to place any ceiling on the number of participants.</P>
      <P>To date, over 1,000 persons have been accepted for participation of whom 825 were actually in the scheme on 30 March 1984.  Due to the time lag between application and approval, there were no participants in the scheme in 1983.</P>
      <P>With regard to age, about 20 per cent of participants are under 25 years of age. I believe that this is a reasonable level of participation from the under 25 year age group having regard to the fact that the group represents just under one-third of the total registered unemployed and that they are unlikely to have the same experience of business as older workers. As the scheme is directed in the main at persons who have been in receipt of unemployment benefit/assistance for at least 13 weeks it is most unlikely that students attending VEC or regional college courses would be eligible to participate.</P>
      <P>The Government have also decided, on the recommendation of the Task Force on Employment, to extend the scheme to provide for the capitalisation of pay-related unemployment benefit where deemed necessary and subject to certain conditions.  The details of the new incentive are being finalised at present and when this is done I will publicise the scheme more extensively to ensure that all eligible persons are aware of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to tell the Deputy that a response of 20 per cent of participants under the age of 25 who want to start their own business, having regard to the level of experience and self-confidence required, was not an unreasonable one.  I would have been happier if it had been greater but I do not regard a response from one-in-five of those under the age of 25 as being a very poor one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the terms of the scheme were made clear to those of that age group? Will the Minister explain to the House the system of advertising the scheme that was carried out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The system of advertising was the normal one used by the Government when publicising any scheme.  Our initial anticipation was that it would be run as a trial project and hence the reason for the ceiling of 500.  In fact, the response was well in excess of any of the expectations that have been put forward.  That was the reason for the very quick decision to lift the ceiling altogether.  There is a continuous demand at all National Manpower Offices.  In relation to trying to assist young workers under the age of 25 to take up the scheme, I should like to tell the House that when we complete the <Col N="1507" /> review after the scheme has been running for six months we will see if there are ways we can increase that take-up.  It is a bit early yet to make substantial changes in relation to the scheme.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That question would be better answered within the framework of the co-ordination exercise being undertaken between AnCO, the NMS and the YEA.  The enterprise allowance scheme will be available to students who come through the third level sector, have a particular skill and who meet the requirement of being 13 weeks on the register.

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Taoiseach made a statement in Cork about this matter two months ago to the effect that the scheme would be open rather than confined to 500 young people from different regions?  Is the Minister aware that in the course of that statement the Taoiseach said that the PRSI may be granted as a lump sum payment at the beginning to be used for capital purposes? When did the Government reach a decision about this matter?  Was that decision published in the national newspapers or through the various Government agencies?  In the course of his reply the Minister told the House that he would be publishing details of the scheme later and I should like to know how much longer applicants will have to wait before being made aware of the exact PRSI lump sum payment.  Is the Minister aware that many applicants are anxious to get that definite statement from the Department?</P>

Will the Minister make personnel available to travel to such schools to make details of the scheme known to all pupils? Is it an absolute requirement that a person should fulfil the regulation in regard to 13 weeks?  In the course of his reply the Minister said that in the main the scheme was directed at persons who had been in receipt of unemployment assistance for at least 13 weeks.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour whether in view of the fact that the proportion of disabled persons employed in the public sector declined between 1981 and 1982, he will consider reviewing the policy of moving towards a quota of 3 per cent of total employment by 1985, and replace it with a policy of setting an annual quota for the proportion of new recruits into the public service who will be drawn from disabled workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>While the number of disabled persons employed in the public sector has increased significantly since the introduction of the quota, I accept that the current restrictions on recruitment in the public sector have had adverse effects on the speed with which the 3 per cent quota can be achieved.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied, however, that the suggestion put forward by the Deputy would improve the prospects of disabled persons, I consider that it would be better to preserve and expand the many special arrangements made by the various public sector agencies to recruit disabled persons. For my part I will avail myself of every opportunity to encourage the public sector to increase its intake of disabled persons and I will keep the arrangements under constant review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not concerned that as many as 66 per cent of the people classified as disabled in the public service work force actually became disabled after recruitment &mdash; in other words, they were not recruited as disabled persons?  Does he not therefore see the advantage of setting a quota for new recruits rather than for the stock so that <Col N="1511" /> we would give people who have been disabled from birth or from an early age an opportunity to find employment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some merit in what the Deputy is suggesting.  However, at present we are more inclined to the view that the 3 per cent quota system is the most effective way to deal with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that between 1981 and 1982 the percentage of disabled persons in the public service declined from 1 ¼ to barely over 1.  That was the reply to parliamentary question in June 1982 and November 1983.  Therefore, the 3 per cent quota does not appear to be working and I am asking the Minister to have another look at the possibility of setting a quota for new recruits rather than a quota for the stock of employees, which is simply not working today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the criteria being used by his Department to monitor AnCO training programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Essentially AnCO training programmes are monitored by my Department on the basis of financial and labour market criteria.  On the financial side AnCO's programmes are monitored by reference to unit costs per trainee and per training day.  Cost elements are examined annually to identify movements and comparisons across programmes to achieve economies where possible.  At <Col N="1512" /> the same time, programme expenditure is also examined to establish how sources of revenue other than the Exchequer can be maximised, e.g., the European Social Fund, employer contributions and service fees.</P>
      <P>On the labour market side, programmes are monitored from two viewpoints. Since the establishment of AnCO in 1967 primary consideration has focused on how training services responded to the demand side of the labour market.  Programmes have been monitored to see how they have responded to skill shortages, emerging occupational-skill trends and industrial development.  The placement rate of trainees off many training programmes and research by relevant agencies and industrial interests have been used as indications of demand.</P>
      <P>More recently increasing attention has been placed on the responsiveness of training programmes to the needs of the supply side of the labour market of which the unemployment level is an important measure.  The Youth Employment Agency Act, 1981, has served in particular to address the need for training for unemployed young persons, especially the disadvantaged.  Programmes are also monitored to identify if they contribute towards equalising opportunities for other special categories including women and long-term unemployed.  The contribution of programmes to developing entrepreneurial potential or indeed rescuing or safeguarding employment has also been a consideration in overviewing training services by AnCO.</P>
      <P>Arising out of the considerable expansion in AnCO programmes and resources in recent times some difficulties have arisen in ensuring effective monitoring by my Department.  For these reasons, the Government decided to have an inter-Departmental review of AnCO undertaken. This is in hands and the outcome will assist in establishing more effective monitoring criteria and procedures for the future in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the inter-Departmental monitoring idea.  Would the Minister not agree that the long-term <Col N="1513" /> training needs of the economy are often not measured by the percentage of trainees immediately placed?  Although the Minister is looking at wider things, does he not feel that the concentration of many AnCO training places in apprenticeship areas is hardly responsive to the skill shortages that will be felt in the coming years?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if certification of standards of training achieved can and should be applied to courses run by AnCO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Certification already applies in the case of long-duration courses which are operated to achieve City and Guilds or other recognised standards.  In addition, AnCO will introduce soon a new certificate of competence for all apprenticeship courses.  This will be in lieu of the certificate of completion of apprenticeship which apprentices currently receive on completion of the statutory period of training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are problems, however, about applying certification to a range of short-term general courses developed by AnCO in response to the urgent needs of recent times.  These courses are designed to bring trainees to high levels of knowledge, skill and attitude, in order to achieve specific training objectives.  Each training course has its own particular training objective.  The courses are <Col N="1514" /> designed to suit individuals in all age groups with educational levels varying from no qualifications to third level in a small number of cases.</P>
    <P>Training programmes contain a strong element which provides a second chance for people who have been made redundant or who have been unemployed for some time or who have left the educational system and have not succeeded in obtaining jobs.  There are no recognised standards which could be used as a basis for certification of these courses.  AnCO, however, would respond to developments in certification in the field of adult education which has been under consideration by the NCEA and education authorities for some time.</P>
    <P>I might add that the question of certification of standards of training has been a European Community concern for some time, and the Council Resolution of 11 July 1983 concerning vocational training policies in the 1980s calls on member states, among other things, to make increased efforts to promote attainment of the objective of ensuring that training programmes lead to recognised qualifications.  The Commission for its part is asked to continue with the activities it is undertaking to continue innovation and the qualitative improvement of training systems in the member states, and to make an interim report to the Council before 30 June 1987 and final report before 31 December 1989 on the progress made in implementing the resolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think that a confusion of quality will arise in the minds of employers who will be taking on people who come off short courses if there is not some form of certification to give the employers an indication of the standard of competence that has been reached, even in some rough way if not in accordance with recognised standards?  Is the Minister not concerned that after a number of months have elapsed the people who participated in these courses often find that the value of the courses is of limited use to them in approaching employers &mdash; that once they move away from the AnCO training <Col N="1515" /> centres the courses do not have much value for them without some form of certificate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's desire to get some form of certification but the problem is the method and system that would be agreed upon and established because AnCO are the only body in this area.  As regards his second question, I am not aware of the difficulties to which he referred but if it is a problem, I will ask AnCO to have a look at it to see in what way it could be responded to.</P>

      <P>Arrangements for followup action on participants in training and work experience programmes are being developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present position is as follows: first, in 1984, AnCO will instal a placement monitoring system which will sample individual training categories with a view to obtaining data on placement at the termination of training and four months later.  Data will be collected on whether the job is permanent, part-time, or temporary, and the relevance of <Col N="1516" /> the job to the training undergone in AnCO.  Subject to the availability of resources longer-term assessment of placement is envisaged.</P>
    <P>Second, CERT have agreed to collect data reflecting the position of trainees after one year's placement in respect of participants on both formal training programmes and programmes for unemployed persons.  Third, The National Manpower Service check on participants in the work experience programme within two months of completion of individual programmes in order to establish whether or not they have secured employment.  It is hoped that the introduction of computerisation will enable more detailed checks of the type suggested by the Deputy to be undertaken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to commend the Minister on those changes but would he consider having a simple standard applied to all the agencies instead of as he suggests, AnCO after four months, CERT after one year and the National Manpower Service after two months?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There are numerous difficulties in forecasting and providing for future skill needs.  The present apprenticeship programme is only one source of skill provision.  Given the role of employers and trade unions in the regulation of apprenticeship through AnCO and in view of the close co-operation between the manpower and industrial development authorities, the present apprenticeship programme is in a good position to make a major contribution to providing for the skill needs of the Irish labour force for the years ahead.  I am satisfied also that AnCO have the expertise in conjunction with the education authorities to <Col N="1517" /> respond to the changing skills requirements of the economy and, in consultation with a number of bodies, to review such needs regularly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister concerned that the recent intake of persons into the apprenticeship programmes shows that more than half are in the motor mechanic trade and the construction industry which, at present, are not likely to be sources of big employment increases in the future?  Does he agree that the style of motor mechanics is changing rapidly and that the numbers needed and working methods are likely to militate against vacancies in that area? In view of the recent figures which show that may be up to one-third of persons coming off their first year AnCO apprenticeships are not being placed does he consider that we should shift apprentices into the newer high technology areas rather than the traditional apprenticeships?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the latter part of the question, the figures the Deputy referred to &mdash; the non-placement of one-third from existing courses &mdash; raises the question whether AnCO courses are appropriate to the labour needs of the job market: that is reflected in the first part of his question about motor mechanics.  The establishment of these courses and the time it takes to run an apprenticeship is not something that can be readily changed and quickly turned around.  This goes back to the basic difficulty of trying to forecast labour and manpower needs in a workplace environment which is changing very rapidly, as we have seen over the last three years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour whether he is satisfied that the Youth Employment Agency has effective means at its disposal to influence <Col N="1520" /> the policies of other agencies; and whether a subcontracting relationship would make co-ordination more effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Youth Employment Agency have effective means at their disposal to influence the policies of other agencies involved in the area of employment, training and work experience for young people.  The Youth Employment Agency Act, 1981, confers a statutory role on the agency for the co-ordination, development and integration of all schemes for the training and employment of young people.  In practice the Youth Employment Agency influence the policies of other agencies through consultation with individual agencies and through submissions to the Minister for Labour regarding the annual allocation of the proceeds of the youth employment levy and proposals on programmes for the training and employment of young people.  There have already been changes in a number of these programmes as a result of Youth Employment Agency recommendations.</P>
      <P>As the agency were set up in 1982 their co-ordinating role is naturally still being developed and in fact one of the agency's priorities for 1984 is the strengthening of their co-ordinating function.  The Government are fully committed to supporting the Youth Employment Agency and to ensuring their effectiveness in pursuing statutory functions.</P>
      <P>As the agency in general look to existing manpower authorities, such as AnCO and the NMS, to implement programmes rather than themselves assuming an executive role, it could be said that a relationship similar to sub-contracting already exists between the agency and the other institutions involved.  By largely freeing themselves from the demands and constraints of the day-to-day execution of programmes the agency are in a position to pursue actively their broader responsibility for the overall co-ordination, development and integration of youth employment and training schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a broader level, I may say that the Government are concerned about possible duplication and overlaps between the <Col N="1521" /> various agencies charged with responsibility for education and training.  As a result the Minister of State at the Department of Labour was also assigned to the Department of Education in December 1983 and given additional responsibilities for the co-ordination of education and training activities.  The Government subsequently decided that the Minister of State should, in conjunction with the Ministers for Labour and Education, prepare a number of agreed recommendations on issues arising as soon as possible. Already the Minister of State has met all the relevant organisations and has received written submissions from them. He hopes to be in a position to report to the Government in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the other semi-State bodies which are ultimately answerable to the Minister can, if they so wish, ignore the efforts of the YEA at co-ordination? Would he not agree that a formal sub-contracting arrangement whereby the YEA would specify the tasks to be done for which they would pay would be very different from the present system whereby the Youth Employment Agency in the case of AnCO make a contribution towards the cost of courses for training young persons under the age of 25?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the agency's priorities for 1984 is the strengthening of their co-ordinating function, which I think would meet the spirit of Deputy Bruton's supplementary question.  The co-ordinating exercise which is being undertaken by his constituency colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Labour, will strengthen the hand of the Government in ensuring that the wasteful duplication that perhaps occurred in the past can be eliminated to the benefit of young people.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would allow me to reply to his question and respond to his concern.  This is one of the reasons for the setting up by the Government of the co-ordinating group under the responsibility of the Minister of State. <Col N="1523" /> That report is almost finalised and discussions have taken place with all the bodies involved.  We are hopeful that we will be in a position very soon to provide for a co-ordinated structure that will avoid some of the problems about which many Deputies have complained.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister spell out exactly what those ways are?

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if, given the findings of recent studies on Irish manpower policy, he believes the National Manpower Service should have as its primary function the provision of opportunities for long-term unemployed; and if this assignment would alter the character and administration of schemes aimed at disadvantaged groups in the labour force i.e. work experience training projects; employment incentive scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Manpower Service were established in 1971 with the general objective of assisting in the placement of all job seekers but have more recently become heavily involved in administering a number of schemes to raise the demand for labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Manpower Service are <Col N="1524" /> conscious of the special problems of the long-term unemployed and some schemes are directly targeted on them. For example, they benefit from the specific provision in the employment incentive scheme providing for payment of a higher premium to employers who take on persons who are over 25 and who are on the live register for more than six months.  The long-term unemployed under 25 years of age also benefit from the general rule giving priority to those over six months unemployed in submissions for schemes funded from the youth employment levy.</P>
    <P>I accept that the NMS must give increasing attention to the long-term unemployed.  While I am not convinced that the provision of opportunities for this category should be the service's primary function, this is an issue which I am examining in my current review of the objectives and programmes of the various manpower agencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the Williams Report which indicated that some of the schemes, particularly those for the longer-term unemployed, were getting less than the full heart of the various agencies administering them, would the Minister not consider that they should be focused in some single agency which would have as their prime target the providing of a service for the unemployed?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the measures the Government are taking, or intend to take, to ensure that employees of contract cleaning agencies, used to clean Government offices, are paid fair wages and given acceptable conditions of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The cleaning of Government offices is carried out by three categories of cleaners viz. full-time cleaners, part-time cleaners and contract cleaners. Where contract cleaners are used responsibility for availing of their services rests with the individual Departments concerned, but the remuneration and conditions of employment of the cleaners in this category are matters for negotiation between the cleaning firms and their employees.</P>
      <P>In response to an application from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions the Labour Court has had under consideration the establishment of a Joint Labour Committee for the contract cleaning industry in the city and county of Dublin. Such a committee would be empowered under the Industrial Relations Acts to submit proposals to the Labour Court fixing minimum rates of remuneration and regulating conditions of employment of workers in the industry.  The court may then proceed to incorporate these proposals in an Employment Regulation Order which carries statutory force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The court has already concluded all the specified procedures under the Industrial Relations Acts, including the holding of an inquiry to consider the establishment <Col N="1526" /> of the Joint Labour Committee.

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been notified that under Standing Order No. 38 the Taoiseach proposes to make a statement relating to the incursion into our jurisdiction by members of the RUC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to put on the record of the House developments arising out of the allegations made in court in Belfast last week that an incursion into our jurisdiction took place by members of the RUC in December 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On learning of this statement on 30 March, the British Ambassador was called to the Department of Foreign Affairs and formally reminded that any action in our jurisdiction by security <Col N="1581" /> forces from any other state would be unacceptable to the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>Following the announcement of the verdict in the trial of Constable Robinson, the allegation of a &ldquo;cover-up&rdquo; was raised at a further meeting with the Ambassador in the Department of Foreign Affairs at which other aspects of the affair were also raised.</P>
    <P>Following consideration of the information then available and in the absence abroad of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who was on an official visit to the Holy See, I asked the British Ambassador to come to see me on 5 April.  I told him that the Government viewed the statement made by Constable Robinson in court that the RUC had operated in this State with deep concern and as a very serious departure from normal rules of inter-State conduct, harmful to the spirit and the practice of security co-operation and damaging to Anglo-Irish relations.</P>
    <P>The Ambassador expressed his Government's concern and formally conveyed their apologies.  He said that it is, and will continue to be, RUC policy, enshrined in explicit instructions, that members of the RUC should not cross the Border while on duty.  He said that the British Government are very concerned and regret that these instructions should have apparently been violated.</P>
    <P>The Ambassador added further that the question of possible criminal and/or disciplinary proceedings arises, and that that issue cannot be prejudged until the necessary inquiries have been carried out.  I expressed concern that the inquiries should be expeditiously carried out and that the Irish Government should be kept fully informed in relation to them. It had been my intention to make no further comment on this matter before the results of the investigation by the British authorities had been given to us.</P>
    <P>I regret, however, that a statement made by the Chief Constable of the RUC, Sir John Hermon, on Saturday, 7 April, made it necessary to make further approaches to the British authorities. These approaches were made on three separate occasions since the Chief Constable issued his statement, the first being on the same Saturday afternoon.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1582" /> In the course of his statement about matters arising from the trial and acquittal of Constable Robinson, the Chief Constable expressed his belief that there had been no criminal conspiracy to cover up.  We have told the British authorities that we can only regard this assertion as an extraordinary prejudgment of the investigation itself.</P>
    <P>We have further told the British authorities that, while we can understand the Chief Constable's statement that there is a critical and proper need to protect operational methods and sources, we could not accept that it would be proper to misrepresent the circumstances in which people have been killed.  We have said that we believe the Chief Constable's statement in this respect to have reinforced existing concern.  We have, moreover, put it to the British authorities that this statement is not helpful to the atmosphere in which security co-operation takes place.</P>
    <P>We have also said to the British authorities that we find unsatisfactory the Chief Constable's reference to the incursion which took place.  As I have already indicated publicly, the British Ambassador has said that there are explicit instructions within the RUC against such incursions and that these instructions were apparently breached on this occasion to the regret of the British authorities.  The failure of the Chief Constable to advert to these instructions and to the fact that they had been breached was unhelpful.</P>
    <P>I have sought an explanation as to what efforts were made by the RUC to contact the Garda Síochána on 12 December 1982 before, during or after the incursion. The British authorities have said that they are unable, at present, to offer any explanation but that the matter is now subject to further inquiry.  They have also indicated that it is a matter of regret to them that no contact was made by the RUC.</P>
    <P>In response to further inquiries, we have been informed by the British authorities that neither they nor the RUC are aware of any other occasions on which members of the RUC or other Northern Ireland security forces have made unauthorised operational crossings. <Col N="1583" /> I have also sought and been given an assurance that no members of the Northern Ireland security forces will cross the Border in an unauthorised operational role.</P>
    <P>The Chief Constable's statement of Saturday last was, in my opinion, a departure from the normal standard which should apply when an investigation is under way and a departure, moreover, from the spirit of security co-operation. So far as the Irish Government are concerned, we now await from the British authorities the results of their investigations.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, last Sunday's atrocious murder of Mary Travers, and the attack on her father as they returned from Mass, emphasise the continuing need for close co-operation between the security forces, North and South, to combat violence.</P>

    <P>It is important to try to assess that statement by the British Ambassador calmly and objectively because while the <Col N="1584" /> British Ambassador was making that statement to the Taoiseach the head of the RUC, the Chief Constable, was aware of and subsequently stated something which is in complete contradiction to that assurance. In his statement the Chief Constable said that at least one particular party did cross the Border in complete contradiction to the assurance given by the British Ambassador.  That is a very serious aspect of this matter.  Was the British Ambassador not fully aware of all the circumstances when he gave that assurance to the Taoiseach.  If he was not fully aware of the exact situation, should he not have been before, as the representative of his Government, he made that solemn statement to the head of the Irish Government?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach quite rightly indicated that it was inappropriate and indeed improper for the Chief Constable to make the statement he did at the time he did.</P>
    <P>The statement of the Chief Constable, in itself, is so full of inaccuracies and contradictions as not to merit great attention from any of us.  However, it is the fact that it was made in the interim, as it were, which is important.  It is difficult to know exactly what is going on if, at one level, the British Ambassador is in touch with the Taoiseach and the Irish Government, saying certain things and giving certain assurances, while at another level the head of the RUC is saying completely different things and apparently acting in a separate role.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of the Chief Constable's statement on which I should like to comment because it is very serious.  It is that he stated that police action resulted in the deaths of a number of persons but that there was no shoot-to-kill policy.  That is a matter on which we must continue to seek explanation.  An article in last week's <i>Sunday Times</i> clearly contradicts the statement that there was no shoot-to-kill policy.  The thrust of that article is to the effect that there is a system of training which amounts to a shoot-to-kill policy.  What is important in that context is that no police force can hope to continue to operate in any community as a police <Col N="1585" /> force, whatever about an army, and receive any sort of community acceptance if they operate a shoot-to-kill policy.</P>
    <P>The Garda are very often placed in very dangerous and threatening situations, but they would never follow &mdash; and we as a House would never condone &mdash; such a policy.  In fact, the spokesman of the Official Unionist Party has described Sir John Hermon's account as incredible. We are asked to believe that an RUC constable shot two unarmed men because they were dangerous terrorists but, at the same time, we are asked to accept that it was quite safe for them to go unarmed into the Republic to seek out a man who was probably regarded as the most dangerous terrorist of all, namely Dominick McGlinchey.  As we are in the middle of this situation it is not possible for any of us to come to any conclusion, except to acknowledge that the facts require a great deal of investigation and of explanation. I am sure that it would be the unanimous wish of Deputies on all sides of the House that the Government would follow this matter through to the end and secure a complete account of the policy as implemented and the instances in which it has been officially or unofficially breached and that some procedure be established for the future whereby we can be assured that there will not be a recurrence.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach towards the end of the statement says:</P>
    <P>I have also sought and been given an assurance that no members of the Northern Ireland security forces will cross the Border in an unauthorised operation role.</P>
    <P>That is a key issue.  Assurances of this sort have been given in the past, but it looks now as if we cannot accept these assurances on their face value.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the very serious aspects of the matter.  There have been quite a number of meetings at ministerial level about the situation in Northern Ireland, particularly about security.  The Government gave us to <Col N="1586" /> understand that relations in this regard were very satisfactory and that there was understanding and co-operation.  However, this incident throws that in doubt and raises very definite questions about the confidence with which we can accept these assurances.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach also says:</P>
      <P>In response to further inquiries, we have been informed by the British authorities that neither they nor the RUC are aware of any other occasions on which members of the RUC or other Northern Ireland security forces have made unauthorised operational crossings.</P>
      <P>Again, can we accept that?  Some of the Taoiseach's own party would seriously question that statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are reputable people along the Border area, particularly on this side of the Border, who would give it as their honest opinion that this incursion is not an isolated incident and that incursions of one sort or another do take place.  Up to now, an attempt has been made to fob us off with different types of explanations &mdash; that there was a mistake, that people read maps incorrectly and so on.  The significance of this particular revelation is that an incursion was made as a matter of official policy. Another aspect into which the Taoiseach must inquire is whence this policy emanates and at what level it is authorised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of us would not be surprised to learn that such a policy is pursued at operational level.  I think that there is evidence that somewhere along the line authority is given for this type of incursion at operational level.  However, is that all?  At what level does it stop? That is something that the Taoiseach and the Government will have to ascertain for us and fully disclose to us.  Is it Northern Ireland Office policy?  Is it something which is, if not decided, at <Col N="1587" /> least approved of at a higher level than simply the police level?  We will have to be assured about that.  If that is so, then, as has been mentioned, the whole basis of Anglo-Irish relations is called into question.  If this is either overtly or covertly approved of at a level higher than police level, it is certainly something about which this House must know, as well as the Government.</P>
      <P>The whole episode has led to very serious public disquiet and, indeed, there is a feeling of outrage about the matter. Certainly it throws a doubtful shadow over the whole legal position in which, on the one hand, our courts are applying themselves with great assiduity to the legal and constitutional issues involved in every case where extradition is sought but on the other hand does it not make a mockery of the whole legal and constitutional situation in regard to extradition if the security forces in the North feel they are entitled to and do come across the Border and extradite people at will? That is another aspect of it.</P>
      <P>We are all at this stage at a disadvantage because a great deal of the facts are not known to us and can only be made known to us after a full investigation.  I want to emphasise, from a number of points of view, the importance of the Government insisting on a complete, thorough, comprehensive investigation followed by a full disclosure of the whole situation so that whatever about what has happened in the past things can be put on a proper basis henceforth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach in the last paragraph of his remarks said something to which we would all subscribe &mdash; the fact that the dreadful, particularly reprehensible circumstances in which the murder of Mary Travers and the wounding of her father took place necessitates close co-operation between the security forces North and South to combat violence and murder of that kind.  It is for that very reason that this matter is so important.  Cross-Border security co-operation can only be on a certain basis and, in so far as this particular incident undermines, or at least brings into question that whole <Col N="1588" /> basis, then it requires the fullest possible investigation and explanation.</P>
    <P>I urge the Taoiseach and the Government to insist on being given complete information and cast iron, watertight assurances for the future, not just assurances but the establishment of some procedures whereby those assurances can be seen to be effective.  That is what is important because we have had too many placatory assurances in the past which, with hind-sight, were seen to be valueless. The whole question of the security arrangements, of our territorial integrity, the safety of innocent citizens who live in Border counties and the future of Anglo-Irish relations, all these things, are involved in this particular matter.  It is something of fundamental importance. We on this side of the House will await further clarification and statements by the Government when we will then pursue the matter further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Haughey that we are operating at a disadvantage because of lack of knowledge and information about what occurred here.  For that reason we hope the Taoiseach will pursue the matter with the British authorities to ensure that the fullest possible inquiries and investigations are carried out and conveyed to the Taoiseach and the House here.</P>
      <P>I am glad to note also that the Taoiseach has accepted that the statement of the Chief Constable has exacerbated the situation and that he has proceeded on that basis.  The statement of the Chief Constable seems to indicate that he regards what occurred as simply a matter of routine.  This is precisely the point I was making last week, the fact that this incident is so different from previous ones, in that it seems to have been pre-authorised, planned in advance and formed part of a general routine-type operation.  It seems to me, and I think there is a general feeling abroad, that the British Government do not really take very seriously the sovereignty and independence of this State and the integrity of its borders.  The statement of the Chief Constable seems to indicate that it is not really taken very seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1589" /> I wish to indicate that my party fully back any action the Government may take to emphasise that action such as this cannot be tolerated.  Assurances and guarantees have been given before but there is little likelihood that they will be honoured because there has been a procedure in operation for many years now which it is unlikely will be altered.  The problem is what occurs if such guarantees and assurances are not honoured and this is where the whole question of co-operation between the respective police forces is rendered extremely difficult.  If something happens behind people's backs, the Garda will find it extremely difficult to co-operate fully in such circumstances. The horrific death of Mary Travers, the shooting of her father and the many other incidents that have occurred indicate the need for such co-operation. The Taoiseach would need to make it very clear to the British authorities that that is what would be put in jeopardy if incidents such as these occur. As has been pointed out, we really do not know the full details; we know only what has been stated publicly.  Obviously there is much more behind the whole incident, indeed behind the whole of the routine procedures being operated than we have yet seen.  We hope the Taoiseach will give the House the results of the investigation when he receives them.</P>

      <P>I should like to reiterate a point I have made perhaps three times in the course of the last four weeks. Today again, and for this week's business, there are Bills which will be ordered for Second Stage today, their Second Stages to be taken tomorrow, with Committee, Report and Final Stages then being taken and then they will go to the Seanad and be enacted by the end of the week.  While I am happy to do this in some circumstances, nonetheless I am somewhat upset when I hear the Tánaiste and other members of the Government <Col N="1590" /> say how successful the Government have been in clearing legislation through the House.  It is not the Government who pass legislation here but rather the House.  Surely co-operation here is based on every Member of the House endeavouring to render such legislation as effective as possible.  If any one Member endeavours to claim credit for that, I take exception, as would other Members on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>For a number of weeks past I have been endeavouring to ascertain what legislation will be taken this side of the summer recess so that I could inform our Front Bench spokesmen of what they should be researching and what is coming up for debate.  But I do not have any idea. Each Tuesday morning when we meet to discuss this matter I seem always to be saying to the members of our Front Bench, &ldquo;I do not know what will be taken over the next eight weeks but I can tell you what will be taken in the next 48 hours because there has been a Bill circulated which has been ordered for today, all Stages of which will be taken tomorrow&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Minister has nothing to say at this stage about this section.  The section states:</P>
      <P>This Act shall come into operation on such day or days as may be fixed therefor by order or orders of the Minister for Justice either generally or with reference to any particular purpose or provision and different days may be so fixed for different purposes and different provisions of this Act.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the Government decided, on his recommendation, that those provisions of the Bill giving increased powers to the Garda Síochána, which will only come into operation when a ministerial order to that effect, is made, would not be brought into force until a complaints procedure involving an assessment by an independent person or tribunal has been established.  He said it had not yet been established whether legislation would be necessary to establish such a procedure or whether it could be introduced, at least in the first instance, on an administrative basis.  The Minister then said that if legislation was necessary it would, in any event, have to be a separate Bill as the present Bill was concerned with the criminal law and procedure and could not appropriately deal with non-criminal procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time we said this was a most unusual statement given the fact that the British criminal justice Bill &mdash; the Police and Criminal Evidence Bill &mdash; includes a complaints procedures at page 67.  I find it hard to understand why this Bill does not include a complaints procedure.  The <Col N="1595" /> Minster promised that one would be introduced in due course.  I put down an amendment, No. 48, which proposed a draft Garda Síochána complaints commission. At 3.30 p.m. today I received a notice from the Ceann Comhairle to the effect that my amendment was ruled out of order as it was considered not to be relevant to the provisions of the Bill as read a Second Time.  I find this hard to understand.  A complaints procedures was mentioned in the Bill at its Second Reading.  The Minister promised a complaints procedure in his speech and I would have thought it was relevant to put forward an amendment to this section which would cover that and which would allow a discussion on that procedure.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question on 8 March, the Minister said that the new procedures would not be brought into operation until both Houses of the Oireachtas had an opportunity to discuss them.  He also said that he expected to be in a position to inform the House of the proposals in the near future.  He said that indications are that the scheme will be a statutory one. I am quite amazed that the Chair has decided to rule out of order the section which includes a complaints procedure.</P>
    <P>Section 1 raises serious questions about the commencement of this Bill in the House in the first instance.  I would like the Minister to tell us the present position in regard to the complaints procedure. The last information we have was given on 8 March when the Minister said that the indications were that the scheme would be a statutory one.  I would like to make our position very clear on the commencement of the Bill.  Sections in this Bill are very valuable and will have the support of almost all Members in the House and about these there is no concern. Naturally, we are anxious to see them brought into operation as soon as possible.  They include such measures as majority verdicts, matters relating to alibis and the question of consecutive sentences.  There may be different views about these.  There is the question of improving the administration of the courts by way of allowing, in section 20, proof by written statement.  There is the <Col N="1596" /> question of trial procedure and notice of alibi in trials on indictment.  There are quite a series of them.</P>
    <P>Concern arises on matters such as the increased powers given to the Garda and I want to clarify our position on this.  We are prepared to grant these increased powers to the Garda.  We trust the Garda as a body to use their powers appropriately, but at the same time we feel that there must be an acceptance of the fact that there should be adequate safeguards against the abuse of these powers.  While in the course of discussions on this Committee Stage we will propose amendments to the Minister for his consideration in relation to the regulations which he is considering bringing forward in regard to the complaints commission, we will do this in the spirit and context of our supporting the basic principle that the Garda need additional powers at this time and that adequate safeguards should be provided against abuse of these powers.  Of course we would prefer to see either the regulations, or as much information on the regulations as can be provided, put down and indicated clearly by the Minister here in the House, and we would like to see the complaints procedure which the Minister has promised put down in conjunction with the Bill.  We see no reason why it cannot be included in the Bill.  We would like to hear from the Minister in relation to that.</P>

      <P>On section 1, the commencement of the Bill, we have been screaming blue murder for a very long time for the introduction of legislation to deal with problems which we have been led to believe can be solved by legislation. I want to be fair in what I say here and I do not want to be unfair to anybody, particularly those who are not here to defend themselves.  However, we have allowed ourselves to be pushed around to the extent of being led to believe that legislation on its own will solve the problems we are facing.  It will not.  This must be stage 1 of a series of attacks on the problem of crime facing this city and society generally.  I was interested to read in <i>The Irish Times</i> of this morning that we have now very nearly three times as <Col N="1597" /> many gardaí per head of the population as Norway has, and the answer to all the problems in this House in regard to crime which are not dealt with by legislation is usually that we will recruit 500 additional gardaí.</P>
      <P>I hope that we can debate the Bill in a balanced, reasoned and fair manner, and I tell people who feel that they are being hounded that nobody in this House intends to hound anybody.  We are merely out to solve the problem of crime and in so far as this legislation is necessary the onus is on the House and on each of us here present to ensure that this legislation, which is very strong but generally speaking very necessary, is balanced, that the Oireachtas enacts something which is in the interests of the community and that we do not enact those sections of the Bill which we do not believe to be in the interests of the community.  I note that the commencement will depend on an order from the Minister for Justice and I hope that he will soon be in a position to inform the House when the complaints tribunal will come into operation.  I understand that the order for the Bill to be enacted will await that tribunal.</P>
      <P>I said on an earlier Stage of the Bill that I had reservations about certain of its sections.  I want to explain those as the Bill proceeds.  Generally speaking, the House must accept that, given the difficulties that exist, on balance we need some form of legislation but as part and parcel of the problem we must ensure that the 11,000-odd gardaí who are now engaged by the State are properly deployed, trained and managed and properly involved in the community.  We must all realise the necessity for this as well as of bringing in legislation which deals with the technical aspects of detention and such matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>At this early stage in this Bill I want to make clear that Deputy Mac Giolla and I do not support the Bill, for very serious reasons.  We consider it an over-reaction to a demand by the Garda for greater powers.  The Minister will be aware of the serious disquiet expressed by very significant sections of people outside this House, including the <Col N="1598" /> trade unions, groups of social workers, organisations of social workers, residents' and tenants' associations and the legal profession, and it seems that no serious attempt has been made to consult with any of these sections of public opinion before preparing the Bill.  The Minister has introduced various amendments which we will be discussing as we go along but it is my considered opinion that the amendments do not affect materially the whole thrust of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Although the Minister has stated that he does not see the Bill as the only response to crime in our society, on the face of it it is the only response so far from the Government in relation to crime, and until such time as we see other responses by the Government we can only assume that this is their only response and they do not appear to have any other answers.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to go into much detail, but it is significant that one of the amendments introduced by the Minister seeks to limit certain sections to five years.  This is an admission&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I understand.  I want to make the point that I feel that there is an admission implicit in the Minister's amendments that this is emergency-type legislation.  It is not satisfactory that we should be introducing legislation here and using generally the most deprived section of our population as guinea-pigs for the next five years to see how these draconian measures will or will not work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to section 1 (1) of the Bill in relation to the Minister making an order in due course for provisions of the Bill to take effect.  He stated on Second Stage that certain sections will not come in until an adequate complaints procedure is in operation.  He indicated recently that this will be statutory and will require certain legislation to be passed through this House.  What stage has it reached?  We are now almost into <Col N="1599" /> the Easter recess.  Is it expected that the Bill will be completed before the Summer recess or will it still be before us into the autumn?  While there are many and differing views being expressed in regard to the Bill, if we are to delay its passage we will be only putting off further the date of the coming into operation of its provisions.  I appreciate that there is a need for discussion with various groups and bodies before the Bill is finalised but it is the duty of us here to put legislation through.  Obviously, any provision of the Bill could be reviewed from time to time should the need so arise.  The five-year provision in relation to a review is a good idea.  Perhaps we could apply such a provision also in respect of other pieces of legislation because there is a need for reviewing legislation from time to time.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to tell the House also what the situation is in regard to the complaints procedure.  I understand that the legislation in that regard is fairly well advanced but until it is before the House we are not in a position to make an order in relation to subsection (1).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is agreement on all sides of the House regarding the seriousness of the crime problem and the need to take some action to deal with it. However, any reasonable person viewing this legislation objectively would agree with Deputy Woods' suggestion that we need to know the sort of complaints procedure we are to have before we continue to debate this legislation.  It would be meaningless to debate the Bill in isolation from the legislation to set up the complaints procedure.  It should form an integral part of the Criminal Justice Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree, too, with Deputies on the other side of the House who say that the crime problem cannot be solved by way of legislation alone but there are many changes that are needed if we are to improve the situation.  There are many legislative changes that need to be made in conjunction with other changes if we are to begin to solve the problem.  This Bill contains proposals for implementing <Col N="1600" /> many desirable and long overdue legislative changes.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to give wide-ranging powers to the Garda.  Surely it is unreasonable that we debate those powers here without knowing what the situation is to be in regard to checks and balances on the other side.  We should be aware of the constraints that will operate in so far as the exercise by the Garda of those powers is concerned.  Therefore, it is a meaningless exercise to debate this Bill in isolation from the provisions of the complaints tribunal procedure.  That is why I urge the Minister to give serious consideration to our suggestion to place before the House, prior to our going on to debate this legislation in detail, the terms under which the complaints tribunal will be established.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the way this Bill was introduced, that there was no opportunity for public debate on what is the most important review of the criminal law to take place for a long time, I should like to draw on the goodwill of the Minister as expressed in his Second Stage speech and to which he has referred on a number of occasions since, both inside and outside the House, and even as recently as during the week.  The Minister said he will listen carefully to what Members have to say in regard to any change that might be made in the Bill.  During the Committee Stage it may be necessary to draw on the Minister's goodwill because some very good arguments may be put forward for making changes in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is provided that sections 3 to 8 and 14 to 18 shall cease to be in operation unless there is passed by both Houses a resolution to the contrary.  I presume the reference is to any one of those sections but I should like clarification on that. That proposal alone needs to be debated because of the wide-ranging and worrying proposals in the Bill.  Should some of the sections prove to be unworkable, a five-year period might be too long.  There is also the factor of not knowing what the mechanism is to be in regard to the complaints procedure or when that procedure is to be put into operation.  By being <Col N="1601" /> asked to agree to the five-year period, we are being asked to put a lot of trust in the legislation working effectively and properly. It would be my view that we should have the right at any time to change any part of the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House do not consider this Bill to be in any sense an over-reaction to the present situation.  We welcome the Bill but, having said that, the Minister will appreciate that we will be expressing certain reservations in regard to some of the Bill's provisions.  However, we disagree totally with The Workers' Party that the Bill is an over-reaction.  The Garda welcome the setting up of the tribunal and are happy that safeguards are being built into this legislation.  I do not see the legislation as being a case of the legislators <i>versus</i> the Garda.  We are giving to the Garda changes they have been seeking for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously, the Committee Stage of the Bill will be lengthy.  Before resuming my seat I should like to make the point that not since coming here in 1965 have I seen so many Members present for, and participating in, a Committee Stage debate. That in itself is an indication of the importance of this legislation.  The Minister may expect to be here for a long time but I hope we will be able to complete the legislation before the Summer recess, as the Bill is very important.  I hope the Minister will regard everything being said from this side of the House as constructive because we are anxious that at the <Col N="1602" /> end of the day the Bill will be better than it was as introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make two very brief comments on section 1.  To take the point made by Deputy Skelly, I hope the Minister will regard the proceedings before the House on Committee Stage with the generosity of approach that he adopted on Second Stage when he indicated that he would take Deputies' comments seriously and be willing to consider redrafting sections if concrete arguments were made for doing so in certain areas.</P>
      <P>As we go through the Bill there will be certain sections to which I intend to refer and which I hope the Minister will reconsider. I also share the concern expressed by other Deputies, and it is worth reiterating, that the complaints procedure commission should be brought into being quickly in fairness to the Garda and to the general public, because there is much that is good in the Bill which I would like to see operative as soon as possible even though there are some sections about which I am worried.  Many sections of this Bill are very desirable.  They depend on a ministerial order.  I hope they will come into force quickly so that offences committed by persons on bail and other areas, such as majority verdicts, can be dealt with to operate within the law without undue delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the draftsmanship of section 1.  One does not normally have long debates on a section like this which largely gives the Minister powers to introduce sections by way of ministerial order but there are two drafting errors in the Bill and I am not sure whether the parliamentary draftsman or the Minister is necessarily aware of them.  One of them arises due to an amendment which the Minister is proposing. He proposes to delete section 12 as contained in the original Bill.  My understanding is that that section, which relates to road traffic offences, is being incorporated in road traffic legislation emanating from the Department of the Environment.  If section 12 is to be deleted, surely under section 1 (2) the reference to section 12 should also be deleted?  The Minister is proposing the <Col N="1603" /> deletion of the existing section and its replacement by an entirely different section. It seems appropriate that there should be an amendment tabled in conjunction with that contained in section 12 to delete the reference to section 12 from section 1 (2) of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is another important matter to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention because we must be anxious to get this legislation constitutionally correct and to ensure that it makes the criminal law certain and does not give rise to complicated criminal law cases in which technical law is argued to enable people in a sense to evade responsibility for wrongdoing. In this context I refer the Minister to sections 9 and 11 of the Bill and raise the question as to whether those two sections should be referred to in section 1 (2) of the Bill.  Possibly section 9 does not need to be because of its phraseology which means it will not come into force or have any effect until the ministerial order brings it into force.  Perhaps, for completeness, it should be referred to in section 1 (2), but it may not be necessary.</P>
    <P>However, it is necessary that section 11 should be referred to in section 1 (2) because if it is not the bringing into force of that section could result in somebody being held liable to a criminal charge for behaviour of which we may disapprove. Section 11 makes it a criminal offence to fail to turn up in court when required to do so.  In a sense that is a new criminal offence.  Nevertheless, we would have great difficulty constitutionally in making a criminal offence retrospective if it was not a criminal offence at the time it was committed.  I support section 11, as I said on the Second Stage debate, but for it to be constitutionally sound we should possibly replace the reference in the Bill in section 1 (2) to section 12, in the light of the Minister's amendment, with a reference to section 11 instead.  That could get around technical legal problems of a constitutional nature which could arise upon the Minister making the order.  It will be necessary to bring that section into force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to delay the House on any particular matter.  Initially, <Col N="1604" /> I welcomed this legislation and at present I am quite happy with the bulk of it.  I have no doubt that the public are waiting anxiously for the implementation of laws which would help them to go about their business in a fashion appropriate to organised and civilised society.</P>
      <P>I was quite happy earlier on in respect of the legislation proposed that the Minister had indicated that there was, concurrent with this, a provision for complaints procedures.  It has become fashionable nowadays to knock the Garda.  I appreciate and fully accept that without the Garda we would be all the poorer.  On the other hand, I accept, as in all human institutions, that where there is a body of 11,000 people it is inevitable that the misbehaviour of one or two of them can reflect on the whole force.  That happens in every profession &mdash; legal, teaching, medical and so on.  I know that 99 per cent of the Garda are concerned because they are being criticised in the wrong.  I imagine they welcomed the announcement by the Minister that it was his intention to set up a complaints procedure as a result of which it would be possible to refute false accusations or to confirm an allegation made against a member of the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to proceed towards the implementation of this legislation we must recognise that the Garda have said they are displeased because some of the sections have been withdrawn.  They will be further disappointed if they hear that it is not intended to set up a complaints procedure in the near future.  I know the vast majority of people would welcome such a complaints procedure and that is borne out by the fact that representatives of all the major parties accept the spirit of the legislation even though they may have reservations about certain aspects. The Minister should indicate the precise position regarding the complaints procedure to which he has referred and which we were led to believe would be introduced with this legislation.  I am sure that the 99 per cent of the Garda who carry out their duties in a conscientious, industrious and intelligent fashion are anxious to see this complaints procedure adopted.  It will be a mechanism by which <Col N="1605" /> those people who have been making false allegations against the Garda Síochána can be shown up or, more positively, it will be an opportunity to allow anyone who considers himself badly treated by those charged with the duty of executing the laws to have these allegations confirmed. I consider it useless for us to proceed further unless the Minister indicates the position in that regard.</P>

      <P>Committee Stage allows every Member of the House to examine in detail every line, every section, every subsection, every amendment and every suggested change in the legislation before the House.  I consider the Bill we are dealing with now to be one of the most urgent and important measures and for that reason, I wish to refer to the verbal undertaking given by the Minister that he will listen attentively to views expressed by Members of the House and that he will give full consideration to them.  I hope that as a result of views expressed here the Minister will not do anything to take the teeth out of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I wish to make the point that there is not one single copy of the Bill available in the General Office or in the Stores Office and this shows the importance attached to the measure by Members of this House, the general public and by the various organisations seeking the protection of life and property.  All interested bodies sought copies of the Bill.  As usual, Deputies got one copy and in many cases they loaned that copy to people who had observations to make on it.  I wish to protest that sufficient copies of the Bill were not available for Members of the House and I ask the Minister to take the necessary steps, irrespective of cost, to ensure that this matter is rectified.  The Committee Stage of this Bill will not be concluded hastily and Deputies need copies of the Bill to allow them to make comments on the sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has been described by people outside this House as an undemocratic Bill and the Minister has been criticised wrongly in relation to it.  I put the point to the Minister that if the teeth are taken out of the Bill to any degree we will weaken the law.  Any citizen who keeps <Col N="1606" /> the law need not be afraid of this Bill. There is nothing in it for anyone to fear except those people who are running away from the law and who are putting life and property in danger.  Only those involved in crime need fear this Bill.  The main purpose of the Bill is to eliminate crime from society.  That is a very difficult problem and I am afraid this measure is too little, too late.  In my view Irish society has broken down beyond repair but if we do not weaken the provisions of the Bill it may assist the Garda to restore some form of protection for life and property.</P>
    <P>There have been objections to various sections of the Bill.  The Minister said it was not a normal Bill but we are not living in normal times.  If times are abnormal, then it will take abnormal actions and legislation to deal with them.  If Members of this House see that there are infringements on the rights of citizens, there is nothing to stop them when times become normal of requesting the Minister for Justice to remove the objectionable sections.  However, I do not see any objectionable sections in the Bill.  Too many of our people are complaining about robberies, about car thefts and about threat to life.</P>
    <P>The Minister has power to make ministerial orders but this is not done without a serious reason.  I wish to make the following point on this matter.  There are many minor traffic offences such as not displaying a tax disc or of having a worn tyre which could not be described as offences of a serious character.  I realise that some traffic offences are serious, for instance, a person under the influence of drink in charge of a vehicle, but most minor offences are committed without the full and complete knowledge of the owner of the vehicle.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will ensure that in the event of a ministerial order to be made under this legislation it will be done in consultation with the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána or an officer so appointed by the Commissioner to consult with the Minister.  The Minister should indicate to the Garda authorities the purpose of an order he intends making. If all legislation is to be introduced <Col N="1607" /> by way of ministerial order it will make a farce of the House.  Ministerial orders should be made only in the case of an emergency, where it is not possible to permit a parliamentary debate.  Such a system takes from Parliament its right to debate legislation and question a Minister. It also takes from Members the responsibility they have to their constituents. Ministerial orders should be introduced in serious circumstances only and following consultation with the Garda Commissioner or an officer appointed by him to enter into consultations with the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána was established to safeguard life and property, to protect the public and to be a friend of the people.  While the members of the Force have a duty to protect life and property we must give them the power and authority to do so.  I preached that when I was a Minister and I am still preaching it.  I should like to warn the House to be careful about what is said in relation to the lessening of the powers of the Garda in present circumstances.  Ministerial orders should be introduced only to give the necessary power and authority for full investigations by the Garda in their efforts to prevent crime, to investigate crime or to ensure that those responsible for crime are, for their own safety and the safety of the public, dealt with as the law stipulates.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's views on the making of ministerial orders.</P>
    <P>There is a genuine expression of goodwill from all sides of the House for the steps the Minister is taking.  I cannot feel extremely critical about any provisions in the Bill and I expect to express certain views about all sections.  Without this legislation Irish society will not be able to carry on for too much longer.  I am convinced that the Minister realises the necessity for this legislation.  The number of occasions when the Garda overstepped their duty when dealing with problems are few.  The Minister should give his full support to every effort by the Garda to implement the laws which are clearly designed to protect the public and safeguard life and property.  Since the State <Col N="1608" /> was founded every Minister has given the Garda that support and co-operation.  I have no doubt that one of the reasons for bringing forward these provisions is to protect the good-living public who are crying out for such measures.  I am sure the Minister will approach all sections in a commonsense way and will bear in mind at all times that the protection of the public is paramount.  I have no doubt that he will ensure that as far as the Garda are concerned they will not be handcuffed or blindfolded by legislation.</P>

      <P>I dealt at length with the provisions in the Bill on Second Stage on 12 November last.  On that occasion I outlined the view of my party on the provisions and pointed out that the legislation will not deal with the problem it was intended to deal with.  It has been said that all other parties support the general thrust of the Bill but my attention has been drawn to the fact that there are no Members of the Labour Party present to indicate if they support the main thrust of the Bill, if they support its provisions at all, if they are opposed to them or what their general attitude is.  It is unfortunate that they are not present to indicate their attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to the promised complaints procedure.  One would have thought that since the Second Stage debate commenced last November we <Col N="1609" /> would have had the outline of a complaints procedure before us when dealing with Committee Stage.  That would have been helpful.  The idea of a complaints procedure is to give the community confidence in the Garda and so that allegations can be investigated and answered. The bill is not designed to improve community confidence in the Garda without other procedures being available with it.</P>
    <P>Widespread efforts are being made at present by communities to get the Garda involved in combating crime and lawlessness but the Bill does not deal with the community relations or the community policing aspect.  A complaints procedure is an important factor in promoting community confidence in the Garda.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that the Minister is not in a position to put before the House regulations in regard to detention and so on, as promised in another section.  If that were put before us we would have a much better idea of what precisely will happen when the Bill becomes law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to reaffirm categorically his commitment that under the powers given to him in this section he will not bring the Bill into law until the independent complaints procedure has been established.  I had understood that that would be the case but from discussions since it seems there is some question about that.  I suggest that the Minister should make every effort to have the Bill passed as soon as possible because the powers in it are necessary. As well, there is general public expectation in relation to the Bill which goes far beyond the powers that the Bill will provide.  The Bill will have only a limited contribution to make to combating the levels of crime in this city, and the sooner the public realise this the sooner the time of the Department of Justice and the Garda will be freed so that they can concentrate on other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is important in itself.  The powers it will give are needed and it has wide public acceptance.  I represent a constituency that has its share of crime and criminals and there the Bill will be widely welcomed.  Therefore I urge the Minister <Col N="1610" /> to move as quickly as possible.  The Bill is a good one and it needs a good complaints procedure that will have the confidence of the people.  I should like to know how far advanced the proposals in relation to the independent complaints procedure are and how soon we can expect to see them.  The Minister can then make progress with the other matters with which he has been concerned, namely an increase in the numbers in the Garda, increased numbers on the beat which will have an important part in developing community confidence.  Confidence in the Garda was lost largely because of the position of our prison system and because of loopholes in the law which rendered the Garda ineffective&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): We have been discussing this section for quite a time.  It states that the Act shall not come into operation unless the Minister so orders.  The Minister can order the entire Bill, or he can order it section by section or he can take a number of sections together and order them to be brought into operation.  That is the only question of ministerial order that is involved.  There is no question of the Minister being given other powers to make ministerial orders, or to legislate by order, or to ignore the House.  A ministerial order will commence the Bill and <Col N="1611" /> it can be commenced <i>in toto</i> on one day or it can be commenced piecemeal.</P>
      <P>There are reasons for that and the main reason is on record.  There is a commitment not to bring increased Garda powers, mainly the detention provisions, into being until the new complaints procedure has been brought into operation.  As well, regulations will have to be made in regard to the treatment of persons in custody, and in relation to some of the provisions it is desirable, for instance, in relation to alibi and proof by written statement, that the courts should have a period after the enactment of the Bill to make the necessary preparations.  The section dealing with majority verdicts might best be brought into operation before the long vacation of the courts so as to give the Judiciary time to consider the appropriate form of direction to be given to juries.</P>
      <P>Apart from the fact that it is the normal standard of commencement provision and that there is the possibility of snags turning up in relation to particular provisions, there are the other reasons I have outlined for not bringing in the Bill on a specified date.  In other words envisage it will be brought in by ministerial orders rather than by one order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies have expressed concern about the commitment I gave in regard to a complaints procedure to process complaints by the public against the Garda.  Last October when the Bill was published I was asked what would happen in regard to the complaints procedure and I replied that the Bill having been drafted I would proceed as quickly as possible with the complaints procedure. I have sent the heads of the procedure to the Government and the procedure will be drafted as soon as possible. In the meantime I will be having consultations with the Garda representative bodies.  The time scale is somewhat longer than originally envisaged.  When I spoke about it first I said it was possible it could be done by administrative procedure rather than legislation.  Because of the great interest in the complaints procedure in the Dáil and in the community, and because Deputies thought of <Col N="1612" /> it as being a very important part of the total package of which the Criminal Justice Bill is only one part, I regard it as being better practice to enact the complaints procedure by way of legislation. I hope to get the Government's approval shortly; then it will go for drafting and will later come to the House.</P>
    <P>A number of points made by Deputies were general statements on the principle of the Bill.  I thank them for outlining their positions from their personal and their parties' points of views.  Other points made will come up during debate on the different sections, under amendments and so on.  Deputy Shatter raised a matter in connection with subsection (2) of this section which provides that sections 10, 12 and 13 shall not apply in relation to offences committed before the commencement of the section concerned. The Deputy drew attention to the fact that section 12 is being transferred to the Road Traffic Act and will not be discussed.  My information is that the Dáil Office will make that correction without intervention by me. therefore section 12 will go automatically.</P>
    <P>The Deputy pointed out that sections 9 and 11 were not mentioned specifically. This had been brought to my attention earlier and I considered it.  It is not necessary to include section 9 (1) here because it specifically provides that a consecutive sentence for an offence committed while on bail can be imposed for an offence committed after the commencement of the section.  Therefore the section contains its own commencement and it does not need to be referred to now. The other section also provides that failure to submit to bail will be a criminal offence only after the commencement of the Act.  Therefore the inclusion of section 11 does not arise.  They were raised by one particular group I consulted.  I have looked into the matter and it is not necessary to include them in section 1.</P>
    <P>On the general position raised, I am very glad the main Opposition party support in general and in principle the measures in this Bill.  Deputy De Rossa said his party are opposed to the Bill.  I am sorry to hear that.  I would prefer if with serious legislation like this we could have <Col N="1613" /> at least the support in principle of all Deputies and all parties.  Deputy De Rossa suggested that their opposition was on the grounds of an intrustion on civil liberties.  We are all concerned about civil liberties but people are being deprived of fundamental liberty because of crime &mdash; the liberty to be safe in one's own home, the liberty to go into the streets day or night and feel safe from attack, especially if one is old, female or both.  These are freedoms as well.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make a Second Stage speech but in drafting this Bill we were very concerned that there would be safeguards in it of civil liberties and there is a commitment to introduce a Bill to set up a complaints procedure, with an independent element, and to bring the legislation before the House.  Deputies will have an opportunity to discuss that as well.</P>
    <P>I am sure we will have a long Committee Stage debate and that many matters will be raised.  I have been asked to treat the Committee Stage with the same flexibility as I treated the Second Stage.  I took on board many of the views raised in this House and tried to get the balance of this House.  Obviously the ground is becoming narrower now as we move through Committee Stage.  The Bill is taking shape but I will be interested in the views and advice of Deputies, and I am not ruling out amendments on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad the Minister agrees that there should be a statutory complaints procedure.  We advised the Minister to take this step when the Bill was published.  We were concerned at that time because two memoranda issued.  It seemed there was some difference of opinion within the Government because it is most unusual that a second memorandum would issue saying certain parts of the Bill would not go into operation until a complaints procedure was devised.  We want to see this legislation in operation.  Because of the approach taken by the Minister up to now the availability of this complaints procedure has been delayed for five months.  We see no reason why this complaints procedure <Col N="1614" /> should not be included in the present Bill. We do not accept the argument put forward by the Minister, apparently with the support of the Chair, that it is not appropriate to this Bill to have a complaints procedure included on Committee Stage. We believe it should be incorporated in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not know what Deputy Woods means &ldquo;apparently, with the support of the Chair&rdquo;.  The Chair has ruled that one amendment is not relevant to the Bill &ldquo;as read a Second Time&rdquo; in the technical meaning of that phrase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is amendment No. 48, the Garda Síochána Complaints Commission.  Our argument is that that is very relevant to the Bill and we have had support from both sides of the House.  I appealed to the Minister to bring it forward in conjunction with the Bill so that he will not have to come back to the House at a later date introducing a Bill to deal with this matter specifically. Surely there would not be a great problem including it in this Bill?  We know that the sections the Garda are looking for will not come into operation until this is done.</P>
      <P>In my view the Oireachtas deserve recognition for the extra powers they are giving in this Bill.  The Oireachtas deserve the respect from the Minister that he put before the House the complaints procedure Bill so that we can see what we are doing and can see the checks and balances which would be provided by the Minister.  Will the Minister outline the regulations he proposes?  He mentioned that it will take some time to prepare these regulations and that consequently some parts of the Bill might not come into operation until they are prepared.  In other words, I am raising two points: the first is that there will be a further delay and, second, we would like some indication from the Minister as to what regulations he has in mind.</P>

I want to know what he said in reference to the goodwill we were drawing on in relation to Second Stage and whether that would be available on Committee Stage.  The Minister referred to civil liberties being changed by this legislation.  The major point made throughout the Second Stage debate was that this Bill would have no effect on civil liberties because it would not do anything to improve the crime rate.</P>

We are being asked to give increased powers to the Garda.  We are being asked to pay a certain price in terms of the surrender of civil liberties but we do not know what systems of checks and balances will operate.  It is akin to the House debating in isolation tax increases in a Finance Bill on the promise of the Minister that tax allowances would be increased by some figure at some time in the future.</P>

The weight of discussion and expression of opinion on the provisions of this Bill would be lessened or would be greater in relation to the complaints tribunal.  The Minister is quite right to deal separately with the complaints procedure and have it discussed separately in the House.  These are separate matters and should be separately dealt with.  I fully agree with the line the Minister has taken.  It is the very line I would take in relation to this matter. When the Government have cleared the various heads of the complaints tribunal memorandum, it will come before the House separately.  This is right and Deputy Woods should agree.</P>

We are giving the Minister support which is very important.  It might be appreciated. The Minister knows as well as we do that we are dealing with very serious principles.  Previously this Bill was about <Col N="1621" /> to come before the Government in draft form.  There was a quick succession of Governments and various Ministers made inputs into the Bill.  What would have been in the Bill at that stage is an open question because it was never actually considered at Government level. Let us leave that out of it.  Let us concentrate on the future.  If we want these measures to be introduced they should be introduced soon for all the reasons Deputy Flanagan mentioned.  We do not want any undue delay, but we want the checks and balances.  If these measures are not introduced this side of the summer recess, they will have to be taken in the autumn and that means we will not have these provision for the Garda until very late in the year.  I do not think people will thank us for that.</P>

Will the Minister explain what he means by saying that the independent complaints tribunal will have a strong independent element?  It is important for us to know whether this will be an independent complaints tribunal or a complaints tribunal with a strong independent element.  What non-independent element will be involved?  This tribunal or commission or whatever it will be called has been dangled by the Minister from the beginning as a carrot to get the House to accept the Bill.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I will reply very briefly to oblige the Deputy. Deputy De Rossa sees the Criminal Justice Bill and the complaints procedure as a package.  He has decided not to accept the package because he is opposing the Bill in principle.  I do not think there is an onus on me to give him explanations about the other side of the package.  The second question was whether there will be a guillotine motion on Thursday.  I understand this is ordered for tomorrow and Thursday.  I hope we will make progress and that we can conclude on Thursday. I will not give the spokesman for The Workers' Party a commitment which would be the manifesto for a filibuster over the next couple of months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I have merely read the text of the amendment. On Second Stage debate, Deputy Kelly and other Deputies suggested that there should be a time limit on some provisions in the Bill.  When replying to the debate, I promised that I would give further consideration to that point and the amendment which I am now proposing would put a time limit of five years on certain provisions.  These relate to increased powers of the Garda, withholding information about firearms and stolen goods and drawing inferences from a failure or refusal by a suspect to account for certain marks, etc. on his person or for his presence in a particular place at or about the time a crime is committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the reasons for my reluctance <Col N="1624" /> on Second Stage to agree to a time limit was that time limits of this kind could impart a flavour of emergency legislation to what we are trying to achieve here.  I want to make it clear that in approaching this measure the Government &mdash; and I should say, in fairness, their predecessors &mdash; sought to ensure that nothing would be included which in their view was not fully justified on its own merits as an addition to the permanent criminal law.</P>
    <P>The aim throughout has been to achieve a proper and acceptable balance between the rights of the individual who may happen to be suspected or accused of a crime and the right of the community in general to have crimes properly investigated and those guilty of them brought to justice.  From time to time, according as there are developments in public attitudes, increased sophistication among criminals and so on, that balance may have to be adjusted.  I think that the Government have shown in their reaction to the representations made since publication of the Bill that they have a continuing concern to ensure that our criminal law procedure will maintain the proper balance to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless the Government felt that it was reasonable to put a time limit on the provisions in question and to provide for a parliamentary review on how they have operated in practice.  Reviews of this kind are desirable anyway and Governments have often been criticised here and in the Seanad for not having any formal system of monitoring the practical application of legislation being discussed. The imposition of a time limit will make it necessary for a review to be carried out and any necessary amending legislation passed before the time limit expires if the provisions in question are not to lapse altogether.</P>
    <P>I do not want for a moment to give the impression that there is any real prospect that in five years' time there would be a case for allowing for example, the powers of detention to lapse.  The Garda are unique among police forces, so far as I know, in not having this power, but, as I have said, there may be improvements in these provisions which experience of their operation would suggest.  If there <Col N="1625" /> are any such amendments, the imposition of a time limit, as proposed, will ensure that they are made in good time before the limit expires.  In my view, five years is an appropriate period for this purpose. It will give time for proper evaluation of how the provisions work in practice and for any necessary amending legislation to be prepared and debated by both Houses and enacted into law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De. Rossa Mr. De. Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De. Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment to amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete &ldquo;five years&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;one year&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We have put down an amendment to the Minister's proposal seeking to have one year substituted for five years.  I have already made the point in relation to the Bill that the main function of the Bill is the serious restriction of a person's civil liberties.  It is widely believed outside this House &mdash; if it is not within it, given the numbers requesting a vote on section No. 1 &mdash; that the powers being sought are in the nature of emergency powers.  I refer the Minister to a quotation from the Ó Briain Report which looked into the question of the powers of the Garda in relation to detention, questioning and so forth.  That report was drawn up by a number of leading citizens of this State, which included a judge and a trade unionist. The quotation is:</P>
      <P>The practice of detaining persons for the purpose of questioning them has no justification in law, apart from the exceptional cases provided for in our emergency legislation.</P>
      <P>That refers to the 1939 Offences against the State Act.</P>
      <P>We feel &mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash; and this is a quotation from the Ó Briain Report&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1626" /> that this form of detention should be terminated forthwith.</P>
    <P>If the Ó Briain Report felt in regard to the detention of persons that even the power under the 1939 Act should be terminated &mdash; and this is embodied in emergency legislation &mdash; then to introduce the same kind of power into the normal criminal law and procedures is an extraordinary step.  Whatever the Minister may argue in relation to the introduction of the five-year review he must accept that it has been introduced quite simply because it constitutes an extraordinary step to take in relation to our criminal law, that is generally felt that there should be some restriction on the extra powers being given to the Garda.  It is our view that five years is much too long a period to allow such powers be in existence before being reviewed.  Assuming that this provision goes through the House &mdash; again we must accept the fact that the Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour Parties <i>en bloc</i>, despite their declared reservations about major sections of this Bill, will railroad it through &mdash; we would argue very strongly that this review be carried out after one rather than five years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the Minister's amendment applying a five-year expiry date with regard to sections 3 to 8 and 14 to 18, inclusive &mdash; in other words, that these sections shall cease to be in operation on the expiry of five years from their commencement unless a resolution has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas.  That tends to emphasise that this is emergency style legislation, that it is a major change in our law and, as such, is one which may well require review having been in operation for some time. That is why so many Members are concerned at present to ensure that it will be right when put into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 3 to 8, inclusive, do provide for a period of detention in the case of arrests without warrant which will come as a surprise to many people eventually when the provisions of the Bill come into force.  Of course the primary purpose of this detention is to enable the Garda to <Col N="1627" /> detain and interrogate suspected persons within Garda stations, a concept fairly unknown in our law at present.  The Chief Justice has written and I migh quote from 1980 IR 316 as follows:</P>
    <P>It has been stated many times in our courts that there is no such procedure permitted by law as holding for questioning or detaining on any pretext except pursuant to a court order or for the purpose of charging and bringing the person detained before a court. Any other purpose is unknown to the law and constitutes a flagrant and unwarranted interference with the liberty of the citizen.</P>
    <P>The exceptions to this procedure are section 30 of the Offences against the State Act and section 2 of the Emergency Powers Act, 1976.  These deal with the question of persons who are suspected of involvement in subversive crime.  Without going into any further references we can see that there is a very major change being proposed here which is why the Minister has correctly introduced a time limit.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposed by The Workers' Party is for too short a period &mdash; one year would not allow adequate time to review the operation of the provisions of the Act.  On Report Stage perhaps the Minister would consider having a review at the end of three years of the operation of these sections by which time there will have been considerable experience gained of their operation and the Minister would be in a position to make any adjustments necessary.  We support his five year amendment at present and would ask him to give consideration to a three-year period on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Woods, I welcome this provision because it constitutes an improvement of the Bill as originally drafted and will afford us an opportunity to reconsider the matter in five years' time in the light of experience of the operation of the provisions within that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might take up a technical point with <Col N="1628" /> the Minister.  I take it that if any of the sections referred to are amended by this House at any time in the course of the next five years this provision will apply to the section as amended &mdash; in other words, that the sections, as amended, will automatically lapse just as the section in its original form will automatically lapse. That is my interpretation of the provision but perhaps it would be as well to have it written into the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am one of the people who advocated that there should be a time limit imposed.  Therefore I welcome the Minister's introduction of a time limit on these sections.  However, I wonder whether the five-year limit is too long &mdash; certainly I accept that one year is too short &mdash; because the problem is that we do not know when the five-year period will commence.  It will be five years from some future date but presumably we will be well into the term of office of the next Dáil before this review arises.  Between now and then a lot of things will have happened.  In five years' time I wonder what will be the excuse advanced for the then crime problem if the provisions of this Bill have not dealt adequately with it?  For example, will we be seeking more severe legislation at that time?  Given that this Dáil has another three-and-a-half years to run it would be a good idea if this section were looked at again during that period &mdash; perhaps in three years' time &mdash; so that some people who have listened to the arguments advanced and indeed to some of the abuses could compare the performance with the provisions and ascertain whether they needed to be changed at that stage.  I accept the five year review period at present proposed. But perhaps on Report Stage the Minister might consider a three-year period so that this Dáil &mdash; one that has concerned itself very much with crime, given the committee that has been established &mdash; will be afforded an opportunity of reviewing the legislation within its lifetime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal primarily with one point made by Deputy De Rossa.  I do not like to see any of our laws changed in so far as they restrict, or, as <Col N="1629" /> the Minister said on an earlier occasion, remove anything from the pool of freedom we have as a society.  But to assume that our laws can remain unchanged while society changes is to be naive, because the reality is that society has changed.  To suggest that these are emergency powers and that Ireland is in some way unique in this respect is nothing less than true.  The fact is that in every other European country with the exception of Scotland, where the powers of detention are limited to six hours &mdash; and, even there, there is provision for a local magistrate to extend a period of detention to 24 hours &mdash; there are powers of detention, in some instances, of up to three or four days, but in most instances up to 24 hours.  Therefore we are not unique or different in that respect.  What is sad is that our society has now caught up with the crime rate that has obtained in other European societies.  I regret that as much as any other Member of this House.</P>
      <P>Secondly, in relation to the other major power in the Bill &mdash; the matter of the right to silence and the way that is being interfered with &mdash; I do not want to see that interfered with.  Later on I shall be thanking the Minister for his amendment proposing to withdraw section 16. But the reality is that very eminent people, including, let me say to Deputy De Rossa, Judge Barra Ó Briain in his report, suggested that that right to silence was being abused.  It has been abused &mdash; I regret to say it has been abused &mdash; because I never wanted to see that law changed.  It is a cornerstone of our legal system but Judge Ó Briain in his report, to which Deputy De Rossa referred, said that this had been abused and referred to the fact that many very eminent jurists had suggested that changes would have to be brought about in relation to it.  The changes the Minister proposes are precisely those changes recommended by Judge Barra Ó Briain.  I hope Deputy De Rossa acknowledges that in the course of this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a view being expressed that we on this side and, judging by The Workers' Party's stand on this, Fianna Fáil, want to introduce draconian measures <Col N="1630" /> and are people who believe in repressive legislation.  These arguments are being made by Deputy De Rossa on the basis of presumptions.  He is being less than fair.  If he is going to deal with each section of the Bill and each amendment he has down on the basis of reason as he sees it, I ask Deputies to bear in mind that he is opposed to the Bill in its entirety.  I want to make my position clear.  I believe it is also the position of the vast majority of moderately minded Deputies who are neither to the right nor to the left in terms of our politics.  We regret that there should be one drop removed from the pool of our freedom but we do not see it in the context of something unique or different.  It is happening in every European country.  I regret that but we must take cognisance of the difficulties presented by modern technology as far as crime is concerned and also the problems caused by our social and economic difficulties.  These must be addressed particularly in relation to Dublin.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately these measures are necessary. I welcome the Minister's proposal to review these measures in five years.  I hope that society will not have changed so much in five years time that it will be nothing but a nodding through the House.  It will not be a reflection on the composition of the House but rather on the sad change which will have taken place in society over that period.  On balance five years is probably the correct period.  I hope we will see the kind of changes we want to see.  I agree with other speakers that this is just one part of a package.  We must address ourselves to the social, economic and other problems which exist.  Perhaps there will be an argument for reviewing these within five years.  It is unusual in the House to see such interest in this and I hope that when the legislation is passed we will address ourselves to some of the other problems and perhaps then we will be able to talk about reviewing this in two or three years time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Molony entirely in what he said.  The legislation before us is emergency legislation. <Col N="1631" /> Those of us who have a view of moderation and liberality will see this as emergency legislation.  We do not want this legislation.  We do not want section 3 as introduced by the Minister or the other sections but unfortunately we are living in rather unreal times.</P>
      <P>The Garda have something to say about criminals.  They are becoming the dominant factor in our society.  We must deal with that problem.  That is what we are doing here.  I do not want the Offences Against the State Act on the Statute Book but there are people representing themselves as republican going off and shooting young people and blowing up people in the name of democratic Ireland.  If that is their point of view I do not agree with it.  As a democratic nationalist and democratic republican I see my position as being very clear in relation to the Bill.  I do not want it but I am prepared to support it on the basis that it will achieve soemthing in society and bring about a return to normality.  That is what I want it to achieve.  In the meantime I am prepared to put up with it and support the Minister and Deputy Woods and the views they have expressed in relation to its operation for five years.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Molony, I hope that in five years' time we can abandon these sections.  However, I do not think that will happen.  The Workers' Party are opposing this Bill in its entirety.  They have a strange philosophy.  It is only in the recent past that they have emerged into the democracy of Dáil Éireann.  I do not want to be wrong-footed by The Workers' Party and have them seen by people outside the House as paragons of liberal Ireland or the upholders in some way of liberality.  I do not want Fianna Fáil to be wrong-footed in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are being dishonest in their approach to the Bill.  I support the views expressed by Deputy Woods and the Minister.  This is emergency legislation. We are living in emergency times.  I achieved what I set out to do in relation to the Bill.  I asked the Minister to abandon section 16.  That, in fairness, is what the Minister has done.  I see my role in relation to the Bill as having been <Col N="1632" /> achieved.  If The Workers' Party are going to express views such as those represented by Deputy De Rossa I will remain in the House and challenge them throughout the course of the Bill.  We in this party will not be wrong-footed by the views expressed by The Workers' Party. The views they have expressed are dishonest and I will continue to challenge them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing a very important aspect of this legislation. Reference has been made to civil liberties and the rights of the citizen.  It is no harm to remind the House, whether we agree or disagree, that Deputies also have rights.  I do not hold it against Deputy De Rossa for expressing his views.  Every Deputy when elected has a right to express his views in parliament.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the liberalistic attitude of The Workers' Party.  Nevertheless I accept that The Workers' Party Deputies when elected have a right and a duty to speak and be heard.  Like Deputies Andrews and Molony I totally disagree with the attitude that party have taken in relation to the Bill.  I want to make a recommendation both to the Minister and Deputy Woods.  It is that they should stick to the five years in relation to the review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the 1939 emergency. I am perhaps the only person who is still a Member of the House who was a Member during the early days when the 1939 emergency legislation was being passed.  Deputies are wrong to make a comparison between the 1939 emergency legislation and the emergency position we now have with the breakdown in Irish society.  Whether we like it or not, Irish society has broken down and I am glad that so many Deputies have agreed with that.  This legislation is a prop to try to keep it up.  The 1939 legislation dealt with war-time circumstances and conditions. It may be of interest to Deputies to know that the 1939 legislation is still law and was never amended or declared to be ended by parliament.  Many people may wonder why this legislation still exists. There may not be any need for it in times of peace.  Nevertheless the legislation in <Col N="1633" /> relation to those emergency provisions still exists.</P>
    <P>There is a great difference between the war-time emergency powers and the emergency provisions taken by the Minster under this legislation.  People like Deputy De Rossa speak about people's rights.  Nobody has a right to break or smash windows.  Nobody has a right to participate in arson or in the stealing or burning of motor cars.  Nobody has the right to aquire, retain or sell stolen goods. Nobody has the right to beat up people or to prevent people from walking in the streets, to participate in rape or in any action that will take from citizens the rights that they enjoy as people keeping and obeying the law.  When people like Deputy De Rossa speak of civil liberties and rights, what liberties and rights are they referring to?  Nobody has the right to deprive a citizen of his freedom. Nobody has the right to retain firearms for the purpose of endangering the life of his neighbour or to use those firearms recklessly or to have firearms without a permit or to loan or give firearms to others to the danger of the ordinary citizen.</P>
    <P>The expressions of opinion of a judge or judges in relation to emergency legislation have been referred to.  I am glad to see that in this House we are all making up our own minds in relation to the Criminal Justice Bill and, whilst we consider the views of judges if they wish to express them and the views of the Garda if they want to speak, it falls on this House to make the laws and we do not need dictation from either the Judiciary or those who will be administering the law.  It is our duty and our function as parliamentarians independently to make the laws which will be upheld by the Judiciary and administered by the Garda.  In present circumstances to think of having a review 12 months after the passage of this Bill is farcical.  It has taken two generations to bring Irish society down to the depth it is in today.  It will take a long time to elevate Irish society to any standard of decency, integrity, respect for law and order and Parliament, respect for the aged and respect for the views and opinions of others, tolerance.  Irish society has crumbled. <Col N="1634" /> It is breaking up like stale bread. That the Minister for Justice should have to review legislation of this kind after 12 months is extremely unreasonable.  I hope that both Deputy Woods and the Minister will see the importance of the five-yearly review.  One is always foolish in presuming, but I hope that in five years after the passage of this legislation we will see a considerable improvement, a tightening up, and if the police, the people whom we entrust with the administration of the law, suspect people of endangering life, being guilty of murder, participating in arson, holding stolen goods, trafficking in or making money from stolen goods, not alone should they have the right but it is their duty to investigate fully and see that citizens are safeguarded against people who participate in activities of this kind to the detriment of all in Irish society who want to live honourable, decent lives.  I ask the Minister that, no matter what pressure comes from any source in this matter, he will have a review at the end of five years.  In a lesser period one could not expect to be able to review with the certainty of seeing an improvement.  The five-year review is reasonable.  I only hope and trust that as a result of the full implementation of this provision at the end of five years the criminal activities of at least some of those who are seriously involved in crime for profit, through ignorance or from lack of anything else to do will be eliminated, to the benefit of all honourable, decent people.</P>
    <P>As I have said, anyone who keeps the law need not be afraid of any provision in this Bill.  Such people can snap their fingers, hold up their heads, meet the Garda Síochána ten, 20, 30 times a day with nothing to fear.  Nobody has anything to fear from this Bill except those engaged in depriving other citizens of the right to live their normal lives.  As has been said on both sides of the House, we are dealing with an emergency situation in which so many of our citizens have lost their senses completely.  They have lost a degree of consideration for others and have respect for neither life nor property. We want to bring some form of realisation into the hearts and minds of these <Col N="1635" /> people that they cannot act in that way, they cannot get away in Irish society with such activities.  I support the Minister's proposal of a five-year review and I hope that the main Opposition party will do likewise in the interests of the people who are clamouring for provisions of this kind and who want to live in peace and without fear.  It is a dreadful situation that families and individuals are living in fear, fear of being beaten up, of loneliness and of having their homes broken into.  We must endeavour to bring about a situation in which this is no longer the case.  The activities of the criminal are more prevalent in the cities than elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in regard to this legislation and I hope there will be no review until after the full five years have elapsed and that if necessary the legislation will be continued after the five-year period.  Deputy Molony tells us that Ireland is now only catching up with the remainder of the Continent in terms of crime but there are many countries in Europe to which we could give lessons in crime.  I do not accept that there are countries in Europe in which society has broken down to the extent that it has broken down here, to the extent that it has crumbled before the eyes of parliamentarians. This Bill provides us with the one opportunity of endeavouring to do something about the problem.  That is one of the reasons for my sitting through this debate.  Any contribution I make will be in the interest of encouraging the Minister and the main Opposition party in their attempts to restore some sanity to society.  We are living in abnormal circumstances. Consequently, we need abnormal legislation.  That is why I support the Bill wholeheartedly and why I am anxious that there be no review of the legislation one hour earlier than the five years being provided for.  The main political parties are dealing with this legislation on the basis of finding a cure for the social unrest, the social cancer, that has beset our society.  At the end of the five-year period this House will be in a position to assess the legislation in terms of effectiveness and so on and then to decide whether to extend it or otherwise.</P>

      <P>The Minister's amendment is useful and practical and will ensure that the legislation to which the five-year period applies will be reviewed in five years' time.  Too often in the past this House has not been as vigilant as it might have been in regard to reviewing legislation.  The provision for a review after five years will reduce some of the worry being expressed regarding the possibility of the sections in question being on the Statute Book for many years, perhaps without ever being reviewed by the House.  There is justification for such concern because of our failure in the past to review legislation.</P>
      <P>At the end of the five-year period, the House would be in a position to decide whether the legislation had been meaningful and whether the sections in question were having a real effect on the operation of our criminal law in terms of assisting the Garda and the courts in obtaining convictions in respect of those properly before the courts.  After the five years, too, we would need to know whether the detention sections in particular were working.  A review must mean something and by the time this review is due to be held, we should have statistics as to the number of offences committed, as to the number of people prosecuted and as to the number of convictions obtained.  In that way we will have some criteria on which to judge whether the legislation has been successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To some extent in dealing with sections 14 to 18, these statistics will assist us but I am not sure as to how, in five years time, the House will review the effects of the detention sections.  Will we review them simply by saying, &ldquo;Yes, they are there.  People have got used to them so we will leave them there&rdquo; or will we say, &ldquo;The Garda are securing more convictions than was the case before.  Consequently we are justified in retaining the provisions&rdquo;?  If, for instance, the crime rate has fallen by then would we be likely to extend the detention period to 24 or even to 48 hours?  Because we do not know the criteria that will be used in the review, there is a gap in the legislation. That gap should be filled in the context <Col N="1637" /> of amending section 2, and particularly within the context of sections 3, 4, and 5 and others concerned with detention.</P>
    <P>The keeping of statistics by the Garda will be very important.  In that way, we will be able to measure the extent to which they achieve what they say they hope to achieve on foot of this legislation. These statistics, too, will enable the House to judge whether the provisions in relation to detention are being used properly.</P>
    <P>In order that the review section may work, the Bill should provide for the keeping of statistics by the Garda in relation to the number of persons detained in Garda stations throughout the country, the number of people prosecuted following such detentions and the number of successful prosecutions that follow. Without such statistics I do not know how we would review the operation of the detention sections.  We in this country object frequently to the manner in which the authorities in the UK operate the prevention of terrorism legislation.  That legislation enables them to detain Irish citizens at points of entry to the UK.  The main objection to the operation of those powers is that the vast number of those people who are being detained by way of that legislation have not been prosecuted subsequently.  They have simply been detained and released.</P>
    <P>In common with every other Member of this House I have no sympathy for those involved in subversion or violence, whether in the UK, in Northern Ireland or within this jurisdiction.  I have been vociferous in condemning people involved in such crime but equally I am anxious that in dealing with the problem of crime we ensure that the measures we enact will be implemented properly and will protect the civil liberties of all of us while assisting the Garda in their fight against crime.</P>
    <P>When we come to review certain provisions of the legislation in five years' time we will need to know how they are working in terms of the sort of statistics I have outlined.  In accepting the Garda case that there is a need for detention provisions there is also a danger to the Garda. Even if the provisions are working well, <Col N="1638" /> though there will always be some people who will be detained and not charged subsequently, there will be allegations that large numbers of people are being detained wrongly.  Therefore, it is in the interest of the Garda to ensure that these provisions prove helpful.  That is why I say that there should be an obligation on the Garda to keep statistics relating to detentions and so on.  It is on the basis of that type of information, together with general crime statistics, that this House will be able to review the effects of these sections, which some of us wish, in different circumstances, were not necessary. We as legislators should be able to review it on the basis of comprehensive information before us and not on the basis of gossip, rumour or sensationalism in the media if the Garda make a mistake in the context of one or two individuals. It is essential that we can look at the manner in which the sections are operating and discuss that in the context of the review on the basis of solid, certified information available.  At present, unfortunately, there is no guarantee that that information will be there.</P>
    <P>In welcoming the Minister's amendment I believe that a five year period is appropriate.  I do not believe one could properly review the manner in which this legislation is working without seeing it in operation for a number of years.  I do not believe The Workers' Party amendment, which suggests that a review should take place in 12 months, is serious.  It is part of the attitude they have brought to bear on this legislation.  Effectively, they take the view that it is not needed.  I have no doubt that most of what is contained in this legislation is needed and their suggestion that we should review it in one year cannot be a serious proposal.  I ask the Minister to again look at the possibility of requiring the Garda, in their own interests, in the interest of this House and of the general public to keep the type of statistical information for which I am asking so that they and this House can participate properly in five years' time in any discussions which may take place about reviewing sections which the Minister intends to have reviewed in five years' time under he amendment he has tabled.</P>

      <P>I should like to add briefly to what Deputy Shatter put forward regarding constructive use being made of the five year period by the Minister. Not alone should we have statistical figures regarding crime and the detention of prisoners but it should also be used in a much more constructive and rounded way and not taken in isolation.  Part of the problem of this legislation is that it seems to be seen in isolation from the other structures of law and the social ills which bring about our high crime rate. We should not confine ourselves to a review of certain sections; it should also take in statistics regarding return to prison by prisoners who because of their high detention rate get nothing from the penal system except a higher level of depression&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Before we get into the question of semantics regarding one, there, or five years, if innocent people suffer under this legislation it will not really matter how long the time is.  I take the view which was taken on Second Stage by many Deputies from the Government and this side of the House that this possibly is not the right approach to our current crime problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molony referred very eloquently to the powers which the Garda have in other countries.  We have learned from that that giving more power to the Garda does not in itself help to resolve crime.  Arming policemen in the United States and other countries has merely escalated their crime problem.  I wonder if our approach in terms of increased powers is the correct one.  Deputy Flanagan takes the view that the building of more prisons, recruiting more gardaí and giving them more powers can help to solve the crime problem.  The facts do not <Col N="1640" /> bear that out.  The vast majority of people, particularly young offenders, come from deprived and disadvantaged backgrounds.  They have a very poor standard of education and it is in this area that we should be solving the crime problem. Deputy Flanagan said that no innocent person would suffer under this Bill and that no person who kept and respected the law need worry.  I wish that was the case.  I do not mind giving the Garda powers if they are necessary &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is what I am discussing. Under this legislation people will not be entitled to have their legal adviser present when they are being interrogated, which is a pity.  I do not mind giving the Garda temporary powers if the proper safeguards, checks and balances are there.  However, I see no reason why a solicitor or independent legal adviser cannot be made available to the person who is being interrogated.  I regret that the Minister did not see fit to adopt that amendment.  It is unfortunate that this legislation is being introduced as many of us feel it is not necessary &mdash;&mdash;</P>

I hope that the kind of statistics to which Deputy Shatter referred will be available.  I should also like the Minister to indicate on what basis he might support the retention of this legislation.  Will <Col N="1641" /> it be on the basis of more people having been convicted, the Garda wanting the legislation to remain or on the basis of our crime rate decreasing?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the sensible amendment by the Minister to the effect that there will be a review after five years.  This review concerns sections 3 to 8 and 14 to 18.  Six of those sections are lumped under &ldquo;detention of arrested persons in Garda Síochána custody in certain circumstances&rdquo;.  Two others relate to offences regarding the withholding of information and there are a few further sections relating to inferences which can at times be drawn where the accused person fails to account for being in a certain place.  The Minister is proposing to review these sections after a period of five years.  Perhaps he would indicate whether at that stage he will make the decision that a resolution will be put or if there will be a full sale of the problem and a detailed review of the operation of those sections?  This is emergency legislation but we are living in critical times.  This legislation has not been brought forward because the Minister thought his Department were not seen to be effective enough.  It is being brought in because of a difficult and dangerous situation which exists at present.  The Minister has accepted that some of the sections are far-reaching and may interfere with the rights of people, even innocent people.  However, the rights of many innocent people have already been interfered with and that is why we have this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the period of five years is reasonable.  In my opinion one year would be totally inadequate.  By allowing five years this will give a sufficient length of time to see how the sections operate. I agree with speakers who say that statistical and other information should be gathered during this period to see how the Bill operates.  I hope that after five years the Minister may be able to tell us that the crime rate has been reduced and that it will not be necessary to add anything further.  We will have to wait and see.  I wish to know if after five years there will be a general review of the entire <Col N="1642" /> legislation and what aspects will be taken into consideration.  I presume that five years will start after the passing of the Bill and the complaints procedure.</P>
    <P>Some of the comment on the Bill has been slightly misinformed.  As legislators we have to do our part to protect the rights and liberties of all people.  I urge the Minister to stick to the five years which I consider a sensible and worth-while proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I note with interest that the Minister's amendment states that the sections shall cease to be in operation at the expiry of five years unless a resolution is passed by each House of the Oireachtas. I understand this will allow the House to debate the resolution when it comes before it.  That will be a good opportunity to review the changes that have taken place.  The only criterion I would have in reviewing the matter after three or five years would be the level of crime.  It may happen that further amendments may be necessary at that time.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Harney, said that many people engaged in crime come from a deprived background but most of the victims also come from a deprived background.  We hear a lot about those who commit crime but not often do we hear about the people on the receiving end.  We have to think about them.  In relation to the review period, it would be desirable for the Minister to have available statistics of people who repeatedly commit crime.  Some time ago I asked a question in the House about how many people convicted of crime had previous convictions but the figures were not available to the Minister for Justice.  There should be some way on a computer system of finding out how many crimes are committed by the same group of people. Recently we read in the newspapers that about 50 people are responsible for the great bulk of crime in Dublin.  If we could get those people off the streets the crime rate would show a tremendous decline. Stiffer penalties could reduce dramatically the crime rate in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear to be a fairly widely held view on both sides of <Col N="1643" /> the House that the implementation of the measures in this Bill will in some way prove a panacea so far as tackling crime is concerned, that over a period, whether it be one, three or five years the implementation of the provisions of the Bill will make a dramatic impact on the crime figures.  I doubt that very much.  On the question of the severity of penalties and draconian police powers, the experience of history shows that increasing police powers and penalties does not necessarily mean a commensurate reduction in the crime figures.  That factor has to be taken into account in deterniming what should be the initial review period.</P>
      <P>There appears to be some dichotomy of thought perhaps on the part of the Government as to the permanency or otherwise of the Bill.  When it was introduced it was put forward as being a permanent addition to the Statute Book. Then the question of the temporary nature of the Bill was introduced by the Minister's amendment.  I suggest to the Minister that if the genuine intent is to regard these measures as temporary and on a kind of trial basis, he might consider amending the title of the Bill.  He might consider interspersing the words &ldquo;Temporary Provisions&rdquo; in the title, to call it the Criminal Justice (Temporary Provisions) Bill, thereby making it quite clear that it was intended as a temporary measure. However, temporary legislative measures have a practice of hardening and becoming permanent.  Some of these measures were referred to by Deputy Flanagan, such as The Offences Against the State Act.  Equally, I could refer to the income tax code which was introduced in 1914 as a temporary measure. As we all know very well, that is still with us.  Notwithstanding the Minister's amendment, this Bill is likely to be permanent and renewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see that the power of detention will add to convictions.  The power of arrest is already there.  At the end of the day convictions are based on evidence and the detention of people does not produce any additional evidence.  If properly implemented and if that power of detention is conducted in a proper manner, <Col N="1644" /> it will not produce one iota of evidence.</P>
    <P>The measures in the Bill are innovative. They constitute potential dangers to some, perhaps many, innocent people.  I welcome the suggestion that there should be a limitation: I think five years is too long for a measure of this kind.  In my view, a maximum of two or three years might be considered appropriate to see what impact, if any, the Bill will have on the crime figures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest it would be in order to ask the Minister to consider some figure in between the two figures. That was suggested already by Deputy Woods when he spoke and there is a good deal of force in that argument.  A three-year period would be quite adequate to enable the crime figures to be examined and to enable the House to determine whether or not the decidely negative aspects of the Bill were made worthwhile by positive results obtaining in the achievement of an improvement in crime figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of my short contribution following that of Deputy Woods I did not advert to the Minister's amendment as such.  The House should give the Minister the support he requires in relation to the operability of the section.  It seems to be agreed that while we may find the sections in their generality distasteful they should be given an opportunity to work. I do not deny, as might be presumed by Deputy Flanagan's contribution, the right of The Workers' Party to move an amendment to the Bill.  That is their entitlement and I respect their right to propose such an amendment.  I do not agree with their amendment because, frankly, I believe it is a nonsense to suggest that the sections should be allowed to operate for one year only and then be subject to a review.  The Minister is not far off the mark when he suggests that five years should be the review period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1645" /> I should like to ask the Minister under what criteria the sections will be reviewed?  Will they be reviewed by the Government or, as Deputy Briscoe said, by the graph of crime figures five years hence, or on a resolution of the House? I hope the Minister treats that important point seriously.  Much will depend on the Minister's response to that point.  I am not intimidating the Minister; he is strong enough not to put up with any suggestion of intimidation but his attitude to my query might well form our approach to the future progress of the Bill.  I do not offer that as a threat to the Minister because I am not in the business of issuing threats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>While I do not share the level of concern expressed by some Deputies in relation to this section those who followed the Second Stage debate will be clear that the two sections of greatest concern are those referred to in this limitation section.  A question in relation to them is whether the Bill as a whole will be effective in reducing the level of crime and whether it will interfere radically with civil liberties.  That these two sections are to be reviewed within five year is a welcome amendment.  I hope that many of the Members who are present today will be in the House in five years' time to give the review the same attention that they are giving the Bill.  Deputy Taylor expressed a lack of optimism in relation to the measures and indicated that such measures historically had not succeeded. There is a different situation currently. Draconian measures in the past generally were imposed on an unwilling population but there is a tremendous body of goodwill out there for the success of the legislation.</P>

It appears that we are being told that if we do not get this through fast, like the Bill that was passed some years ago, the whole State will be in a state of collapse. I do not think that is the case at all.  We have legislation.

      <P>That Dáil Éireann, considering the importance of tourism to the economy generally and particularly in the area of employment, calls on the Government to take immediate steps to maximise the potential of our tourist industry.</P>
      <P>In moving this motion I would remind the House that the world's biggest growth industry this century is the tourist industry. It is reckoned it is bigger even than the oil industry.  It will have huge implications for our economy and for job creation. In the past, Governments made an act of faith in tourism hoping it would develop by its own volition because of ethnic loyalties and the international perception of the far away Emerald Isle, but never adequately funding Irish tourism's main promotional agency, Bord Fáilte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of operational and development budget given to Bord Fáilte is so small by comparison with other agencies <Col N="1649" /> dealing with exports that Bord Fáilte can only be admired for the results they have achieved during the years.  We must speculate how much greater the impact on tourism would have been on jobs and revenue generation if national financial commitments had matched expressions of support during the years.  While CII and the IDA were annually getting their requirements to meet their targets, Bord Fáilte found it difficult to transfer political sentiment into tangible allocations.  A few simple statistics will prove my point.</P>
    <P>For every employee of Bord Fáilte in 1972, 2,700 tourists visited Ireland.  For every employee of Bord Fáilte in 1982, 4,700 tourists visited the country.  Every £1 spent on tourism in 1972 generated £22 in revenue and every £1 spent on tourism in 1982 generated £27.  The industry earned £760 million last year and catered for 2.377 million out-of-State tourists and 4.273 million home holidaymakers. It involves 72,000, or 7 per cent of our total work force.  Therefore, in real terms the industry is a major generator of revenue and jobs.</P>
    <P>Because of the variety and complexity of the interests involved, a complete rethink of our objectives in tourism is necessary.  This should be translated into a national tourism plan setting out short and long-term targets.  This would involve imaginative and bold initiatives in matters of taxation, transport, marketing promotion and environmental control and preservation, as well as specialist tourism and general services.  In support of Bord Fáilte I foresee an advisory co-ordinating committee comprising representatives of the Departments of Finance, Communications, Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Environment, Labour and Education so that maximum recognition will exist of the various components of a saleable tourism package.</P>
    <P>A few examples will serve to indicate the need for action now.  If there is one criterion more than another that will decide the future of tourism it is the question of standards.  We have an expensive product serviced by an expensive transport system and people will only pay for <Col N="1650" /> a quality product.  It is a business in which there is a high level of person-to-person contact demanding the highest level of personal hygiene and presentation.  This demand must be met in every grade of accommodation and service.  There has been too much complaint and talk of sloppy and dirty service.  This irritant can be overcome by education and management. We must match up the 1983 statistics of 41 per cent of overseas visitors unhappy with value for money with the 89 per cent of all tourists in that year who were satisfied with their holidays.</P>
    <P>We are a secondary tourist location whose access transport is expensive.  Easier and cheaper access by all carriers will have to be matched with Bord Fáilte marketing strategy.  An anomaly exists in regard to competitive carrier relationships. The Department of Communications handle aviation transport policy dealing with charters, access transport and fares.  They also handle the national airline.  There is a conflict of interests and a separation of the two responsibilities is long overdue.  The beneficiary would be the tourist industry.  We are dealing with a numbers game and the only way to multiply the numbers is to lessen the burden of transport on the overall cost of the holiday.  This decision will take political courage but until it is there the marketing strategy will labour under a very severe handicap.</P>
    <P>Last year 1.52 million British tourists came to Ireland, 52 per cent of them to visit relatives.  They spent £130 million. Of those, 76 per cent stayed with friends and relatives.  These figures show the strength of the ethnic pull but also they show that the number of visitors from Great Britain fell every year since 1978. We must get the British motorist back. We are losing him because of loss of price competitiveness.  There are clear indications that the prices of petrol, drink and food are deterring factors.</P>
    <P>These areas are under our own direct control and we must face up to this if we are to compete with the foreign holiday threat in our nearest and biggest market. Of all the surveys undertaken the predominant reason visitors still give for coming to Ireland as guests is our scenery <Col N="1651" /> and the friendliness of our people.  We can only hope that hard times and recession and the profit motive will not erode the latter but we can do something to protect and preserve the former.</P>
    <P>An unspoilt environment is our greatest national asset from the point of view of tourism, and vigilance and determination are the virtues that will keep it pollution free.  All local authorities are aware of the unauthorised illegal dumping that is taking place throughout the country&mdash;rubbish, litter and abandoned vehicles everywhere.  If a tourist never came we owe it to ourselves to clean up Ireland.  The resources of the Department of Labour and the youth employment schemes should be harnessed to do a national clean-up.  The benefits would be many&mdash;jobs for our unemployed, a more pleasant environment for all to live in and an educational good example to all to be more careful about our heritage. Our schools should play their part to create the proper attitude to environmental control.</P>
    <P>During the forthcoming US Presidential visit we will be given a great opportunity. We do not want the TV cameras of the world to be showing up our black and dreary spots.  We should use those cameras for world wide TV promotion of what is best in Irish tourism.</P>
    <P>The development of specialist tourism, not just as an addition to holiday itineraries but as an attraction in its own right for major special interest groups, is a very important factor.  These special interest opportunities exist in the sporting, cultural, musical and archaeological fields, to mention only a few, and I appeal to the Minister to examine them carefully. There is also considerable scope for improving and marketing Ireland as an international conference business centre. We have an inland waterway system second to none in Europe.  Our boat holding capacity can equal any canal system in Europe and there is tremendous scope to develop this so that we can gain what is very much needed in real terms, that is, to attract the European tourists in bigger numbers.</P>
    <P>Hotels and tourism are mutually <Col N="1652" /> dependent.  The hotel industry, an integral part of the tourist industry, plays an ever-increasing part in the social and economic life of this country.  In many respects it acts as a barometer of the entire industry.  Our 615 hotels, employing 22,700 people &mdash; 85 per cent of them outside the Dublin area &mdash; the majority of them Irish owned, are in some difficulty at this time.  However, even in their difficulty they earned over £150 million in foreign revenue last year.  They paid £61 million in VAT returns and bought £100 million of agricultural produce last year.  Every job directly involved in the hotel industry maintains another job in related manufacturing, processing and service industries.</P>
    <P>The biggest bogey of the hotel industry is the VAT levels which apply to what is essentially an export industry.  The disadvantage which tourism has to contend with is that its competitors have an average VAT rating of 9 per cent while our industry labours under double that rate. In effect, there is a 10 per cent or 11 per cent visitors tax on every out-of-State visitor who comes here.  Add to this the domestic inflation rate, which is also double the European average, and the consequential loss of competitiveness is very easily identified.  There is a strong argument that if the VAT rate for hotel room and food sales was reduced substantially, with the corresponding reduction in these tariffs, the loss of revenue to the State would be more than compensated by increased business volume and hotel turnover.</P>
    <P>The Government have contributed about £10 million to rescuing the Great Southern Hotel chain and have agreed to the deferment of the payment of VAT to help them get over their financial problems. In simple equity the Government should allow similar arrangements with the Revenue Commissioners as those for OIE to allow for a deferment of payment of VAT where this would cause serious financial hardship and job losses.  There could be an increase of VAT returns to the Exchequer because more businesses paying the lower VAT rate would be attracted from the non-VAT paying sectors of accommodation operating here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1653" /> Hotels have been losing the businessmen's market share to in-home catering and small caterers not paying VAT.  If the VAT on business purchases could be reclaimed, a great deal of commercial traffic would be generated and returned to the hotels.  In effect, we would get back the businessmen's trade from the black economy.  Because of low profitability over the past ten years re-investment has been very limited in the hotel industry, resulting in a deterioration, especially of hotel plant.  Simultaneously the incentives schemes operated by Bord Fáilte when tourism was at its peak in the sixties have also dwindled drastically.  The Government should consider immediately interest subsidies for existing capital development loans and to keep up standards a refurbishing grant scheme is absolutely essential.  The Minister promised this last winter and still we await news of any implementation of a scheme. An investment in renewals today will save the State millions of pounds later in replacement and much higher capital outlay when the plant fails completely.</P>
    <P>The scheme announced in the 1984 budget by the Minister dealing with the question of rebate of VAT on sale of goods to tourists is an embarrassment to our tourist promoters and should be withdrawn forthwith.  Neither scheme has an opportunity of working.  They are complex and will be impossible to administer. It is ridiculous to suggest that a VAT rebate scheme on purchases made by ordinary tourists will only apply if each item purchased is in excess of £152 in value.  The question of certification by customs will make it impossible to make this scheme a success.  What was needed was a simple scheme directly in line with the one I recommended during the debate on the Tourist Traffic Bill last winter.  I recommended a Swedish model as the one best suited to cater for our situation.  It was simplicity itself.  It was easy to promote and readily and easily understood by everybody.  The visitor should have to pay for the item and the VAT, get the proper receipt and at the exit point he should be able to get the rebate of the VAT paid.  All he should have to do is produce his receipt and <Col N="1654" /> identification.  That is the way the scheme works in other jurisdictions.  Why is it that other countries when dealing with schemes to promote tourism can take the pragmatic view all the time?  Why do we have to make it virtually impossible for anybody to benefit under this scheme?</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta, working as agents for the State, should have operated the scheme. The shipping companies would have been happy to oblige as well because they too are involved in the arrangements for bringing visitors to and from this country. Those people have vested interests and it would have enhanced their operations at the airports and improved business at duty-free shops.  I would have introduced a system where the rebate offices would be located next to the duty-free shops. The people having been paid their rebate in the currency of the State would be able to make further purchases in the duty-free shop rather than going back through immigration control and converting the cash into their own currency.</P>
    <P>The arrangements suggested by the Revenue Commissioners are more than an embarrassment.  They will be impossible to implement.  The scheme is complex, difficult and is not in line with the spirit of the scheme announced by the Minister in his Budget Statement.  Even at this late stage I ask the Minister to have another look at withdrawing the scheme as outlined by the Revenue Commissioners and bringing in a scheme similar to that which operates in other European countries.</P>
    <P>If there is some difficulty about a land frontier, I would confine the scheme to international tourists at first.  The airports and seaports could cater for the business that would be generated.  What would be generated would be an increase in the sale of goods throughout the country with a consequent increase in the employment generated by that VAT increase.  Every sale attracts VAT and the amount of money lost to the Exchequer would be more than made up by the increased revenue which would accrue from expenditure at first point of sale by tourists.  That has been a great disappointment to everybody in the industry.  The Minister must remember that the scheme for the rebate <Col N="1655" /> of VAT on purchases made by tourists will now be implemented not just in some Scandinavian countries but in most of the major tourist countries on the Continent. The convoluted system being suggested as our answer to helping tourism will only mean that multi-destination tourists, particularly from America, will spend their money in countries where they can get the easiest and best rebate.  If we are to compete in this area of activity we will have to do so in a way which will justify the Minister bringing in the scheme at all.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there has been a great lack of tourism policy on the part of this Government.  I would point out to the Minister that in the recent Finance Bill the hotel industry has been specifically excluded from section 84 loans. They are also excluded from the venture capital scheme.  We on this side of the House have no doubt that no direct input was made by the Minister of State or by the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism at the Cabinet table in getting means allocated to the industry whereby they could deal with section 84 loans and venture capital.  What other industry deserves the implementation of those schemes more than the tourist industry?</P>
    <P>We have given lip service to what tourism could do for this country but as yet there has been no positive commitment in giving Bord Fáilte the necessary funds to adopt a proper marketing strategy designed to attract people in large numbers. In real terms every pound spent in the tourist industry returns more than a pound spent in any other area of activity. I am asking the Minister of State, through the Minister, to make representations to the Cabinet to reverse the ridiculous decision concerning the rebate of VAT on purchases made here by tourists and to reconsider the situation in regard to section 84 loans and venture capital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>That this is a very important motion is shown by the fact that so many Members want to express their views.  Bord Fáilte have done a reasonably good job over the years but they have not been getting the necessary funds <Col N="1656" /> to carry out much needed promotional work.  Let us take, for example, the case of the Midland Regional Tourism Organisation. They lack funds to encourage tourists and are unable to design and market a programme for tourists who come to this country.</P>
      <P>Pricing policies must be examined because charges vary greatly among hotels and restaurants.  I must be slightly critical and say that hotels and caterers go in for the kill and jack up prices whenever an organisation holds a major function. This is giving us a bad name and I could not support it.  They may get away with it once but not a second time.  People are intelligent and they know what is going on.</P>
      <P>My colleague has referred to the rebate of VAT on purchases made by tourists. It is a most clumsy instrument and I cannot see how it will work.  I cannot see that tourists will want to become involved in all that documentation.</P>
      <P>The very high rate of VAT is killing the tourist industry.  When we put down this motion last year we asked that VAT rates be substantially reduced.  The Minister for Finance said it could not be done but eventually, following the argument we put forward, he reduced VAT.  The question must be considered once again. The Minister will quote the figure of revenue shortfall but I believe there would be a gain.</P>
      <P>Farm holidays are now taking over the tourism industry.  This is due to the level of charges because prices in hotels vary greatly.</P>
      <P>The Minister should co-ordinate the activities of Bórd Fáilte and all the other bodies involved in tourism such as CIE, Aer Lingus and the shipping companies. Through this co-ordination tourism packages could be devised.</P>
      <P>Private transport, whether to football matches or elsewhere, has taken over from CIE.  This is because it is always on time and the package is cheaper and more attractive.  What have we done about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities also have a part to play.  They should be involved in cleaning up scenic areas and removing cars and other rubbish.  This task could provide jobs through the Youth Employment <Col N="1657" /> Agency and months of work would be provided.  The local authorities may say they have not the necessary personnel to administer such a scheme but if they were properly approached I am sure they would co-operate.  We have more engineers than ordinary workers in local authorities and some engineers are supervising only two men.  That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>I do not blame Bord Fáilte for the lack of co-ordination.  They have not been given the direction but I have no doubt that if such a direction were given they would co-operate with the other agencies and local authorities to bring about an improvement in our tourist facilities.</P>
    <P>In the midlands area where I come from the main complaints have related to charges and hotels not being clean.  I can elaborate on that.  People have had a lot of complaints to make.  Bord Fáilte and the Midland Regional Tourist Organisation have not got the finance to go around to these places and see what is happening. Grants should be made available to hotel owners and people in the catering industry to enable them to refurbish their premises.  Cabarets were all the go for a number of years, but over the past few months there has been a falling off in attendance.  About a week ago a very attractive group were playing in a certain place.  I will not name them.  A key group were entertaining and there were only 280 people in attendance.  I asked what was wrong and I was told it cost £4 to get in and the price of drink had been shoved up again.</P>
    <P>Cleanliness is very important.  Tourism brings in £760 million.  That is an enormous amount.  The grant to Bord Fáilte was in the region of £10 million and is now in the region of £20 million.  That is a paltry amount.  A large amount of the grant given to Bord Fáilte goes on administration costs.  It has to be divided by four or five to show the amount which actually goes into the industry.  About 22,000 people are employed in the tourist industry.  That is a substantial number of jobs.  There is a great outcry when a hotel gets into difficulties, and rescue plans are suggested.  We must give a lead.</P>
    <P>There must be co-ordination between <Col N="1658" /> the State bodies involved in this industry. The Minister should take that on board. They may say that this cannot be done, but a great deal could be done.  Our road signposting leaves a great deal to be desired.  The local authorities could play their part in co-operation with the tourist board, Aer Lingus, CIE, the shipping company and everybody involved in the industry.  We must present an attractive picture; if not the tourist will not come here, they will go elsewhere and they cannot be blamed.  They are looking for value for money.  The British tourists are looking hard at us also to see whether we are giving good value for money.  That is open to question.</P>
    <P>People involved in the industry cannot get away with any sort of catering and then charging people through the nose. That is not on.  The management in the industry must look at their pricing arrangement and see that they are good. Many tourists have spoken to me about variations in prices.  I do not know the reason for this.  There are even variations in the price of meals.  We need uniformity of prices.</P>
    <P>Grants should be made available to enable hotel owners to refurbish their premises.  They are unable to do that themselves because their profits are affected by the high VAT rate.  The VAT rate should be reduced substantially.  This is most important.  If we do that our industry will be more attractive to tourists and help us to maintain our existing employment.  I want to warn the Minister that if we do not make our tourist industry more attractive, at the end of the year there will be further closures of hotels.  I regret having to say that.  All these bodies should have been co-ordinated long ago. I have no doubt that if they are handled properly they will co-operate with the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. M. Moynihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To delete all the words after &ldquo;employment,&rdquo; and substitute: <Col N="1659" />&ldquo;commends the steps being taken by the Government to assist the tourist industry to realise its potential.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity to speak about the tourist industry here tonight, its importance to the economy and its great potential for future development. Very few Deputies will disagree with me when I say tourism has a major role to play in setting our economy on the right road and helping us to expand.  This industry earns a large amount of foreign currency and supports a large number of permanent jobs.  It has the potential to earn more foreign currency and to create more jobs.  This Government have done and will continue to do everything possible to create the environment in which industries such as tourism can develop to their fullest potential.</P>
    <P>Throughout the seventies tourism was overshadowed by the rapid progress in agriculture and in the manufacturing industries.  EEC membership in 1973 gave a great impetus to these sectors and to future job creation in them.  The onset of the current recessionary cycle in 1979 undermined many of these achievements with consequent serious losses in employment and the closure of industries once thought to be absolutely impregnable. Tourism, on the other hand, has come through the recession without the deep structural damage evident in agriculture and manufacturing.  It has shown a remarkable resilience in the face of very negative trading conditions.  Indeed, in the last few years it has been able to capitalise on favourable opportunities prevailing in the overseas markets.</P>
    <P>Prospects for tourism in Ireland &mdash; short, medium and long-term &mdash; are good.  We possess in our countryside the physical attributes and in our people the social attributes necessary for a thriving tourism industry, We have here a tourism product which can compete effectively on the world tourism markets, a market which, it is predicted by many leading authorities, will grow into the world's biggest by the end of this century.  The most recent forecast of the European <Col N="1660" /> Travel Commission is that by 1990 the level of tourist arrivals in their 21 member states will be of the order of 240 million. This compares with a figure of some 160 million in 1982.  The forecast increase of 50 per cent must give us an idea of the immense opportunities existing for Irish tourism and of the benefits which can be achieved through tourism for the development of our total economy.</P>
    <P>Irish tourism's ability to achieve this success will be influenced by a number of factors, some within our control and, indeed, some influenced by external matters, which are &mdash; a return to growth in the world economy; Ireland's competitive position compared with other destinations, maintenance by us of a high quality tourism product; the political situation in Northern Ireland; our ability to replace the declining Irish-related markets in Britain and the United States. These are all factors which will be crucial to the long-term viability and health of our tourism industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister say to replace the British markets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. M. Moynihan Mr. M. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  International travel is, to a large degree, determined by the rate of world economic growth. Prospects now, based on current trends, are much more positive than was the case some 12 months ago.  Inflation has fallen in most countries, including our own. Projected inflation rates for this year in most of our main markets are of the order of 2 to 5 per cent.  International exchange rates are not expected to change significantly. It is confidently predicted that Europe, including Ireland, will for the rest of the present decade be competitive with other parts of the world in terms of value for money offered by their tourist product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A healthy domestic economy is the foundation which the Irish tourist industry needs.  The Government have, in their relatively short period in office, taken positive strides towards stabilising this firm foundation.  Ireland indeed compares very well in its recent handling of the economic ills which have plagued all western countries.  Our inflation rate has <Col N="1661" /> dropped considerably, our prices have stabilised, we are coming around to growth and expansion in our economy. This Government have taken the decisions on economic matters necessary to put the economy right.  We have not been swayed by the easy option of short-term expediency.  This House realises and the country appreciates that this Government have the will and ability to develop a sound economy for the future.  As I have said, a sound economy is vital for the industry and its expansion and development.</P>
    <P>I see tourism as one of Ireland's most important export industries.  It has the capability, firstly, to earn foreign currency which we so badly need at present; secondly to provide and sustain much needed employment for our population, particularly the youngsters coming on to the jobs market; thirdly, to make an enormous contribution to regional development by stimulating commercial activity in our more remote areas.</P>
    <P>The Government recognise the industry's potential, not alone in words but, I am glad to say, in action also.  Since taking office we have acted, notwithstanding the extremely difficult economic circumstances, to alleviate some of the competitivity problems facing the industry.  The decisions in successive budgets are evidence of this.  Holiday accommodation in hotels and guesthouses was exempt from increase in VAT rates.  VAT on car hire, on caravan hire and on boat hire was reduced.  The tax on live entertainment tickets is now down to only 5 per cent &mdash; 10 per cent less than that in Britain. Visitors can now claim a refund in full on retail sales tax on goods purchased in Ireland.  These are all attractive concessions and, working in combination, have a strong, positive appeal among potential visitors.</P>
    <P>Tourism is a buyer's market.  Effective marketing of the product is probably more important in tourism than in any other import-export sector.  We are extremely fortunate here to have a tourism promotional board as dedicated and as effective as Bord Fáilte Éireann.  In my period in office, I have had the opportunity to view at first hand the board's <Col N="1662" /> marketing activities on home and overseas markets and I have been deeply impressed by the effectiveness and professionalism of their approach.</P>
    <P>Over the past two years the Government have provided the board with a significant level of promotional funds to help them to press home the Irish tourism message in the various world markets. This year, for example, the allocation for Bord Fáilte, of the order of £14.972 million, is the highest provision ever made for the promotion of Irish tourism.  In the area of promotional expenditure, as in other areas of Exchequer tourism spending, my Department and I are continually aware of the need to ensure a satisfactory return to State resources employed in the sector.  The national objective of tourism policy is to maximise the economic and social benefits in Ireland gained by the promotion and development of tourism consistent with ensuring an acceptable rate of return on the resources employed. The House can be assured that I shall continue effectively to pursue the achievement of these objectives.</P>
    <P>While I am on the subject of the importance of marketing, it is appropriate to say a few words about the immediate prospects for tourism growth in the various overseas markets.  The market foremost in my mind at the moment is the German market as I have just returned from participating in two of a recent series of Bord Fáilte promotional workshops in this market.  The workshops, which were held in nine venues around Germany, were a new development for Bord Fáilte.  They combined an evening of Irish entertainment with a promotional message for prospective tourists.  I would like to say here that the interest and enthusiasm demonstrated by the German community among whom I had the pleasure and honour to be present on two evenings were really astonishing.  At two venues in excess of 1,000 people came, not only by invitation but, by a new strategy of Bord Fáilte in their promotion: they had to pay a small fee in order to indicate their sincerity.</P>
    <P>This was a feature demonstrating the tremendous interest there is in Irish tourism on the German market.  I was very <Col N="1663" /> fortunate to view at first hand the immense enthusiasm there is in Germany and we can look forward to substantial growth in that market.  Initial reaction has been very positive and Bord Fáilte are optimistic that the German market will show significant growth again this year.  Indeed our overall prospects for continental European travel to Ireland this year and in the next three to five years are much more promising than they have been in the recent past.  All European economies, including that of France, are expected to show a real growth this year of the order of 1 to 2 per cent, improving to 2 to 4 per cent in 1985. This, together with the lifting of the French travel restrictions and competitive air and sea fares, should continue to meet Bord Fáilte's target for tourism growth of between 3 and 5 per cent achievable in 1984.</P>
    <P>North America probably holds the best prospect for growth after two consecutive years of expansion with revenue reaching £126 million last year as compared with £60 million in 1981.  This year Bord Failte are seeking growth from this market of between 6 and 10 per cent, a highly optimistic approach but one we are confident of achieving.  We would hope to welcome over 300,000 United States visitors this year, the highest ever number.  This optimism is based on a number of factors: the value of the United States dollar in Ireland, increased air traffic capacity and very competitive air fares, a determinedly high profile Bord Failte marketing campaign and the fact that Ireland exemplifies major tourist attractions for United States visitors to Europe, namely, our culture, history and beautiful scenery. Therefore it will be seen that this American market has tremendous interest potential.  On assuming office one of the first matters I investigated was why in the year 1981-82 something in the region of five million American tourists came to Europe, of whom in excess of two million went to Britain and only between 200,000 and 250,000 came here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Because we are a secondary tourist location, that is the reason.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. M. Moynihan Mr. M. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>When one remembers that within that colossal American population there are 40 million Irish ties and relations one has reason to be disappointed that such a small proportion came here in that year.  I believe that the current decisions of Aer Lingus in relation to fares, increased chartered arrangements and a number of other factors will remedy that situation and secure for us that growth of American tourists to which we are genuinely entitled.</P>
      <P>I believe also that the Irishness of the approach to holidays here is important, that the fuller development of Irish music, song and dance in the peak of the tourist season is of particular significance to United States visitors, the absence of which has been noticeable.  Parades on St. Patrick's Day and other occasions have exhibited the best features of our culture but too often during the peak tourist season their absence is significantly noticeable.  Through promotions, discussions with Bord Fáilte, local Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann and other cultural activities we hope to remedy that situation by ensuring that facilities are made available for the highlighting of all the splendid aspects of our music, song and dance so appreciated by tourists, especially Americans.  Those are all plus factors which should render 1984 another record year for United States tourists to Ireland.  All reports of that market and in particular feed-back information from Irish tourist companies selling in America suggest that interest in Ireland as a tourist destination was never higher in the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking beyond this year the medium-term prospects for the United States tourism market continue to be most encouraging.  The most significant part of overseas traffic flow to Europe is from the United States.  In 1982 it accounted for approximately 10 million arrivals in Europe.  On European Travel Commission forecasts of growth of 5 per cent per annum in this traffic up to 1990, to a total of 14.5 million arrivals, Ireland must be well placed to increase its share of this immense traffic growth.  Success in the United States market is so important <Col N="1665" /> as to be almost vital for our tourist industry, particularly our hoteliers, car hire and coach hire companies.  It is reckoned that the average spending of an American tourist in Ireland is approximately twice that of his or her continental European counterpart or three times that of a British counterpart.  An indication of its importance can be seen from the following statistics: American tourists account for six out of ten cars rented by overseas visitors, for over 80 per cent of our coach tour business, seven out of ten overseas visitors attending banquets and are half of hotel bed nights on the part of overseas visitors.</P>
    <P>I went to the United States late last year to help the tourism promotion effort and was most impressed by the work being done there by Bord Fáilte officers. During that visit, at many promotions I attended in the course of that trip and indeed also to continental Europe, it was made very clear that the presence of private sector representatives, hoteliers, car and coach operators and others, was invaluable in getting the Irish tourism message across.  I am glad to note that this year Bord Fáilte have introduced a scheme under which private tourist operators will be assisted financially and otherwise in undertaking overseas promotional activities.  I would urge all sectors of the industry to avail of the provisions of this scheme and follow the example of those who participate in Bord Fáilte's overseas promotions.</P>
    <P>Despite our success in other markets Britain remains the largest, closest tourism market.  Unfortunately our image there, arising from the Northern situation, militates against a restoration of tourist growth from that immense market. Last year Bord Fáilte launched a new three-year advertising and publicity campaign aimed at winning a greater share of first time visitors particularly in the non-Irish related sector.  The House will recall that well-known personalities were used in the course of that campaign which was designed to improve Ireland's image in Britain as a holiday destination. Last year the newspaper and magazine advertisements features of the campaign won two top awards from the British <Col N="1666" /> Institute of Marketing.  So far reaction to that campaign has been positive showing a perceptible increase in numbers from the tourist segment of the market.  Last year tourist numbers grew by 2 per cent while revenue, at £131 million, was up by 6 per cent.  While Ireland still labours under the disadvantage of perceived high prices for a range of tourist items <i>vis-à-vis</i> prices in Britain, there is a very wrong impression created, particularly when one takes into account the currency differentials there are in our favour.  Bord Fáilte are confident that real growth can be achieved in this market in 1984 and have set themselves a target of between 2 and 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>The value of marketing and promotion in the tourist context is enormous.  Tourism needs to operate in a positive atmosphere.  It is that type of industry.  Visitors to Ireland and Irish holidaymakers need to be greeted with a welcome and a smile and not with a frown.  There is no place in tourism for gloom and despondency. Some of the utterances of the so-called tourism experts, mostly ill-informed and in search of cheap, sensational headlines, do little to further the cause of the industry they purport to represent and in many cases are the source of untold damage.  The atmosphere that the industry itself creates is crucial to the desirability Ireland projects as a destination. Informed, constructive criticism is needed if we are to create the right tourism product and the right atmosphere in which to market it.</P>
    <P>Maintenance of a high quality tourism product and infrastructure is a prerequisite to the industry realising its potential. It is essential that we provide the accommodation, amenities, facilities and services of the right quality and quantity to fulfil the expectations of our visitors. In the coming years this country will be judged increasingly in tourism terms against the high and in most cases meticulous standards of other competing international destinations.  I am glad to say that Bord Fáilte visitor surveys show generally that there is a high level of satisfaction amongst our tourists.  The most recent survey of our visitors, undertaken <Col N="1667" /> towards the end of last season showed, for example, that over 80 per cent of all our US visitors would recommend Ireland to their friends and relations.  A satisfied tourist is the best salesman, and the only way to have a satisfied customer is to give him the best possible product at the best possible price.</P>
    <P>Deputies tonight have referred to this matter and I want to reinforce very strongly my approach on one of the fundamental criteria that I have set down for the expansion and development of tourism, that is value for money.  Unless the overwhelming majority of tourists leaving Ireland are satisfied that they have got value for money, then the efforts of Bord Fáilte and other private or other promotional agencies would be nullified. Deputy Connolly made a point about exploitation through groups or otherwise. Any statutory powers whatsoever that I, as Minister, and Bord Fáilte would have to curb any get-rich-quick aspects within any segment of the tourist industry will be used with all the severity that any such attempted exploitation deserves.</P>
    <P>One of Bord Fáilte's statutory roles is to assist the development of the tourist product.  In the period since 1979 the Government have provided through Bord Fáilte more than £11 million in grant assistance for the development of holiday accommodation.  This grant expenditure stimulated a total investment of approximately £35 million in expanding and upgrading our accommodation stock.  Initially emphasis was on the hotel sector but more recently grant assistance has been channelled towards other areas of holiday accommodation such as self-catering cottages and caravan and camping parks which have become increasingly popular.  In addition grant assistance has been and is being provided for the upgrading of town and country homes as well as farmhouses.  Much has been written in recent years on the effectiveness or otherwise of the money spent in this area over the years, most notably the National Economic and Social Council report published in November 1980.  My Department's recent extensive review of tourism policy included an indepth <Col N="1668" /> assessment of accommodation grant schemes.  This review underlines the need for a more critical approach to future State assistance in this area as a means of ensuring that the State obtains a worth-while return from any investment made.</P>
    <P>With future development in mind, my Department, together with Bord Fáilte, are in the process of making a full, detailed assessment of current and likely future holiday accommodation capacity to establish whether supplies over the next four to five years will be sufficient to meet demand.  When this assessment is completed it should be possible to identify to what extent, if any, there is a need to expand or upgrade any segment of our accommodation stock and to consider if grant schemes are the most likely means of stimulating the developments which are thought desirable.  Non-grant type of assistance in the form of concessionary finance is another means which has been used to stimulate investment and assist operation of the tourism industry.  The House is well aware that the Government have established two fixed low interest loan facilities for the tourism sector which operate through the Industrial Credit Company, an investment capital scheme financed through the EIB and a scheme providing additional working capital. The uptake of moneys under these schemes by the tourism sector has been most encouraging and this type of financing is being kept under close review to ensure, in so far as is possible, that sufficient funding continues to be available to the sector.</P>
    <P>We are very lucky in Irish tourism to have such a wide range of tourist accommodation available.  The top Grade A star hotels, the family type tourist hotels, guesthouses, town and country homes, farmhouses, self-catering, caravan and camping sites, hostels &mdash; all have a part to play in the tourist effort.  We can offer accommodation to suit almost every conceivable taste and pocket.  It is highly important, therefore, that we, the Government, be very careful to ensure that the supply of tourist accommodation be, as far as possible, consistent with the demand for it.  It would be very wrong for <Col N="1669" /> us, for example, to initiate schemes to stimulate development of a particular type of accommodation if by so doing we were to put in jeopardy the continued viability of accommodation providers already operating in that sector.</P>

      <P>Minister, you have one minute to conclude.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. M. Moynihan Mr. M. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few points to make.  Another important development initiated during 1983 was the development of an EEC tourism policy, and the Government have been supporting that actively over the past year.  Meetings with the EEC Tourism Commissioner have been arranged, discussions have taken place and in Athens in December an EEC tourism policy was formulated. This in time will be of immense benefit. The possibility of easier frontier barriers, passports etc. is something from which Ireland could benefit immensely in the context of EEC tourism.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I can summarise the importance of tourism to the economy by emphasising the following facts.  The total value of tourism to the economy last year was £824 million, £540 million from overseas tourists and £284 million from domestic tourism.  The numbers employed in the industry are over 60,000. The total number of out-of-State tourists last year was over two million.</P>
      <P>The motion before the House for discussion tonight calls on the Government to take immediate steps to maximise the potential of our tourist industry.  I am sure the House will agree, from what I have said this evening, that the Government are in tune with the needs of the industry and are taking the appropriate action to help the industry achieve its potential.  I urge the House to support the amended motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the point made by the Minister that last year tourism was worth £850 million.  In 1982 it was something like £760 million.  The breakdown of that figure is interesting.  Of that figure £497 million was made from visitors outside the State while home holidays were responsible for £263 million.  In 1983 a <Col N="1670" /> total 2.7 million people visited Ireland. According to the Estimates and the figures available tourism is responsible for 76,000 jobs, or 7 per cent of all employment in the Republic depends on tourism.</P>
      <P>Tourism is worth approximately £80 million to County Kerry and it provides employment for approximately 7,000 people there.  These figures measured against other sections of our economy are very substantial.  In the past few years we have lost more than 3,000 jobs in Kerry alone as a result of the decline in tourism. If even one-tenth of that loss was suffered in industry, it would create national headlines and would be regarded as a disaster. However, there appears to be no organised voice so far as the tourist industry is concerned.  The losses in employment occurred in small numbers in numerous places, since the industry is spread throughout the county.  In the Cork-Kerry region, which I consider to be the best of the eight regions, a boost is needed for the tourist industry especially in regard to a commitment on the question of the ferry service into Cork, a service that has existed for about 160 years and which was availed of last year by 100,000 visitors who between them brought in 20,000 cars.  The loss of that service was a major blow to the region. We are informed that Aer Lingus will revert to a profit-making position in 1985. They should be asked then to restore to Cork the direct service flights which they discontinued some years ago.</P>
      <P>The problems of the tourist industry are numerous.  It is the only export industry that is being penalised in every conceivable way.  There are special concessions by way of income tax, VAT exemption and so on in respect of export manufacturers but there are 18 and 23 per cent VAT levels in so far as the tourist industry is concerned.  In addition, there are high labour costs and high PRSI contributions to be borne.  These factors are hampering the growth that is necessary for the future development of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the ever-increasing overheads, including taxes, those engaged in the tourist industry were forced to cut <Col N="1671" /> back where possible and one of the areas in which there were cutbacks was the area of staffing.  That is one of the reasons for the problems of the industry not being highlighted.  Operators cut back on a gradual basis so that they might remain in operation.  Obviously, these cutbacks have resulted in a reduced service to our visitors.  This is a situation which must be remedied because of the damaging effect it is having in terms of customer satisfaction and of the PR image of our tourist business.  In addition, the reduction in the level of services can amount to the loss of valuable spending by the visitor.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest problems in the market field in regard to tourism has been our reputation for very expensive hotel accommodation.  Although we have a wide variety of accommodation to offer &mdash; caravans, camping, farmhouses, town and country houses and guest houses &mdash; the high-class hotels are regarded as the barometer of the tourist business.  Yet, this is the section that is the most severely penalised in terms of taxation and so on. If we are to succeed, the level of services will have to be adjusted.  I am confident that any concessions we would make to the industry would be more than offset by way of increased turnover.  Deputy Flynn has made that point also.  When we compare the burden on the industry in terms of taxation we find that our industry is at a disadvantage compared with other tourist countries.  If, for instance, the VAT on tourism were to be reduced to 10 per cent, the loss would be made up easily by way of increased income to the Exchequer from increased numbers of tourists.</P>
    <P>Our greatest potential, and perhaps the easiest one, for creating employment is through the development of tourism and this can be done at a very low cost compared with industrial development. Because tourism is spread throughout the country, the small units would survive but unless we are prepared to give more help to the industry, that will not be the case.  I appeal to the Minister for Finance to implement what he outlined in his budget speech with regard to interest-free loans, refurbishing loans and special <Col N="1672" /> concessions in respect of youth employment during the summer months.  Such employment should be exempted from PRSI payments.  Many of the young people use the money earned in this way to further their education.</P>
    <P>Tourism is almost totally dependent on home-produced raw material.  The consumer comes to the product rather than the product being exported.  There are figures to prove that 80 per cent of the food used in the tourist industry is home produced.  This is a direct help to the agricultural sector which is our other great resource.  Therefore, the agriculture and tourist industry complement each other.  There are benefits to the spin-off industries also such as crafts, tour services and so on.  This enables people to set up small business without being involved in big capital outlay.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a greater awareness of the true value of the tourist industry and for the full co-operation of national, regional and local effort to develop a product that is suitable for the potential market.  In many areas local committees have proved what can be done in co-operation with other bodies.  More than ever there is need for strong and active local organisation because, in the long term, development will come about only by way of local initiative working through to regional and national levels.</P>
    <P>In some instances small beginnings by way of local initiative have grown into major operations.  In this context I refer to the efforts of a small committee who began their work 25 years ago in Tralee by way of organising a carnival.  That was to develop into the Festival of Tralee which has become a major international tourist attraction bringing millions of tourists to Tralee and establishing that area as a tourist resort in its own right.</P>
    <P>To sum up, I suggest that with very little help and effort the job loss trend in the tourist industry could be reversed. This would automatically reduce the unemployment figures and will set the industry on the path of regrowth and job creation.  In the short term it would be the quickest and most effective method of dealing with the unemployment problem. This is an industry with great potential <Col N="1673" /> and one that contains no danger in so far as pollution and such other problems are concerned.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider the situation of the eight regional boards, especially in relation to the Cork-Kerry region.  This year the grant-in-aid to Bord Fáilte has been increased by just less than 6 per cent.  However, we find in the Cork-Kerry region that Bord Fáilte are reducing the grant under various headings. That is why I am appealing to the Minister to investigate the methods used by the board in relation to such a situation. They have adopted a dogmatic attitude to our region.  I do not believe any other region has generated more finance than has the Cork-Kerry region.  In the past three to four years about £500,000 was generated in the region and this was directed towards worthwhile promotion. Is this the reason that the board are cutting back on the grant-in-aid for this region?  I take this opportunity of congratulating the Minister of State on the job he is doing in the field of tourism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion in the name of Deputies Flynn and Connolly but regarding the amendment tabled by the Government I can only say that there is no evidence to support the claim that steps are being taken by the Government to enable the tourist industry to realise its potential.  Indeed, in my area the steps the Government have taken have dealt a body blow to the tourist industry.  I am talking of taxation measures and so on.</P>
      <P>Job creation has been mentioned and in a time of recession it is important to examine how tourism could help the economy generally.  Tourism gets a modest level of Government support.  In 1982 the grant to tourism was only 10 per cent of that given to agriculture or the manufacturing industry.  There is great potential for tourism and in 1982 it generated £301 million in foreign earnings, which is a very sizeable sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Border region has been the subject of a number of reports, jointly financed by the EEC.  We had the report on the Erne catchment scheme in the east Border region by the Economic and Social <Col N="1674" /> Committee of the EEC and yesterday there was the north-eastern region development scheme which is a development strategy for the region from 1983 to 2,001.  Each of those reports lays strong emphasis on tourism and says that it held out the best hopes for the development of the region.  They all pinpointed the need for the development of our waterways and lakes, expansion of the Lough Erne navigation system, forest park development, the promotion of activity based holidays and consultation on the development of several large tourist complexes in areas of scenic beauty.  On a cross-Border basis there is a unique opportunity to develop the region not alone from an economic point of view but also in the interests of goodwill.  Over the last number of years we have been agitating for an administrative structure in that region because I fail to see why the EEC should fund an area which is so neglected.  There is also room for development on a voluntary basis and many voluntary organisations who are developing tourism should get greater recognition and financial support.</P>
    <P>In 1980 the EEC set up the Border counties fund for Cavan, Louth, Monaghan, Donegal and Leitrim and over a five year period they allocated a sum in the region of £20 million.  It was based primarily on tourism development. They assessed transport, communication and craft industries as it was a region that had no history or background of tourism. It was also an area scarce in natural resources and where farm sizes were small.  It looked as if tourism would be the ideal vehicle to provide additional funding for small farmers.</P>
    <P>In 1968 the north-eastern tourist development region in Louth, Monaghan and Cavan had 946 beds to offer to tourists. In 1974 the number had increased to 1,207.  However, since 1974 the number has got smaller and the figure is now 1,070, a substantial reduction of about 20 per cent at a time when there should be development in that region.  That gives an indication of the extreme neglect of the region and of the measures imposed on them by way of taxation and VAT <Col N="1675" /> which caused such distortion in business both sides of the Border.</P>
    <P>On 6 March I asked a question in the Dáil regarding projects and their locations financed by Bord Fáilte from the European Regional Development Fund Special Border Programme for the years 1981, 1982 and 1983.  The Minister for Finance said that there were three grants made available for supplementary holiday accommodation in Cavan, three in Kingscourt, two in Killeshandra, two in Cootehill, Shercock and Belturbet and two in Poles and Lough Gowna.  There was also a grant for hotel improvements in Cavan.  There were just a handful of grants in County Cavan and County Monaghan fared even worse.  There was only one hotel improvement grant and there were grants for supplementary holiday accommodation at Castleblayney, four at Carrickmacross and two at Ballybay. In Louth the situation was even more dismal because they had only hotel improvements in Drogheda and Dundalk and supplementary accommodation at Carlingford and Dunleer.  They were the only grants provided out of that fund which we thought would have been of great benefit and value.  I asked Monaghan County Council to keep a record of the amount of money granted under those headings which we had received.  Bord Fáilte provided £925,000 for accommodation development in 1981.  County Monaghan received £15,900.  I have not got figures for the other counties.  The following year they received £7,900 from an allocation of £1½ million.  In 1983 they received £4,000 from an allocation of £350,000.</P>
    <P>It is very hard to understand that type of approach by the development organisations in that area.  I wrote to Bord Fáilte some time ago asking them to designate an official to counties Monaghan and Cavan.  They replied as follows:</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte does not consider that the expenditure from the ERDF (Non-Quota) Section would be enhanced by the appointment of an official.  The take-up from the fund is dependent upon a number of factors, <Col N="1676" /> including the general level of economic activity within the counties and the existence of suitable projects.</P>
    <P>There have been adequate projects and a sufficient number of applicants for accommodation grants and it does not seem right to say that it would not be enhanced by the appointment of an official. We are satisfied after long and serious discussions on various Border committees that the only chance for development in those areas for tourism would be by the setting up of the structure to which I referred.  A few weeks ago a full-time EEC representative was appointed by the Commission in the Munster area.  I appeal to the Minister to examine the subject very carefully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 466 and 468 together.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that primary treatment of sewage discharging into Dublin Bay is adequate.  This form of treatment does more than screening &mdash; it reduces the solids content by settlement and lessens the oxygen demand in the receiving waters.  The decision to provide primary treatment is based on the conclusions of Professor Crisp's Report on Dublin Bay which shows that the assimilative capacity of the receiving waters of Dublin Bay is adequate to take the discharge of effluent which has received primary treatment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>While a number of monitoring results at certain locations have on occasion exceeded the mandatory standards set out in the EEC Directive on the Quality of Bathing Waters, the coastal waters in Dublin Bay do not, in the opinion of the health authorities, constitute a threat to public health.  Some of the monitoring data which was supplied at the seminar referred to in the question related to areas where little bathing occurs.  In addition, samples taken outside the bathing season were included. Monitoring for the purposes of the EEC directive is carried out at two locations on Dollymount beach during the bathing season.  Since 1978, full compliance with the requirements of the directive has been achieved, and analysis of the monitoring shows that results are well within the EEC parameters.</P>
      <P>As regards other locations, the position is as follows:</P>
      <P>Seapoint</P>
      <P>The source of pollution is the Dún Laoghaire outfall off the west pier and, with easterly winds, pollution would tend to increase at Seapoint.  Local authority proposals to alter this outfall are at early planning stage.</P>
      <P>Dollymount</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dublin city outfalls (which discharge into the river Liffey upstream of the Poolbeg generating station and carry sewage from the city centre and from Pembroke-Rathmines) affect the Bull Wall significantly with lesser effects on the south Dollymount strand.  A programme <Col N="1533" /> for improvement in sewage treatment is being carried out and a new sewage treatment works at Ringsend is operational since February 1982.  When the Ringsend pumping station is commissioned in Autumn 1984 a major improvement in the existing position should occur.</P>
    <P>Coliemore Harbour, Dalkey</P>
    <P>This is not a bathing area of any significance and the cause of pollution is a small sewage outfall at the pier.</P>
    <P>Corbawn Lane, Shankill</P>
    <P>The information given at the seminar related to the period to 1981.  However, a new sewage disposal scheme has since been completed at a cost of £7 million and this includes a 1.4 km marine outfall at Shanganagh.  This scheme, which came into operation in Autumn 1983, should resolve problems in this area.</P>
    <P>Blackrock, North and South Beach</P>
    <P>Occasional high readings have been mainly attributable to a malfunction in the Tobernea drainage pump.  The beach is not used for bathing and chlorination is carried out on the water in the baths.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Eastern Health Board, who carry out analysis for the local authorities concerned, have extended monitoring programmes beyond the traditional bathing months and that monitoring commenced this year on 1 March.  The EEC directive on the quality of bathing water only requires monitoring of designated bathing areas on a fortnightly basis during the bathing season (i.e. the period during which a large number of bathers can be expected) and this is, in fact, being done at present for Dollymount and other undesignated areas in the bay.  It is a matter for the local authorities concerned, in conjunction with the health board, to determine whether any further extension of the duration or frequency of the monitoring programme should be arranged.  However, given the information available from monitoring results over the past few years, it is unlikely that more frequent monitoring would produce major variations in the general pattern.</P>
    <P>The commissioning of a hydrographic <Col N="1534" /> survey on the currents in the bay is a matter for the local authorities.  The 1971 Crisp study on Dublin Bay reported that hydrographic conditions in the bay are satisfactory for dispersal of effluent and found that &ldquo;there is a strong clockwise circulation continually flushing the bay and maintaining high water quality standards&rdquo;. I am advised that the sewage solids from the centre city area are removed before effluent is discharged from the treatment works at Ringsend and that the effluent contains only very fine particulate matter.  On discharge to the sea and admixture, the sewage is quickly dispersed in the water body.</P>

      <P>The issues raised by the Deputy are covered by the terms of occupational sick pay schemes rather than the Social Welfare Acts.  My Department are responsible for the Civil Service sick pay schemes.  The aim of these schemes is to ensure that, within certain limits, an employee who is out sick is in general no worse off financially than while at work. Thus, in the case of civil servants eligible for disability benefit, the scheme provides for the payment of the difference between full salary and any benefits payable under the Social Welfare Acts.  In addition to claiming the relevant benefits from the Department of Social Welfare, a civil servant must satisfy the requirements of the occupational sick pay scheme &mdash; including those governing the furnishing of medical certificates.</P>

The inspector of taxes has written to him on several occasions requesting details of his income from all sources including particulars of his wife's business profits, to enable his income tax liabilities for all years subsequent to 1974-75 to be determined.

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will list the names of all children's homes in the country; the management responsible; the number of places provided; the age and the sex of the children at the end of 1983 and 1979; and if he will indicate the measures that he has taken in order to compensate any decline in places since 1979.</P>

      <P>A tabulated statement giving the information requested is appended.  Residential places available have declined by 9 per cent since 1979, due to more extensive casework on the part of social work personnel with families in their own homes and to the increase in the number of foster parents offering their services to the health boards.  Occupancy levels in the homes are currently about 90 per cent/95 per cent on average.</P>

      <P>Provision exists enabling statutory authorities to continue to provide for the maintenance of children beyond the age of 16 years for the purpose of completing their education or training.  In the small number of cases where children choose to leave care before 18, every reasonable effort is made by the caring agency to ensure adequate provision for their maintenance and accommodation and to retain contact with them.  These children are usually referred to vocational agencies such as Manpower, AnCO and CERT and would be eligible where necessary for supplementary welfare assistance from the local health board.</P>

      <P>My Department have lead responsibility for day care services for young children. In general the policy is to assist the development and operation of those centres which are aimed mainly at assisting families from deprived areas.  Funds for this purpose are channelled through the <Col N="1554" /> health boards who do not involve themselves in the provision of the services, but who financially assist, sometimes up to 70 per cent of operating costs, and encourage voluntary effort to establish and manage the centres.  Therefore, the agencies responsible for them are the various local management committees and voluntary organisations running them. Bord na Gaeilge and Údarás also grant-aid the development of pre-school play groups through the medium of Irish.  The latest statistics available on day care centres in receipt of grant-aid relate to the year ending 31 December 1983 and are set out below in the form of a tabular statement:</P>

      <P>The most recent published report of the inspector of mental hospitals was for the years 1977-79.  There is not the same need for such reports as there was when the mental hospitals were closed institutions. However, the inspector of mental hospitals continues to inspect each district and <Col N="1555" /> private mental hospital as required by law.  Reports on these inspections are furnished to me and appropriate action is taken by my Department.  Much of the statistical information which would have been contained in the inspector's reports is published in the reports of the Medico Social Research Board.</P>

      <P>While the provisions of the Health (Homes for Incapacitated Persons) Act, 1964, and the Homes for Incapacitated Persons Regulations, 1966, are actively enforced by the health boards, no proceedings have been taken by health boards in the last ten years under section 2 (5) of the Act.  However, while no proceedings have been taken, health boards do take action in respect of nursing homes where poor standards are found to exist.  In fact, there have been cases where health boards have withdrawn the payment of subventions in respect of patients maintained in certain nursing homes because of unsatisfactory conditions therein.  Many of these homes subsequently closed.</P>
      <P>However, as I have stated on a number of occasions, I am not satisfied with the extent of the powers and standards provided under present legislation.  Consequently I am currently preparing proposals for submission to Government for a revision of this legislation.</P>

      <P>The latest assessment of her means consisting of the income from the letting of a holding and the weekly value of capital entitle her to a pension of £16.60 a week plus £3 living alone allowance.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department operate directly or through their agencies a number of schemes which are designed to encourage the creation of additional employment.  The schemes operate on a national basis and as such apply to Skibbereen in the same manner as to other parts of the country.</P>
      <P>Details of the schemes are as follows: Employment Incentive Scheme, under the scheme which is administered by the Department of Labour, premiums are paid to employers who create additional jobs and fill them by recruiting unemployed persons.  During the coming month, I will announce some changes in the scheme.  In 1983, premiums were paid for the first time for 470 workers in Cork city and county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enterprise Allowance Scheme, the scheme which is administered by the National Manpower Service, is designed to encourage persons on the live register and in receipt of unemployment compensation payments for a specified period to <Col N="1578" /> set up enterprises.  An allowance of £50 or £30 per week, depending on marital status, is payable for up to 52 weeks. Enterprises in any sector of economic activity other than gaming or the promotion of political or religious views are eligible for participation.</P>
    <P>In certain circumstances, the allowance or part thereof may be capitalised if this is warranted to assist in the acquisition of capital assets for the business.  An additional incentive is being introduced into the Scheme whereby applicants in receipt of pay-related benefit may apply to capitalise any remaining weekly PRB entitlement.  I will announce the details later this month.</P>
    <P>At present, three persons in Skibbereen are participating in the scheme.</P>
    <P>Grant Scheme for Youth Employment, this scheme as administered by the Youth Section of the Department of Labour is designed to encourage the employment of young people on desirable community works which would not otherwise be undertaken in the normal course at the present time.</P>
    <P>In 1982, a project in Skibbereen provided for the employment of six young people and one supervisor and was funded for 34 weeks.  This year, my Department have not received any applications for assistance from organisations in Skibbereen.</P>
    <P>Community Youth Training Programme, the Community Youth Training Programme (CYTP) operated by AnCO is designed to provide training and work experience to young unemployed people (generally between 16 and 25 years) recruited by the National Manpower Service on projects of benefit to the local community.  Depending on the nature of work, the project team may also include unemployed craftsmen, apprentices and general operatives.  Projects may be put forward for consideration by non-commercial groups, local authorities, community organisations, church bodies etc. Three projects in the Skibbereen/Bantry area have been completed in the last 6 months and three projects are in progress at present.</P>
    <P>Youth Employment Agency.  From its establishment in March 1982 to December <Col N="1579" /> 1983 a sum of £3.48 million from levy proceeds has been allocated by the Youth Employment Agency to the support of sustainable job creation and enterprise developments.  In the context of its specific brief in the job-creation field relating to community and youth enterprise, the agency developed two programmes of its own in 1983 &mdash; the Community and Youth Enterprise Programme and the Youth Self-Employment Programme.</P>
    <P>The Community and Youth Enterprise Programme, this programme is aimed at directly involving community, voluntary and youth organisations in both creating economically sustainable employment for young people and raising the general level of enterprise and self-help among young people.</P>
    <P>The Youth Self-Employment Programme, this programme is designed to assist unemployed young persons who want to set up a business, by enabling them to get a bank loan without security. There are, in addition, other job creation programmes which are funded, but not directly operated, by the Youth Employment Agency.  One of these is the Young Scientists and Technologists Employment Scheme which is designed to promote the employment of young people with science and engineering qualifications and to assist firms to increase their technological capabilities.  Another scheme is called Marketplace and is a job creation programme for young marketing graduates, with the objective of encouraging companies to employ marketing graduates.</P>
    <P>As a general comment, I should say that admissions to the Schemes mentioned depend on individual businessmen and community groups coming forward with programmes and proposals that meet the eligibility criteria of the schemes.</P>
    <P>Questions relating to manufacturing industry should, of course, be addressed to the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism.</P>
