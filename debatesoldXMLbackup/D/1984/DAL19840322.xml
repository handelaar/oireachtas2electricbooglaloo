    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for the Environment.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>In speaking on this Estimate a fortnight ago I went through a series of proposals I had to resolve the financial crisis in local authorities and I also detailed areas where I considered our housing policy should be reviewed. Today I shall deal with a number of specific items in the Department of the Environment that are causing acute problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first relates to urban boundary extensions.  There are four of these proposed in County Wexford, in Gorey, Wexford, Enniscorthy and New Ross. However, they are being held up because of the financial situation.  I have been informed by officials of Wexford County <Col N="169" /> Council that not one urban boundary extension has taken place since domestic rates on homes were abolished in 1978.</P>
    <P>The present financial structures of local authorities do not allow for what is a vitally important development.  It is vital for many provincial towns that they be allowed to expand for the purpose of industrial development so that a potential investor can ascertain the way an area is growing in terms of labour needs.  There are basic anomalies that have to be rectified. People who live on different sides of a street have different eligibility for free fuel, in certain cases for unemployment assistance and for other entitlements. It is totally unfair that because a person lives on one side of the street and is in an urban area he should be entitled to free fuel but another person in the same circumstances on the other side of the street is not so entitled because he is in the rural area.  The same situation applies with regard to water rates.  In my area different water rates have been charged by the county council as against the urban council.  This is a cause of great aggravation to the people concerned.</P>
    <P>A fund should be set up to facilitate county councils and municipal authorities to expand.  The percentage rate for capital schemes is at a reduced rate for urban authorities: I am thinking of main drainage schemes and so on.  One of the reasons urban boundaries cannot be extended is that the authority will get a reduced State subsidy on their loans for such schemes because they are a municipal authority.  If the same percentage rate applied to both types of authority it would solve the problem.  I hope this matter will be given serious attention.</P>
    <P>In relation to planning permissions and the charges introduced last year, I require clarification on whether GAA club developments are exempt from the charges.  I understand that the phrasing of the ministerial order relates to community-type developments but it is quite unspecific as to whether GAA clubs will be exempt from planning charges.  Some clubs in Wexford are liable for such charges.  In this the centenary year of the GAA, it would be appropriate that the exemption <Col N="170" /> be extended to GAA club developments because they are allegedly a non-profit making organisation.  It seems to be totally unfair that a company can be charged £1,200, as happened recently in an incident I know of, for a development, whether it is for potential planning permission or an expansion and then they were turned down and lost their money. There should be some rebate system especially for small businesses so that if people do not get planning permission some percentage of their charges will be refunded because they have paid for a service they are not ultimately getting.</P>
    <P>Some disgraceful and ridiculous delays have taken place with An Bord Pleanála. Delays of two and three years have taken place.  There is one farmer I know of who had bought cows and did some development work.  He got planning permission to erect silos and milking parlours.  There was an objection and this took so long &mdash; it still has not been dealt with to date by An Bord Pleanála &mdash; that he had to sell his cows and suffered a substantial loss.  It is a disgrace that An Bord Pleanála take so long to deal with such matters.  When this is applied to the commercial criteria it is simply inexplicable. I know of people who had a proposal in to build factory units.  There were objectors and this took three years to sort out. In the end there had to be a direct deal between the objectors and the developer. An Bord Pleanála are a vehicle to stop industrial and agricultural development in many areas.  I plead with the Minister to introduce a six-month limit on all appeals before An Bord Pleanála.  Six months is a reasonable time for anyone to process any thorny problems.  If there was such a deadline people would not be held up unduly long and would not be put to great losses.  At the same time we would get the best type of planning environment.</P>
    <P>I would like to move on to County Wexford specifically in relation to the amount of money being spent by the Department of the Environment.  The housing allocations have recently been announced by the Department.  The allocation for Enniscorthy Urban District Council is £400,000.  I hope the Minister <Col N="171" /> will meet a deputation from the urban council in relation to Phase 3 of the Drumgoole scheme.  We have no programme for housing at the moment and if is vitally important that we get the allocation for the go ahead for that scheme.</P>
    <P>There are a number of sewerage schemes around County Wexford, in Castlebridge and Kilmuckridge, in desperate need of being handled expeditiously because some of those schemes are going on for up to eight years.  There is a training centre for the fire service in Castlebridge and I understand there have been repeated requests from the personnel there to have it modernised and brought up to the best possible standard. I hope that request will be acceded to. There is no doubt that, because the PLV case was brought up in Wexford and because of the difficulties of Wexford County Council in relation to the outstanding arrears of £1.8 million and the interest on that, the most insolvent county council in the country is County Wexford, bearing the brunt of being in the middle of a court action between the Government and the farmers.  If we are serious about protecting the long-term future of Wexford County Council it is vitally important that the Government take early steps to sort out that financial situation.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with different ways in which financial structures could be changed to help local authorities.  I hope something is specifically done in relation to this matter because Wexford has borne the brunt of this and will have to take impossible decisions because they are statutorily obliged to provide services for which they have no money.  It is a catastrophic situation and will have to be dealt with sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>With relation to the house improvement grant system there should be far greater flexibility in relation to the prior inspection.  When the scheme was reintroduced in November 1981 I understand it was done on the basis that they wanted to start afresh so that people who had done work in the interim period between the last scheme and those who were <Col N="172" /> refused under the old renovation scheme would not be able to reapply.  That period has long elapsed.  I notice the recent modification in the Department that certain starts will not be ruled out on the basis of the prior inspection.  More leniency is required here.  If something is half built it is necessary to allow the development to go ahead because it is a genuine one.</P>
    <P>I should also point out, in relation to the house improvement grants, something which I consider is totally unfair, although it may seem a small thing.  I know of a person on unemployment assistance at the very lowest level of income.  He had no toilet or sanitary services whatsoever.  He put in an application to the Department for the erection of an outside toilet.  He was refused on the grounds that an outside toilet was not the type of development that was required and he would have to build an extension to his existing house to put in a toilet.  That type of develompment would cost in the region of £1,000 whereas the other would only cost the man approximately £300.  The bottom line is that he will not have a toilet.  I feel very sore that the Department are so inflexible in such instances.  When there is genuine hardship and people are cutting the cloth according to their measure I feel they should be facilitated in every way.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the principal officers in the new house grant scheme will not come under the scrutiny of the public expenditure committee because some of the decisions taken are totally unfair.  I know of a couple who had submitted plans which were over a year in the Department.  They were ultimately ruled out because those plans were wrong and the couple went ahead and built according to those plans.  They were ruled out because of something which was not in the memorandum attached to new house grants, that the dormer windows had to be facing a certain way.  I feel those people were very badly treated.  I know of another case in relation to the year of occupancy.  A person applied and was waiting a year to get an SL4 form from the Revenue Commissioners and because of that delay the application for a new <Col N="173" /> house grant went in one month after the year of occupancy and that application was refused.  This is totally unfair and there should be greater flexibility in this area.</P>
    <P>In relation to the essential repairs grant scheme, the house improvement scheme and the disabled person's grant scheme it is socially unacceptable that people have no sanitary services.  There is a need to combine employment creation and social needs in this area very urgently.  I suggest that the Department of the Environment have another look at this whole area on the basis of saying: &ldquo;Right, in 1984 it is socially unacceptable that people do not have toilets and sanitary services.&rdquo;  There is a multiplicity of State services for youth employment.  There is the Youth Employment Agency, AnCO and the NMS.  Those should be confined and the Government should say that they will abolish all the grant schemes and they will introduce a youth employment scheme whereby if any person wants sanitary services a youth scheme will do that work.  We would simultaneously create jobs for young people at a fairly low cost and provide what is an essential service for many people who are without sanitary services at the moment.  We are all aware of many elderly people in our constituencies who must drag pails of water a quarter or half a mile.  Surely that is unacceptable and that a revamped youth-employment scheme to meet this social need would be the right way to move.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other small matters to which I wish to bring the Minister's attention.  One is public lighting. On a national primary route it seems most unfair that the maintenance and cost of public lighting, ESB charges and so on should all be met by the local authority.  Surely that cost could be taken up by the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>There should be some provision within the Department of the Environment for a practical and flexible way of helping the many homeless people, whether they be young couples starting off, homeless men or deserted wives.  I am thinking here of the provision of mobile homes even in a temporary capacity until they are <Col N="174" /> rehoused.  Many local authorities have a one year rule under which nobody can be housed unless they have been an applicant under the letting priority scheme for at least one year.  I know many such people &mdash; homeless men, homeless wives with four children who literally have nowhere to go and whose entitlement is zero until they have been one year on the housing list.  Probably the best way to proceed to meet this need would be through the Department making moneys available to or reimbursing local authorities for a stock of mobile homes.  That would be dealing with what is an emergency situation in a very practical way.</P>
    <P>In relation to road safety, the general level of anti-theft devices and so on, the Departments of the Environment and Justice should get together to ensure that there are compulsory provisions applicable to new cars.  In my constituency a new company has been set up to print on each pane of glass in a car the registration number of that car so that if one's registration number is, say, UZR 240, that would be printed on every pane of glass in that car.  It has been proven that of the 50 to 60 cars stolen each day in Dublin 11 to 12 per cent of them are stolen by professionals with a view to their resale, which is then done by changing the registration plates.  If the Department of the Environment stipulated that nobody could tax their car without its having some form of anti-theft device such provision would cut enormously the malicious damages claims and in the long-term be of major beneficial effect.  There are other forms of anti-theft devices.  For example, there is another which when turned on will ensure that a car will move only about ten yards when the petrol supply will be cut off.  The stealing of cars constitutes the tip of the iceberg only in the type of crime perpetrated after their theft.  For example, tragically, people are killed from joy-riding.  We see also the number of stolen cars used in robberies, kidnappings and so on.  Therefore there is a double-edged factor here.  I would recommend that in such instances the Department of the Environment and Justice consult with certain companies insisting that all new cars to be taxed have <Col N="175" /> fitted certain anti-theft devices.  This would do more for road safety than any other measure and I hope the Department will take up this suggestion.</P>
    <P>I might recapitulate somewhat on what I said already about the financial condition of local authorities at present. Because of the PLV case, the abolition of rates and because of the cut in the domestic grant in lieu of those rates formerly levied, we have now reached a cash crisis situation in local authorities that must be resolved and faced head on.  My suggested remedy would be, say, a 1 per cent VAT refund on purchases in municipal authority areas, or in county council areas.  It should be remembered that we collected £1.6 billion in VAT last year and if a percentage of that were to be paid to local authorities it would constitute one way of solving the problem.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I would suggest a lottery run independently and autonomously by local authorities which would be another method of overcoming the problem. There might also be an element of privatisation in the capital schemes of local authorities.  There is also the whole question of a roads finance agency which would aid the cash flow of the Department of the Environment, which hopefully would provide ultimately through joint venture schemes infrastructural and social works at a cheaper rate, whether they be housing, roads, the building of bridges or whatever.</P>
    <P>There is the whole question of self-financing services to be taken up by local authorities.  Funds generated through the courts by fines or whatever should be payable to local authorities.  Surely it is only reasonable that those responsible for the maintenance of, say, the court-house should receive a few coppers out of it.  There are the other services such as the licensing of transport vehicles and so on.  All of those funds might be paid to the local authority.  Each of these contributes little to the Department at present, but to a local authority it would make all the difference, having a more practical, localised effect on such services.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister and his Minister of State well.  In their lifetime I hope the <Col N="176" /> Government will face up to the financial crisis of local authorities because, if not, ultimately they will be reduced to mere talking shops.  If we do not devise the appropriate financial structures, then they should simply be abolished, which would be a most regrettable step.  I would urge the Minister to use his good offices and those of his officials for an early conclusion of the revision and reorganisation of local authorities.  In the course of such review they should give priority to financial structures because, if one does not have the money, all other policies go out the window.</P>
    <P>I hope my remarks and suggestions will contribute somewhat to that process.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Yates on his contribution in which he showed a keen interest and a clear insight into the difficulties now facing local authorities.  When one compares his contribution with the rather sterile remarks of the Minister in his introduction one wonders what is happening on the Government side, why action is not being taken when their backbenchers clearly are capable of articulating the difficulties and of suggesting to them solutions similar to those advanced from these benches.  One wonders why the Government are refusing to take any action to deal with what most people in this House recognise as a serious crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we look back approximately 16 months, when the Government came into office, with the appointment of the Leader of the Labour Party as Minister for the Environment and Deputy Quinn, also of the Labour Party, as Minister of State one remembers there were great expectations that the Environment brief would be a powerhouse for development, meeting the urgent housing needs of our people, providing the infrastructural needs of a fast-growing population and facilitating the industrial growth necessary to provide urgently needed jobs. There was a belief then that bold and imaginative initiatives would be taken to make the Environment the concern of everybody, to render local government more meaningful and dynamic in promoting local development and strengthening <Col N="177" /> local democracy.  We must ask what is the position now 16 months later.  The answer is that those two bright lights to whom we all looked for these bold initiatives, these major dramatic and radical changes, have deserted the Environmental brief.  The Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, sought refuge in the less onerous duties of the Department of Energy and Deputy Quinn has moved to the Department of Labour.  One can fairly comment that this move could have been made to save him embarrassment for not fulfilling the promises he made of major improvements in nearly every area under his responsibility.  The record of these two Ministers is dismal.  The only achievements they can claim are the changes in An Bord Pleanála which were politically inspired.</P>
    <P>The Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Bill which they left behind as a legacy enables local authorities to introduce charges for services. More importantly, it removes the obligation on the Exchequer to provide a sum to local authorities in lieu of domestic and agricultural rates.  It enabled the Minister to decide on an arbitrary figure which would not have to relate to the amount of money local authorities would have received from rates.  That change is now having the dramatic effect we forecast. It was a retrograde step and put the Department of the Environment and the Exchequer in the position of being complete masters over the financing of local authorities.  We pointed out that the inevitable result would be that Government Departments would be looked after first when it came to the allocation of funds and that local authorities would come a poor second and be short of money.  Everything we said during the course of the debate has come true.  The Estimates show an average increase of 8 per cent to Departments but when it came to allocating money to the local authorilties they gave an increase of less than 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>In a year when inflation is forecast at 9 to 10 per cent it is clear that this decision spells absolute and utter disaster for local authorities because they cannot be expected to maintain service with less <Col N="178" /> than 1 per cent of an increase.  Something has to give and it is to be seen in the threats of redundancies which county managers put before local authorities at their estimates meetings.  This has resulted in council after council seeking meetings with the Minister to discuss the crisis which he created for local authorities. The Minister, being inundated with requests to receive deputations, had to resort to sending out a letter explaining that he had so many requests from so many local authorities that it would be April or May before he could see them all but that if they wanted to come to Dublin they could see the Minister of State, Deputy O'Brien.  The Minister is running away from local authorities and will not face up to the problems he has created for them.  It seems he is not prepared to sit down with them and discuss their difficulties or tell them why he has left them so short of money, how he expects them to survive and maintain the essential services which were so glowingly painted in his speech.  He said he recognises the importance of these services yet he seeks to undermine them through a savage cut back in the allocation of funds to local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not listening to the Deputies on his own backbenches. Deputy Yates articulated these difficulties in a clear and concise way and it is obvious that he has knowledge which the Minister is not prepared to recognise.  It is incumbent on the Opposition to cut through the waffle in the Minister's speech which is padded from start to finish with selective figures used for propaganda purposes and presented to a willing media who are not prepared to look behind the figures and tell the real story of how it is in local authorities today.</P>
    <P>There is no recognition in the Minister's speech of the turmoil this is creating. There is a threat to democracy in a move of this kind where the Government clearly seek to undermine the authority of the second tier of democracy by leaving it short of funds.  I recognise that the decision to remove rates from houses brought about a fundamental change in the method of financing local authorities but in the Bill which introduced that <Col N="179" /> change, very direct obligations were placed on the Minister to provide a sum of money equal to that which would have come to the local authorities from rates on houses.  There was a shift from local taxation to national taxation in that the money was to be provided from the Exchequer.  That decision of the House was reneged on by the Coalition.  If the Government do not face up to the problem and come forward at an early date with new proposals to ensure an independent source of finance for local authorities then, as Deputy Yates said, they will have to be abolished.  If that happened there would be a great void in the community which would have other adverse effects.</P>
    <P>These are some of the legacies which the Tánaiste and the Minister, Deputy Quinn left behind them.  They were two leading lights of the new Government which came in with such great hope for the introduction of change about 16 months ago.  Unhappily for the Minister Deputy Kavanagh, he has been landed in their place and must carry the can for the mess they left behind.  However, that is his problem.  It seems he is prepared to defend all those decisions.  He is responsible for them in that he participated in Cabinet decisions and voted for them in the House.  He stands condemned as much as the other two gentlemen who skidaddled off out of the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>One of the great hopes given to those who were in need of housing was that the Government intended to increase the house construction programme to 30,000.  That was printed in their programme for Government and there were few who came to any conclusion other than that was what they intended to do. The programme stated that there was a housing crisis for couples trying to buy their own homes and for 35,000 people on council waiting lists.  The Government will aim to raise housing output towards 30,000 houses a year with sufficient local authority housing to cater for those who cannot, even with the aid of schemes like the Housing Finance Agency, undertake the purchase of their own dwelling.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="180" /> Therefore, it is clear that in the commitment made by the joint parties in Government they intended to raise housing output towards 30,000 houses a year. We had to wait until their full year in office to see whether they were serious in carrying out that intention and achieving that target, because we said they were not.  When this Estimate was being debated last year and when the then and now continuing crisis in the construction industry was being debated here, we argued that we did not believe the Government were serious in implementing this, that they were not seeking to raise the housing output to 30,000.  They made no financial provision to raise it to that limit.  They introduced no new initiatives which would have increased housing output and completions to anything near that level.  If the Minister had fallen short of this target by a few hundred nobody would quibble but no attempt whatsoever was made and the funds were not provided.  The result is that we had the lowest number of house completions last year, the Government's first full year in office, that we have had for five years. A similar situation will arise in 1984 because the financial allocations provided in this Estimate we are debating here today are not adequate to raise housing output to 30,000.  Because this Government have slept for all of the past 16 months no changes which would have brought any new incentive or initiative into the house building industry are seen. No, the Government are still relying on the existing aids which were there when they came into office, the ordinary house grant, the mortgage subsidy, local authority houses, and that is it.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister for the Environment tried to deride a Fianna Fáil spokesman in this House by saying that we were critical of the Government's inactivity but were not showing how these problems could be solved either, despite the fact that throughout every contribution that I have made in this area I have made firm and positive suggestions as to new changes and initiatives that could be taken which would bring about an increase in the number of houses being built.  We have heard one of them mentioned <Col N="181" /> here, that is the joint venture programme between local authorities and builders which, if vigorously pursued, would result in a very substantial increase in the number of houses being built, provided active interest was shown by the Minister in charge, that he became involved in the programme down to ground level and was seen to be committed to it, and that he spurred each of the local authorities with various incentives and improvements to ensure that joint venture projects were undertaken on a vast scale throughout the country.</P>
    <P>We also suggested equity sharing as another element which could be introduced into the whole housing construction scene here which is absent at present. Again, no initiative in that area has been taken by the Government despite the success of equity sharing in other countries. It is clear that the methods that we are employing to try to provide homes for our people are not having the required and desired results.  It is more than clear that the demand is there for houses.  All the Government reports, the ESRI and others who have done studies and surveys of the housing crisis, have agreed that there is a massive demand for homes here.  The Minister's own <i>Programme for Government</i> recognises that at that time there were 35,000 applicants for local authority houses which represents 130,000 to 140,000 people who are condemned to inadequate accommodation at present and who have qualified for homes from the local authorities.  Is it good enough, is it just that so many of our people should be condemned to stay on the housing list for a long number of years because we have a Government in power with a Labour Minister who is not prepared to take any new initiative to try to increase output of local authority houses?  It is just not good enough.</P>
    <P>If the Minister reads back on his own Labour Party policy documents which have emanated over the years he will see that he is reneging on all of those plans and policies which have been adopted at Labour Party conferences down the years.  He has taken no initiative to meet this so-called labour-socialist commitment. I suggest that he has only to look <Col N="182" /> at the record of some previous Fianna Fáil Ministers in that Department and see the results which were brought about when the individual who held the office had a commitment, took the interest and the time, put the effort into it and took the required initiatives.  Sitting back, looking for an easy time in Government, as the Minister seems to be doing when too much was landing on his plate and then deciding to move over to the Department of Energy where things were not happening so quickly, the brief was not so big and the responsibilities were fewer, is an indication of the lack of commitment of some of the Labour Members of this Government and it is time that was highlighted.</P>
    <P>People who report on politics here and who claim to have some expertise should look behind some of the headlines that they are being fed by the Government and make their own assessment and judgment. When the Estimates for Public Services were published many newspaper reporters said that there was a massive increase in the money being provided by the Government for the construction of houses and this would be a big boost to the construction industry and everybody would be delighted at this commitment by the Government.  <i>The Irish Times</i> local government correspondent said at the time the Estimates were published:</P>
    <P>The Estimates for the Department of the Environment show that a major effort is being made to increase finance for housing and services.  This move will be welcomed by the ailing construction industry which has been pressing for a strong injection of capital into the housing programme ... No doubt the Construction Industry Federation will say that all this goes nowhere near what is required to put the building industry back on an even keel.  It is, nevertheless, good to see such percentage increases in a time of general depression.</P>
    <P>He said that the construction industry could take a certain amount of encouragement in that the subsidy for local authority housing had been increased from £124 million in 1983 to £154 million <Col N="183" /> in 1984, an impressive rise of 24 per cent. All that is being met in the housing subsidy is a commitment which exists, which is ongoing and which must be met by the Government.  Irrespective of whether they feel that they should or should not meet it, the Government were not enabled to exercise any discretion in the allocation to meet a housing subsidy. Once they had agreed on the rents to be charged by local authorities the housing subsidy had to meet the balance, and not one new house was going to be constructed with any of that £154 million which was provided merely to pay the subsidies on houses which had been built in previous years.  The local government correspondent in <i>The Irish Times</i> does not seem to recognise that fact and the Government get an easy ride.</P>
    <P>Of course it is obvious that there was no big welcome from the construction industry who knew well the significance of those figures and that there was no 24 per cent increase in capital for new house construction.  In fact, there was no increase at all and the Minister's excuse was that with tighter tendering and a cut-back in the margin for the builders he would be able to get the same number of houses for 1984 as were built in 1983 without providing any additional money. What he is not saying is that by so doing he is expecting many builders to tender uneconomical quotations which will force more of them into bankruptcy.  The sad experience of our construction industry over the past year is that so many have found that they cannot continue in business with the crippling level of taxation on individuals and industry.  The Government's reluctance to support the house building industry by any increase in finance makes it strange that the Minister again repeats his expectation of maintaining the level of output without providing any more money in a year in which inflation will run to about 10 per cent. Obviously, the squeeze is on the builder and the Minister has no concern for those who are being thrown out of business. That may be because anyone who is self-employed or is an employer is, therefore, a capitalist, while the Minister <Col N="184" /> claims to be a socialist, thus having no interest in capitalists.  He is not too bothered if that person goes out of business. However, in putting the employers and construction firms out of business the Minister is also putting many hundreds of building workers and skilled operators out of work and throwing them on the unemployment heap.  We have the resulting crisis of high unemployment at a time when it is coming down in all European and major world trading countries.  We are running against the global trend on unemployment because of continuing Government policies.</P>
    <P>The future looks very bleak indeed for those who have been traditionally employed in this industry.  Already there are about 50,000 registered as unemployed and in a statement issued this morning the representatives of the Construction Industry Federation said that the number is increasing at the rate of 900 per month.  I did not hear any contradiction from the Minister on that figure and the officials of his Department are in very close touch with the construction industry and the professions attached to it.  There is constant monitoring of employment trends and trends generally in that industry.  The Minister knows that the trend has been depressing and that his Government have done nothing to try to reverse it.  If he had tried and failed, he could claim some credit that at least he did try.  The sad fact is that his predecessors, the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring and the Minister, Deputy Quinn, did not try.  They made many brave statements and optimistic forecasts, none of which was fulfilled and all of which were contrary to what we on the Fianna Fáil benches were saying was the real position. The statistics at the end of the calendar year show that what we and the industry were saying was correct, that unemployment is creeping steadily up at an alarming rate.  I am afraid that it will reach a level where the State might not be able to continue to support payment of the correct rate for the numbers who will become unemployed.  The Government are so bankrupt of policies that there appears to be no hope of a reversal or any effort on the Government's part <Col N="185" /> to bring about a reversal of that bad trend and instil confidence in industry and growth.</P>
    <P>The plea that if we allow our wage costs to be strictly controlled everything else will fall into order is absolutely pathetic.  It is a very weak argument because wage costs are only one of the elements and it is not good enough that a Government should sit on the sidelines hoping that the changes will come if they stick to that one aspect of policy.  As the Government will find out in practice, that is an area over which they have very little control when it comes down to brass tacks and the final decisions are made.  Nobody knows that better than the Minister, Deputy Kavanagh who had a very good record for competence when Minister for Labour and who will agree with me on that.  Asking that no provision should be made in the Estimates for wage increases is treading on very dangerous ground. The Government cannot expect that the public service, any more than any other sector, will accept 10 per cent inflation without demands from them for some compensation to try to maintain their standard of living.  It is like a dog chasing its tail and we should break out of this terrible slide.</P>
    <P>In the unemployment debate last week suggestions were made from this side as to some measures by which the Government should try to bring a response from the community, resulting in increased investment and, it is hoped, encouraging growth.  The response has been pathetic. The country is suffering and will continue to do so until the Government change their policy and take some initiative or move over and let somebody else take initiatives and deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>Part of the dismal record of these two gentlemen who have deserted the environmental brief was the impression given during the course of a debate on a Private Members' Bill that if the Fianna Fáil Opposition agreed to have the Bill moved for Committee Stage from the Dáil to a Committee of the Dáil, it would be favourably received and progress might be made.  Foolishly, at the time we agreed to that move, but when we began to discuss in committee the Housing (Private <Col N="186" /> Rented Dwellings) Bill which was moved by me &mdash; which made provision for rent cases standing for hearing before the District Court but not yet heard to be transferred to the new Rents Tribunal &mdash; we discovered that the Government attitude was to stonewall and oppose the Bill tooth and nail, despite the completely different impression given by the Tánaiste when he asked us to agree to the transfer of the Bill to a committee.</P>
    <P>This was a salutary lesson for the Fianna Fáil members in Opposition as to whether we should accept invitations of that kind from the Government in future, or indications of goodwill which could be so quickly reneged upon.  The 500 or so rent cases which have been put before the District Court were all denied the opportunity of transfer to the Rents Tribunal. All sides of the House agreed that it would have been preferable and more humane to transfer these cases.  We had good, authoritative legal advice that our proposal was not unconstitutional.  We showed those arguments in a committee of this House but despite that, the attitude of the Deputies representing the Government side was that their riding orders were to oppose the Bill and that was that.  Nobody will ever know the exact position.  It was a very retrograde and unfair attitude on the part of the Government in denying mostly elderly people the right to have their cases heard before the Rents Tribunal.  I understand from reports that the Rents Tribunal is now working satisfactorily, although there may be some cases about which people might not be too happy.  The general opinion appears to be that people are happy enough with the results of the work of the Rents Tribunal, but that is not a complete survey of the whole picture.</P>
    <P>The construction industry is not concerned with the construction of houses only even though the housing aspect of it is solely the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment.  At Cabinet that Minister is also the spokesperson for the construction industry in general which includes all forms of building work here. The output in that industry has taken a very serious turn.  It was showing strong <Col N="187" /> growth in 1980-81 but in 1982 that growth disappeared and, according to statistics, it has been missing since.  We are told that 1983 was another dismal year with an approximate drop in output of 10 per cent if one bases it on 1975 prices to show the effect of inflation.  The worrying aspect of this is that the decline is continuing. When the Government took office they reduced the published estimates of the Fianna Fáil Government for construction work by £220 million.  Before they took office the Coalition said at various centres, in particular to trade union representatives, that they intended pumping an extra £100 million into building. They reneged on that promise.  That matter was debated last year and I will not deal with it again.  The Government cut out that money an overall reduction of £220 million on stated intentions.</P>
    <P>The tragedy in this area is that when the Public Capital Programme outturn for 1983 was published it showed that those reduced figures resulted in an expenditure which was £142 million less than the published capital programme.  If one adds those figures together one will see that millions of pounds have been taken away from the construction area although the Government had indicated that that money would be spent.  There was the loss of £220 million, £100 million and £142 million which they did not spend.  As a result £462 million less was spent on construction than was indicated by the Government.  That is a serious matter and that decision has had a very detrimental effect on the industry.  It is the real reason why there is such a lack of confidence in the industry.  Having suffered the reduction of £220 million, and having failed to fulfil their promise to add £100 million, the Government decided on spending £142 million less than their published programme.  That has had a shattering effect on the confidence in the industry.  It is clear that the Government are not committed to construction.</P>
    <P>It is known that some Ministers, in particular the Minister for Finance, harbour serious doubts about the benefit to the economy of making any investment of State funds in the building industry. <Col N="188" /> The value of jobs in that industry do not rate very high with the Minister for Finance unfortunately.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a brief reference to the position of local authorities.  The decision to reduce the grant in lieu of rates has had a disastrous effect on those bodies.  I urge the Minister to publish as soon as possible whatever proposals he has for financing local authorities in the future.  He should also publish the proposals he said he has for reorganising local authorities.  The position has deteriorated to such a state that the whole structure of local democracy is under serious threat.  I have doubts as to whether the Minister is serious about his stated intention of tackling this.  I urge him to be serious and to tackle this problem in a fundamental and radical manner. He should avail of this opportunity when this matter is under active consideration in his Department to make a bold step to revolutionise local government rather than fiddling around and making a few minor changes, changing some boundaries or introducing new local authorities to meet the need that exists where there have been large urban developments since the structures were first introduced. If he does that rather than nibbling at the problem he will earn the respect and applause of the community.  He will be doing a great service to the country and future generations.  The existing structure may have served us well but it has been wobbly in the last five years.  It is losing respect and causing frustration to those who are serving as elected members. There is a growing disinterest and disenchantment with existing structures. Unless something is done quickly existing structures will have a detrimental effect on peace and prosperity and democracy as we know it.</P>
    <P>I should like to assure the Minister of the fullest encouragement from the Opposition benches for the initiatives I have mentioned.  I am not greatly encouraged from what has happened to date that any such great initiatives will be taken.  There is no evidence of a willingness to step out and do radical things from the performance of incumbents in the Department of the Environment in <Col N="189" /> the last 16 months.  A serious crisis exists. I am glad to see the Minister of State, Deputy Donnellan, present because, as a member of Galway County Council, he will be aware of a circular distributed by the county manager of that body indicating the extent of the problems.  The experience in Galway is similar to what is happening in other counties.  I should like to quote from a statement sent to members of the council prior to going on a deputation to the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy O'Brien.  On the question of roads, the county manager stated:</P>
    <P>The council's estimate statement envisaged serious implications for the road service and employment unless there was a substantial increase of road grants.  These grants had not been allocated when the estimates were prepared. The grant notification was received on 29 February, 1984.  By reason of a major change of conditions attached to the grant it is necessary to explain that what appears to be an increased grant is, in fact, a reduced grant.  It has been the established practice for many years &mdash; for a variety of reasons &mdash; to carry forward, for expenditure in the succeeding year, part of the grant allocation for any specific year.  In this way the expenditure on road grants in any particular year would take account of the following arrangements:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) expenditure would be incurred from a previous year's grant;</P>
    <P>(b) expenditure would be incurred out of the current year's grant;</P>
    <P>(c) expenditure would be carried forward to a subsequent year;</P>
    <P>(d) necessary over-expenditure, in a particular year, could be financed from the subsequent year's grant.</P>
    <P>In the circular allocating grants for 1983, received on 18 March 1983, it was stipulated that &ldquo;Grants allocated for strengthening, surface dressing, or special maintenance had to be used for the purpose stated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Galway County Manager said he had to comply with that new condition. <Col N="190" /> Therefore, the 1984 figure had to be adjusted because of those new conditions. The allocation was £4,040,000 while the allocation for the previous year was £3,870,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy dealing specifically with Galway?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving Galway as an example but something similar is happening in all other counties.  Out of the Galway allocation for this year the county manager has to deduct unrecouped expenditure to the end of 1983 of £719,333 and over-expenditure on works to the end of the year of £265,307, a total of £984,640, leaving £3,055,360.  Then if we add in respect of one unpaid grant and over-expenditure another £151,000 that brings the total of £3.206 million and the 1984 grant is therefore reduced from £4.04 million to £3.2 million so in actual fact the road grant allocation to Galway County Council for 1984 is £663,000 less than it was in 1983.  This is disastrous. The effect of that will mean massive unemployment and the manager goes on to indicate in that case in Galway, taking together the funds available from specific road grants and other council sources, the sum available for employment is now at the latest assessment showing a shortfall of £1,345,000.  This is equivalent to a total lay-off of all the roads workforce for 16.5 weeks and if 70 redundancies are introduced the lay-off could be reduced to 15 weeks.  These figures take account of the cost of redundancy payments.</P>
      <P>When one reads the Minister's introductory statement one does not see any of that type of effect at ground level but those who sit on local authorities know what the effect is.  They know what is happening and they know it is disastrous. They know it is disaster that is particularly confronting those who are unemployed. These things will be immediately effective and the standards of our roads are deteriorating at such a rate now there is serious concern that they will soon become impassable in many places and that will have a detrimental effect on industry and the development of rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="191" /> I want to move on now to an area in which the Government have a very negative approach.  I refer to the programme for the settlement of the travelling community. A very excellent report on the travelling people was published some time ago.  It was published in February 1983.  That report makes a major recommendation to the effect that a statutory body be established to oversee the implementation of the programme.  I note the chairman of that body, a Mr. Walter MacEvilly, had several reservations and published his own view by way of an addendum to the report.  I must say I agree wholeheartedly with everything Mr. MacEvilly says.</P>
    <P>It is important that as a matter of national priority we should set about implementing a programme for the provision of adequate accommodation for every member of the travelling community. It is not an insurmountable problem. There are now only 1,300 families living in caravans on the roadside.  If the provision of proper housing for 1,300 families is beyond the capabiities of the Government then they should resign.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have an opportunity to speak.  There is no need for ignorant interruptions.  This is a very serious social problem.  There are poor, deprived people living in the most appalling conditions, conditions none of the settled community would tolerate for a week, never mind for a lifetime, and it behoves every one of us to dedicate ourselves to achieving the settlement of all these families as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have long experience of the difficulties that lie in the path of anyone charged with responsibility for implementing this programme but I believe if the will is there among those who control policy, and the responsibility is clearly that of the Minister for the Environment, and it is there that Mr. MacEvilly also claims <Col N="192" /> it lies and should remain, then all that is required, as he says, is a fresh approach to the problem by the Minister and his Department.  If the will is there the problem will be solved.  Rather than have Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Brien, dealing with a variety of matters or acting as a kind of fill-in for his Minister when he is absent or away on holidays, the Government should appoint one individual, the Minister of State, with full responsibility for the implementation of a settlement programme for the 1,300 travelling families who have not got decent homes.  He should be given sole responsibility.</P>
    <P>As I see it, there are three ways in which the programme can be implemented. First of all it is essential that an adequate number of hard stands be provided in each county and the Department should ensure not just that 100 per cent grants are made available for the acquisition and construction of these hard stands but that there are unlimited funds available for the provision of full back-up services.  This is where the whole thing has been falling down, where inadequate sums are being provided to ensure the continuation of the essential back-up services required.  These are all listed statistically in different chapters of the report to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>The problem of numbers exists really in only two counties, Dublin and Galway. The size of the problem in other counties in not a major one so I think the concentration should be on Dublin and Galway. That is not to say other counties should be ignored.  Every county should be considered to ensure that every single family is housed.  The first step then is to ensure an adequate number of hard stands.  We have at the moment the ridiculous situation where the courts are refusing to apply the law where there is illegal parking on roadsides and other unauthorised places, illegal parking which is causing serious interference and upset to the settled community adjacent to these areas. Great tension is building up between the settled community and the travelling community and until the proper authorities, the Government and the local authorities working hand in hand, set <Col N="193" /> about an immediate programme to provide an adequate number of hard stands the courts will not apply the law, and rightly so.  It is necessary for the local authorities to perform their task and my suggestion has always been that an adequate number of hard stands be provided, much more than just the number of known caravan dwellers at a particular town.  There is constant movement. There are different numbers in the summer as compared with the winter.  The travelling people move from place to place.  We have to accept all the traditions of the travelling community and recognise them in drawing up plans designed to make full provision for them.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that a number of these hard stands be provided simultaneously. No one area should be asked to carry the main burden.  These hard stand areas should not be large or designed to cater for huge numbers.  If that happens they become unmanageable.  Tensions grow and the difficulties become greater between the different communities.  If there was a determined commitment at Government level, with a Minister having sole responsibility for setting about the implementation of this type of programme, the problem would be solved very quickly.  All these people could be properly accommodated within a period of five years.  That would be a worthwhile achievement.  It is something of which we could be proud.  We cannot be proud of the present situation.</P>
    <P>There is, then, the system of group housing for the travelling community and also the allocation of ordinary housing in local authority estates.  There are three stages and there should be a concerted movement simultaneously on each front involving the fullest possible discussion and consultation with the residents in each area where it is proposed these facilities should be located.  The facilities should be spread in such a way that they would not involve a big concentration of travelling families in one area.  At the same time the travelling community should not be isolated from one another in too small units.</P>

      <P>If nothing else was achieved from this debate than a commitment from the Minister that he would set up a determined programme for the settlement of the remaining 1,300 families living in caravans who are not properly housed, then a major day's work will have been done.  I want to assure the Minister of the very fullest support from this side of the House in implementing such a programme, provided the fullest consultation takes place and that officials do not act in an arbitrary way and seek to impose solutions.  That has not proved successful in the past.  If the solution of this problem was so simple that all it required was a stroke of the pen by somebody sitting behind an office desk, then the problem would be solved years ago.</P>
      <P>This is a real social problem which is on the conscience of every Irish man, woman and child.  It is a scar on society which we should work to remove as quickly as possible.  It is not a huge problem in the sense of numbers, but the tragedy shown in this report is that due to the lack of facilities for the travelling community in recent years, some of those allocated homes found that when their children came of marriagable age, there were no homes for them to go to and they had to go back on the road again, starting the cycle again.  There is a danger that the little progress which has been made so far will be lost unless the type of plan I am suggesting is undertaken immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate my colleagues, Deputy Ray Burke and Deputy Woods, who were the then Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Health, who set up this review body and asked them to produce this excellent report.  We are not in office unfortunately to see its implementation, but I am suggesting how I would like to see this problem tackled. I am aware from the Minister's statement that a group of Ministers have been brought together, that they have been looking at this problem and that they will <Col N="195" /> be making suggestions on what they intend doing about the recommendations in the report.  They have been meeting a long time now but I have not yet seen any results.</P>
    <P>I am telling the Minister what I think he should do, but I hope the Government decide to do something positive and that adequate finance will be provided.  Time and time again I have seen county managers enter into commitments with local communities but those commitments were not fulfilled.  In many cases this was not the manager's fault, there was a lack of funds to provide the fullest possible back-up service required in each case.  I saw situations where caretakers were to be permanently on site, where sites were to be kept in tip-top condition and so on, but none of this was implemented.  Many of the undertakings were impossible to comply with.  The solving of this problem will involve the most extensive discussion and painstaking consultation, planning and care.  I believe this problem warrants the appointment of a Minister of State.</P>
    <P>I suggest that a joint committee of this House be set up.  I am chairman of an Oireachtas committee but I would resign in the morning if I thought I could participate in a joint committee which would be given power to become involved actively in promoting this work throughout the country, but that is not the way we operate in our democracy.  In this country the responsibility lies solely with the Minister.  He does not have to share any of that responsibility with the Opposition parties.  Therefore, all I can do is urge him to set about that task and to remove that scar which is on the consciences of our people.  I can assure him of the fullest possible support from this side of the House, provided painstaking care is given and provided the required amount of money is made available. The limited funds available at present are not adequate to ensure the implementation of these recommendations.</P>
    <P>We owe it to the people who have been deprived from birth of adequate education, health services and a roof over their heads to protect them from the elements. We are all crying out with shame to have <Col N="196" /> this problem dealt with and the way forward is shown by Mr. MacEvilly.  I do not agree fully with the idea of setting up another statutory body because another layer of bureaucracy will only delay the matter and that is not the ideal solution. I urge the Minister to read Mr. MacEvilly's recommendations and to follow them.  He will have the fullest possible support from everybody on this side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Vote.  I have been a member of local authorities in County Wexford for over ten years and have at least a small appreciation of the difficulties facing that sector at present.  As the Minister rightly pointed out, local authorities make an important and indispensable contribution to national life in the various areas of their traditional responsibility, and the purpose of this Vote is to channel money to the local authorities for these purposes.</P>
      <P>I sometimes wonder if any of us realise, if the Government realise, how heavily we rely on local authorities to give effect to important national policy in the areas of services and infrastructures.  There is a very long list of items involved &mdash; housing road development, planning, environmental protection and fire safety. There are areas people do not realise local government are involved in.  The list is endless: waste disposal, swimming pools, libraries, parks, burial grounds, abbatoirs, malicious damage, sheep dipping, courthouses, water safety, coast protection, land drainage, piers and harbours, and so on.  The public do not fully realise what is involved in a vote like this and how far what we are discussing touches our lives, no matter what part of the country we live in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These services are taken for granted. Members of local authorities are subject to a lot of criticism, much of it unfounded, because people do not realise all that is involved.  This is a particularly difficult time for local government because finances are perilous.  Many authorities are on the brink of insolvency. Wexford County Council is an example, but there are many others.  The Minister <Col N="197" /> mentioned the traditional areas of responsibilities, there is a review of financing and reorganisation of local government going on at present, but at a time when local authorities are finding it impossible to meet demands for essential services in the areas of roads, repairs, housing and so on I find it hard to understand why an issue such as courthouses still comes under this Vote.  That is a relic of the old grand jury system.</P>
    <P>Take many of the other subjects I mentioned which are the responsibility of local government.  It is time the sheep dipping sector became the responsibility of the county committees of agriculture. Water safety and coast protection are the responsibility of maritime local authorities because the Office of Public Works cannot undertake all this work.  The list of such work is endless and it could be 20 years before they get around to doing some of the jobs which are so badly needed.  Wexford is no exception.  We have areas which are in serious need of repair and the local authority have to put their hand into their pockets.  We do not have the money but we must do something about this.  It would be false economy to say we cannot do this work because we do not have the money.  We must protect our local and national amenities. The local authorities must be vigilant and ensure that the job is done.  If others cannot do it, we must ensure that it is done before it is too late.</P>
    <P>I have to remind myself from time to time how important the employment sector of local government is.  We rightly criticise the amount spent by the Exchequer in the public services but 35,000 people employed in local government would add up to a sizeable number of industries.  The 200 or more people employed by Wexford County Council would represent a major industry in the area which has critically high unemployment. Wexford town has 26 per cent unemployment, the highest in the region. It is easy to forget this and to be critical of public spending but when we see how we are affected it is very hard to accept some of the cuts.  It is hard to put our mouths where our money is and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>
      <Col N="198" /> The whole financial background to local government has been well documented here and there is no need for me to dwell on it although it would not be correct to speak on environmental matters without alluding to it.  Again we forget just how perilous the state of local government finances is.  Of course we understand why this is so but it is very hard to find solutions.  The various circumstances which have caused the present difficulties have been well documented. Domestic rates were abolished in 1978, a decision which was applauded, but they were abolished without introducing a viable and sustainable method of financing local government, which has created a major problem.  Farmers then withheld their rates on agricultural land on a considerable scale, as the Minister put it, and this case was based on the unconstitutionality of the Griffith PLV system of 1852 on the basis that it was inequitable as there was no appeal against it as in the case of commercial rates.  We all know that the farmers were successful in the action but it has caused major problems and ripples throughout the country as a result.</P>
    <P>There is a figure of over £20 million owed to various local authorities on agricultural rates.  That is an enormous sum to be found by the local authorities in question.  Wexford was extremely badly hit as over £2 million is owed to us.  Even the financing of this debt is causing serious problems.  If some of the money used to service our debts could be freed so that it could service structures and look after the work we should be doing in the county, Wexford would benefit tremendously.</P>
    <P>There is a figure of over £2.3 million owed to Cork as a result of the constitutional case taken by the farmers.  Money is owed to Dublin, Kilkenny, Kildare, Wicklow, Meath and Tipperary; a sum of £20 million is the cumulative owed.</P>
    <P>When the Government came to office and as a vote of confidence in local government, they put an additional £31.5 million into supporting the rates.  This went some way towards helping the cash flow position of local authorities but it was only a drop in the ocean.  We inherited <Col N="199" /> a situation in which local government had been under-funded and the importance of that had not been recognised.  Of this £31.5 million, a sum of £5 million went directly towards agricultural relief grants or, more correctly, towards the grant in lieu of rates for agricultural land.</P>
    <P>There is also a strong policy of insistence on value for money for local government spending, especially in the area of house building.  Sometimes, however, I question whether it is not false economy to be so stringent with regard to conditions of accepting schemes for housing and indeed individual cottages.  If the Government could allow more discretion in this area, if houses could be built at or below unit cost and the number of houses being built was kept up, local authorities should be allowed to devolve their own schemes and build up to a standard and not down to a price.</P>
    <P>In rural areas we can get value for money in certain areas which is more difficult to achieve in urban areas.  In Wexford, for example, we can build lovely, natural stone walls more cheaply than block walls which the Department are now insisting on.  I appeal to the Minister to use his discretion and to allow some autonomy to the various authorities to build to as high a standard as possible within the confines of a unit price and in the number of houses he expects to be built.  There will be tremendous demand for more local authority housing in the years to come.  At present there are 35,000 people on local authority housing lists but I do not think this represents the real figure.  Those of us who are involved know that you cannot measure the demand for housing until a scheme is mooted in an area.  After that people whom you did not know existed are on the local authority lists for rehousing, young people in totally unserviced caravans with two, three and four children. At present in Wexford we are building a house for a family of eight who are living in a caravan, not even a mobile home. One wonders where these people have been over the years as we built scheme after scheme.  I am convinced that the figure of 35,000 is half the real figure <Col N="200" /> needing to be accommodated.  It is one of the great challenges that the Government have to meet and I am delighted that they are measuring up to it.  If we can put decent roofs over all our people's heads and if our children can be reared in decent housing conditions with proper sanitary services they have a reasonable chance of getting a good start in life.</P>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out, two thirds of local government spending is directly from the Exchequer.  Some years ago the figure was only 40 per cent.  It is felt by those who are involved in local authorities that our financial independence is gone.  Members of county councils are merely rubber stamps.  It is very hard, especially for younger members, to have a sustained interest in a system which gives them no chance to control their own destiny.  We have to keep reminding them how important local government is and how it touches on so many matters affecting our lives.  A massive public relations job needs to be done in this area because the public are critical and members of local government and local authorities have always been the object of amusement and the butt of criticism.  Perhaps it is our own fault because we did not spell out the important nature of our service and how indispensable we are in implementing the policies of the day.  Perhaps we have not said often enough that democracy depends on sound local government.  It is in the interests of the PR system here to ensure we have a sound, healthy system of local government.</P>
    <P>In the review which the Minister has promised, I hope he turns his attention to the question of making it easier to extend local boundaries.  This has been a very complicated procedure involving the transfer of very large sums of money from one local authority in an area to another. If we cannot facilitate the smaller corporations and urban councils in extending their boundaries to encompass the natural development of urban towns, the political base is gone.  In Wexford town at present, the corporation have six independent members out of 12.  That may seem a very high proportion but the reality is that the quota is so low at election <Col N="201" /> time now that PR no longer works.  This is the case in many urban councils and corporations.  If you get three or four hundred No. 1 votes you are elected to the local authority in question.  I am a strong believer in political parties.  The discipline of the party Whip, even though we might have different ideologies and policies, is very important for this country. It ensures that there is collective responsibility and that there is a certain discipline in what is said.  It ensures there is little irresponsible mouthing without having to put down one's money.  I believe in the system of political parties. If the Minister cannot ensure in his present review an easier method of extending urban boundaries local democracy will be gone, the political parties will be wiped out and that will not be in the interest of anyone, least of all the public.</P>
    <P>Very difficult decisions have to be made with regard to future long-term financing of local government.  I hope we face up to them and accept our responsibilities, particularly those who are members of local authorities.  From time to time all of us play politics in local government, particularly when estimates are being discussed.  It is amazing how easily we line up on different sides.  On the very difficult issue of charges in local government, Fianna Fáil's record is comparable with ours.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that reasonable charges must be levied, and the Financial Provisions Act, 1983, allowed for this.  We are asking only for reasonable charges.  In Ireland we have always accepted the principle of paying for goods.  If one wishes to buy an article one goes into a shop and pays for it.  However, we have never accepted that we must also pay for services, even though this principle is accepted in the rest of Europe and the rest of the world.  For some reason, people here expect services for nothing.  We put everything down as &ldquo;free&rdquo;, whether it be school transport, education, medical cards or hospitalisation. We use the word &ldquo;free&rdquo; in totally the wrong context.  Everything has to be paid for by somebody.  Particularly in the area of providing services for local government, people will have to accept <Col N="202" /> reasonable charges, and I stress the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;, as did the Minister.  Nothing is free, somebody has to pay.  We cannot go back all the time to the central Exchequer or to the taxpayer and this is what we are talking about basically.  All of us agree that the taxpayers are too heavily loaded, that our taxation system is penal and that they are carrying too much of the burden and this applies particularly to the PAYE sector.  It behoves all of us to sell the idea that if we want a service, if we want good, strong, effective local government we will have to contribute reasonably in the future.</P>
    <P>As far back as December 1972 Fianna Fáil advocated charges for local services and in their White Paper entitled &ldquo;Local Authority Finances&rdquo; they said:</P>
    <P>The Government consider that the maximum possible amount of revenue should be derived by local authorities from charges for services, fees and other non-tax sources.</P>
    <P>It then proposed to confer on local authorities a general power to make charges for services and to undertake trading services where these were ancillary to their normal function.  The White Paper clarified the Government's intentions in regard to planning permissions, suggesting in 1972 that in regard to planning permissions £500,000 could be raised by charges for the processing of planning applications.  That was very sound.  It has been adopted and all of us agree with it.  It has been one of the least contentious matters in the introduction of charges.  The mystery remains why it took so long for all of us to see that this was an area where people should contribute to the services they were receiving.  It also had the effect of decreasing the number of speculative planning applications. Because it cost them nothing people applied for planning permission to test the market even though they had no intention of selling a site or building a house.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil came back to office in 1977 it was not long before they set about reviving their policy of charging for services.  Twice during 1980, on 1 February <Col N="203" /> and on 22 August, the then Minister, Deputy Barrett, sent circulars to local authorities asking them to review their charges.  His successor, Deputy Burke, spelled out his Government's intentions more clearly in January 1981. In a speech to the county managers in Butler's House, County Kilkenny, he said:</P>
    <P>I would like to dwell a little on this last possibility, that of charging for services.  Local authorities have already been alerted by my Department to their powers to charge directly for certain services.  I have been asked to review their practice in this regard and, where appropriate, to consider bringing the level of charges up-to-date. For my part I have been looking at the need for legislative action in certain areas to increase the scope for justifiable local authority charges.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil also took action and I commend them for it.  We are not divided on this.  It was Fianna Fáil who sponsored the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1982, which provided the legal basis for planning charges. We followed this up with the Financial Provisions Act, 1983.  While we can agree in this House on the necessity for reasonable charges for services, it behoves all of us to try to sell this idea to our own members at local government level.  It is not proving easy.</P>
    <P>I have complained in this House about removing powers from members of local authorities, about the executive function of the managers versus the reserved function of the members.  I was told that if members do not accept their responsibility the only alternative was to give that responsibility to the managers.  For the sake of the future of local government and local democracy, I appeal to all those concerned to accept their responsibilities in this area and to explain the situation to the public.  They have a choice of paying reasonable charges for essential services or facing the possibility of local government becoming extinct in the near future.  Many of the smaller authorities are seriously threatened and will be in <Col N="204" /> jeopardy unless we resolve the long-term financial position and do that very quickly.</P>
    <P>The Minister has provided £550 million for the housing programme and I commend him for this.  In times of scarce resources it is important that we spend as much as possible on local authority housing. Of that amount £211 million is for capital spending on local authority housing. However, there is one smaller area and I should like the Minister to consider it.  As he has pointed out, the central objective of our national housing policy is that every household should be able to obtain a suitable dwelling at a price or rent they can afford.  The Committee on Legislation is considering the question of the age of majority.  A major problem I encounter in my clinics, and I know this is a problem also for other Deputies, is that many young married couples wish to avail of local authority loans, HFA loans or SDA loans to build or buy their own houses but if they are not 21 years they are not entitled to borrow money or to get a local authority loan.  People can marry at 16 years and vote at 18 years but they cannot borrow legally until they are 21 years.  As far as I am concerned this matter must be rectified as quickly as possible.  We have a strict screening procedure, and the income limits and the guidelines are laid down.  I do not see any risk in lending to a 19-year old or a 20-year old who is in a secure job, who may be married and have one or two children, and particularly if their housing circumstances determine they are in need of rehousing.  I urge the Minister to do everything possible to eliminate this problem of the age of majority so that young people may be able to borrow money to build houses for themselves.  It is a major issue in Wexford and I imagine it crops up elsewhere also.</P>
    <P>Another traditional responsibility of local government relates to roads.  We have a major, on-going programme for construction, maintenance and improvement for our roadways.  Large amounts of money have been and are continuing to be pumped into the national road system. I urge the Minister to look again at the deteriorating state of county roads. <Col N="205" /> Unless we improve the road surfaces of our county roads and also examine the whole matter of longitudinal drainage we will have a major problem in the very near future.  The surface of these roads is deteriorating at a very rapid rate and I do not think this is being appreciated.  In County Wexford alone we will have a 50 per cent cutback in our surface dressing programme.  Some roads are impassable and it is a waste of time to continue pouring tar and chippings into potholes when the sides of the roads and the whole construction of them is beyond an economically feasible condition to continue maintaining.</P>
    <P>There is a matter which has been before the Department of the Environment, and the Departments of Social Welfare and Health are also involved. Some years ago Wexford County Council, because of the financial restraints on them, had to lay off about eight road workers in August and September. Those men had worked for years and wanted to continue working.  Many of them had large families and when they signed on and got their unemployment money they were not taking home much less than they got when they were working, particularly when pay-related and unemployment benefit is taken into account.  All of them preferred to be working.  Even though the financial resources in the Department of the Environment were completely depleted at that time and there was no money to enable Wexford County Council or other local authorities to keep their road workers on, the Exchequer could still provide funds for the Department of Social Welfare to assist those men.  Could we not have some system of inter departmental transfer of money during the year?  If one Vote has run short and there is still money in another Vote, surely there should be some system &mdash; I know it is cumbersome and that we are into computers &mdash; to transfer money from one Department to another?  If it is possible to do this we must do it particularly if it means keeping people, who want to continue working, doing jobs such as maintaining our roads which is part of our <Col N="206" /> infrastructural service which is so important for the future of the country.</P>
    <P>We need proper road services to attract industry to the country.  We also need good water and sanitary services.  We often forget how important the local government role is in attracting industry. I would like to commend Wexford County Council and Wexford Corporation who have never failed to meet the demands of the IDA or individual entrepreneurs when it comes to providing services if it means bringing an industry to a town.  Local government bodies throughout the country respond in a positive way to attracting industry and this is not recognised.  They provide the services if it means securing jobs, even if they have to do so at the pin of their collar.</P>
    <P>We have heard from other speakers about many other aspects under this Vote.  A great tragedy in County Wexford is the number of unserviced houses we have.  I ask the Minister to see if any special money can be found to improve our existing housing stock.  I agree with Deputy Molloy and the other speakers that in this day and age we cannot expect people to rear children without bathrooms and toilets and living in primitive conditions.  These people, because of the large number on our local authority housing lists, often get caught in a limbo.  They would probably be better off in vastly over-crowded conditions or caravans because they would be rehoused in proper conditions faster than they are at present living in unserviced, old, two up, two down type cottages with little hope of a bathroom or toilet being provided for them in the near future.  Those houses are called sub-standard houses in Wexford. I know that technically, as far as the Department are concerned, that description is not correct.  Surely it is sub-standard living if people have to rear their families without bathrooms or toilets. The Minister should see if he can provide once-off type grants to bring our existing unserviced housing stock up to an acceptable level.  This would be appreciated by everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>Wexford County Council have a very good record in relation to housing itinerants. <Col N="207" /> Many Deputies have referred to the report on itinerants.  I will not delay the House by going into this now.  I welcome the report.  Wexford County Council can be very proud of their record in housing itinerants over the last five years.  I fully accept that the issue of numbers does not confront us to the same extent as it does in Dublin, Galway and some of the other counties but we have dealt with what we have as effectively as possible.  We have a long way to go.  We are talking in terms of 48 to 50 families in County Wexford on the roadside who need to be housed.  We will not avoid our responsibility.  I want to sound a word of caution in this area.  Some years ago County Wexford were over-zealous in relation to our itinerant settlement programme. We were so zealous that we housed too many of the itinerants in the one housing scheme.  Even from the itinerants' point of view we exacerbated their problems rather than helped them.  They could not be integrated into the settled community and their children could not be integrated into the local schools.  We did very little good for them.</P>
    <P>The itinerants who want to be integrated into the settled community are entitled to be housed.  We have a scheme of letting priorities, we accept their applications and we must look after those people the same as we do any members of our community.  We must do it in such a way that they benefit from it.  Wexford have never reneged their responsibility in this area.  I doubt if consciously any local authority have reneged their responsibility in this area.  It does not do us any harm to be told to pull up our socks and continue our efforts in this area.</P>
    <P>I commend the Vote before the House. I have no doubt in the years left to the Minister in this Department, that things will go from good to even better and that the areas which need more attention will be attended to and the money found to provide for them.</P>

      <P>The Minister had a 45-page script when introducing his Estimate and looking at it one would regard it as a very fine document but what really <Col N="208" /> matters is what it will achieve for the people and all the bodies concerned.  The Minister at the beginning of his speech referred to the important work done by local authorities and to the need for reorganisation. As a member of Dublin County Council, the largest in the country, I realise the heavy responsibility on local authority and county council members. Members of local authorities are expected to meet their responsibilities in the stringent financial times we live in and not run away from them as has happened in many cases in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to reorganisation and the problem of financing.  He said he will be issuing a document later regarding reorganisation and new proposals to finance local authorities.  Everybody will welcome this.  I fully appreciate that since the abolition of rates the problem of financing local authorities is a very great one.  There has not been any progress made in this field.  I hope, when the Minister produces his new structures, they will be meaningful and will bring about a solution.</P>
      <P>The Minister said it is common knowledge that the building construction industry has suffered a significant decline in output and employment in recent years and he is concerned to see that this deadline is halted and growth resumed as soon as possible.  That is a very welcome statement from the point of view of seeing growth resumed and the decline halted. What proposals are there in this Estimate to ensure that that decline is halted and growth resumed?  No matter how many local authority houses are provided annually it must be recognised that the real growth will emanate from the private sector which must be got moving.  Have we really confronted the problems facing the building industry and ascertained what is wrong with the private sector?  Is the finance available or have people involved in the building industry had so many setbacks they are not now anxious to continue developing land and so on making it available to the building industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One major problem confronting Dublin County Council is that of the provision of services in respect of which I see <Col N="209" /> very little in this Estimate.  The provision of services constitutes a major problem in the Dublin area.  There is also the question of planning permissions and applications.  I do not intend here to be critical of the planning officials of Dublin County Council, rather I would compliment them on doing a very good job.  But with regard to the granting of planning permissions in the Dublin area there is what is called the by-law system.  There is first planning permission and then the by-law approval.  I think I am correct in saying that this does not obtain in other counties.  If I am incorrect in maintaining that it applies to Dublin only, I apologise. This is a rather complex procedure.  I am not advocating that standards be reduced but I would ask the Minister to examine this process to ascertain whether it can be simplified.</P>
    <P>In regard to planning permissions for the building of single houses in rural areas I might refer particularly to the Bohernabreena, Brittas, Rathcoole and Newcastle areas where it is very difficult for an applicant to receive planning permission for a single dwelling particularly in regard to by-laws.  Here I want to make myself perfectly clear: I am not advocating a lowering of standards but rather a simplification of the by-law procedures. In the Rathcoole, Newcastle and Saggart areas there are no services available &mdash; a sad situation within a radius of perhaps ten miles of the city centre &mdash; so that a local person cannot get planning permission to build a single house because of lack of facilities.  I know that in rural areas septic tanks can be provided and so on.  But here again the situation is difficult because these are regarded as high amenity areas.  Yet there are enormous strictures imposed on local applicants. Heretofore an applicant for planning permission was able to deal with the matter himself, whereas a person seeking planning permission to build his own home now will require the services of an expert architect in order to deal with the problems with which he will be confronted.  It is this aspect of planning permissions I would ask the Minister to have scrutinised.</P>
    <P>As a member of Dublin County <Col N="210" /> Council I might refer to the activities of Dublin Corporation in the county.  The Minister of State, Deputy F. O'Brien, is a member of Dublin Corporation &mdash; he was once Lord Mayor.  Dublin Corporation have built thousands of houses in the county, in the Tallaght and Clondalkin areas, and continue to do so.  But their policy appears to be to move people from the city centre out to Tallaght, once a rural area with no facilities whatever. They are provided with a house only and the time has come when that situation must be reviewed.  This matter has been raised on several occasions at county council meetings.  We are now told that the housing co-ordinator, Mr. Morrissey, has approached the Minister in this regard.  I am glad the Minister is present to hear my remarks because the problems in the Tallaght area are enormous, hundreds of families are being moved out to houses there from the city centre and, were it not for the work done by voluntary bodies, clergy, the principals of schools and so on, the problems being experienced would be even greater.</P>
    <P>In view of the situation prevailing there one must ask: is it any wonder that we have a drugs problem.  Families are being moved out there without any amenities or facilities.  In the past it was possible to build houses and provide open spaces with sites available in the event of people wanting to build a community hall or some such other building.  How can people, many of whom are unemployed, moving out from the city centre be expected to provide these facilities themselves? Unless there is a rethink in this area these problems will worsen.  We raised this matter time out of number at county council meetings.  Unfortunately I must place on record that the policy of Dublin Corporation appears to be merely to house people, deserting them thereafter &mdash; they are treated just as a number and no more.  The day is long since past when that type of situation can be allowed to prevail.  I appreciate that the provision of such amenities will cost money but nevertheless a rethink is urgently required.  We have been assured at county council meetings by the housing co-ordinator that he has approached the <Col N="211" /> Minister in this regard and, in replying, I hope the Minister will be able to assure me in this respect.  As a Member of this House and of a local authority, representing the Tallaght area, naturally I compliment Dublin Corporation on the numbers of houses built, but I must be critical of their overall programme.  I am glad to have had the opportunity of raising the matter in the Minister's presence.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about travelling people in the course of the debate.  We hear and read a lot about them.  I was pleased to hear Deputy Avril Doyle laud Wexford County Council, saying that that local authority were proud of their record in this respect.  The position is very different in the Dublin area.  Unless the members of Dublin County Council accept their responsibilities in regard to this problem it will continue and worsen. People may have been inclined to think that this problem would die away but such has not been the case and it will not happen.  Unless something is done about it, it will worsen.  We have had many meetings of Dublin County Council at which we merely talked around the problem. We did not take any positive decisions and no progress was made.  There is another meeting due to take place shortly.  Unless some proper decisions are taken I do not know what will happen.  I hope the Government will do something about the problem and instruct the county manager to proceed with the development of his programme.  That is the only answer.  The decent people in Tallaght and Clondalkin who purchased their own houses have been subjected to this kind of abuse for far too long.  They have been very patient and have put up with a great deal.  The time has come for a lead to be given.</P>
    <P>If the members of Dublin County Council are afraid to face up to their responsibilities and want to renege on them the responsibility must be placed elsewhere.  I am satisfied the Minister understands the problem but it is one thing to understand it and another thing to do something positive about it.  There is a lot of talk about halting sites and so on.  If some were provided it would be a <Col N="212" /> start in the right direction.  I fully support the programme of housing for itinerants. If we do not make a start the problem will get worse.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation expect the council to solve all their problems.  They have played a very small role in settling itinerants. I speak as one who has lived with this problem for many years and has heard it mentioned at various meetings. I fully support any proposals that may come before the county council which would do something about the problem. The Taoiseach was very quick some time ago to give instructions to his party members not to support certain actions and the time has now come for him to give instructions to them to be more considerate in relation to this issue.  This problem cannot continue and I hope something positive will be done.  I am pleased that the Minister is here and hope he will refer to this when replying.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister referred to the waste disposal unit which he intends to provide at Baldonnel.  There is a figure of £400,000 in the Estimate for this development. As one who is involved in industry I recognise the need for this kind of facility but I question the location.  I ask the Minister to bear in mind what I have to say.  This facility is to be sited in Baldonnel but it is strange that the people there cannot get planning permission to build houses.  I am not talking about a scheme of houses but rather the local people seeking to build their own.  They applied for planning permission but the applications were strongly opposed by the Department of Defence in Baldonnell. Now the people are expected to accept this waste facility.  The Minister has stated that every effort will be made to meet the objections of the people and I appreciate that.  There are decent people living there who have purchased their own houses and they were not objecting to the waste facility just for the sake of objecting.  They are genuinely concerned.  As a representative for the area I ask the Minister to meet their objections in a proper way.  By that I mean that officials of the Department would meet them, discuss the problem and hopefully allay their fears.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="213" /> The question of industrial waste and dumps is a matter that requires great attention.  What I have to say relates not only to this Government but to other Governments.  Is this something we have neglected?  Should we have developed it to a greater extent?  We should have known that the problem existed and would continue.  It is very difficult for local authorities to acquire suitable land for dumps.  The Minister should look at this from the point of view of his dealing with the council.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister referred to the importance of a proper road structure. There is no doubt about that.  We all appreciate that money is not readily available.  However, money which is allocated for roads should be utilised to the best advantage.  Many people find it difficult to understand why, when a section of newly laid road is completed and paid for by the county council, in a month or two some other group tears it up in order to provide another service.  There should be greater co-ordination of services.  I refer to the new Belgard road which connects Tallaght, the Naas dual-carriageway and Clondalkin.  This is a section of road which cost a lot of money to build.  It was opened by the chairman of the county council who is now a member of the Cabinet.  There is a plaque to commemorate the opening of the road. About a month later An Bord Gáis moved in to lay the gas pipe and tore up the road.  I appreciate that this was important but it illustrates how we must coordinate services.</P>
    <P>When we hear of firms closing we tend to blame them for the way they managed their affairs and approached problems. An Bord Gáis must be subject to some Government Department and surely there could have been some kind of planning between that Department and the Department of the Environment.  When this matter was raised at the council meeting we were told that An Bord Gáis would pay for it.  It does not matter who pays for it because ultimately the money comes from the people.  The time has come when a greater effort should be made in the co-ordination of services.</P>
    <P>To come back to the question of local <Col N="214" /> authority housing, there is no doubt that the Housing Finance Agency scheme is playing a major role in housing development at present from the point of view of the provision of loans.  I am concerned here about the income limit which I appreciate has been raised to £10,000 recently.  We find that a number of applicants who have been made redundant have received small allowances in redundancy payments of a few thousand pounds which, when included in their income, will put that income over the limit.  I am not referring to people who may have drawn very substantial redundancy payments but to those who may have received a small redundancy payment and because of that are anxious to purchase houses and the little money they have received added to the income earned brings them above the income limit.  It is very easy to stand up and speak about matters and sometimes very difficult to do something about them, but something should and can be done in this area and I ask the Minister to give some consideration to it because more and more people are being made redundant.</P>
    <P>Time is running out and I do not wish to deprive other speakers of the opportunity to speak.  I hope the Minister will bear in mind some of the points made in relation to the number of travelling people in the Tallaght area and what the people of Tallaght have had to suffer over the years, and here a number of members of Dublin County Council have failed to face their responsibilities.  I ask the Minister to consider the question of facilities in the Tallaght area for people who have been moved out there from the centre city into local authority houses and who have no facilities whatsoever.  Perhaps in some other Estimate we will hear about money being provided to help to solve the problem of drug abuse which is very much with us in parts of the city and county.  The problems in the Tallaght area are major but is it any wonder that we have this type of problem in the present situation?  Perhaps the Minister will have a rethink on the policies of the Department of the Environment and that might help the situation here.</P>

      <P>I hope that all who wish to speak will have an opportunity to make a contribution, as the previous speaker has said, but that may not be possible within the timescale.  Nonetheless we see a great deal of interest in the Department of the Environment Estimate on the part of politicians.  Most of us began our political career at local level and we are concerned about it on an ongoing almost daily basis.  The Minister in his new position must be congratulated on what is a very ambitious programme.  A large measure of taxpayer's money is being devoted to the Department of the Environment and our responsibility and obligation are to ensure that that money is spent wisely and that the best possible benefit for the entire community is derived from it.  I know the time is running on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to confine myself to that or even less.  County councils have experienced in the last month or so the major reductions in relation in particular to secondary roads and county roads.  My council have witnessed this particularly since the abolition of rates in 1978 which came into effect in 1979.  A great amount of money has been withheld from us as a result of High Court decisions in relation to the valuation on farms and the rating of farm lands.  Many local authorities have been left considerably short and therefore the whole road structure is at a level of decay and unless major investment is made in it in the immediate future it will cost a great deal more in the long term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say how appreciative we are in Kilkenny to the Minister for the go-ahead for the Slieve Rue by-pass, the Waterford-New Ross roadway which is long overdue and for which we have campaigned for a long time.  We hope to see considerable progress on that very important section of roadway which links the whole south-east from Cork to Rosslare through Waterford.  That very important roadway is not up to the standard <Col N="216" /> required, particularly when you consider that we are a member of the EEC.</P>
    <P>One matter which may not have been mentioned in this debate is the level of VAT charged in the operation of local council schemes and programmes carried out by local council workers.  A high level of VAT is charged then whereas contractors who do work at council level get away with a reduced level of VAT.  That is extraordinary and the Minister should examine it seriously.  The same level of VAT should apply whether the job is done by the local authority themselves and their workforce or by contractors. Certainly there should not be a variation of the order of 20 per cent between the two.  If this matter could be remedied it could leave local authorities with additional money out of their allocation to proceed with essential work in their areas.</P>
    <P>Local authority housing has been mentioned by previous speakers.  We have been fairly successful in that.  The programme for 1984 shows a considerable increase in expenditure.  The number of houses completed in 1983 shows an increase over 1982 and the prerogative and aim of the Minister is to ensure that the level of local authority houses services the need where people cannot provide houses for themselves.  I am concerned also about the level of return from some of these houses.  This relates to the agreements drawn up by the National Tenants' Association.  We are not getting anything like what we should be getting in return from rents of local authority houses.  Maintenance on these houses is costing local authorities a considerable amount of money, which is recoverable from the Exchequer; nonetheless it is taxpayers' money that we are playing around with.  Certainly we are committed to carrying out essential repairs.  The structure of the house must be catered for, but we should at least get a return that justifies carrying out repairs.</P>
    <P>I welcomed with open arms the setting up of the Housing Finance Agency and put on record my appreciation of the thinking behind that scheme.  It has done immeasurable good in the area of house purchase.  People who otherwise would <Col N="217" /> never have had the opportunity now own their own houses because of this scheme. Like every other scheme, it needs modification and amending at different stages. In agreement with the previous speaker, I would like an increase in the upper limit of £10,000.  This is a self-financing scheme which does not cost the taxpayer anything. While the upper limit is reasonable, nonetheless with the current uncertainty of employment, people may not be in a position to continue repayments to building societies, or under the SDA or other systems.  The Housing Finance Agency is here to stay and I am glad that it was the brain child of a former Coalition Government.  I wish to place on record the appreciation of many throughout the country who have benefited under the scheme.  At the time of its introduction there was great opposition to it, even in my own county council.  A fellow councillor, not of my political persuasion, described it as the greatest disaster ever perpetrated on house purchasers.</P>
    <P>I am, unfortunately, constrained by the time available and would have liked to mention many more matters.  I ask the Minister to give very serious consideration to allowing the Paulstown sewerage scheme to go ahead in 1984.  This is an area within a short distance of Kilkenny city which has had no housing construction in the last number of years.  Without a sewerage scheme, housing development cannot continue.</P>
    <P>With regard to the statutory charges which are part and parcel of ongoing obligatory local authority payments every year and concern the Departments of Health, Education, including vocational education, Agriculture, Justice, the Board of Works, Social Welfare and even the Civil Defence, these have increased by as much as 50 per cent while rates have been kept to a minimum over the years.  In his commitment to the reorganisation and re-structuring of local government, the aim of which is to make it more beneficial to the local community, the Minister must give serious consideration to having these statutory payments deleted.  They should be the responsibility <Col N="218" /> of the appropriate Department and not part of the local authority responsibility through the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>Charging for services is not the most appropriate way of ensuring the viability of local authorities.  There must be something more innovative such as a guarantee of a certain percentage of funds on an annual basis.  Otherwise, we will eventually reach the stage reached with regard to rates some years ago.  If charges for services such as water are increased continually, the public will refuse to pay them.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and wish him well in his Ministry.  I hope that after his being four years in that office, many of the problems raised here in the last few days will be solved.</P>

      <P>First of all, I should like to thank all the Deputies who have contributed in this very interesting and full debate.  I am sorry that other Deputies had not the time or perhaps the opportunity to contribute.  I thank the Deputies for their good wishes to me in this Department and hope that their good wishes will be fulfilled over the next year in which we shall be working here and that we shall be able to produce the results which some have suggested could be done if we followed the advice being given here today and on previous occasions.</P>
      <P>Deputy Avril Doyle listed the areas of responsibility of this Department and while her list was long it did not exhaust the list of matters which the Minister for the Environment has under his aegis.  As Deputy Calleary suggested, a quarter of an hour would not do justice to all the comments made and I am limited to replying to some points which have been raised here.  Certainly, I can assure the Deputies that their contributions will be noted and their ideas and comments on problems will be very fully considered by me in looking into the policy to be carried out in this very onerous Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to make a general point about local authority finances, to which many Deputies have made reference.  Deputy Molloy was particularly scathing in his remarks about the present position.  I am very well aware that local authorities are experiencing problems and said that at the outset of my very full brief at the beginning of this debate which took almost an hour and a half to get through. <Col N="220" /> I thought the Department deserved that attention so that I could give the fullest amount of information, which I did give. Any Deputy could refer to that speech and probably see the answers to some of the problems which were raised during the course of the debate.</P>
    <P>Despite the impression given by some speakers, these problems are largely the result of financial difficulties brought on by actions taken by the previous Government, now the Opposition party.  The rot set in &mdash; and we all know this &mdash; back in 1978 when domestic rates were abolished and no alternative local financing system was substituted.  That failure led from one problem to another as time went on. It was exacerbated by the decision of the High Court on the derating of agricultural land.  We all know that it had come to a point where decisions had to be taken and they were taken by this Government. The Government have restored the local authorities' discretion with regard to the structuring of local rates and widened their powers for raising revenues locally. Also, as an interim measure until more lasting solutions have been devised, the Government have greatly increased Exchequer support for local authorities in 1983.</P>
    <P>In the course of his contribution Deputy Molloy placed a lot of blame on the Leader of my party and former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Spring.  When the Tánaiste took charge of the Department of the Environment in 1983 he found that the Fianna Fáil Estimate for that year for the domestic rate grant was the same as that for 1982, not one penny had been added to it.  The decision of our Government to add a further £31 million to the figure in the Fianna Fáil Estimate meant that local authorities got great relief.  That figure has been maintained again in this year's estimate and some additional money will be added to it.  I do not pretend that all needs will be met but with the additional powers being given to local authorities to raise money and the money being made available by the Department, services and employment can be maintained. That will occur if the opportunities given to local authorities to raise money are <Col N="221" /> pursued vigorously.  Deputy Molloy raised this issue as though we had not done anything but he was wise not to refer to the record of his party when in Government.</P>
    <P>As far as grants to local authorities are concerned the Government grants and subsidies to them this year will amount to £663.3 million, an increase of £52 million or 10.3 per cent on the 1983 figure.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy once in the course of his contribution. In the few minutes available to me I will not have an opportunity of dealing with all the points raised.  A number of speakers in the debate expressed hopes that the local government review would be comprehensive and far-reaching and that new proposals would bring a better system into being for the future. In general, my aims are to strengthen the local democratic system and to make it more efficient, and to meet these aims the review involves a broad examination of the organisation and operation of local government.  There are many pressing problems, such as the inability of present structures to cope with modern social and economic demands, outdated town boundaries which have been left behind by urban growth &mdash; that was mentioned by many Members &mdash; and the lack of any structural response to the major expansion in the Dublin area.  The Dublin area represents a big problem for us.  There is also a need to review procedures, powers and functions so that local authorities can be enabled to act more effectively and flexibly in the interests of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To suggest, as Deputy Fitzsimons did earlier, that the review is leaving local authorities in the position of not knowing whether they will continue to exist is to miss the whole point of the intended reorganisation. I can assure him, and Deputy Molloy, that I have no intention of adopting the latter proposals in his White Paper of 1971 which would have wiped out local government in all but the big towns.  I can recall being actively engaged in opposing that White Paper.  I am glad it did not get off the ground because if ever there was an attack on local democracy that White Paper stands out as the major attack on small and medium sized local authorities in all areas.  I should like to assure the House that I will be looking to see how the system can be adopted and how functions can best be distributed to meet the circumstances which have <Col N="223" /> resulted from urban growth in this city and other areas.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate that the building industry is having its difficulties and all Members must be aware of that.  I accept responsibility for being in a position to do something in this area, and I am taking that responsibility seriously.  There are two reasons for the difficulties of the building industry, the recession which we find ourselves in and the lack of private investment in the industry, both of which are to some extent interdependent. Deputy Fitzsimons criticised the Government for not providing extra funds in the budget for the industry.  In my opening speech on the Estimate I took great care to explain the position relating to the building industry.  Its problems do not arise primarily from the level of public capital investment in the industry which in fact has been maintained at high levels; the State is currently financing over 70 per cent of the industry's output.  Growth in the industry must come about through increased private sector demand and investment, and it is only by encouraging this that we will see a return of significant growth in the industry.</P>
    <P>Government policies are designed to create the conditions in which development will again freely take place.  I should like to tell Deputies Molloy and Fitzsimons that their irresponsible free spending policies of the past were the major cause of our present difficulties and of the limitations on the further borrowing which can be undertaken now at home and abroad.  As a result of those policies the building industry has been hit more than by any action our Government have taken.  We will be endeavouring to improve that.  The Government will make every effort in all Departments, particularly in the economic Ministries, to improve the position in the economy so that the building industry which always reacts to any improvements can move forward.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Molloy's attack on the housing output of the Government.  The area of housing output which is most directly under the Government influence is of course the local <Col N="224" /> authority house building programme. Deputy Molloy in his contribution conveniently ignored the fact that as a direct result of the increased level of capital investment in the programme by the Government the number of new local authority houses built in 1983 was the highest since 1979.  The Deputy was very selective.  As I have already pointed out, local authority new house completions at 6,190 in 1983 were 500 higher than in 1982 &mdash; Fianna Fáil were in power for most of that time &mdash; and the number of houses in progress at the end of 1983 was 1,000 higher than at the end of the previous year and employment on the programme was 500 higher on average than in 1982.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I am satisfied that the provision of £211 million for the programme in 1984, will, having regard to the good value being obtained in tender prices and the improved cost control procedures, maintain the programme at the higher level achieved in 1983.</P>
    <P>Progress towards the Government's housing targets is, of course, dependent on growth in the economy generally.  The Government's policies have contributed to a return to significant economic growth in 1984 and I expect this to be reflected in an increased activity in the house building programme in the private sector this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it true that housing completions were down last year by 2½ per cent?  That cuts through all the waffle.  It was the lowest in five years.</P>

      <P>Deputy Walsh raised many interesting points but, unfortunately, in 15 minutes I cannot deal with them adequately.  I should like to refer to the question of the travelling people, a topic mentioned by many Members but, in particular, by Deputy Walsh who is well versed in the problem which exists in his constituency.  I am glad to say that the Minister of State in my Department is considering a programme to deal with the problem.  I will certainly be very active in seeing that the proposals in the report are brought forward as quickly as possible so as to alleviate the situation.  I <Col N="225" /> agree that it is an area where councillors themselves are involved because local councillors have responsibility for the housing of the travelling people.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy is very anxious that something should be done in this area and I certainly give him my assurance that it will be done as far as I am concerned. Perhaps telling me to do something is all very well but it would be wise if he himself were to speak to some of his own councillors in his own area as well as speaking to councillors on this side of the House.  I have practical experience of the problems in my own county and some of the statements made by councillors about this problem were certainly not reflected in Deputy Molloy's speech, I am glad to say, this morning.  Some councillors need to be educated about their responsibilities. The problem of the travelling people is indeed a major one and the House can be assured the Government are fully committed to material progress in this whole area.  I am sorry I cannot deal with other points but, as I said, I will take all the points raised into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In my earlier remarks I strongly criticised the whole approach to the development of the health service as well as the attitude of the present Minister who is the Deputy Leader of the Labour Party and who has a policy totally at variance with Labour policy in the trend he is pursuing at the moment.  I indicated that the Government and the Minister were availing of the soft option in that they had decided to confront the old and the sick rather than the vested interests in the operation of the service, vested interests such as the medical profession, the pharmaceutical profession, the drug companies and the private hospitals.  I also indicated that what was developing from the Minister's side of the House was a new form of socialism which appears to be a means test socialism, an attitude involving the application of a means test to all sections regardless of the rights or wrongs of the particular computation or the result of such a test. The most obvious example of that recently was the withdrawal of medical cards from some 120,000 students.  Medical cards were withdrawn from a large number of young people between the ages of 16 and 25.  I attempted to get the exact figure of how many students were involved and I was informed by the Minister it was not possible to produce such a figure and that that kind of information was not therefore available.  It has, of course, been possible to produce a figure of 120,000 students and it is difficult to understand why the much vaunted computer the Minister has at his disposal can produce information which suits him but cannot produce information essential to Deputies in Opposition in order to counteract his arguments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another piece of information I sought which highlights the ludicrous approach of the Minister in regard to the withdrawal of medical cards from young <Col N="227" /> people was the cost of means testing these young people who are deprived of medical cards.  On two occasions I tabled a question to the Minister asking him to let me know the cost and I was told it would not be practicable to work that out.  I tabled a further question to find out how much it would cost on average in general to means test any applicant for a medical card.  Again I was told it was not practicable to produce that kind of information. I am fairly certain that if one were to take into account the time involved, the number of staff employed, the cost of stationery and so forth, we would be talking in terms at the very least of £20 per applicant. That is putting it at the lowest level. In a previous question I asked the Minister how much it would cost to inform 120,000 students that their cards were being withdrawn and I was told it would cost £50,000.  That illustrates the way in which the Minister is continuing the <i>ad hoc</i> approach in the cutback.  The <i>ad hoc</i> approach in the development of the services is now being applied to the actual cutback in the services.</P>
    <P>Any society must be judged by the way in which it treats the old and the sick and if one were to apply such a guideline to the way in which the health services are being attacked by this Government and add to that the on-going long-term abuse of the old, particularly those who are lodged in psychiatric hospitals because they are old and no longer capable of looking after themselves, and when we are met every day of the week with housing cutbacks affecting the old, and even the young, the picture is not a happy one. I also raised with the Minister recently the case of a four-and-a-half year old girl whose parents were unemployed, who urgently needed her tonsils and adenoids removed and whose parents were advised that, unless the operation took place promptly, the child could suffer some permanent loss of hearing.  By the time I put my question down the child had gone completely deaf.  The Minister's reply on 13 March was that he was informed that should the case require urgent surgical intervention it would be carried out immediately.  The fact is the operation <Col N="228" /> has not yet been carried out and it would appear the Minister's interpretation of what is urgent is certainly not the same as that implied by the child's doctor and certainly not that which is implied by the hospital.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see the Eastern Health board and the hospitals do not regard ear, nose and throat operations as matters for urgent surgical intervention.  This is a clear case where a child entitled under statute law to health care, to the best care available, has been deprived of that care and is suffering as a result.  We do not know yet when the operation will take place or to what extent that child's hearing will be restored when the operation is completed because the doctor is not in a position to guarantee that hearing will be restored.  This is a situation where the cutbacks are having a very clear effect on the health of our young people.  This case was brought to the attention of the hospital. She was placed on the waiting list last November but she has not been operated on yet and her hearing has gone completely.  There are other instances as well.</P>
    <P>The health boards are being driven into making petty and mean cutbacks in relation to old people.  These people are subject to problems with abscesses or varicose veins and so on and the Eastern Health Board have insisted on cutbacks on the number of dressings that can be applied for these complaints.  This is causing a great deal of distress.  For the Minister to claim that his cutbacks are not affecting the quality of the health services available to the people in general is not accurate. I would ask him to think again of the way he is applying these cuts.</P>
    <P>There is a need for urgent reorganisation of our health services.  In the past the Minister committed himself to changing the fee-per-item system which means that every time a patient with a medical card visits a doctor the doctor is paid for that visit and every time a prescription is filled by a chemist the chemist is paid for that prescription.  No advanced society attempting to provide a comprehensive service free at the point of delivery can do that with this fee-per-item approach. The Minister is on record as saying that <Col N="229" /> he favours the capitation system whereby a doctor will receive payment for a patient on his books but that payment would not necessarily be related to the number of visits a patient makes.  That would be a fairly dramatic change and would save considerable amounts of money if introduced.</P>
    <P>Another area where savings could be made is in the administration of means tests.  There is a considerable amount of time, resources and effort spent assessing people who may be eligible for particular services to which they are entitled.  I would argue very strongly that the approach to the delivery of health services is tied very closely to a commitment to retaining private medicine.  The only people who can gain from the continued split in the population &mdash; 40 per cent who have medical cards and the other 60 per cent who are bound to use the private medical schemes and others who pay out of their own pockets as they need the services &mdash; is the medical profession.  Unless the Minister makes a calculated decision to do away with the whole concept of means testing for health services and confronts head on the vested interests, whose main interest is in selling health care as a commodity, we will have a ramshackle <i>ad hoc</i>, medical service forever and a day.  Having a Labour Party Minister for Health in the Government one would expect that that would be the approach, but unfortunately to date the evidence is not there to raise any great expectations in that direction.</P>
    <P>Another area which needs to be looked at is the drugs which are available.  The World Health Organization have estimated that approximately 1,000 basic generic drugs would cover most eventualities in any health service.  On the other hand, in this State there are something in the region of 15,000 drugs in circulation under various brand names and most of which are produced by multinational companies and promoted in a very lavish way through the doctors in private practice. I feel very strongly that the Minister should establish a list of these 1,000 drugs and insist that it is from this list that doctors prescribe for their patients and <Col N="230" /> that the drug companies be asked to tender for supplies for health boards. That is an area where very large savings could be made.  Again, the Minister will have to face very strong vested interests because there are huge profits made out of supplying drugs to our health services. Anyone who has ever had the misfortune to go into a chemist to buy any kind of drugs, whether on prescription or otherwise, will know the huge market there is at that level.</P>
    <P>The other area I propose to talk about is family planning.  The Minister promised some amendments to the Health (Family Planning) Act, 1979.  It is my contention that the whole area of family planning is a question of the public health, and the health of the women in our society and their children.  Members of this Dáil have no right to interfere with the choices made by couples as to what form of family planning they choose to use.  The only function we have in the matter is to ensure that a wide range of family planning facilities are available throughout the State and where they are not available any amendment the Minister makes to the Act should ensure that they are made available.  I favour the provision of family planning services through our local health clinics.  In present circumstances this is the most obvious means of delivering family planning services to local areas.</P>
    <P>The local health clinics could provide a much wider range of services in relation to women's health, which is at present ignored unless the woman has the finance to go to a private doctor to have various tests carried out.  A local health board could provide services such as screening for breast cancer, cervical smear testing, rubella immunity testing and many other services.  The basic service must be concerned with comprehensive and varied methods of family planning.  It is not the function of the people in this Dáil to decide the methods any couple ought or ought not to use.  All methods should be available, ranging from non-medical devices to what is called the natural family planning method.  There are all sorts of methods which suit different people at different stages of their lives <Col N="231" /> and it is not our function in this House to make moral decisions for anybody.  It is up to us to ensure that public health is protected and comprehensive family planning is an integral part of that.</P>
    <P>If the Minister introduces amendments which provide for the type of service I have talked about and does not attempt to make moral judgments for individuals, then he can count on my support and that of Deputy Mac Giolla for those amendments. If there is an attempt to carry on the window dressing introduced here in 1979 we will oppose it as strongly as we can inside and outside this House.</P>
    <P>Drug abuse is an area of concern which makes newspaper headlines almost every day of the week.  The problem has not developed overnight but has been growing over a number of years.  Many of us involved in public life warned various Governments over the years about the growth of this problem and that nothing worthwhile or specific was being done to tackle it.  There is a need for the implementation without delay of the task force recommendations which the Government received last November.  The Minister has indicated that steps are being taken to implement them but the perception of people outside this House is that not enough is being done to tackle the problem.  This has given rise to street demonstrations in recent months and in some instances the harassing of individuals alleged to be drug pushers.  It has also led, apparently, to activities of a paramilitary nature.  A number of people have been shot and attempts have been made to kidnap several people.  This is leading to even greater frustration on the part of parents who are genuinely concerned about the problem of drug abuse.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise that the kind of vigilante activity which has occurred in some instances &mdash; not all &mdash; is not a solution to the problem.  There can be no overnight or easy solution.  It requires the co-operation of parents and the Garda at local level, as well as the co-operation of teachers in schools.  It also requires the provision of resources by the Government for the treatment of drug addicts and a positive development of social and <Col N="232" /> economic policy which would eliminate the despair which largely leads to the use of drugs by young people.</P>
    <P>A study last year indicated that the greatest problem of drug abuse exists in those areas which are most deprived socially.  That is not to argue that drug abuse does not occur in middle class or upper class areas &mdash; it certainly does &mdash; but its greatest concentration is in areas where there is most social deprivation. Many young people involved in drug abuse are also involved in petty crime in order to pay for their habit and this is leading to further frustration and disenchantment among people in areas where there has been for a long time a high degree of alienation from the establishment, the Garda and so forth.</P>
    <P>One of the task force recommendations concerns the expansion of the drug squad.  That is a very clear and unambiguous recommendation which has been accepted by the Government.  I would be the last to argue that the expansion of the drug squad would lead to the solution of the problem, but it is an indication of the unwillingness of the Government to tackle the problem seriously and provide the necessary resources that a few months later they say it is not proposed to expand the squad immediately and that if the Government feel greater resources are required then they will be provided.  That is a very clear back off from the acceptance of the recommendation.  If we examine the progress which has been made on the recommendations of the task force, we see a trend towards backing off from those recommendations.  We are told in reply to questions here that various discussions are taking place and various decisions are being made but we see no concrete evidence of progress.</P>
    <P>One recommendation concerns a part of my own constituency, Ballymun, regarded as a high risk area, together with Dún Laoghaire, sections of the north inner city and sections of Cork.  It was recommended that various State agencies should come together and decide how best their services could be utilised to assist in beating the scourge of drug abuse.  To date, almost six months after the acceptance of those recommendations, <Col N="233" /> there is no clear evidence in Ballymun of any concrete result.  There is no evidence that any of the agencies concerned have come together to discuss how they can best make an input to the solution of the problem of drug abuse in the area.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Minister must make a serious endeavour to convince people outside that he is genuinely concerned about the drug problem.  I know he is genuinely concerned about that problem but he must make that clear by way of taking positive action to tackle the problem at all the various levels.  Obviously, the area of supply is one, but if demand ceases to exist supply is no longer a problem. Therefore, we must concentrate on the long-term question of eliminating the demand for these drugs while in the short term we must deal with the situation of those young people who are addicted to drugs.  We can only do that by providing adequate resources to enable treatment facilities to be expanded.  We must ensure that those young people who are dependent on addictive drugs and who find themselves before the courts are not lodged in prison cells without there being any hope of treatment for them.  During their incarceration they come into contact with people who have been found guilty of other crimes with the result that the drug addict may well leave prison more proficient in ways of getting money with which to buy drugs.  I am asking that practical steps be taken, steps which will convince the people of this city and of other areas where there are serious drug problems that the whole question of the treatment of addicts and of the apprehending and imprisoning of pushers is being dealt with to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    <P>We must concentrate on eliminating the demand for addictive drugs, a demand that arises by and large from the sense of despair experienced by young people in not being able to fulfil themselves as a result of the social conditions in which they live.  In many cases of drug addiction the people concerned began taking drugs when they found they had no job prospects and very often these are people who have only had a very poor <Col N="234" /> education.  I appeal to the Minister to concentrate on that aspect of the problem.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister, too, to reverse the policies he is pursuing now and to face up to the vested interests I have named &mdash; the medical profession, the pharmaceutical profession, the drug companies and the private hospitals.  These are the areas in which huge amounts of money are being wasted.  It is a statistical fact that for almost the same expenditure of GNP in Britain a comprehensive health service is provided free of charge whereas here this is available to only 40 per cent of our population.  Clearly, then, there is a wastage of resources and there is a necessity to locate the areas of that wastage.  I have indicated where I think they are and it is for the Minister as a socialist and as Minister for Health to tackle those areas.</P>
    <P>It might be worth reiterating that the purpose of private medicine is profit.  In order to highlight that I shall quote a gentleman by the name of Jack Massey who at one stage was chairperson of Kentucky Fried Chicken in America but who resigned that position to become head of the hospital corporation of America.  He said that the gross potential in hospitals was unlimited, that it was even better than that of Kentucky Fried Chicken.  I appeal to the Minister to tackle the private medicine lobby and to set about providing a public health service from the resources provided by the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>The Irish have a health service of which to be proud.  Thanks to the commitment and foresight of our predecessors &mdash; politicians, professionals and administrators &mdash; this country has a health service comparable with those of <Col N="235" /> the richest countries in the world.  Many countries envy the extensive system of primary care, the sophisticated hospitals and trained personnel that are at our disposal.  The rate of infant mortality, now at a record low level, mortality rates and life expectancy at different ages, all compare favourably with standards enjoyed in other countries.  This was not the case 35 years ago, before a comprehensive effort was made to improve the health services.</P>
      <P>In recent years the health services have been able to meet the growing demand for services resulting from the increase in population, rising expectations for medical care and advances in medicine.  The health services have for the most part avoided the kinds of problems which have affected other services in this country where demand has exceeded supply. Much of this has been achieved by increased efficiency.  Health board hospitals, for example, with a slight reduction in beds increased their throughput of patients by more than 60 per cent in the period 1970 to 1981.</P>
      <P>The scope of the health services is unusually wide in Ireland, more so than in other European countries.  It includes sophisticated medical treatment in hospitals, family medicine in the home and doctor's surgery, long-term care for the elderly and handicapped and, less obviously, a wide range of welfare services to assist people with physical, mental and social disabilities.  The health service is responsible also for standards of food and medicines, the control of tobacco and alcohol advertising and for the promotion of health education.  This permits health and health-related problems to be tackled on a broad front.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The organisation of these different activities into an effective and efficient service to promote the highest level of health is one of the major challenges in the health services at present.  Since taking up office I have been particularly concerned with a number of specific aspects of the health services.  One of these is the whole concept of obtaining value for the money which is spent on these services.  The rapid increase in <Col N="236" /> expenditure on these services is a matter of concern and there now seems to be a general realisation that the resources which we can make available for health are limited.  It is therefore more vital than ever before to extract the maximum benefit for every increment of cost which is incurred.</P>
    <P>One of the major problems facing the health services is how to balance an infinite demand with limited resources.  Very few countries will be in a position to maintain the level of increase of spending on health services which has taken place in the past ten years.  We are no different in this respect.  The current year's health allocation is less than the Government would have desired but is the most that could be given having regard to the Exchequer position.  As a result I recognise that all health agencies will face difficult decisions in containing expenditure within their approved levels.</P>
    <P>The current year therefore will see some inevitable reductions in expenditure levels.  The bulk of this reduction will fall on institutional services which account for over 70 per cent of total expenditure.  In achieving the reductions necessary all health agencies have been advised that services for those most at risk should be protected to the maximum extent and that a switch should be made wherever practicable from institutional care to care in the community.</P>
    <P>There has been a significant degree of criticism in recent years regarding the manner in which health resources, financial and personnel have traditionally been deployed.  The thrust of these criticisms is that far too high a proportion is consumed by hospitals and other institutional centres, leaving community services to make do with the remainder.</P>
    <P>The absence of extra funds for new developments means that none will be possible unless resources can be transferred within the present levels of allocation. It is essential that all services should now be subject to a much more searching and ongoing examination to identify all opportunities for the modification of services, to improve both their effectiveness of delivery and their economic efficiency.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="237" /> Given that it will be absolutely essential to maximise levels of cost effectiveness, we have already taken a number of important steps to see that value for money is obtained across a broad range of services.  For example, a number of studies were carried out on supplies, energy, transport and housekeeping and the recommendations for improved practices set out in these particular reports have now been circulated to the health agencies.</P>
    <P>Certain other services, notably the procedures relating to patient admissions to general hospitals, are currently being examined to ensure that unnecessary admissions to hospital do not take place. New management information systems, now being introduced by the major health agencies, will be of inestimable value and assistance to managements, both local and central.</P>
    <P>The management information that will be produced by those systems, for example in the costing area, will greatly improve the quality of analysis and decision making.  I think it is fair to say that the rapid growth in non-capital expenditure in the past decade on the health services has meant that there is room for greater economies and better utilisation of resources.  These studies which I have mentioned, the critical evaluation of services, the new management systems being introduced by the various major health agencies, can only assist the Department and the agencies to deliver services in an efficient way.  Ultimately they should result in greater value for money being obtained for every pound spent on the health services.</P>
    <P>One other area which is being examined in the current year is the question of supplements to basic pay which cost over £100 million in 1983.  While I accept that the major portion of this amount was in respect of payments for night and week-end duty it is imperative that a reduction in this area is achieved.  Failure to do so could result in the loss of jobs or reduction in important services.  We are very fortunate in this country in having an exceptional and strongly motivated staff providing our health services.  We have received a most responsible level of co-operation <Col N="238" /> from these staff in effecting savings and I am confident that with their assistance services will be maintained at an acceptable level.  The measures being taken in regard to cost containment, while important, are just one part of a more general strategy to ensure that resources are used to the best effect.</P>
    <P>We must now move from this stage to a more fundamental questioning of some of the services and procedures which have traditionally been regarded as essential elements of the health care system. This is allied to service evaluation, the process of continuously reviewing the justification for each area of expenditure to enable conscious decisions to be made on each element of the services provided. This process is an inherent part of good management but it will become even more relevant in the future if, as we must now assume, the current restrictions on public spending are not simply a transient phase.</P>
    <P>The need to control spending on public services is not simply the pre-occupation of politicians and public servants.  Daily we hear the exhortations for lower taxation or more lenient treatment of this or that group.  Simultaneously, there are requests and demands for new services, extensions of existing services or eligibility for services, many seemingly based on the false notion of a bottomless public purse.  As politicians we have a responsibility to inform the public of the realities of the situation.  We must have the courage to tell them that it is not possible simultaneously to reduce the yield from taxation and, on the other hand, provide more public services.  Quite simply, the equation will not balance.</P>
    <P>I have also been concerned with the drugs related aspects of the health services.  This responsibility comprehends both the legitimate use of drugs as well as their abuse and the various controls which need to be exercised in both areas.</P>
    <P>Drug abuse is one of the most serious problems facing our community today. In the last few years the nature of the drug problem has changed in this country and it has had a dramatic growth.  The nature of the problem has changed in that <Col N="239" /> most addicts are now abusing heroin which is a recent phenomenon in this country.  The social profile of the typical abuser has also changed.  The drug problem, which is mainly confined to the greater Dublin area, now affects young people particularly, without any reference to intellectual or educational attainment. No social class and no district in this area is exempt.  A remarkable trend in recent years has also been the increasing number of adolescents who begin with immediate abuse of &lsquo;hard&rsquo; drugs rather than by way of the long established procedure of graduating from the so called &lsquo;soft&rsquo; drugs.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that there are 1,500 heroin addicts in the Dublin area and probably twice as many more experimenting with the drug.  The available evidence from the drugs advisory and treatment centre in Jervis Street shows that in June last 260 patients attended the centre and of these 196 were abusing heroin.  Sixty of those attending were new patients.  As there tends to be a three to four year time lapse between a person's first contact with drugs and when treatment is sought these figures from Jervis Street obviously would not reflect the full extent of the current problem.</P>
    <P>The impact which heroin abuse has on our community is very significant particularly in terms of human suffering and of crime.  Heroin addicts almost invariably have to resort to crime to obtain the money to feed a habit which can cost from £100 to £150 per day.  It is also evident that many addicts eventually turn to drug pushing to help feed their own habit and this in turn spreads the growth of the problem.  The number of persons convicted of unlawfully supplying controlled drugs increased from 24 in 1981 to 99 in 1982.  The number of drug seizures made by the Gardaí increased from 1,204 in 1981 to 1,873 in 1982, an increase of 56 per cent.  The most disturbing factor in this area is the increase in the amount of heroin being seized, which increased from 170 grammes in 1981 to 1,264 grammes in 1982.  The largest single seizure made was 364 grammes in Dublin.</P>
    <P>It was in the context of this major and <Col N="240" /> growing problem that the Government decided to establish the special governmental task force of Ministers, which was the first of its kind.  The task force were asked to review and report on the question of drug abuse with particular reference to the inner city area of Dublin. They carefully examined all submissions received including those received from the health boards, as well as two recent reports on the incidence of drug abuse, both of which confirmed that the extent of heroin abuse is very high.  There were many useful suggestions made in the submissions and these helped the task force to frame many of their recommendations. Among the areas which were examined in detail were the range of measures aimed at preventing the importation and distribution of illicit drugs, the provision of comprehensive drug education programmes as an integral part of school curricula, the introduction of a youth and community development strategy, and the adequacy or otherwise of the treatment and rehabilitation facilities available to drug abusers.  The task force in their consideration of these areas had discussions with the experts dealing with these facets of the drug problem.</P>
    <P>The Government appreciate that the drug problem cannot be eliminated overnight. However, its growth in the Dublin area must be halted and its spread to the provinces prevented.  I am confident that with the implementation of the recommendations of the task force the technical problems experienced by the Garda in the past have been overcome and the spread of drug abuse through the country can be arrested and contained.</P>
    <P>Another of my responsibilities as Minister of State is measures to combat infectious diseases.  My predecessor in office, Deputy Fergus O'Brien, gave particular emphasis to the expansion of vaccination and immunisation to protect the health of infants.  The low level of whooping cough vaccination is particularly disturbing. While the target level to ensure an acceptable level of immunity is 70 per cent of young children, vaccination rates in the seventies fell to as low as 32 per cent.  In other words, only three out of every ten children were being adequately <Col N="241" /> protected from the disease.  Not surprisingly, the incidence of whooping cough rose, alarmingly rising to 1,000 reported cases in 1982.  This is no less than an epidemic.  Since the disease can permanently damage children, and in some cases causes death, something had to be done to encourage parents to bring their children for vaccination.  The 11 deaths from the disease between 1973 and 1982 were 11 deaths too many.</P>
    <P>Parents who may have feared that the vaccine might damage their child, may be reassured by the work of the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland.  Surveying the international information on whooping cough vaccination, the college have drawn up a list of the contradictions for vaccination which has since been circulated to general practitioners and medical officers to assist them in deciding whether or not to administer a vaccine in a particular case.  It is clear that the damage caused by the disease far outweighs the risks of vaccination.</P>
    <P>The programme to promote vaccination designed by the Health Education Bureau aims at increasing the awareness of parents and the medical profession of the benefits of immunisation in preventing disability and death.  The public is being alerted by means of advertisements on television and radio and many of you will have seen or heard the extremely hard hitting advertisement about whooping cough.</P>
    <P>A special educational and informational &lsquo;kit&rsquo; on vaccination and immunisation has been circulated to each doctor in the country.  The &lsquo;kit&rsquo; consists of posters for display in the surgery and a leaflet setting out details of the Department of Health's programme of recommended vaccination and immunisation.</P>
    <P>Poor rates of vaccination against polio are also causing concern.  The occurrence of five cases of polio in 1977 and one case of the disease in 1980 and 1982 was the direct result of the low level of vaccination. There is no need to remind the House of the devastating effects of this dreadful disease.  We cannot relax until every child is vaccinated against polio as a matter of routine.</P>
    <P>I will continue my predecessor's efforts <Col N="242" /> to ensure that every child is assured the right to health from its earliest years. About 40,000 cases of measles occur each year and the side effects of the disease place demands on the health services, both in the short and long term.  The Minister has announced that he is planning the introduction of a measles vaccination programme, to begin hopefully in 1985.  A vaccination programme will reduce the amount of illness caused to children by this disease and the consequent demand on the health services for expensive medical care.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned with the suitability for human consumption of meat and milk at the point of sale.  The Minister for Agriculture shares this responsibility.</P>
    <P>Health boards arrange for analysis of food samples at the retail level including the monitoring of milk and milk products for antibiotic residues.  It is hoped that products will soon be monitored for both hormone and antibiotic residues.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed about the widespread use of antibiotics in farming and the danger that human diseases will become increasingly resistant to some antibiotics.  The Department of Health commissioned an in-depth review by the Food Advisory Committee. Detailed controls, which include prescription control for all antibiotics, together with monitoring systems have been recommended by that committee and are being considered in both Departments.  As the Minister indicated, the proposed measures promise to be up-to-date and effective. Of course, in addition to checking for compliance with these controls by sampling at the retail level, it will be necessary to ensure that they are observed at the point of source, that is at the slaughtering stage.</P>
    <P>Recently, the adequacy of controls on the sale and use of hormones and antibiotics in animal husbandry has been queried.  Controls already exist under the Poisons Regulations 1982 and under regulations administered by the Minister for Agriculture.  I understand that he is moving to restrict sale of certain of these products to prescription only.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1980 community ophthalmic <Col N="243" /> services for all eligible persons were provided by the health boards through clinic sessions held by ophthalmologists who were paid on a sessional fee basis.  When spectacles were prescribed they were supplied by certain opticians who were the official contractors to the health boards. Each community care area of the health board invited tenders, and contracts for the supply of spectacles were awarded on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of 1980 the new sight testing scheme came into general operation. Under this scheme eligible adults and adolescents who require a sight test are issued with an authorisation by the health board to attend an optician or ophthalmologist of their choice from a panel who have entered into an agreement to provide services on behalf of the health board.</P>
    <P>When spectacles are prescribed they can be supplied by an ophthalmic optician, ophthalmologist or a dispensing optician on the health board panel.  The fees for sight tests and the prices for spectacles are the same as those paid under the Department of Social Welfare's optical benefit scheme.  The sight testing scheme is in addition to the clinic based service provided by ophthalmologists who continue to provide a service as before but whose work-load of adults has been considerably reduced by the introduction of the sight testing scheme.  While the full development of the community ophthalmic and sight testing services require additional resources, there are no great problems for children in obtaining treatment, and spectacles, if required.</P>
    <P>Screen testing of children for hearing defects is carried out in the course of developmental paediatric clinics and by specially trained public health nurses. Where hearing loss is suspected the child is referred to an ear, nose and throat surgeon or an audiologist for confirmation of the diagnosis and, if necessary, to the National Rehabilitation Board for the supply of a hearing aid.</P>
    <P>Visiting teachers of the deaf are employed by the National Rehabilitation Board to advise on the care of pre-school hearing-impaired children in co-operation <Col N="244" /> with visiting teachers of the deaf employed by the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>An eligible adult with a hearing difficulty can be referred by his doctor to an ear, nose and throat specialist, or, if the doctor considered a hearing aid is necessary, to the local health board.  The health board arranges for the supply of a hearing aid through the National Rehabilitation Board.  The National Rehabilitation Board provide assessment of hearing loss throughout the country.  They operate permanent clinics in Dublin, Cork and Galway, and regular clinics in several other centres.  The hearing aid service is functioning satisfactorily.</P>

      <P>The two-year course for medical secretaries which is conducted by the North-west College of Technology, Derry, and which qualifies for the Diploma of the Royal Society of Arts is not acceptable for the purposes of the award of a scholarship under the scheme of scholarships operated by vocational education committees having regard to the entry qualifications for the course and the academic attainments required for awards under the VEC scholarships scheme.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Government policy on adult and continuing education is outlined in the recently published <i>Programme for Action in Education 1984-1987.</i> The report of the Commission on Adult Education will be published shortly and the Government will respond as positively as possible to the recommendations of the commission within the limits imposed by available financial resources.  Adult literacy will constitute a major thrust of future policy and community education in disadvantaged areas will also be promoted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state in what way it is intended that the disadvantaged will be favoured in the provision of adult education facilities?  Secondly, will she consider consulting with the Minister for Social Welfare to provide that adults attending education courses will not be disqualified from receiving their social welfare benefits in a manner as applies at present?  Thirdly, will she indicate what funds are likely to be available for adult education in disadvantaged areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>On the second part of the question, I am in consultation with the Minister for Social Welfare on that matter. With regard to adult education in disadvantaged areas, I am afraid I shall have to wait until the report of the Commission on Adult Education is published, which will be in a matter of weeks, for further details so that we can see how we plan to implement the programme.  That applies also to the funds available.  As the Deputy is aware, it is not possible for me at this stage to allocate funds for 1985, 1986 and 1987.  The Deputy can be <Col N="246" /> assured that I will implement as actively as possible the report of the Commission on Adult Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister go so far as to say that it is likely there will be an amendment to the existing rule regarding the disqualification from social welfare benefits of adults on education courses? I realise a decision has not been made but perhaps the Minister can indicate to the House that this will be likely?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state how long the report of the Commission on Adult Education has been with the Department?  I ask that serious consideration be given to allow people to continue to receive their benefits and, at the same time, benefit from adult education which ultimately will help their future job prospects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to the second part of that question, I can only repeat assurances of my concern in this area and the fact that I am in discussions about this very difficult problem.  It is quite complex, as I am sure the Deputy is aware. The report of the Commission on Adult Education was presented to me in June 1983.  It is a very large report and, as the Deputy is probably aware, when reports are presented to Government they must be circulated to all Departments for observations.  Because it is such a large report many Departments took a considerable time to consider it carefully.  It is now being discussed by the Government and I expect to have it published within a matter of weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated she was somewhat restricted in what she could say until the report is published. Does she not agree that the matter of premises presents one of the greatest difficulties facing those who are registered in adult education?  At the moment adult education classes can take place only in whatever facilities are available for first <Col N="247" /> and second level education.  In Dublin there is a problem in certain areas of decreasing numbers at first and second level.  Will the Minister undertake to do what is possible, through the involvement of her Department in the schools, to make sure that resources available at first and second level will also be made available to adult education groups who are beginning to develop around the city?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter that is covered in the report of the Commission on Adult Education.  The Deputy is aware that facilities are available at third level for adult education.  It is not envisaged that the Department of Education will get involved in the large-scale provision of premises for adult education but obviously the full utilisation of existing resources is something that must be encouraged.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I carefully considered the submission made by the Finglas Association for Mature Student Education.  A reply has been issued to the association explaining the position in regard to (i) the question of fees for students at the leaving certificate examination, and (ii) the question of accommodation for the association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of accommodation, the reply pointed out that only the managerial authorities of the schools in the area could deal with that matter.  As I said in relation to the previous question a moment ago, it is not the function of the Minister to supply premises for adult education.  With regard to fees, the fee for the leaving certificate examination is £30 per student for school candidates and £30 per subject for external candidates.  There are <Col N="248" /> reasons for the difference.  One is that a special examination centre has to be established to cater for external students and unit costs are likely to be considerably higher than for regular school-based centres.  In the reply I said I would look at the position regarding the charges for external candidates in respect of future examinations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister happy with the position regarding fees?  I am referring to a situation where a group of housewives apply themselves to study one subject in which they can become literate and thus help their families.  Is she happy that those ladies should be charged £30 for sitting that examination?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">

      <P>Will the Minister accept that this area has been grossly neglected over a number of years, that there has been a total failure to come up with any realistic policies?  The Minister's action programme is the first sign that this is being faced.  Does the Minister agree that there is need to make a great deal of progress like the progress made in other countries in identifying these areas? While we welcome the money granted this year a far greater commitment of resources in the particular areas will be needed in the future.  I would like to mention again pupil-teacher ratios and pre-school investment.  They are all an integral part of the programme.</P>

It must, of course, be said that the whole question of what action can be taken will relate to the amount of resources available.  We have specified quite clearly in the Programme for Action in Education that priority in the use of available resources will be accorded to a programme to assist disadvantaged pupils.

      <P>Would the Minister not accept that there was an exceptionally remarkable level of disparity between the level of results in this particular year and those of previous years?  Perhaps the Minister in her reply is giving us newer information than we have had in direct correspondence.  Would the Minister confirm that a significant revision resulted in this case or is she talking about the small number of people about whom we have known for some time?  What method of checking is involved?  Were the actual papers reconsulted, because there is grave local concern and there appears to be a remarkable level of disparity in the results that year in comparison with the standards normally achieved in that school.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>As a general principle <Col N="264" /> the State would accept liability for personal injury to teachers, students or members of the public only where negligence on its part or on the part of its officers, servants or agents is proved. School managements are not responsible for private property and, accordingly, the indemnity would not apply in the event of loss or theft of personal property or damage to such property.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to part (f) of the question, the Department are advised that should an accident befall a student while on the school premises through dismissal for disciplinary reasons or early closure of the premises, the immediate circumstances of the action would most likely govern the question of liability. Sending home a student or otherwise would be regarded as too remote to render the school authorities or the teacher liable.  It is unlikely that the question of indemnity cover would arise in such circumstances.</P>

A rationalisation of the educational facilities needs to be considered in the context of the provision of new school premises.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to have discussions in the near future with the school authorities concerned.  In the meantime, I am not in a position to state the number of pupils for whom accommodation is to be provided in the new premises.</P>

      <P>Why is the Minister not in a position to state the numbers?  It is an amalgamation between St. Joseph's school and the vocational school.  The need for accommodation is urgent, as I am sure she is aware.  The accommodation in relation to this school is totally inadequate at the moment.  It is spread out around the town and the pre-fabs are inadequate and coming to the end of their life.  I ask the Minister to give this matter priority in her Department in regard to an allocation.  I ask her if she will indicate now whether she is prepared to make an allocation for this building in the 1984-85 programme.</P>

Taking that political decision brings with it responsibilities as far as providing adequate accommodation for both pupils and teachers in this vast growing school area of County Roscommon is concerned.

Would the Minister not think that in that area alone there is a need for development?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a range of incentives to encourage young people to stay in full-time education beyond the statutory school leaving age, chief amongst them being the scheme of free post-primary education, the school transport scheme and the schemes of grants and scholarships for third level courses.</P>
      <P>As pointed out in the Programme for Action in Education 1984-1987 the joint meeting of EEC Ministers of Education and Labour in June 1983 has led to new emphasis on the provision of vocational training for young people.  The opportunity thus afforded for providing expanded courses of vocational training designed to cater especially for those who would otherwise drop out of full-time education is being followed up in conjunction with the Department of Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that for young persons to stay in full time third level education, notwithstanding such grants as might be available to some, it would still render them to a large extent, if not entirely, dependent on their parents?  Would the Minister agree that the best incentive to encourage young people to stay on at third level would be to make available to them a grant of a sufficient sum to enable them to live independently of their parents?  Would the Minister take any steps in that regard to achieve an improvement in the grant situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the logic of <Col N="276" /> the situation is that such a grant would be an incentive.  The question of giving to all students at third level a financial grant on top of the very large subsidy already existing with regard to third level education obviously has enormous financial implications.  Therefore, it is not something which one could readily consider. As I say, the new emphasis placed by the Ministers for Education and Labour on vocational training for young people may provide some leeway in that area.  I shall be very shortly meeting the Commissioner in charge of that area in Brussels and discussing that and other subjects.</P>

      <P>This is one of the areas that has emerged as a problem in recent years.  The vast increase in the number of young people looking for training courses of a more practical nature has led to a great growth in courses given by AnCO and funded by the YEA and the EEC. There has been a certain amount of overlapping and backing into the educational system.  That sort of problem is one that requires to be addressed and I am sure it will be in the near future.</P>

      <P>The fluoridation of water supplies, which began in July 1964, is now virtually completed in so far as practically all water supplies serving populations of any consequences have been or are about to be fluoridated.  At present 2.1 million people or approximately 61 per cent of the population are in receipt of fluoridated supplies.  Of the water supplies which are unfluoridated, it is estimated that only 3 per cent of the population are served by supplies which are suitable for fluoridation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department and Irish pharmacists are engaged in finding solutions to problems <Col N="316" /> posed by proposals for EEC directives dealing with the free movement of pharmacists, right of establishment and mutual recognition of diplomas within the community.  The purpose of these proposed directives is one which is central to the philosophy embodied in the Treaty of Rome, that is, a unified community where harmonisation of economic and social conditions and free movement of workers between member states exists.  This objective is one which the Government support wholeheartedly.</P>
    <P>Pharmacists understandably have reservations about the implementation of these proposed directives under the diverse regulations governing the opening of pharmacies throughout the community. There is a need for prior co-ordination of the conditions of the practice of pharmacy in all member states. Certain amendments to the draft directives have been suggested by the European Parliament which are intended to meet the problems raised.</P>
    <P>The need for some form of State control over the distribution of pharmacies is a matter which has been raised on many occasions by representatives from the pharmacy profession in Ireland.  The Irish Pharmaceutical Union prepared a report on the licensing of planned distribution of pharmacies some years ago.  Naturally enough no member state would like to see its nationals placed at a disadvantage <i>vis-á-vis</i> their counterparts in other member states.</P>
    <P>However, this whole question of localisation of pharmacies is one which raises many complex and difficult issues.  The concept of professional freedom, constitutional rights to practice and succession and the complex area of corporate law have to be considered.  The extent to which the State should become involved in this matter is one which requires high level discussion to iron out the issues.</P>
    <P>The recent implementation in this country of regulations providing the pharmaceutical society with greater powers of control over the practice of pharmacy will provide them with more statistical information on the current distribution and ownership of pharmacies <Col N="317" /> and on their staffing.  The availability of this detailed information is a necessary prerequisite to any serious discussion on the wider issue of the distribution of pharmacists.</P>
    <P>One particular area where I would like to see the undoubted talents of the pharmacist put to better use is in the area of health education.  Today's community pharmacist is in an ideal position, by virtue of his face-to-face contact with the public, to promote the concept of a healthy lifestyle.  We are all aware of the problem of increasing demand for drugs for every illness, no matter how minor. Health education has a vital role to play in the prevention of the misuse and abuse of drugs.  The pharmacist is a professional who has the respect of the community, and I believe that the public will listen to his advice that there is a healthy alternative to a lifestyle dependent on drugs. Pharmacists have been involved, in recent years, in giving talks to community groups on the problem of drug abuse.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I would like to return to the theme of how our health services have evolved and the broad direction which they may take in the future.  In this context, I would like to make brief mention of the major programme launched by the World Health Organisation entitled &ldquo;Health for all by the year 2000&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The emphasis in this programme, and increasingly among those concerned internationally with the planning of health services, is on the maintenance of the best attainable good health rather than on the cure of sickness.  Attention is focused in a major way on health promotion and primary health care.  The whole concept of health promotion is not entirely new and in many ways it is concerned with changing existing patterns of behaviour which have a damaging effect on health.  Such damage can be inflicted in the short or the long term and the actions of individuals may adversely affect not just their own health, but also that of many other people.</P>
    <P>There is a compelling logic and attraction in the idea that many forms of illness could be avoided through greater consciousness <Col N="318" /> on the part of individuals, and society in general of the possible consequences for health status of particular actions they take.  This is particularly so in the case of illness the onset of which is heavily influenced by one's lifestyle.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to dwell on this point as I feel that the overwhelming argument for prevention is self evident.  The challenge in the future will be to translate these principles of prevention into the practical policies of the health services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesNFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few brief observations on this Estimate which is an important one in that it covers a wide area.  I should like to refer in particular to the care of the aged, a fundamental part of our health service. Unfortunately, although that service is getting better it is not improving fast enough.  In the past we were not too proud of the service for caring for the aged and improvements today are hampered because of lack of money.  The programme for the aged is suffering in most health board areas due to a lack of finance.  In the North-Eastern Health Board area there are long waiting lists for entry to our geriatric hospitals.  While these hospitals are doing a very good job, the waiting lists could be reduced if the home help service was substantially improved.  This service encourages families to keep the elderly at home, and finance is provided for relatives or neighbours to look after the elderly rather than admitting them to our overcrowded geriatric hospitals.</P>
      <P>This is an area at which we should look because if we live long enough &mdash; in our profession it is doubtful &mdash; we may not have anybody to look after us when we get old.  It is then that we will appreciate the geriatric hospitals.  It is better if elderly people can be kept at home and looked after by neighbours or relatives. This will give them the feeling of being wanted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a scarcity of public health nurses and this is one area in which we are falling down.  It is said that we should have one public health nurse to every 2,500 people but in reality the figure is in the area of one public health nurse to <Col N="319" /> 3,500 people.  The public health nurses are unable to cope because they have too much to do and that reflects on the aged and the elderly.  The Minister should look at this area with a view to providing extra money.  There is a small amount of money allocated to the programme for the aged but it is inadequate.  I strongly recommend that more money be provided in this very important and sensitive area.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the dental services are suffering for want of finance. In most health board areas there are hundreds of people waiting for dental services &mdash; adults and school-going children. The reason for this delay is simple &mdash; we have the dental clinics but we do not have the dentists because we are not able to pay them enough.  Dentists earn much more in private practice than they would if they were employed by the health boards.  Therein lies the problem. In the meantime the people, especially our young people, are suffering.  We have to find a way to reduce these waiting lists and provide dental services.</P>
    <P>In our clinics we hear of many cases of people waiting for orthodontic treatment. I appeal to the Minister to look at this situation to see if anything can be done about this problem.  It is easy to be critical but without doubt the orthodontic service, particularly for school-children, is a sham.</P>

      <P>The sooner this Bill comes to this House the better.  If there <Col N="320" /> is anything good in it we will welcome it because the present service is a sham and I hope something can be done about it.</P>
      <P>There is the problem of insured persons needing dental treatment, for example, fillings.  This service is provided by private dentists who participate in the dental treatment scheme for socially insured persons, but this has to be sanctioned by the health boards first.  In most health boards there is a delay of up to eight months before the boards sanction treatment.  This delay defeats the purpose of the scheme.  This is not the fault of the dentist or the patient but of the Department and the health boards.  This brings us back to the fundamental issue of the demand for the service and the inability of the Department to provide the money for the service.</P>
      <P>It is a pity hardship was inflicted not only on the parents but on students themselves by the abolition of the medical cards for them.  That move put the health of those students in jeopardy.  Because of the struggle parents have trying to educate their children today, if second or third level students suffer from ill-health, their health will be neglected because their parents cannot afford to send them to a doctor.  The Minister should not inflict any further defects on the medical card system.  He should leave it alone and, if possible, restore medical cards to the students because while it may be saving money, in the long term it will affect the health of future generations.  There is not much point in having unhealthy young people because one needs to be in the best of health to survive modern day living.  This is an area the Minister should look at.  I am not being political when I say this, but this will be a political issue if there is to be an election.  Whether it is an issue in the European election is another matter.</P>

      <P>We are very dignified on the eastern seaboard and would not know too much about that.  I am more concerned about the health of people than making a political issue of it.</P>
      <P>We have a very good old people's home, St. Joseph's in Trim, which looks after County Meath and parts of County Westmeath.  I would hope that there could be extensions to these homes because they are doing a very good job. They are spotless and the people are well fed and well looked after.  There are waiting lists for these homes and for geriatric hospitals and every Government should give compassionate consideration to providing money for these facilities.</P>
      <P>Some years ago our local hospital, Our Lady's Hospital in Navan, was to come under the hammer subsequent to the Fitzgerald Report.  Fortunately the folly of this was seen by the Minister for Health during the 1977-79 period, Deputy C. J. Haughey, and he decided that the hospital required up-dating because of the changing scene since the report was produced in the late sixties. Through his intervention a fair amount of finance was provided and there has been considerable improvement.  The population in County Meath has risen from about 70,000 in 1971 to in excess of 100,000 today.</P>
      <P>As well as the general hospital we also have an orthopaedic hospital which looks after Counties Louth, Meath, Westmeath, Longford, Cavan and Monaghan. It is an excellent hospital but suffers from the common problem of lack of finance and a shortage of beds.  They are carrying out very successful hip operations which are greatly in demand because of the incidence of osteo-arthritis.  There is a three-year waiting list for such an operation because of the shortage of beds. Three top-class orthopaedic surgeons are working almost round the clock in providing a service for these six counties. The Minister should give favourable consideration to the provision of money for the necessary beds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="322" /> I do not have to remind the Minister that this Government closed down the children's orthopaedic hospital at Coole in County Westmeath.  The idea was to provide beds for these children in the Navan hospital but this has not been done.  Clearly there is a dire need for beds in the north-eastern region which, for the purposes of the orthopaedic service, takes in Counties Westmeath and Longford.</P>
    <P>Many old people suffering from osteo-arthritis of the hip die before the ailment can be treated and it is horrifying to see the pain they suffer.  We have great professional expertise but we are not able to cope with the demand for treatment of this ailment.  Many people suffering from this condition are cripples one month and are dancing a jig the next due to this extraordinarily successful operation.  I speak specifically about the North-Eastern Health Board area but I know there are similar problems around the country. Perhaps the high incidence of this ailment is due to our damp climate.  It appears to be becoming more prevalent and to be affecting lower age groups.  Many of us carry scars from the football field, as the Minister will know.  One of these orthopaedic surgeons in Navan is waiting to do a job on both my knees but I have not time yet to have it done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly.  Most of the people I am speaking about have not been involved in sporting activity to that extent.  I remind the Minister that we had a maternity hospital in Trim which was closed by him last year.  Clearly there is a need for a maternity hospital in the region because of our growing population. Most people in the country use the Dublin hospitals or the Lourdes hospital in Drogheda.  Our population is increasing at the rate of about 3,000 a year because of our proximity to Dublin.  The Dublin maternity hospitals are grossly overcrowded and mothers must leave the hospitals very quickly due to the demand for beds.  In view of the fact that he closed down the maternity hospital which existed in Trim for many years, the Minister <Col N="323" /> should consider providing an alternative maternity hospital in the near future.  People in the area tend to marry very young, the population is rising and the desirability of such a hospital is evident.</P>
      <P>The self-employed have been somewhat discriminated against in the determination of eligibility for medical cards.  The health board seem to ignore even the income figures agreed by the Revenue Commissioners.  Recently at Question Time Deputy Connolly referred to the case of an Offaly family, that case showed blatant discrimination against the self-employed.  The Minister should issue guidelines to the various health boards so as to ensure that commonsense would prevail in relation to accepting the figures of the Revenue Commissioners.  In this area, also, there is the question of farmers' health contributions.  This is a question that is rather nebulous at the moment because of the Supreme Court decision in relation to the rating system for farmers.  Instead of being based on PLV, the health contributions from farmers are based now on income but I understand that in many areas the health boards are having regard to the assessments made by the Revenue Commissioners as to farmer incomes rather than to the actual tax paid eventually.  I understand that another problem in this regard is that many farmers do not receive application forms from the health boards.  All farmers should be included in the scheme but they should be assessed on the commonsense basis of real income rather than on the basis of an assessment made by the Revenue Commissioners.  This is another aspect of the unusual situation in respect of the taxation of farmers in general. It is an aspect that is finding its way into the area of the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the handicapped, we in Navan are very proud of being able to look after people so afflicted by way of voluntary services of the community in providing schools for mildly handicapped and severely mentally handicapped. There is an active rehabilitation unit in Navan.  There are many physically handicapped <Col N="324" /> persons who are not ill in any sense of that word but whose physical handicap is the result of some childhood illness such as polio and who are in mental hospitals.  This should not be the case. There should be available units geared specifically for the needs of the physically handicapped.  It is a serious indictment of our health services that such people be detained in mental hospitals.  This is an age-old Irish problem.  These people are put out of the way as it were into these institutions.  It has been a defect of our society down through the years that such a situation existed but one would hope, now that we are well into the winter of this century, that the situation would be arrested and that the physically handicapped would be accommodated in places designed specially for them.</P>
    <P>The big problem in respect of health matters is that of finance.  There is the difficulty of trying to spread available finances as much as possible.  Apart from the usual health problems that beset a population we now have the enormous problem of drug abuse to contend with. In his speech the Minister impressed on us the size of the drug problem in Dublin. While drug abuse is a problem of great proportion in Dublin it has spread to towns and villages throughout the country. It is frightening to think that in Dublin alone there are 1,500 heroin addicts.  There are probably twice as many experimenting with that drug.</P>
    <P>The enormity of the problem and the complications of it have been brought home to us particularly in the recent past with the abducting of certain people in the city.  This situation highlights the alarming problem of young people finding themselves at the mercy of hoodlums and gangsters.  Another very sad aspect of this whole problem is its link with crime.  As the Minister mentioned, invariably heroin addicts have to resort to crime in order to obtain the necessary money to feed a habit which can cost from £100 to £150 per day.  The only way in which young people can find that sort of money is by robbing not only commercial premises but the homes of people all around this city and elsewhere.  On the Order of Business I heard Deputy <Col N="325" /> Brennan ask the Ceann Comhairle for permission to raise the matter of the incidence of old people being robbed in Sligo.  I do not know whether that situation in Sligo arises from drug abuse but it is frightening that both old and young alike are being robbed.  The increase in this type of crime must be linked with the drug abuse situation.  It is horrifying to think that there is drug abuse among school children.  This phenomenon is not confined to any one sector of society.  I know that a governmental task force has been set up to consider this whole problem but the figures are alarming for such a small country.  We must put a stop to the problem.  Obviously, it is not one that can be eliminated overnight.  One would hope that the Garda task force on drugs are being very vigilant in this area.  Unfortunately the problem has spread to the provinces.  It is a very serious situation and I know the Government are taking a very serious view of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the ophthalmic service.  Again there are always delays.  They may not be of as serious a dimension as the delays in the orthodontic service, but I hope this service can be improved and if money is needed that it will be provided.</P>
    <P>The Minister is trying to ensure that there will be severe cutbacks in all hospital services.  This will give us five-day-a-week hospitals with very limited treatment available at weekends.  We cannot have five-day-a-week hospitals like five-day-a-week boarding schools because staff and teachers are not available to work at weekends.  It would be intolerable to have five-day-a-week hospitals.  I hope the Minister and the Government will reappraise that situation and ensure that it does not occur.  If not, the Minister wants instant deliveries by pregnant mothers, with mothers coming into and leaving hospitals in the one day.  That would be most undesirable.</P>
    <P>There are many problems in the health area which basically take finance to solve. There is not much point in educating young doctors and turning out the best and most efficient medics in the world if we have not got the facilities for them to enable them to look after the health of <Col N="326" /> the nation.  The policy of the Government in relation to the cutbacks which are affecting the health of the nation needs to be re-appraised with a view to providing the finance in the very near future for these essential services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to say a few words about this very pivotal Estimate for the Department of Health.  Despite the straightened times in which we are living, a considerable budget has been approved for the Department.  There is a figure of £1.021 billion approximately made up of a gross non-capital provision of £1,057 million and a capital provision of £55.5 million. In the non-capital area that represents an increase of approximately £30 million on last year's figure.  Despite all the protestations and public manifestations of grief at the degree of the cuts which have been made, that represents a fairly considerable intention on the part of the Government with regard to the provision of very vital services in the health area.</P>
      <P>I should like to record my appreciation of all those involved in the provision of the health services and under the aegis of the Minister and his Department.  I want to pay tribute to the GPs who are working in the field and also to the public health nurses who are doing a tremendous job in looking after the sick and the elderly, and generally putting into effect the final stages of the whole array of services available to the public.  They do a great deal in outlining to the public the scope of the services.  In many cases people are not aware of their entitlement until they are made aware of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Estimate is made up of a couple of main ingredients.  I should like to deal quickly with the general and specialist hospitals.  I am glad to note that in my own constituency of Kildare plans are at an advanced stage for the provision of an up-to-date and extended hospital in Naas.  When the need for funds arises I hope they will be made available.  Reference has been made to the specialist hospitals.  If we want to see an indictment of our society all we have to do is go into some of our specialist hospitals and psychiatric institutions.  In the second last <Col N="327" /> decade of the twentieth century we have people housed in conditions which would scarcely do justice to the nineteenth century. Many of the buildings in which they are housed were built then.</P>
    <P>People who want to get a true perception of this problem should travel to a number of those psychiatric institutions to sense for themselves the degree of hopelessness, the sense of decay, the sense of total and absolute loss and dependency on these institutions, and the total institutionalisation of the individuals. We then begin to recognise the almost total degradation of those unfortunate patients.  It is a shame that at this stage of the twentieth century we have not been able to do more for them.  Some work has been done over the past number of years, but I would like to see a definite programme for the replacement of all of those old institutions over as short a period as possible.</P>
    <P>We would be doing ourselves a great service because, if we have to spend the money in any event, we might as well spend it now and reduce to some degree the misery experienced by some of the unfortunate people in those institutions. I feel very strongly about that subject because, as a member of a health board, I have seen the problem at first hand.  My colleagues and I have seen at first hand the seriousness of the problem.</P>
    <P>In many specialist hospitals we have housed a number of patients who should not be there at all.  I am referring to the elderly or what are commonly known as psycho-geriatrics.  The only reason they are there is that there is nowhere else to send them.  This again is a very sad reflection on our society.  There are people in those institutions who have spent 20 or 30 years there.  They have become totally institutionalised.  If they have any feelings left, they must feel absolutely forgotten. It is obvious that they are totally harmless. They even take a great interest in the very small event of a visiting committee passing through.  It is very sad that such a small event should be such a big event for those unfortunate people.</P>
    <P>There are many psycho-geriatrics in institutions and it is very difficult to care <Col N="328" /> for them when they are among other patients who require a great deal of heavy nursing care.  We would be doing a very great service if we put a programme into operation as quickly as possible which would have the effect of reducing the number of old fashioned and outdated institutions.  I should like to pay tribute to the geriatricians who work for the health services and to acknowledge the wonderful work they are doing in creating the half-way houses and day care centres where patients who some years ago would have been committed permanently to psychiatric institutions now have at least some access to the outside world and the opportunity to meet and talk to the public.</P>
    <P>The public attitude to people in the institutions I have mentioned leaves much to be desired.  I have mentioned this before but it should be mentioned again and again.  For some unknown reason they do not seem to command a great deal of public attention.  Elections are never fought on the conditions in mental hospitals whereas they might well be fought on the issue of students' medical cards.  When one considers the plight of these unfortunate patients it does not say much for society that we have so little regard for them.  After all, there but for the grace of God could go any of us.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate all concerned on the mental handicap unit at Cheeverstown which is to be opened shortly.  Over the last couple of months a great deal of time and effort has gone into outlining the effects of cuts.  We have had scares of hospital beds closing and patients being sent home overnight.  I should like to pay a tribute to the health board with which I am involved who are apparently able to effect the necessary cuts while at the same time giving a very good standard of service.  I am glad to note that there will be no diminution of the service in that area.  I am amazed that other health boards seem to have such difficulty in responding to budget cuts.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to five-day week hospitals.  It seems to be very poor economics to hospitalise people on a Friday when there is little chance of doing anything for them until after the week-end. <Col N="329" /> Patients should be discouraged from entering a hospital on a Friday except in cases of absolute necessity.</P>
    <P>There appears to be an increase in the incidence of tuberculosis.  This is a serious development and perhaps we have become a little complacent as a result of the great strides which were made in eliminating that disease some years ago. Perhaps it is time to take further stock to ensure that it does not become a serious problem once more.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzsimons said that students' medical cards might become an election issue.  I hope that does not happen because we would not be doing the students or anyone else any good by allowing ourselves to be drawn into such an arena.  Possibly it has gone unnoticed that some families who did not qualify for medical cards before this revision may now qualify on the basis of their dependants who include students from whom medical cards have been withdrawn.</P>
    <P>A great number of voluntary bodies are working very hard on behalf of the disabled.  The Wheelchair Association are extremely active and effective in my constituency.  The Minister should ensure, where possible, that the health boards should give favourable consideration to allowing as much funds as possible under the section 65 grants to be devoted to the activities of such organisations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to talk about Cavan General Hospital which brings an almost Pavlovian response when I mention it. The battle has been going on for some time with regard to the most recent attempt to provide us with a general hospital. I understand that in the most recent hearing of a rather odd case where a group of people are trying to stop the building of a hospital, the Minister said he intended going ahead with the building. At the same time, the court case was fixed for May.  What specifically is going on regarding Cavan Hospital at present? Are the planners working on it now?  If so, what kind of instructions did they get from the Minister and the Department of Health?  I should like the Minister to clarify the position regarding the original <Col N="330" /> plans and to ask him if there is any intention of changing them.  If this is the intention, I fear it will cause great delay in starting work.  The House knows &mdash; God knows it has been repeated often enough &mdash; that a certain amount of money has been spent on the site and planning already.  I should now like to get the up-to-date position.</P>
      <P>I do not intend making a case now for the hospital as I have already done so. The officials of the Department of Health and the Minister have accepted the necessity for this hospital.  They inspected the existing surgical hospital and came to the only conclusion that any sane person would come to &mdash; the sooner it is replaced the better.  Its existence, despite the dedication of highly-qualified staff, is a danger to the health of the community.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer also to the parlous position of the handicapped in a certain age group.  We are attempting to cater for the handicapped and, without ignoring the others, I wish to emphasise here the mentally handicapped in all three grades and the difficulty that arises when they reach a certain age in the middle teens.  The Minister referred to this whole area in his speech but this House should be conscious of the serious problem that exists when children have been trained &mdash; and that is a word of flexible meaning depending on the degree of handicap &mdash; for a number of years and then have nowhere to go.  This House, the Department of Health and the Minister would be well advised to consider this problem and to allocate adequate resources to this area.</P>
      <P>On the question of medical cards, I would appreciate it if people at local level &mdash; I do not mean the headquarters of the health boards but I am referring to employees of the health boards in various sub-office areas &mdash; had a little more discretion in deciding cases.  There are cases where, when considered <i>prima facie</i>, the applicant is not entitled to a medical card but local knowledge might indicate that he should be entitled to a card.  Very often the apparent is not the real situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down a question recently about dental services in schools.  I mentioned specifically one school in the mountainous <Col N="331" /> area of west Cavan, namely, Barran national school, and I got a reply from the Minister.  In that area, which includes Corravagh, Killinagh and Barran, there is a grave difficulty regarding access.  It is on top of a mountain and one has to go through Glangevlin Gap to get to it. People find it difficult to get dental services there and if the school service falls down the people face considerable difficulty.</P>
    <P>I was at a meeting last night of Ogra Fianna Fáil in south County Dublin and I found the young people very conscious of the drug problem not only in the areas highlighted but also in other areas.  The Minister is aware of what I am talking about.  The energies of this House and of the Department of Health, apart from the Department of Justice, should be directed towards a major campaign to deal with the drug problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister had his quarrel with the students and some kind of resolution has been reached.  I want to indicate again that the general principle very often conflicts with and inflicts damage on the individual.  I can give the Minister an example of how this can happen.  I refer to the case of a family nearly all of whom went to third level colleges, to the Regional Technical College in Athlone, to university and to the Regional Technical College in Dundalk and whose father died.  One member of the family who is still a student in a agricultural college has developed a skin disease and he happens to be caught by the new regulations. His mother, who is now a widow, is having difficulty in coping with the new and very unexpected situation.  That young man to whom I was speaking is not having medical treatment because he knows his mother cannot afford it.  I will give the Minister details of his case and I hope it is the kind of case where the Minister, despite the apparent, may recognise the real situation and provide him with a medical card.</P>
    <P>I endorse the remarks of Deputy Durkan about TB and the recrudescence of that disease.  I understand that in the older age group there is a danger of this disease beginning to spread again.  As the <Col N="332" /> Deputy said, I do not think it will ever become the menace it used to be but it is something about which we should be on the alert.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few brief words on this most important discussion.  As a society the amount of money devoted to our health services has increased enormously in recent years; in fact, by a factor of ten since 1973.  Inflation played a major part and real spending doubled in those ten years.  However, it is questionable whether the health of our nation bears witness to this fact.</P>
      <P>A simple increase in the amount of money is no longer the answer.  There are a number of services that are no longer essential.  We have to face the fact that as a nation we have gross overbedding and rely too heavily on hospital care.  In my view, we are neglecting the GP service and primary and community based health care.  Unnecessary admissions to hospitals, particularly at weekends, could be avoided by improved co-operation with GPs and by consultation, not by unilateral action or by confrontation.  No one is talking of a five-day hospital, as has been said across the floor of the House; all that is needed is a simple, reasonable approach to the matter.</P>
      <P>It would appear that at the moment morale in the GMS is low.  Many GPs feel alienated from it.  The GP feels he is but the poor relation of the hospital consultant. Branches of the Medical Union are talking in terms of industrial action, even in advance of the report of the working party due shortly.  I appeal to those responsible on both sides to get around the table and resolve their difficulties for all our sakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are hospital-based services throughout the country that are no longer essential in the prevention and treatment of illness.  To mind immediately springs the number of psychiatric hospitals even in my own region of the South-Eastern Health Board where bed occupancy rates no longer can justify the continuation of five such institutions.  The savings in the closure of even one of these &mdash; without any redundancies, only the redeployment <Col N="333" /> of staff &mdash; would finance from our existing allocation of £80 million the staffing and running of a very badly needed paediatric unit in Wexford General Hospital.  This was approved in principle by An Comhairle in October 1982.</P>
    <P>For many years we have had in our hospital a modern and fully equipped maternity unit catering for more than 2,000 births per annum.  The nearest paediatrician is in Waterford and it often happens that instructions have to be given over the phone for the treatment of neonates.  There is a large population under 14 years, all of whom must go to Waterford or Dublin for paediatric treatment or wait for the two visits per month from the overworked Waterford consultants who do all they possibly can.  They join us, as do the Medical Union in Wexford, the medical and nursing staff in our general hospital, all the GPs, Wexford parents and AWCH in Wexford whom I commend for their ongoing efforts, as well as the South-Eastern Health Board, in asking the Minister to sanction the appointments necessary to run such a paediatric unit.  The beds have been provided and we do not ask for any capital expenditure.  At this point I must record my appreciation of the consultants in our hospitals for their generosity which underlines their commitment to our case. At the moment the case is with the Department for approval regarding the financial implications.</P>
    <P>I am often reminded by those concerned with this issue that children do not have votes.  They say they would not have to wait so long for a paediatrician if children had votes.  Cynicism apart, I feel I can rely on the Minister to realise that our case is rationally presented with fully documented facts and figures to substantiate it.  I know I can rely on him to respond positively and soon.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister's promised Green Paper on the financing and organisation of the health services.  I hope pride of place and poll position will be given to primary care and community health care especially in the areas of geriatric services and mental health.  These patients must be cared for as far as possible <Col N="334" /> in the local community as much for their sake as for the sake of the local community.  Shutting away these people in institutions has been a way of avoiding responsibility to those who in our materialistic society do not quite measure up. It has, ashamedly, been the case of out of sight out of mind.  Those who need constant institutional care, our seriously handicapped both mentally and physically, are among the group who need priority in our hospital based services. Very often they, like our children, cannot speak for themselves.  Services for the mentally ill, in particular, have not until recently received the priority due to them.  I welcome the Minister's continued commitment to this group and the commitment of our health boards in this area.</P>
    <P>I would like to commend the work in Wexford of the Association of Parents and Friends of the Mentally Handicapped and their vigilant and constant efforts which have resulted in the completion of the first stage of the residential unit for mentally handicapped adults in Enniscorthy.  The health board are fully behind them and I feel the Minister is also.  The matter is with the Minister for Finance at the moment and I hope it will not be too long before we receive good news in this most important priority area of the South-Eastern Health Board.  We must not allow the quality and dignity of the lives of our mentally handicapped to be affected by Government cutbacks.</P>
    <P>Time is very short and there is a lot more I would like to say.  I would like to paraphrase a recent <i>Irish Medical Times</i> editorial which said:</P>
    <P>Have we in the political arena, the vision and nerve to confront the vested interests in Irish medicine with the painful truth?  At a time of relative scarcity true radical planning is required.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that our proud promises coming into office are not discredited. We eagerly await the Minister's Green Paper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to very briefly draw attention to the existing situation in St. Luke's Hospital in Kilkenny. At a <Col N="335" /> recent meeting of the local health committee, of which I am a member, a surgeon at the hospital, as quoted in the <i>Kilkenny People</i> this week, said:</P>
      <P>The unenviable distinction of having the worst overcrowding of any health institution in the country now belongs to St. Luke's Hospital in Kilkenny. Studies have shown this to be an irrefutable fact.</P>
      <P>This was stated by surgeon John F. O'Grady who described the current situation as appalling with beds continuously in the corridors.  He further stated:</P>
      <P>Attention has been drawn to this fact over a number of years by public representatives and members of the health boards in different capacities and little or no action has taken place.  We have in the hospital also a newly equipped extension for the maternity service. That, because of lack of staff, remains unopened.</P>
      <P>That situation cannot be tolerated.  I ask the Minister to ensure, within the resources available to the South-Eastern Health Board, that every effort is made to deal with it, even if it means the deployment of staff from some other hospitals as a matter of extreme urgency.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the St. Luke's extension programme was dropped but that it has come back into play.  This is an important advance.  I ask the Minister to state publicly that it is his intention to carry out the necessary development at St. Luke's Hospital to alleviate the gross overcrowding there.  I have continuously listened to personnel from the hospital saying that of all the hospitals in the south-eastern region, St. Luke's Hospital in Kilkenny caters for a far greater level of patient intake and because of that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I await the response of the Minister to that demand.  I would like to draw attention to the fact that in the Carlow area, which has a fairly sizeable urban population, there is no casualty service.  This means that people requiring limited casualty treatment may have to travel 30 or 40 miles to a hospital outside the area.  I ask the Minister to make use of the existing hospital facilities and to provide an adequate casualty service for the people of the town and region of Carlow.</P>
      <P>With regard to Ardkeen Hospital I hope nothing will prevent the development of the new hospital in 1984.  I would like to draw attention to the Minister's Estimate speech in which he said that when health contributions are based on profits derived from farming, less expense is actually incurred in earning these profits and that is how the health charges will be calculated in future.  I want qualification in relation to this. Expenses incurred in the promotion of farm profits actually means reinvestment by farmers and for that reason reinvestment should not be a charge for health purposes.  I would like to wish the Minister well.  He has a very ambitious programme and is doing an excellent job.</P>

I expect to have the contractor on site within at the very most two months.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The capital moneys for 1983 are available and I do not envisage any difficulty at this stage with the Department of Finance.  I have taken <Col N="337" /> careful note of the points made by Deputy Avril Doyle in relation to paediatric services for the Wexford Hospital. I assure Deputy Dowling also that I have taken careful note of his observations relating to St. Lukes and in relation to Ardkeen.  I assure him that there will not be any undue delay in the major redevelopment and extension work in this hospital.</P>
      <P>Regarding the debate at large, there is a common thread through the contributions of most of the Deputies who spoke on the Estimates, which relates to the desirability of certain developments within particularly the acute hospitals services, for example, in the area of maternity, paediatric, orthopaedic and dialysis.  I agree with the Deputies that such developments are in many instances both necessary and desirable &mdash; but the essential fact remains that developments in the present financial climate can only take place if the agencies, health boards and voluntary boards concerned, can redeploy resources, dropping unnecessary services or services of a lesser priority. I firmly believe that in many instances they have the capacity to do so and it only requires an objective look at the matter to create a situation in which they can do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding health expenditures generally a number of Deputies referred to the level of funds provided for health services in 1984.  In no way do I want to deny that the allocations for the health agencies are extremely tight and that some reductions in real terms in expenditure on health services, particularly in the hospital areas, must be faced up to.  I would point out, as I did in my Estimate speech, that expenditure on health has grown from £400 million to £1,064 million in the past six years, or from 6.25 per cent of gross national product in 1978 to approximately 7.3 per cent at present.  It is perfectly obvious that it is no longer possible, or even desirable, to maintain and sustain this increasing trend of expenditure into the future.  Consequently, there is an urgent need to evaluate critically all services and to identify ways and means of securing the necessary savings.  I might make the point there that, despite a great <Col N="338" /> deal of ruaille buaille at health board level, as yet, I have not been notified by any health board &mdash; and the first quarter of the year has now expired &mdash; of any redundancy of any health board staff.  I do not know the name and address of anybody, of the 60,000 people employed in the health services, who has yet been formally laid off.  I am not suggesting that they should be but, reading local papers, one would imagine that hundreds of people were being laid off in the health services every day of the week.  Of course that is entirely untrue.  As yet not one redundancy has been notified from any sector to my Department.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that there is considerable scope for rationalisation of certain services and for the redeployment of financial and personnel resources.  Of course this will take time.  Meanwhile we have the immediate problem of aligning expenditure with funds available in the current year.  All the health boards have now reported to me on the measures required to secure the necessary reductions in expenditure.  These include: reductions in pay extras, in the employment of holiday substitutes and the nonfilling of certain vacancies which, while presenting problems, should not give rise to cuts in essential services.  However, some health boards are in the situation in which they consider it necessary to scale down the volume of hospital services through the closure of wards and this is at present being examined.  Therefore I am reviewing the overall situation in the light of the reports I have now received.</P>
    <P>If I may refer to my recent observations regarding the use of public facilities and equipment by hospital consultants I had a meeting recently with a delegation from the Irish Medical Union to discuss various matters relevant to the health services.  One of the questions discussed was the use of public facilities and equipment by consultants in the course of their private practice.  On the question of private fees chargeable by medical consultants, it was agreed that a series of meetings at official level will take place over the coming weeks.  It is expected that these discussions will be completed <Col N="339" /> within the next four to six weeks.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of young nurses who are unemployed, I am aware of the need to improve the job opportunity of young people, particularly those of young trainee nurses.  In order to improve these job opportunities I have decided that a more liberal attitude should be adopted towards the granting of special leave without pay to persons holding permanent appointments under health boards or other health agencies. Instructions are being issued to these bodies informing them that applications by health staffs for special leave without pay for a period not exceeding three years, as a general rule, should be granted and that all employees going on special leave without pay should be replaced.</P>
    <P>I might add that quite a number of nurses wish to go abroad, wish to work in voluntary organisations, or take up some other activities, such as, for example, doing post-graduate work for three years or thereabouts, or leaving the health services for a period without pay. That decision will facilitate quite a number of staff in that regard.</P>
    <P>Regarding the assessment of farm incomes, a number of Deputies referred to the different criteria used in means testing for medical cards, health contributions, income tax and social welfare benefits and to the question of standardising what is acceptable in terms of profit where farmers are concerned.  I would point out that the definition of income for farmers' health contributions is the same as that used for other self-employed persons.  Unlike the procedures relating to the payment of income tax, a deduction for capital expenditure is not allowable for health contribution purposes.  This applies not only to the self-employed, including farmers, but also to the PAYE sector who equally are not entitled to an allowance for capital expenditure.  I do accept that it is necessary to develop an agreed methodology and standard guidelines for assessing farmers' incomes, particularly in the case of persons applying for medical cards. That matter is currently being examined. <Col N="340" /> A number of Deputies raised a number of points about the general medical services and, in reply, I should like to say something briefly about these services. One question Deputy O'Hanlon asked was why the new allowance for old age in the medical card guidelines will apply only from 1 July next.  The rationale behind this is that the next round of social welfare increases will take place in July and the new allowance for old age has been timed to come into force then also. This new age allowance will ensure that elderly person in receipt of the increased maximum rate of non-contributory old age pension will retain their medical cards.  This reflects our concern for safeguarding the special needs of elderly persons. As I said in my Estimates speech, a married couple, aged 80 years or over &mdash; having regard to the new age allowance &mdash; will normally be entitled to a medical card if they have an income of £101 per week or less.</P>
    <P>Regarding the withdrawal of medical cards from the elderly I would presume that Deputies are referring to the fact that persons aged 66 or over who are in receipt of contributory social welfare pensions no longer qualify automatically for medical cards.  I would remind Deputies of the sequence of events that culminated in this policy.  Firstly arising out of the March 1982 budget the former Fianna Fáil Government decided to give medical cards from 1 July 1982 to all the elderly persons in the category I have mentioned.  Secondly, the former Government decided, in October 1982, to revert to the normal position of assessing the eligibility of those persons on the basis of their financial circumstances. Thirdly, on taking up office, I reviewed the situation and decided that medical cards would continue to be issued on the basis of a person's income.  I then conveyed this decision to the chief executive officers of the health boards.  There has been no policy change whatever in that regard since then.  I do want to make it quite clear that no medical card has been withdrawn from any elderly person without giving that person every opportunity of establishing entitlement on the basis of the income guidelines. <Col N="341" /> Another point discussed at length on this Estimate was the question of students' medical cards.  I might add that the policy in relation to students' medical cards has now been clarified for the Union of Students in Ireland and the health boards are proceeding with the task of implementing the provisions of the relevant regulations.  There has been no change whatsoever in the overall position concerning the original regulations made in relation to student medical cards.</P>
    <P>Regarding visiting rates under the general medical services, a further question was raised as to whether the number of visits for persons under the choice-of-doctor scheme had increased during the period 1974 to 1982.  I might point out that the visiting rate increased from 5.51 in 1974 to 6.01 in 1982 and that the trend is definitely upwards.  There are a number of factors which influence the visiting rate, including the needs of patients, and the actions of doctors participating in the scheme.  Of course the number of doctors has increased as has the number of smaller panels.  As a consequence these smaller panels are associated somewhat with a higher than average visiting rate.</P>
    <P>Regarding the exclusion of items under the general medical services scheme the position is that on 1 October 1982 854 products were removed by the former Government from reimbursement under the scheme.  In November of that year 12 of those were restored.  When I came into office I deleted 70 items because they were no longer on the market.  Sixty-three items were deleted because they were for hospital use only.  One hundred items were deleted mainly because they were similar to items already excluded and 96 items were restored to the list. The position has now settled down and overall the position has been effectively clarified.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of private hospitals, I will be submitting proposals to Government for draft legislation in the next few weeks, following which I will seek the observations of all interests concerned.</P>
    <P>In relation to the integration of public voluntary hospitals the suggestion was <Col N="342" /> made that I am going to take over the voluntary hospitals. That is simply not correct. I have no intention of &ldquo;taking over&rdquo;&mdash; to use that phrase &mdash; voluntary hospitals as such.  What I am doing is endeavouring to ensure that the taxpayers' money which at present entirely supports the activities of voluntary hospitals is spent to the best advantage of the community and that the services provided in them form an integral part of the complex of services available from the health board agencies.</P>
    <P>I regret I have insufficient time to respond to Deputies in detail but, in brief, those are my general observations. I thank the Opposition spokesman, Deputy O'Hanlon, and the other Deputies for their contributions in the course of this discussion.</P>
    <P>Question put and a division being demanded, it was postponed in accordance with Standing Order of the Dáil No. 123, as modified by order of the House, until 8.30 p.m. on the next day on which the Dáil sits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter and I am grateful to the Minister for being present to hear what I and others have to say about this ongoing tragedy in connection with the felling of trees on the Dorney Court Estate, Shankill, County Dublin.  I will be approaching this subject on an all-party basis.  This is national tree week and I should like to think that what we are doing is relevant in that context.  I have agreed to share my time with other Deputies in the constituency and so give meaning to my call for an all-party approach to the subject.</P>
      <P>I raised this matter on 6 March by way of Private Notice Question.  I asked the Minister if he was aware:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>...that 200 trees on the Dorney Court Estate, Shankill, County <Col N="343" /> Dublin, most of them in excess of 100 years old and including oak, ash, sycamore, chestnut and Scotch pine, would be felled within days; the action, if any, he intends taking to save and preserve the trees; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    <P>At column 1321 of the Official Report the Minister stated in reply:</P>
    <P>The company applied for a felling licence in respect of 102 trees on 22 December 1983.  A prohibition order was issued in the normal way and served by the Garda on the company. The effect of this order was to prohibit any felling until the matter had been investigated by a forest and wildlife service inspector.  Inspection took place on 9 and 19 January 1984.  The inspector recommended a licence for 33 trees.  These were numbered on the site map.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to develop the answer.  An inspector from the Department recommended a licence.  Did the Department or the Minister authorise the issuing of a licence?  On the one hand, the developer has full planning permission and included in that is the right to fell 102 trees.  However, he cannot fell those trees without a licence under the 1946 Act dealing with fisheries and forestry. Has the developer received such a licence?</P>
    <P>Over 60 trees have been felled.  No later than yesterday a resident, one of the many irate and concerned residents, attempted to block a number of gargantuan vehicles put in by the developer to knock down the trees.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> today there is a report by Mr. Frank McDonald in which the resident said:</P>
    <P>eventually, the gardaí arrived on the scene, but they were told by a representative of the county council</P>
    <P>I do not want to mention his name</P>
    <P>that it was all in order.  He said the developers had permission, but when he was asked to produce a copy, he said it was in the office.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="344" /> There is no such tree felling licence and I hope the Minister will confirm that when replying.</P>
    <P>I raised this matter this morning because of the large number of phone calls I received from local residents late last night and this morning informing me that the developer went in on the site again and continued to fly in the face of legality.  The county council, by the presence of a representative, presided over an illegality.  The developer has full planning permission.  The residents do not object to the developer building homes. There has never been any objection to the development as such, but they object to the felling of the trees.</P>
    <P>Those of us who know the area will accept that it is a lovely linear park belt type area.  It is a tragedy that we should preside over the destruction of these trees.  It is national tree week and we should be preserving or attempting to preserve what will be a heritage for the next generation.  The developer has stated that he will plant a tree where trees are felled but that is not the point.  When we see an old ash, sycamore or oak we recognise that it is irreplaceable.  My children and possibly my grandchildren's generation will never see a fully developed tree on that site.</P>
    <P>Arising out of my raising the matter this morning, the Minister, Deputy O'Toole, met the five Dáil Deputies for the constituency at 12 o'clock this morning. I record my appreciation of his courtesy. He did not hide anything.  He confirmed that at no stage was a tree felling licence granted.  As has already been pointed out, departmental officials may have recommended that a number of trees be removed.  The conflict is that, on the one hand, the local authority are giving permission for the destruction of 102 trees incorporated in the original planning permission and, on the other hand, they appear to take it on themselves to go ahead with the destruction of the trees without communicating with the Department. If that is the case it is a serious vacuum in the law which must be plugged.  I believe the Minister when he told us that the planning permission was given, the licence from the Department <Col N="345" /> was applied for, the application was lodged with the local Garda Síochána and that he received notification of that application on 22 March 1983.  On 3 January 1984 he issued a prohibition order which would allow a look at the application and would allow the application to be processed in the ordinary way.  It would allow the Minister's Department to liaise with the local authority as the planning authority.  The Minister sent out officials from Bray to the site and I understand that the developer requested that 33 trees out of the 102 trees to be felled should be dealt with urgently and on 3 March 1984 the developer felled three trees without permission.  On 5 March 1984 a letter issued from the Minister's Department to the developer stating that he was in breach of the 1946 Act and that any further breach would mean legal proceedings. On 9 March 1984 an official from the Minister's Department met on site with a citizen, who shall remain nameless. He was asked to relodge his application for a tree felling licence for the remainder of the trees still standing.  Subsequent to that another 30 or 40 trees were felled yesterday without the licence, as I understand it.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take action urgently.  I realise that I am going a little over my time on the basis of the agreement that I made with my Fine Gael colleagues in the constituency.  I will let them come in to support my urging their Minister, as he is, after all.  What happened in the past, what interfering councillor from whatever party he came, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour, and what action or inaction was taken is a source of indifference to me.  I am representing my point of view in relation to the trees.  I stand on that and I ask the Minister to regard this matter urgently. If this developer does not conform with the law &mdash; he may be confused in this regard with respect to the gentleman &mdash; then the Minister should issue proceedings against him.  That should be the last resort.</P>
    <P>I think I have spelled the facts out clearly and I ask the Minister to act urgently.  Now I leave the floor open to <Col N="346" /> my colleagues in the constituency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Barrett, Dún Laoghaire) Nuala Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Barrett,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dún Laoghaire):</i> It is unusual for a Minister or Minister of State to speak on an Adjournment Debate but, as Deputy Andrews said, this is not a political matter, it is a community problem that faces us all and is of great importance to anybody who has any interest in our environment.  I am anxious to say a few words because when I was a member of Dublin County Council I was very much involved in getting a tree preservation order placed on these trees.  To say that I was horrified to hear that they are now being lopped is to put it very mildly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the short time available to us, I want to make one or two points.  We have all learned leasons from this sad debacle. Even if the people of Shankill and adjoining areas have lost mature trees that can never be replaced, here is a lesson for the rest of the country in future.  I know, as Deputy Andrews has said, that the Minister is extremely anxious to see to it that action is taken to prevent any further damage.  Our problem here is that a planning permission exists and brings into the question whether a local authority should have power to grant a planning permission where a tree preservation order exists, without prior consultation with the Department involved.  This is where we as legislators come into it.  Where a tree preservation order exists the same obligation should rest upon an applicant for planning permission as does in the case of a Housing Act approval which is necessary. You cannot get planning permission for the conversion of a dwelling into offices, from residential to office, unless prior permission has been granted under the Planning Acts.  Arising out of what we have learned in this instance, the same should apply where a tree preservation order exists, that is that before a planning permission can be granted permission should be sought through the Department of Fisheries and Forestry to contravene the preservation order already placed.  We should see to it that the Department of Fisheries and Forestry are the Department solely responsible for <Col N="347" /> tree preservation.  They should have the power to place a tree preservation order and should be the sole body to decide whether that order should be lifted.</P>
    <P>Therefore, like Deputy Andrews and, I am sure, my other colleagues, I ask the Minister to take the necessary legal action &mdash; I know he is doing this &mdash; to prevent any further damage.  All of us here can leave aside our party differences and, if necessary, agree on whatever amendments to legislation are necessary to see to it that this type of thing never happens again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to record my thanks also that this matter is being taken on the Adjournment because of its urgency and importance.  I welcome the Minister here to reply to this question and I thank Deputy Andrews for allowing all of us to record this as a community matter.  We are all here and involved in this because this is a national issue.  If the kind of ambivalence, to say the least, and at worst the flagrant abuse or lack of licensing laws and of direction from our Department of Fisheries and Forestry continue to be ignored as they are, we shall end up with a devastated, polluted country in which it would be impossible to live, whereas we have been granted one of the most beautiful countries in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to underline our responsibility here as legislators.  Deputy Andrews pointed out that reinforcing legislation is needed.  Deputy Barrett asked if there is need for a provision that no local authority could ever grant planning permission or make any decision regarding the felling of trees without the licence and permission of the Department of Fisheries and Forestry.  If that legislation is needed we should bring it in as an emergency. Above all else we wish to record that an irreparable loss has already occurred not alone with regard to the environment in the area concerned but to the whole ecology of Ireland, not alone to human beings but to flora and fauna.  We have a huge responsibility and until we begin to take our environment seriously and, as legislators, make sure that nobody can ignore <Col N="348" /> or transgress the law in this, then we are not passing on very much to our children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L.T. Cosgrave Mr. L.T. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Along with my colleagues I would like to express my concern about what has been happening at Dorney Court.  I refer first to the preservation order which I have in my hand here.  This must highlight the effect preservation orders have.  If they are to be made they must be given substance and back-up by both the local authorities and the Department.  Also I appeal to the Minister to see that if a felling licence is granted, the trees cut under it will be supervised with the assistance of his officials or local authority officials, or even if necessary to have the Garda present. It appears that the person has been going ahead cutting trees where it is clear that he has not the necessary permission or the necessary licence.  Whatever we can do in the short term to prevent either further felling or the destruction of these trees is to be welcomed.  It will highlight the problem for other areas.  This being National Tree Week, it is appropriate that something like this, unfortunate as it is, should highlight the danger to our trees.  If the Department of Forestry and Fisheries and the local authorities exercised their powers and act in respect of orders which they have made, given consultation between the various bodies, this will ensure that these events will not take place in future.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to use every legal power he has at his disposal.  He should certainly ensure that if further trees are to be felled they will only be felled with total permission and total supervision and that if any are illegally felled appropriate action will be taken.  It must be made clear to people contemplating such action, that they face the full penalties of the law.  It might be necessary even to have the law reviewed in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. O'Toole) Paddy O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. O'Toole)</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, could I say that normally the last thing a Minister wishes is to be drawn in on an Adjournment Debate.  It is one of those things which Ministers do only when they have to. <Col N="349" /> However, in this case I welcome the opportunity of highlighting a matter which I consider to be of serious proportions in that the law is blatantly being disregarded here.  The Deputies who have brought this to our attention, both from the far side of the House and this side, are to be complimented on their swift action.  I have had the privilege of discussing this matter with them today. Unless action is taken in such cases, one cannot stop people from breaking the law without using physical means.  I would hope that we are not engaging in the kind of approach where physical obstacles are the only way in which we can control the situation.  There are other means and I shall mention these in a moment.</P>
      <P>The background to this case is that the local authority, Dublin County Council, granted permission to the developer some time ago, and a provision in that planning permission included permission to fell 102 trees.  That is granted under the Planning and Development Acts. Under the 1946 Forestry Act, a felling licence is required to be obtained by the developer in order to fell trees.  It was not until my Department got notice of an application for the felling of 102 trees that we were aware of such a development, or, indeed, of the implications for us included in the planning permission already granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We proceeded to deal with this application for a felling licence for 102 trees. Having received the application on 22 December last, we immediately issued a prohibition order on 3 January last.  This was purely a preventative measure to block off any destructive approach which might be made by the developer until such time as it could be done legally and if and when we issued a felling licence. The process of examining the application for felling went ahead, in consultation with the local authority, and on 1 March we received a letter from the local authority pointing out that they had no objection to the felling.  Our officials went out from their Bray station and reported back that they could recommend the felling of one section where the developer was anxious to start work on the site.  The <Col N="350" /> Forestry officials recommended that 33 trees could be felled.</P>
    <P>We were still examining this recommendation and on 3 March, 33 trees were felled by the developer without permission being granted under the requisite felling licence.  At that time, Deputy Andrews brought this matter to the attention of this House in the form of a Private Notice Question.  Immediately after that incident, my officials undertook to warn the developer, both verbally and in writing, of his legal position and that he was engaging in illegal activities in going ahead along these lines.  It was suggested that he submit an application for the felling of the remaining trees which were within the planning permission provision.</P>
    <P>Only yesterday, on 21 March, I understand that more than 30 trees were again felled without a felling licence.  Now, there is something amiss here and this is the first time that I have come across a case in which the planning authority &mdash; and I am not speaking specifically about Dublin County Council as this could happen in any local authority area where tree felling is involved in the development of a site for any purpose &mdash; have given permission which included proposals for the felling of trees without the knowledge of the Department responsible for the preservation of trees.  It is only when an application for felling comes along on foot of a planning permission that my Department become aware of such provision in the planning permission.  As has been said here there is a vacuum or a lacuna here which must be corrected, by amending either the planning Act or the 1946 Forestry Act or, possibly, both.  It may very well be that the latter will be the case.</P>
    <P>The House can take it that this matter will be dealt with urgently by me in consultation with my colleague in the Department of the Environment to see what can be done to block off that loophole. Yesterday's incident, of which I have not yet full details, may not be totally illegal in that there is provision, I understand, for the felling of trees without a felling licence if those trees are within 100 feet of existing buildings.  I do not know to what extent this condition <Col N="351" /> was fulfilled yesterday, or whether the felling of trees outside that distance took place.  This matter has to be examined.  It seems that in the case of Dorney Court a certain amount of highhandedness is being indulged in by the developer, despite verbal and written warnings. Without the House pressing me into giving details, I can assure the Deputies that appropriate action is being taken at this very moment in order to preserve trees and avert any further damage to trees on that site.  I cannot be more specific than that, but the House can take it that I have acted with full rigour within the Act and as far as my powers permit.  I hope that that will have the desired affect in this case.</P>
    <P>This is possibly a unique occasion where such an item is being discussed on a non-political basis, purely on a community <Col N="352" /> one, with &mdash; as Deputy Barnes said &mdash; national connotations also.  This type of activity can take place anywhere and at any time.  It is time that we put down a marker as to our intention of protecting the environment, and as a Minister involved in the Department of Fisheries and Forestry I assure the House that I take a very dim view of such an approach by any developers anywhere within the jurisdiction of any local authority.  They will be met with the full rigour of the law.</P>
    <P>I finish by repeating that in order to close off any loopholes which appeared to be raised in this case, I shall not be found wanting, nor will my colleague in the Department of the Environment, in amending our respective Acts to meet the needs of the day.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 27 March 1984.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 400 to 403, 405, 407, 408 to 414, 416 and 417 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned at the level of unemployment <Col N="283" /> in County Wexford and of the need to secure new industry for the county.  I would point out however that the increase in unemployment in County Wexford in recent years has not been influenced significantly by manufacturing job losses.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Industrial Development Authority are taking all possible measures to promote industrial development in Wexford.</P>
    <P>In Wexford town the IDA have available a 40,000 sq. ft. privately financed factory, a 39,000 sq. ft. factory, two units suitable for new small industries and 120 acres of land.  These facilities, which are being promoted by the IDA, also cater for the Rosslare area.</P>
    <P>The IDA have provided a 25,000 sq. ft. advance factory in New Ross by arrangement with a private developer. This facility and IDA's 32 acre industrial site in the town are being promoted for suitable projects.  Over the past two years there were 51 job gains in manufacturing employment in the New Ross area.</P>
    <P>In 1983 a new company was assisted by IDA to establish in the 27,000 sq. ft. factory in Gorey.  Four small industry units of 1,000 sq. ft. will be completed shortly and these will be promoted together with IDA's 12 acre site in the town.</P>
    <P>The IDA have no proposals to acquire industrial land or provide advance factories in Taghmon, Clonroche, Campile, Fethard-on-Sea, Bunclody or Wellingtonbridge. However Taghmon and Wellingtonbridge are in the catchment area of Wexford town where the IDA have made substantial investments.  Similarly Clonroche and Bunclody would benefit from developments in Enniscorthy, and Campile from developments in New Ross where IDA have provided land and factories for promotion.</P>
    <P>The IDA do not own a site at Eidermine. However they have a 19 acre site at nearby Enniscorthy.  Three small industry units of 3,000 sq. ft. each are currently being erected in the town.</P>
    <P>I will arrange for the appropriate Minister to communicate with the Deputy <Col N="284" /> regarding jobs lost in the agricultural services sector if he will indicate what he means by &ldquo;agricultural services sector&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am assured that the IDA will support with their full range of incentives any viable manufacturing or international service projects put forward for the various areas in County Wexford mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

On the basis of the information available to the inspector of taxes, the taxpayer and his wife were self-employed and estimated assessments to income tax were raised on him on this basis for a number of years.  The taxpayer was also in receipt of earnings from employment for some of those years.</P>

The determination of eligibility under the supplementary welfare allowances scheme in any particular case is a matter for the health board having regard to all the circumstances.  In determining eligibility the board would take account of the applicant's other income, if any, and in this case it is understood that in making the payment on 25 February 1984 account was taken of wages paid by the employer on 23 February 1984.</P>

These contributions are not reckonable for disability benefit purposes while the person in respect of whom they have been paid continues to serve as a member of the Defence Forces. Following inquiries it was determined that the person concerned has not been a serving member of the Defence Forces <Col N="303" /> since 19 June 1983, and disability benefit was therefore payable.</P>
    <P>Payment of disability benefit was authorised from 27 January 1984, the first day of incapacity at the rate of £34.80 a week.  In addition pay-related benefit was awarded from 17 February, the nineteenth day of incapacity, at the rate of £25.99 a week.  All benefit payable to the date of the latest medical certificate received has been issued.</P>

      <P>One of the conditions for receipt of contributory old age pension requires a person to have contributions paid in respect of at least 156 weeks of insurable employment since his entry into insurance.  The Department's records show that the person concerned had only 82 paid contributions since the beginning of 1953 and 32 such contributions prior to that year.  Under the regulations the 32 paid contributions prior to 1953 may be regarded as being equal to 48 thus bringing his total number of paid contributions up to the equivalent of only 130.  He does not, therefore, qualify for contributory old age pension.  A copy of his insurance record has been sent to him.  He has been in receipt of a non-contributory old age pension at the maximum rate since 30 December 1977.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): As I indicated in reply to other parliamentary questions on 8 March last, my Department are not directly involved in the holding of competitions for entry to the Garda Síochána or the calling up of candidates and I regret that I am unable to undertake to give information by way of reply to parliamentary questions in relation to the position of individual candidates.  Any such information can be sought by candidates, or on their behalf, from the Garda authorities who will supply details in so far as it may be possible to do so at any particular time but it will be appreciated that such information may not be available.</P>
      <P>In general terms the Garda authorities have informed me that it is intended to commence calling female candidates for medical examination and, where appropriate, oral Irish test, in about two months or so but no final decision has been made at this stage as to the number of female candidates to be appointed from this competition or the length of time the list of qualified candidates will last.  As soon as a final decision is taken in the matter, the Garda authorities will be in touch with each candidate about the position.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The AnCO centre in Wexford town has the status of a temporary training centre and there are no plans to change this at present.</P>
      <P>The welding course is due to end on 12 May 1984 and will be replaced by a light skills course which will include:</P>
      <P>&mdash;light electrical and mechanical assembly</P>
      <P>&mdash;introduction to electronic and electrical assembly</P>
      <P>&mdash;keyboard skills</P>
      <P>&mdash;life and social skills.</P>
      <P>The general engineering operative course is being updated and will include additional modules as follows:</P>
      <P>&mdash;life and social skills</P>
      <P>&mdash;mechanical assembly</P>
      <P>&mdash;machining where necessary, i.e. where a trainee has a chance of a job in machining, he/she will be trained accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The machine room is fully operational at present and its capacity of 26 training places is being maintained but these will be used in a more flexible manner to suit the needs of the area.  The centre will therefore be able to provide a much <Col N="315" /> broader range of courses based on the specific needs of industry.</P>
    <P>The welding facilities are being maintained and they will be used in the future to meet identified needs.</P>
    <P>AnCO have no plans to expand their temporary training centre in Wexford as they take the view that the training needs of the area can be met by a combination of flexible responses available to it including external training and other community based approaches such as the community youth training programme along with access to the regional training centre in Waterford, for which accommodation and/or travel subsidies are available to trainees.</P>
