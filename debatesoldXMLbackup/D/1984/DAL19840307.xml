    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reminded of a statement of our illustrious founder when he was interrupted &mdash; for a different reason of course.  My underlying opposition to this order being made is what I consider to be the cowardice of the Government in running away from these elections.  On a number of occasions during the debate up to now it has been said, with some justification, that local elections have been adjourned on previous occasions.  I do not disagree with that, but I contend that each and every time those elections were adjourned or postponed for a year or so it was for very good and valid reasons.  There is no valid reason why the local elections would not be held in 1984 but that the Government are reluctant to face the electorate in these elections. They are afraid of the challenge.  Previous instances and times of postponing elections and so forth have been mentioned. On the day this order came in the Government voted down our request for the Laois-Offaly by-election.</P>
      <P>It is right to remind some people of the challenge that we in Fianna Fáil took up in 1972 when the mid-Cork by-election was in the offing.  Because the combined Coalition parties were 6,000 votes ahead of us in that constituency they were anxious to have the by-election.  Members will remember that our leader at that time, Deputy Jack Lynch, when asked about a certain item on the agenda replied, &ldquo;What about it?  Will we have it?&rdquo; We took up the challenge and held that by-election and the result is part of history, that Deputy Gene Fitzgerald was elected then, in spite of the 6,000-vote head start of the Coalition parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why do the Government not take up our party's challenge now to hold the by-election?  Why can they not accept the challenge as we did in 1972?  Everybody knows it is because the abhorrence of the general public for the performance of this <Col N="1524" /> Government would surely be manifested in the vote.  The people of the constituency are anxious for this opportunity. Unemployment now at 216,000 is almost unprecedented in our history.  When Fine Gael and Labour came together to form a Government unemployment was at 170,000.  This conglomeration coming together made marvellous promises.</P>
    <P>We were told of decisive action that would be taken in this matter of job creation and rising unemployment.  No action has been taken by the Government in their 15 months in office to eradicate the growing unemployment trends.  One could ask the reason why this has not happened.  I contend that it is because of the diametrically opposite policies being pursued, as is customary with a Coalition Government, of Fine Gael and Labour and people are saying that they have tried four times but this is surely the straw which broke the camel's back.  Like the words of the song, never no more, is the attitude of the people, if they are given the opportunity.  The Coalition Government do not formulate policies but conduct a public relations exercise about policies.  They are never prepared to come before the public and state their objectives openly and honestly.  They preached those at great length during the election campaign.  Subsequently, they made promises to one another and got together to form a Government.  They have let the country down simply to be in Government.  The reluctance to hold the local elections is because of the effect it would have on the Coalition Government if they were held.  The people would show their abhorrence of the lack of performance of the Government.</P>
    <P>It is an established fact that the central issue of our economic and social lives is the frightening level of unemployment and the fact that it continues to rise and is now at the extraordinary figure of almost 216,000.  The full extent of the economic and social damage that this massive unemployment figure causes cannot be underestimated.  It has brought hardship and frustration and is likely to bring massive unrest in the community unless the Government wake up to the fact and do something about it.  It <Col N="1525" /> destroys human dignity and takes away from our massive young population their hopes and ambitions for the future. Despite this, the Government are prepared to slide along leaving the ship of State drifting rudderless without a captain. It is time the Government woke up to the situation.</P>
    <P>It is beyond comprehension why action is not being taken by the Government in relation to capital investment in a programme to help the construction industry. The Minister's budget speech took up 64 pages much of which was undiluted water.  One of the most important basic industries, agriculture, got only two paragraphs in his speech.  The enormous uncertainty of the stalled negotiations in Brussels and elsewhere and the lack of Government support for agriculture is doing great harm to this industry.  The people involved in agriculture and its ancillary industries would like to show their disapproval of the Government. The way to do that is through the local elections.  The Government's policy seems to be to let our farmers fend for themselves.  They are ignoring the role which our natural resource can play in securing economic growth and reducing unemployment.  A new concept is needed for economic management, to give thrust and make clear decisions on where we wish to go and mobilise all our resources. We need good political leadership and economic management to do that but the Government have not got either of those things.</P>
    <P>During the course of the debate a Member on the Government side asked why should we vote for these fellows? That is a very good question.  People have been asking that question and, if they were given the opportunity, they would not vote for the people in Government. They are being denied this opportunity by this order which we are now debating. Reference was made disparagingly that only one party at the 1979 local and general elections prevented their members from contesting the European and local elections.  People making statements like that should check the record and they will find that the same rule applied to Fianna Fáil members as well as to Fine <Col N="1526" /> Gael members.  Our candidates were not allowed to contest the local elections and the European elections on the same day. I am merely stating that for the accuracy of the record lest it be misconstrued that we were adopting another attitude on that matter.  It was sad to have reflective comments made on the members of sub-committees of county councils during this debate.</P>
    <P>It was clear from the 1983 Act, which empowered county managers to levy charges on council services, that the Government intended that their cutback in financial support for local authorities would be made up by dramatic increases in local service charges without any consequent easing of the direct and indirect taxation already imposed by the Exchequer. We did not support the 1983 Act because it replaced rates with service charges rather than supplementing the existing sources of local authority revenue. It has been stated erroneously on a number of occasions that in <i>The Way Forward</i> we advocated the introduction of these charges.  In relation to charges it states:</P>
    <P>Investment in sanitary services is designed to provide a level of water and sewerage services adequate for industrial, agricultural and commercial growth and housing development.  The main emphasis over the Plan period will be on major schemes which convey the largest national benefit in terms of improved infrastructure and serviced land.  In view of the increased investment in sanitary services, it will be necessary to consider imposing realistic charges both on individual users of sanitary services and developers so as to recoup part of the cost.  This matter will be examined in the context of legislation to empower local authorities to charge for services generally.</P>
    <P>There are many homes without water supplies or sanitary services.  It is reasonable to expect that in order to provide such people with these services a development charge should be levied.  Water and sanitary facilities are basic necessities. From 1977 Fianna Fáil Governments <Col N="1527" /> gave 100 per cent grants in lieu of rates. The first chopping of that was done under the Coalition Government's Estimates which included a figure of £65 million to be raised by local authorities to make up for the reduction from 100 per cent grants to 91 per cent grants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I respect the Chair's observations and I will do my best to comply with the direction.  I raise these matters because they all hinge on the fact that the local elections are not being held. We know from the attitude of the people during the Dublin Central by-election who they hold responsible for the charges.  More importantly, they now realise &mdash; the more often we tell them the better &mdash; that the reason for the charges was not to extend services to people who did not have them but to make up the shortfall as a result of the Coalition Government's cutback from the 100 per cent grant in lieu of rates.  This is another reason why the Government are unwilling to face the electorate.  Hence we have this order before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I condemn the pious resolutions about reform.  This has been given as the reason why the local elections are being put off but if the proposed reform bears any relation to the 1983 Act introduced by the Government then we had better warn the people, particularly local authority councillors.  The 1983 Act gave the manager power to bring in service charges rather than giving the power to the local councillors.  We were very concerned about this attack on local democracy.  We must highlight the detrimental affect of the Act so that the public can understand the damage the Coalition policies are doing in this area.  That is why I would be interested in the proposals the Government bring in in their so-called reform of local government.  If what they brought in is an indication of what we might <Col N="1528" /> expect, the local elections might not be held for another few years.  If they have any ideas about that, they had better think again because they have done enough damage.  If they want suggestions about reforming the structure of local authorities, members of local authorities could give them some.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is still a member of a local authority and must be aware of the position of elected members.  The attempt to put off the local elections is regrettable and unacceptable.  The Government are very reluctant to hold them.  Nobody would blame them for doing another U-turn.  They have done a few already so one more will not make any difference.  I urge them to reconsider this matter and hold the elections.  We never stood back from a challenge.</P>

      <P>We are challenging the Government to go out and face the electorate at the local elections.  The Coalition have been in Government for 15 months and have not done anything except damage the economy.  They have not put forward any policies or proposals which might help to generate employment. The construction industry is at its lowest ebb since the Coalition Government dragged it down in the fifties.  Agriculture has been treated with contempt and the unemployment figures have risen to the totally unacceptable level of almost 216,000.  There is a lack of creative incentive to fund our social services such as health and education.  Why are all these services being left short of money? Because we have a Government that has failed to generate economic drive, wealth and well-being.  In the words of one of their former members, they are a thundering disgrace and it is time they faced the electorate in local elections which would be a barometer of their popularity. We are appealing to the Government to do something instead of letting the country drift aimlessly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L.T. Cosgrave Mr. L.T. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In noting the decision of the Government to postpone local elections to allow thorough examination <Col N="1529" /> of the structure and financing of the local government system to be completed, we have to ask if local government is facing difficulties at present and if we have problems in relation to its structure?  The undeniable answer is that we do, and the sooner the problem is tackled the better.</P>
      <P>Many councillors are members of corporations, county councils or urban councils.  Some are Members of this House, although the majority are not, and year in year out they face many problems. They give great attention to their own communities and they work long hours for very little reward.  They are subjected to abuse and taunts that they are not doing their job properly when in many instances their hands are tied by central government or by officials in various Departments or local authorities.  It is quite clear that changes are needed.</P>
      <P>In relation to the postponement of the elections it is clear that changes are long overdue.  White Papers have been published in the past but nothing has been done about them.  Postponing the local elections for a year is not going to prevent the people from being given the opportunity to pass an interim judgment because they will be given that opportunity in the Euro elections.  Perhaps there will also be by-elections which will give people a further opportunity to express their opinions.  Perhaps the results will be unfavourable to the Government as has happened in the past, but at least they are facing up to their responsibilities. More and more people recognise that they are doing a good job in difficult times.  Mistakes have been made, but what Government have not made mistakes? After the debacle of the various deals in the previous administration, at least this Government are dedicated to their task and and prepared to face up to their responsibilities.  They will govern until 1987 and will then be prepared to stand on their record.  It will be up to the public at that stage to give them a further mandate if they so desire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to have a stable Government over the next few years.  There are many problems to be faced and postponement for one year for very necessary <Col N="1530" /> reform is to be commended and indeed urged.  There are many problems facing local government in relation to its structuring and financing.  It is only by a combination of effort all round in trying to solve these problems that we will have any success.  The Minister in his speech last week indicated that the review was under way and that he was meeting various bodies.  I do not know what stage the review is at now, but perhaps he will tell us that later and perhaps outline the Government's proposals in relation to reform.  I hope we will be able to help him in this regard.</P>
    <P>Domestic rates were abolished pursuant to the 1977 Fianna Fáil manifesto. The public accepted it, as rates were an inequitable burden.  However, did anybody ensure at that time that there would be enough money to make up the deficit to local authorities?  Where was the extra money going to come from?  It is interesting to go back to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to refer briefly to the need for reform.  The fact that local authorities are experiencing financial difficulties goes back to the time when rates, which were the main source of income, were done away with.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the speech of the Minister for Finance, then Deputy Ryan, in 1977 in relation to rates relief.  He stated:</P>
      <P>The Government have been giving sympathetic consideration to the problem of rates on domestic property.  The rates bill is a significant part of the average family budget and indeed there have been demands from some quarters for their complete abolition. Complete abolition would cost over £60 million in 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He went on to list the increases in various forms of taxation which would be necessary to finance this measure.  The White Paper published by Fianna Fáil stated that rates could not be replaced without increasing income tax by 14 pence and <Col N="1531" /> they did not accept the idea of imposing new taxes to replace rates.  That was Fianna Fáil policy prior to 1973 but in 1977 they abolished rates overnight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair must be consistent.  I cannot allow a full dress debate on the removal of rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L.T. Cosgrave Mr. L.T. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a need for reform in relation to structure and also in relation to finance and this postponement is in order to allow the reform to be effected.  The then Minister for Finance adopted a phased approach and there was a partial reduction in rates. Had that approach been continued local authorities would not be facing the financial problems which necessitate reforms.</P>
      <P>The local authorities in Dublin city and county and the Borough of Dún Laoghaire are facing many problems and the necessary finance must be provided. None of us would want to see councillors dictated to by ministerial order and deprived of their independence.  It is clear that the Exchequer cannot bear the whole burden of financing local authorities. Grants and subventions from central funds have not been keeping pace with inflation.  People will have to pay a certain amount towards services, and water charges have already been introduced. They are paying so much already in personal taxation that other ideas must also be considered.</P>
      <P>There have been various suggestions relating to local taxes and lotteries.  While a lottery might be successful in an urban area such as Dublin, Cork or Galway it is doubtful whether a lottery in a rural area would cover even administrative costs.  The Minister might say what possibilities are being considered by the Government.  In some American states taxes are raised on certain items and these taxes are retained in the local areas. Here taxes such as road tax and property tax go into central funds and are not available locally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>We must look at the whole question of raising finance for local authorities, whether by direct or indirect taxation, by local charges or by lotteries.  In 1977 rates were abolished without any clear thought as to how finance for local authorities would be forthcoming.</P>
      <P>Many areas around Dublin, such as Tallaght and Finglas, have grown from being villages some years ago into minitowns. It is unreasonable to expect councillors to represent many thousands of people and look after all the problems of these areas.  There must be a restructuring of the Dublin county area.  Thought must also be given to the provision of facilities such as shopping centres and leisure centres and houses should not be built where these facilities do not exist.</P>
      <P>There is also the problem of itinerants in Dublin city and county.  We must first identify what we mean by itinerants. There was the old type of itinerant who generally got around and was never too well off but there is now the new higher class breed of itinerant who to a certain extent lives outside the law, does a tremendous amount of dealing and does not want to settle down because it would not suit his lifestyle.  The bulk of them probably do not pay tax of any sort.  Many people want to do something about the problem but nobody wants to tackle it firmly.  It must be tackled at ministerial and regional levels.  Itinerants are hopping around south county Dublin from one estate to another and being encouraged in certain cases, including one in my own constituency where there are dubious circumstances as to how they arrived on an open space.</P>

      <P>This is a matter which must be part of local government reform.  I would hope that my comments would be considered by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other problems relating to the water supply.  Many areas have very low water pressure because of new developments <Col N="1533" /> which have taken place.  Existing reservoirs have been expected to cope with an expanded network and problems have resulted in many areas.  All these matters must be thought out in advance of developments taking place.  Another matter which has to be looked at is the problem about finishing estates and the burden this creates for local authorities. Various fly-by-night builders&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I hope that the local government reforms to which I have referred will be considered by the Minister. He indicated that a review was under way.  I do not know how far it has gone.  This review is long overdue.  I hope the Minister will make as many proposals as possible, and that they can be implemented when councillors are seeking reelection in approximately 16 months.  It is important that we do not abdicate our responsiblity.  Policies must be adequately thought out.  There are many problems to be faced.  Councillors should be given a fair chance and they should be rewarded for their dedicated work.  We need many reforms, including the extension to them of certain facilities.  It is too much to expect councillors to carry on working without getting at least some reward and getting a fair crack of the whip.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bulk of the local authorities are running deficits at the moment.  The public are now beginning to understand what <Col N="1534" /> the facts are.  Rates were abolished overnight and money has to be found somewhere else.  Reform is needed on the financing front.  This will be very difficult. The Minister said there is no simple solution.  That is the case.  Money cannot be found easily.  We will have to go back to the taxpayer again if we are to provide a certain standard of services.  We have to ensure that the local authorities can carry on and, to a certain extent, be self-financing.</P>
    <P>Dublin County Council should be broken down into committees or areas. There is no point in having councillors from Finglas looking at the problems in Shankill or vice versa.  They should be able to deal with their own areas and come together to make major decisions on general policy.  Councillors should be responsible for problems such as zoning in their own areas.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will keep in mind what I have said.  When he is replying perhaps he might indicate at what stage the review is, and whether it will take into account the financing element of the restructuring of local government, and the various other problems I mentioned such as tree preservation, water problems, planning and finishing of estates, itinerants, and so on.  This review should be completed as quickly as possible.  The elections are being postponed for one year, but the public will still have an opportunity to go to the polls in June of next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal to cancel the local elections this year is objectionable on a number of grounds.  The manner in which the announcement was made was objectionable.  On 23 December, two days before Christmas, when the Dáil was in recess and most people were concerned about other matters, a brief announcement was made that the local elections would not be held in 1984.  That was the second occasion on which a similar major announcement was made prior to the Christmas holiday.  That showed contempt for the people and for their right to know what the Government are doing and why they are doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also objectionable on other <Col N="1535" /> grounds.  The right of the people to elect local councillors to represent them is an important aspect of our democratic system. To fiddle around with it simply because it is expected that because support for the Government parties has fallen and they are likely to lose seats shows contempt for the ordinary people. The reason put forward for the cancellation of these elections for a year, or possibly two years, is that local government needs to be reorganised.  Re-organisation will entail structural re-organisation and presumably financing re-organisation. That is a major undertaking.  We are told that a review of what needs to be done is still in progress.  That review has been in progress for at least ten years.  Various Government bodies, State agencies, political parties and local organisations have been making recommendations and studying the whole question of re-organisation of local government for at least ten years and possibly longer.  There is a report going back to 1945.</P>
    <P>For any Minister to say he will reorganise local government between now and June 12 months is deliberately trying to mislead the House and the people.  An amount of legislation has been promised apart from legislation on local government reorganisation.  The Criminal Justice Bill is still being dealt with.  It has still to go through Committee Stage.  That is a major Bill.  We have the Social Welfare Bill and the Finance Bill.  The Minister for Health has promised us a family planning Bill.  He has also promised us a children's Bill.  Other Bills are to come before the House dealing with illegitimacy.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to have to intervene but I think I heard the Deputy saying the Minister deliberately misled the house.  To say he misled the House is one thing but to say he deliberately misled the House is another.  That is not in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to imply anything improper in regard to the Minister. I withdraw the word &ldquo;deliberate&rdquo;. However, it is my contention that the <Col N="1536" /> Government are misleading the House &mdash; it may be that they are not doing so deliberately; they may not know what they are doing &mdash; in the claim that re-organisation of local government can be carried out between now and June of next year.</P>
      <P>The amount of legislation promised between now and June 1985 cannot be processed in that time.  It will not be possible to deal with legislation in regard to the reorganisation of local government in that time.  Another argument put forward for cancelling local elections was that the elections to the European parliament were too important to be cluttered up with local elections on the same day. We were told that if local elections were held on the same day the importance of the elections to the European Parliament would be reduced.  We were told it was necessary to give the European elections a clear run so that people would have a better understanding of what is involved. However, last week the Government voted down a proposal to hold the by-election in the Laois-Offaly constituency on the basis that it would be better to hold it on the same day as the elections to the European Parliament.  We have also been told that there will be a referendum on the extension of voting rights to citizens of other EEC countries on the same day as the elections to the European parliament.  Therefore, the Government's argument in regard to the importance of the EEC elections and not holding local elections on the same day is a spurious one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason the Government want to postpone the local elections is that they are afraid of the electorate, afraid that they will lose power on various local councils and corporations.  I have no doubt that if the Government had an opportunity, or could do so, they would postpone the elections to the European Parliament also.  Obviously, they do not have the power to do that.  One of the major problems in regard to the area of local government and one of the reasons for the crisis in that area is the manner in which the finance of local authorities has been reduced over the years.  A promise was made in the House when domestic <Col N="1537" /> rates were abolished that the Government would meet the rate made by local authorities but that has not been kept. As the Minister of State is aware, Dublin Corporation received an increase of less than 1 per cent this year from the Government in lieu of rates.  In effect in real terms that represents a cut of 9 per cent.  At the same time local charges are being imposed in an attempt to bridge the gap between what the Government ought to be providing to local authorities and what they are giving.  Local charges represent double taxation.  Charges are being imposed on people for services paid for in PAYE tax.</P>
    <P>If the Government are unable to meet the needs of local authorities from general taxation it is within their power to reform the taxation system and bring into the tax net those sections of the economy that are not paying their fair share in taxes.  The question of whether the reorganisation or reform of local government will eventually introduce some form of local tax is a separate issue from that of local charges.  It is important that it is made clear in the House that the vast majority of people are rejecting the local charges because it is a form of double taxation.  They are very angry about them.  The proposal by one of the partners in the Coalition to introduce a land tax has not been taken up by the Government yet.  There is still time for those Members to do that in the Finance Bill. such a move would obviate the necessity to impose local charges.  The loss of finance to local authorities as a result of the abolition of farm rates is one of the major causes of the shortfall in funds to such bodies.</P>
    <P>The need for a reorganisation of local government is evident to all those involved in politics or local affairs.  It is a major undertaking and I am convinced that this time next year the Government will be telling us that they will have to postpone the local elections for another year because they have not had time to complete their discussions, reviews or consideration of their proposals.  I have no doubt we will be told that it will be 1986 before we can have the local elections. Reorganisation is needed and there <Col N="1538" /> is no reason why the local elections due to take place this year should not go ahead in conjunction with the elections to the European Parliament because reforms suggested by the Government later can be implemented.</P>
    <P>On the question of local government reorganisation I should like to point out that the constituency, I represent, Dublin North-West, has two major urban areas, the Finglas and Ballymun areas.  Finglas has a population in excess of 50,000 people which is the same, or even slightly more than, the population of the city of Limerick.  However, Finglas does not have anything like the facilities or representation the city of Limerick has.  When the Minister is dealing with reorganisation he should consider establishing local district councils in areas such as Finglas, Ballymun, Tallaght, Ballyfermot and all those villages that have blossomed into small towns on the periphery of Dublin city.  In that way local democracy will become effective and people will feel they have local representatives to deal with the problems of their area.</P>
    <P>In my area we have the ludicrous situation of Finglas, for electoral reasons, being split down the middle.  The boundary line runs through the middle of Finglas village and people who represent Finglas West cover Cabra and Glasnevin, while representatives for Finglas East cover an area as far as Artane.  As far as I am aware only one of the local representatives of the nine involved live in either of those areas.  That is not satisfactory from the point of view of people who require representation.  I urge the Government to re-think their decision to postpone the local elections, and to hold them at the same time as the elections to the European Parliament.  I appeal to the Government to proceed as fast as possible with the reorganisation of local government and not to use spurious arguments simply to avoid a contest.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the contributions this morning I feel I must respond because a great deal of the discussion seems to be taking place in a vacuum almost and we are not really getting on with the job we were elected <Col N="1539" /> to do.  Some of the points made must be answered.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his opening statement said the reason for the postponement of the elections was to permit a thorough examination into the structure and financing of the local government system to be completed before the next local elections.  Deputy De Rossa and others cast doubt on the Minister's reasons.  All I can say is that local government reform was part of the Government's programme 1981-1986.  As secretary of the Fine Gael backbenchers committee I can tell the House that our committee has been looking at the problem of local government reform in recent months and the Minister is aware of that.  The Seanad also has indicated in recent times that there is need for reform in many areas of the local government system because of changes generally.  Some speakers have indicated some of them.  Deputy De Rossa indicated some of them.  What amazes me is the huffing and puffing which is going on on the Opposition benches because of the postponement of the elections.  But the Opposition party postponed the elections on two different occasions in 1965 and again in 1972.  On both occasions they were postponed for two years.  Now they are carrying out their usual window dressing tactic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One reason put forward by some speakers was that the Government are afraid to face the electorate because of the grave unemployment problem and the problems facing the agricultural industry.  This could not be further from the truth.  We were accused of cowardice by one of my colleagues from Cork.  In a particularly bitter speech he went back into the past, into matters that are best forgotten.  The elections are not being postponed because the Government are cowardly and afraid to face the public.  If one looks at our record over the past 15 months one can see how very positive the Government have been in their attitudes to the grave problems facing the country. Taking the area with which I am most familiar, unemployment in Cork city and county is high but the rate of unemployment <Col N="1540" /> is decreasing now compared with 1982.  That is of course, no consolation to those who are still unemployed.</P>
    <P>Nobody is above criticism where this problem is concerned.  To say one particular party can be blamed for the unemployment problem is totally dishonest and the efforts made by the Government to tackle the problem of unemployment are laudable.  I have no doubt the public appreciate the efforts that have been made and are being made to solve the problem.  It is a problem which did not come into existence overnight.  Unfortunately the public seem to expect the Government to do everything and, more unfortunately still, Government efforts are not at times complemented as they should be by other bodies which could be active in job creation.  The problem can only be tackled successfully by the combined effort of all interested parties.  That is not the evolution at present.</P>

      <P>The performance of Government councillors throughout the country and in the Cork region in particular is nothing to be ashamed of.  In Cork over the last five years we have been active in carrying through the land use and transport scheme and at the moment we are involved in a review of the progress of that scheme.  Deputy Cosgrave mentioned the problems facing local authorities&mdash;massive deficits, unfinished estates and so on.  But these problems will continue until such time as we get real reform.  People should judge the performance of councillors by their commitment to resolving the problems that exist. It is on those grounds performance should be judged and not on the cosmetic politics we have experienced in some recent years.  The Government have achieved a great deal over the last 15 months and we will stand on our record in any local elections.  We have dealt with issues which were utterly ignored by previous <Col N="1541" /> administrations, to their shame. The Government are dealing with the increasing crime rate through the Criminal Justice Bill.  We have tackled the reform of the Dáil and the committee system is working satisfactorily.  Where the environment is concerned the Government have gone from a situation in which there was complete connivance with Britain on nuclear dumping to an independent active opposition to such dumping.</P>

      <P>I was giving reasons to show why we are not afraid to face the public. I expect the local elections will be held in 1985 and the public will then give their full support for not only policies at local level but Government policy generally over the years in which we have been in Government.  The public have the ability to differentiate between popularity and good government.  They recognise that the present Government are taking action to tackle the major problems.  We cannot expect to be popular because some of the actions we are taking are affecting people's lives but in the long run they will be for the benefit of the public.  They can now differentiate between positive Government and the type of politics we have had in recent years and when we face the local elections in 1985 we will get a positive response from the public.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this motion.  It is very unfortunate that the time of the Dáil has to be spent discussing an order of this kind. The postponement of the local elections is wrong because it is depriving the people of an opportunity to select and elect the people to represent their interests on the various local authorities over the next five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concept of local government is suffering as a result of this postponement. The Government are not prepared to recognise that it is important to hold local <Col N="1542" /> elections regularly.  The contributions of local authority members have been under-estimated for far too long.  These people work in a voluntary capacity as members of local authorities, various sub-committees and statutory bodies. They represent the interests of the people in their area and, as I said, it is very unfortunate that the voluntary effort of these people has not been getting the recognition it deserves.</P>
    <P>Local government is the cornerstone of our economy because in some way it affects the daily lives of every man, woman and child from the time they get up in the morning until they go to bed at night.  The postponement of these elections is diminishing the status of local authorities and their members.  The general administration of local authorities has a profound influence on the affairs of the nation and on the people who make up the population.</P>
    <P>The provision of houses, whether private or local authority, is of prime importance to local authorities.  From the day planning permission is lodged the local authorities are involved with all the decisions that have to be taken.  The time has come for the Minister to take a look at the unnecessary bureaucratic duplication which exists between local authorities and the Department of the Environment. There is an enormous amount of public money wasted in this area.  Local authority and Departmental officials are doing much the same type of work, yet the speed of communication and decision-making are hindered because of the system we operate.  Plans for particular housing schemes are going from the local authorities to the Department with monotonous regularity.  If a Departmental official decides that the plans need to be looked at, they are sent back to the local authorities and the engineers and architects spend more time examining them.  Again the plans are sent to the Department and if further changes are necessary, they are returned to the local authorities.  In this day and age we should be able to eliminate this type of unnecessary duplication.  The method of decision-making in this area needs to be up-dated.  This would eliminate the enormous <Col N="1543" /> wastage of public money which we see at present.  This to-ing and fro-ing of plans must add to the administrative costs of the housing or sewerage scheme concerned.</P>
    <P>Since this Government took office there have been very serious problems in relation to the payment and general operation of the house improvement grant scheme.  Recently I learned of an old lady of 73 years who lived alone.  Her son had emigrated a number of years ago but came home on holidays and realised she had neither sewerage facilities nor water supplies.</P>

      <P>I wanted to tell the Minister of State of a case which would be of particular interest to him.  This son proceeded to carry out the necessary repairs and development work to the house.  He then found out he would be entitled to a house improvement grant but that was refused by the Department.  Under a democratic system that type of thing should not happen.  The probability is that if that old lady of 73 years were to remain in that environment eventually she would have to be moved to a geriatric hospital and this would mean considerable expense for the State.  We should have the necessary flexibility and understanding in the application and operation of these schemes to ensure that this will not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an ideal opportunity to refer to the serious situation that has arisen in <Col N="1544" /> relation to the financing of local authorities. Louth County Council find themselves £2 million in debt and the money required is not forthcoming from the Department of the Environment to keep the ordinary services in operation in the county.  I am afraid that if local authorities are not given the funds they need many of them will go broke.  The local government system will grind to a halt and the services provided by local authorities will be abolished.</P>
    <P>In these very difficult times there must be a responsibility on the Government to provide funds to ensure that local authorities have the finances to carry out, and to expand where necessary, the services people have come to expect as their right. This Government are reneging on their responsibilities in this matter.  We had the abolition of rates some years ago and all the parties agreed they were an unfair system of taxation.  The necessary moneys were to be provided in the interim by the Department but this Government have decided that they will not operate that system.  They propose to throw tax equity out of the window.  Under the local government legislation passed last year the power will rest with county managers and the local authorities to raise by local taxation the money they need to operate services.</P>
    <P>This does nothing for tax equity.  Considerable difficulties have arisen throughout the country with regard to the collection of service charges and what is happening will not benefit the local authorities.  The Minister will have to examine this matter again and realise that the money required by the local authorities for the operation of services must come from central funds.  Louth County Council decided at their estimates meeting last Monday to seek a meeting with the Minister to discuss their problems, particularly the fact that they are £2 million in debt.  I hope the Minister will meet them and discuss their problems and agree to provide the necessary money. The local authority must be given the funds to enable them to function for the coming 12 months.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to disagree with the Chair but much of what I have said relates to the operations of local authorities.  I am a member of a local authority and these are the problems that face us.  However, I will not dwell on them to a great extent because we will have the opportunity tomorrow to talk about such matters in more detail.  I will try to confine my remarks on the subject to a passing reference.  This year Louth County Council were promised an increase of 3.7 per cent but other local authorities have got in excess of that amount.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, the Deputy is moving away from the central theme of the motion before us.  As the Deputy has pointed out, there will be an opportunity tomorrow for him to indicate his concern with regard to allocations for housing and roads.  I would be grateful if the Deputy would confine his remarks to the matter before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the Chair will not allow me to dwell on these points. It is my belief that elections, whether they be in respect of local elections or the European Parliament, provide an opportunity for the people to judge the performance of their representatives. Obviously people will judge that performance on the basis of the activities of the local authority in their area.  If progress is not made with regard to, for instance, group water schemes or housing schemes it is inevitable that the blame will rest on the shoulders of the public representatives in the area concerned. Most members of local authorities put a tremendous effort into their work on behalf of the people whom they represent. However, it is an unfortunate fact of life that the financial constraints imposed by the Minister will determine to a great extent the success or otherwise of undertakings of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the postponement <Col N="1546" /> of the local elections was for the purpose of giving him an opportunity to examine the whole operation of local government but that is no more than a smokescreen.  At the moment we have an administrative structure that provides for a development plan every five years in a local authority area.  Such a plan provide the guidelines within which a local authority will function.  I cannot accept that the Minister wishes to postpone local elections for 12 months in order to restructure local government.  The local elections could have been held and where the people considered that new representatives should be elected they could have actively participated in any restructuring proposals the Minister might bring forward. If the necessary political will is there on the part of the Minister to give the go-ahead, that will determine the success of local authorities in their activities.</P>
    <P>I believe the time is right to consider the possibility of joint ventures with the public sector and community groups.  For many years we have had in operation group water schemes and this has been most valuable in the development of our infrastructure.  Those schemes are joint efforts by the local community, local committees, local authorities and the Department.  They have been one of the success stories of local government.  I hope that the possibilities in this area will be explored further.  Housing co-operatives are a relatively new idea here which has not attracted the attention it should. The involvement of local public representatives in some areas has helped these co-operatives to some extent but their range of activity could be broadened considerably if a number of measures were introduced to help them along the way. The possibility of increased house grants under this&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy, I have tolerated several passing references. You yourself have admitted that you will have an opportunity tomorrow to refer to different aspects of the Department of the Environment.  We are dealing specifically with a proposal to postpone local elections and I appeal to you to <Col N="1547" /> confine yourself to debate on that subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come back to that, but I want to finish the point I was making in relation to housing co-operatives.  I ask the Minister to consider the possibility of giving increased grants to participants in these housing co-operatives and to explore the possibility of AnCO and their apprentices becoming involved in this area.  A shot in the arm could do a great deal for much-needed housing for those who are unfortunate enough to live in mobile homes and perhaps have one or two children.</P>
      <P>To come back to the question of the local elections, it is very unfortunate that at this time the Government should take a decision to postpone them for the next 12 months.  The down-grading of the role of the local authorities has been cultivated in the minds of the people by that postponement.  People will see that decision in the context that the Government feel that local elections are not really essential in the running of the country, that people who have been members of local authorities for many years can continue to serve and that perhaps the opportunity should not be afforded to new members to come on to local authorities with fresh thinking, ideals and outlook generally.  That they should not be allowed the opportunity to put their names on the ballot paper and let the people pass judgment on them.  That is a great indictment of the Government's action in postponing these elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no reason why the local elections cannot be held.  The European elections will be held in June and we may have a referendum then also, and no great extra cost would be involved in holding the local elections on the same day.  We must conclude that behind the decision is the Government's fear of allowing the people to pass judgment on their performance in government over the last 16 months.  Perhaps it would present an ideal opportunity for people to say: &ldquo;We are dissatisfied with the type of policies being pursued, with the lack of cohesion, lack of direction and lack of <Col N="1548" /> proper encouragement to the people of the nation to look to the future and to haul ourselves out of the difficult economic situation we are in.&rdquo; The policies being pursued are only discouraging people, telling them that they must pay up, that taxation will be increased, that expansion and employment creation will simply have to wait, that if we have over 60,000 people under 25 unemployed it is not really relevant.</P>
    <P>This postponement of the local elections will not afford the people in the street or in the countryside the opportunity to say to the Taoiseach and to the Fine Gael and Labour partners in the Coalition: &ldquo;We are dissatisfied with your performance and unless you are prepared to change your policies and adopt a different strategy towards Government for the remaining part of your term you will not be re-elected.&rdquo; It is obvious that the Government have discovered that the people will give them that message if the local elections are held now; consequently the decision has been taken to postpone them.  If we are to have such decisions which are of fundamental importance in the running of the country, if we do not recognise that our local authority structures are the cornerstone of our democracy, if people are not to be allowed every five years to elect their local public representatives to look after their needs and interests in their area, it is a poor day and perhaps a turning point for democracy here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the postponement of the local elections will ensure that the reform which is overdue, particularly in the Dublin region which now accounts for approximately one-third of the population, will now be carried out.  That reform is so much overdue that it is difficult to call local government in Dublin either &ldquo;local&rdquo; or &ldquo;government&rdquo; any longer.  Neither word relates to the structural arrangements which prevail in the Dublin area.  In the case of Dublin Corporation, the City Council of 45 members represents over half a million people.  In electoral area No. 8, the one with which I am most familiar, an electorate of 48,000 elect four members to <Col N="1549" /> Dublin Corporation.  A similar electorate would elect 40 plus members to Leitrim County Council or three Members to Dáil Éireann.  Electoral area No. 8 in Dublin is the same size as a three-seat Dáil constituency.  Many counties in this country have a population just about sufficient to elect three Members to Dáil Éireann.  Therefore, the population represented by members of some local authorities, particularly in the Dublin region, is far in excess of anything that was intended by the original local government plan.  We need smaller regions, smaller numbers represented by more councillors particularly in the Dublin area, so that they can deal with purely local matters.</P>
      <P>The present situation causes problems in other areas.  For instance, a bad stretch of roadway may underline the need for traffic lights or some such thing, but Dublin Corporation would be very reluctant to erect traffic lights in that area because of the precedent that would be set, perhaps encouraging the other side of the city to make similar demands.  That should be a local issue decided by local people.  They should decided whether they want traffic lights, stop signs, &ldquo;children at play&rdquo;, signs or whatever else in their locality.  That is what local government is all about.  Switzerland has over 3,000 local authorities who have not the restriction of <i>ultra vires.</i> They can decide on the local issues within their community, without reference to central Government and this works very well. Our central Government are afraid to give to local communities the right of deciding local issues because they fear that this will in some way interfere with central policy.  One instance is the eastern by-pass, regarding which the various local communities put their views, section by section.  I argue very strongly for more local authorities and local councils, particularly in the Dublin region.  If the postponement of these so-called local elections means anything, it should mean reform of local government, in particular in the Dublin region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, local authorities of the size of Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council are used as a springboard <Col N="1550" /> to Dáil Éireann.  Let us be honest, it is an avenue, once a representative has established a reputation, to Dáil Éireann.  We need to create two streams of government, local and central.  If we continue to have such large local authority electoral areas we cannot expect local communities to have any voice in deciding what should be local issues such as traffic, sewerage and local planning matters. These matters are now being decided by well thought out principles, regulations, laws and by-laws which however, may not have a general application and which in many cases should not have.  If local authorities are prepared to pay for their facilities, they should be allowed this right, provided it does not interfere with central Government.</P>
    <P>Let us reform this whole area of local government.  I am speaking now about the Dublin area about which I know most.  Everybody in the Dublin area would agree that there is need for reform but there is disagreement between Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation as to how that reform should take place.  There is disagreement as between Fianna Fáil members in Dublin Corporation and in Dublin County Council and as between Fine Gael members in these two bodies.  It is not a party or an authority thing.  Everybody agrees that something needs to be done, but there is very little consensus on what should be done.</P>
    <P>I am chairman of the Dublin Corporation Local Government Reform Committee and we are finding it very difficult to obtain a consensus of opinion.  Even if we do get it across party lines, we may find that our own party colleagues in the county council take a different view because they are comparing their powers with those of the corporation.  There is a tremendous task to be carried out.  We should define the activities of local authorities and ask should central Government be involved.  A Traffic Bill passed through the House a few weeks ago and another will be brought forward shortly.  In many cases regulations under such legislation should be decided by local communities.  They may wish to put <Col N="1551" /> yellow grids at crossings, parking meters and &ldquo;children at play&rdquo; signs and those decisions should be left to them.  Not only are the Government now involved but so also are several Government Departments, Government agencies, the traffic study group, the task force, the traffic committee of Dublin Corporation, the Department of the Environment, CIE and the Garda Commissioner &mdash; the list is endless.  These issues should be decided locally.  We must define local government responsibilities and hand them back to the local authorities which should be broken up into smaller units.</P>
    <P>By comparison with Switzerland we do not know what local government is all about.  The Department of the Environment might take a look at the Swiss method.  It is a fallacy to talk about Government in terms of present local authority arrangements.  The only way in which a local authority can direct the manager to do anything is by introducing a section 4 motion, which must be done in a very legalistic way.  This method is used more by some authorities than by others.  There is also the question of influence and certainly here my experience in Dublin Corporation has been very favourable.  Standing committees certainly carry a lot of influence, but a stubborn manager can ignore the locally elected representatives if he so wishes. The Managerial Act has centralised a great deal of power in the hands of the manager and any reform of local government should include an examination of the desirability of continuing to centralise power to such an extent.</P>
    <P>The local authority members, operating in an area in which they have grown up and with a knowledge of local problems and difficulties, would take a great pride in that area and would act responsibly in finding solutions to these problems than central Government appear to believe.  Councillors, frustrated by not having any power, have engaged in publicity and caused excitement from time to time and that may engender fear and anxiety in the Department of the Environment, but given the authority which they should have, the local communities <Col N="1552" /> would use that authority responsibly.  The Managerial Act should be examined with a view to putting the necessary powers in the hands of the locally elected members.</P>
    <P>Much have been said and written about TDs being councillors and I am both &mdash; indeed the House has Ministers who are both TDs and councillors.  However, the TD has as much right to be a councillor as has a doctor, an accountant, a solicitor, or a carpenter.  However, if people are going into local government who are only interested in central Government and are using it as a means towards getting into central Government &mdash; present company excluded, of course &mdash; then perhaps we should examine this whole question in detail.</P>

      <P>Councillors could say that TDs should not be councillors.  If it works one way, it should work another. If we are really interested in creating two streams, we should include in the list of people prohibited from standing for Dáil Éireann, councillors who under the new organisation would have new powers and share in the Managerial Act.  They would then become comparable to certain local authority officials who would not be allowed to stand for Dáil Éireann.  If we are serious about this there should be a mutually exclusive arrangement whereby TDs cannot stand for a council and councillors cannot stand for the Dáil.  In that way we would divert the energies of people who are genuinely interested in local government into local government and people interested in national politics into the Dáil.  That should be considered as part of the reform.</P>

    <P>I have a few more suggestions to make as to how we proceed from here.  From time to time we read in the papers about councillors suggesting to people that they should break the law.  I have had experience where I did not realise I had a share in the lease on a very small office and I was reminded that there were rates still outstanding on that office which I did not know anything about.  If they had not been paid I could have been debarred <Col N="1553" /> from being a member of a local authority. Members of local authorities can be debarred if they do not pay rates which are due.  I am talking here about domestic rates.  A similar regulation should apply to councillors who advise others to break the law.  This matter needs to be looked at.  We cannot have people who make by-laws or national laws advising other people to break those laws.  If we are to have some sort of order in society we will have to expect from councillors and TDs that they do not advocate the breaking of laws.  People who do this should be brought to account for it.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the reform which must take place consideration will be given to dealing with the shortage of finance which local authorities are running into. One way to do it is to set up within local authorities a similar arrangement to the one we have nationally in relation to Government Departments, that is the Public Accounts Committee.  The local government auditor, who examines the accounts of the local authorities and has absolutely no contact whatsoever with the local authority members, in future should report to the local authority members. We have had situations when reports of the local government auditor have not been presented to local authorities for three or four years after they were examined.  They were only submitted under pressure eventually.  Presumably they were submitted to the Minister but had not come from the Minister to the local authority.  I maintain that any reform which is undertaken should change that system.  Local authorities should be encouraged to set up a committee of public accounts.  The local government auditor who examines the accounts should report directly to local government members and they could take whatever action they considered necessary.  If this were done we could save unnecessary and wasteful spending because local government members, as we do on a national basis in relation to Government Departments, could debate the report of the local government auditor and decide to take steps to cut out wasteful spending.  That would certainly help in relation to the funding of local <Col N="1554" /> government which would not cost the State anything.</P>
    <P>Another thing which would help is if the Department of the Environment would give the decision about whether they will allow Dublin Corporation to run a lottery.  Dublin Corporation have been seeking a decision from the Department of the Environment and the Minister.  We met the Minister for Energy when he was Minister for the Environment who said he would give active consideration to the matter, but nothing has happened.  Surely we should be given a decision yes or no. If the answer is no, why has it taken so long to tell us that?  If the answer is maybe, why will they not tell us maybe and we can see if we can get any further information to help to sort out the problem. This needs to be decided on.  I cannot understand why it has taken almost two years despite various written requests and various meetings, but there still has not been a decision.  That is another way of dealing with the problem of local government funding.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a suggestion as to how we should proceed from here.  I believe we will have difficulty in getting consensus from all the different interest groups, from all those with experience &mdash; I am not just talking about elected members because people in the management end of local government could have suggestions to make.  I believe there will be difficulty even within party lines.  The Minister, after giving consideration to the various contributions in the House during this debate and the various submissions made to his Department, should then publish a Bill with specific proposals.  We should not have any more White Papers or discussion documents.  When the Second Stage has been completed the Bill should then be sent to the legislation committee who would take submissions from interested parties and decide on amendments to recommend to the House for Committee Stage.  I do not think it is a political issue.  I believe it is an issue on which Fianna Fáil would have difficulties within their group and we would have difficulties within our local authority groups, we would have difficulties with each other and local authorities would <Col N="1555" /> have difficulties with other local authorities about this.  I am talking particularly about the position in Dublin.  I believe that is the best way to proceed on this Bill.  I hope the Minister finds that suggestion worth while.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-West):</i> As a member of Dublin Corporation, the largest local authority in the country, I feel I should make a brief contribution. The excuse the Government have given for postponing the local elections is that they want an opportunity to reform local authorities.  Everybody knows that the main reason for postponing the elections is that the Government fear facing the electorate at present.  Last week a similar vague excuse was given when the Government opposed moving the writ to hold the by-election in the constituency of Laois-Offaly to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Ber Cowen.  While the Government say they propose to reform local authorities they have not laid any proposals before the House about the way they propose to do this.  There is no indication given how these reforms will be brought about.  I question what the Government intend to do in reforming local authorities.  Do they intend to carve up constituencies favourable to Government parties?</P>
      <P>The unpopularity of the Government is very well known.  The Dublin Central by-election proved that to the Labour Party who held seats in that constituency for a number of years.  The former leader of the party held a seat there.  That is the real reason why the Government are afraid to face the people.  That result prompted them not to hold the elections. The Labour Party are the real losers.  The people showed their dissatisfaction with the way the Labour Party changed.  They projected themselves as socialists and custodians of the working people.  They joined Fine Gael which could be described as a conservative party.  This decision may have short-term benefits for Labour but in the long term the decision will be fatal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that if the Government decide to hold the local elections the <Col N="1556" /> Labour Party will be the real losers.  Fine Gael will not lose that much.  These elections were due to take place in June 1984. What was wrong with the Minister going ahead with them?  He has five years in which to introduce reform.  There is no immediate need for reform although I agree that certain areas need to be reviewed.</P>
    <P>The Government parties have control in Dublin Corporation.  For the last five years they succeeded in electing a Lord Mayor from either Fine Gael or Labour. We are the largest political party and not once in the past five years has a member of our party been given the honour of being Lord Mayor.  Part of Ballymun is under Dublin Corporation and the other part is under Dublin County Council. That creates problems for people living there.  Some services are provided by Dublin Corporation in the county council area and others are provided by the county council.  We made submissions to the Minister to bring the whole area under the jurisdiction of Dublin Corporation. It would be much better to bring it in under one authority.  Dublin Corporation. It would be much better to bring owned by Dublin County Council.  There is no need to postpone the elections so that this can be done.  However, like our other proposals, this will probably fall on deaf ears.</P>
    <P>The last local elections were held in 1979 when Fianna Fáil were in power. There were many industrial disputes at the time and it was not very pleasant for us to face the electorate.  However, we took up the challenge.  If we had not done so, we would have been described by the Opposition as cowards and afraid to face up to our responsibilities.  The Labour and Fine Gael Parties had everything going for them at the time.  The big issue in Dublin was the saga of Wood Quay. There were protest meetings all over the city and, as a result, many prominent councillors lost their seats.  We favoured the decision to build offices on the land. Only for the industrial disputes and protests there would be four office blocks instead of the two we have.  They will not be ready for occupation until 1985.</P>
    <P>I recently attended an estimates meeting <Col N="1557" /> of Dublin Corporation.  The question of the cost of renting office space arose. Large sums of money are paid for renting offices and councillors said they looked forward to the opening of the new office block.  One Fine Gael councillor said it would be great because a lot of money would be saved.  A colleague of mine informed the meeting that that councillor was one of the strongest objectors to the building of the offices and had expressed himself in terms of &ldquo;lying in front of bulldozers&rdquo; which would excavate the ground in order to build the offices.  The decision we made has proved to be correct. The offices are there and will be occupied in 1985.  If we did not encounter such severe opposition to the building of the four office blocks we would have saved even more money in the long term.</P>
    <P>There is much concern at the Government's decision to change the legislation and empower city and county managers to make charges.  The only charge we have now is the water charge which many householders have refused to pay. Deputy Mitchell said it was irresponsible of elected members to advise people not to pay these charges.  Never at any time have I advised people not to pay them. Local authorities are empowered to take anyone who does not pay the charges to court.  When Fianna Fáil abolished rates we did so because it was an unjust system of taxation.  A householder in poor circumstances had to pay the same rate as his wealthy neighbour.  We do not apologise for abolishing them.  There is strong resistence by residents associations and ACRA to paying these charges.  In some cases it will cost the local authorities more to enforce payment.  I think the Government have got the message and that is why they are postponing the elections. They think the climate will be more favourable for them in 1985.  However, I have no doubt that if the climate is not more favourable then that the elections will be postponed for another year. Nevertheless, the Government should have the courage to face the people.  The decision to postpone the elections is undemocratic.</P>
    <P>Much has been said by members of the <Col N="1558" /> Government parties in the past about the involvement of young people and I know many young people, representative of all parties, who are very disappointed because they cannot contest local elections. We have also heard much about the involvement of more women and I have no doubt that many more would contest these elections.  I am sure they are also very disappointed that the elections are not being held.  The excuse the Government gave for opposing the writ last week was to save additional finance. They proposed holding the Laois-Offaly by-election on the same day as the European elections on 14 June.  Would they not have saved additional finance if they had gone ahead with the local elections on the same day as the European elections? I have no doubt that no matter how long these elections may be postponed the people will remember the decisions the Government have made since they took office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The longer this debate goes on the more I feel I should come into the Chamber equipped with a snorkel and mask because we are in danger of being washed away in a flood of crocodile tears from the Opposition with regard to putting off the local elections. Their protestations can be for only two reasons: that they are making this case for purely political reasons to try to embarrass the Government or because they do not think that local government is in need of reform.  If that is their opinion, I submit that members of the Fianna Fáil Party who are members of local authorities have not been taking their job seriously because there is a crying need for local government reform.  This applies especially to the constituency which Deputy Barrett represents and I urge the Opposition to stop shedding these crocodile tears and to address themselves to the relevancy of putting off local elections, that is to the whole area of local government reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the postponement for another year of local elections.  Of course we would all welcome elections being put off for the next 15 years so that we could stay safely in our seats without having to face the electorate and be in competition <Col N="1559" /> with our party colleagues.  The postponement of the elections will concentrate the minds of the officials of the Department of the Environment and local authority members who have the best contribution to make towards the reform of local government and individual political parties and give them an opportunity to come up with suggestions for reform.  It will also concentrate the minds of the general public on letting us know in what areas changes should be made.  There is no doubt that local government, especially as it exists in Dublin city and county where one third of the country's population lives, is no more relevant to the people than some people feel the Dáil is. The city and county of Dublin have grown in the last ten years out of all proportion but the structures of local government are still the same.  After the abolition of rates in 1977 &mdash; and, in fairness, all sides of the House approved of that decision &mdash; unfortunately people did not look ahead to see what would happen when they had not to pay rates.</P>
    <P>In the area which I represent most of the development has been in the area of housing.  The local authority get a percentage increase based on the rateable value of the houses.  If that percentage increase is very small, as it is this year, there is no way in which the local authority can raise extra finance through the business sector because the percentage of business in Dublin County Council is very small compared to the whole administrative area of the county council.  We have no option but to look at the area of charges, which I feel must be further examined.  There were many protests when the law was changed to allow corporations and county council managers to raise charges.  The reality is that the executive function was always there to raise water charges in county council administrative areas.  There was no major change there, county council areas in Dublin have always paid water rates, even since the abolition of domestic rates.</P>
    <P>The whole area of charges needs to be further examined.  A county council should be able to decide what amentiy is <Col N="1560" /> needed in their area &mdash; it could be a golf course or a graveyard &mdash; and charges should be levied for the time it takes to provide such a service.  Of course the people must want such a service and then they would be willing to pay for it.  When the service was provided the charges should then be dropped &mdash; in other words, people would realise that there is not a bottomless pit and that you cannot keep providing more services without somebody paying the price.  It is all very well to say to go back to central Government but it is the people who are financing central Government, so it is just catch 22.  People should have the power to say to the managers of county councils that they are prepared to finance an amenity which they require.  We cannot continue as we are at present with requests <i>ad infinitum</i> for more public facilities, playing fields and community services.  Somebody must bear the cost.  I agree with some of what Deputy Michael Barrett said, but we are not afraid to face the electorate.  I know the kind of work councillors have been doing and they will not lose their seats.  They have been doing their jobs diligently and courageously. The reason for the postponement is not that we are afraid of losing our seats.  It is to allow in-depth examination and reform so that when we go to the electorate they will see that local government means something in their area.</P>
    <P>Dublin County Council are the local authority who represent the largest number of people.  Seven or eight years ago they found they could not continue within the structures of their standing orders and they amended them in order to break up the council area into four districts. One general committee dealing with planning was not working.  People in Tallaght, Malahide, Portmarnock and Swords did not feel they were being represented. The setting up of four district committees had great advantages because the problems of individual areas could be raised.  Now even those district committees are becoming mini-councils but they have no power and are of less benefit than when they were established. We have reached a crisis in County Dublin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1561" /> Deputy Barrett mentioned areas of overlap between the city and county. There are parts of his electoral area for the corporation which I represent on the county council.  He said there were corporation houses built on land owned by the county council.  In fact the corporation have built large estates in county council administered land.  The county council do not own the land and the corporation are the biggest land owners in Dublin county.  One local authority are developing in another local authority's area and housing people.  Rows are building up between them because the county council feel that the corporation are housing their people in the county area and that therefore the onus should rest on the corporation to provide services such as water and sewerage connections. Even the councillors are at odds with each other instead of working for the betterment of the people they represent. That is not the way it should be.</P>
    <P>We must tackle the problems which arise where boundaries differ from the local authority administrative areas.  This happens in other places besides Dublin. People who are tenants of one local authority do not know to whom they should turn.  It is the same in regard to private developments.  Small builders are awarded contracts by the corporation in county council areas and years can go by before the two local authorities make up their minds about who should be responsible for planting trees, maintaining footpaths and providing traffic wardens at schools.  The people become more and more confused.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister and the Minister of State realise the problem.  They are both former members of local authorities and have personal experience of the frustration of councillors coming up against these problems.</P>
    <P>The time has come when people should be able to go to local offices and report their problems.  Let us consider, for example, the case of a person whose drains have become blocked.  Local authorities can, by making a small charge, enter private property and clear out the drains.  The charge is much less <Col N="1562" /> than a private firm would demand and it is a service we should try to maintain. Because of the increase in crime and the danger of being robbed, local authority staff will not take money at the door.  The county council are statutorily obliged to impose a charge because they are not allowed to carry out work on private property at public expense.  A person who rings the county council offices to report the problem is told to go into the offices in Parnell Square, pay the charge, take the receipt to the office in O'Connell Street, sign a form stating that the charge has been paid and obtain another receipt. Then the people in the O'Connell Street office ring the local office concerned, tell them the money has been paid and that the drain should be cleared.  There may be a delay before a person is able to go into the city centre and carry out this procedure and in the meantime the drains will remain blocked.  This problem causes a lot of flak for the county council.</P>
    <P>I would hope that local council offices would be provided so that people could report their problems and have them handled locally.  There should not be a long series of letters and phone calls with the delays entailed.</P>
    <P>There are more than 460,000 people living in the Dublin County Council area and a survey would probably show that most of them do not really know who runs the libraries and look after the graveyards or who is responsible for the implementation of the Litter Act and the Water Pollution Act.  They would probably think it was somebody in central Government.  The functions of local authorities are a complete mystery to most people.  They tend to think of local authorities as being pothole and drain merchants who are not important in day-to-day living.  A publicity and public relations job is necessary.  We tried to make our council more relevant and we in Fine Gael tried very hard to get agreement regarding the need for a public relations exercise, and on our council in particular.  Unfortunately Opposition councillors did not always agree with us and said it would be money badly spent.</P>
    <P>I still maintain that we should have tried to alert the public to the problems <Col N="1563" /> of the local authorities.  If we had done so there would not be so much opposition to what the local authorities are now forced to do, that is, to charge for some of the services.  I abhor the tactics of some members of the public and some parties, not necessarily the Fianna Fáil Party, in trying to undermine the local authorities when they are trying to do their job responsible.  These people are trying to stir up agitation about the imposition of charges.  They are adopting an irresponsible attitude in saying that water is free because it comes down from the heavens and nobody should pay for it.</P>
    <P>The reality is that water comes down from the heavens, but there would be great opposition from the public if the only way they could get water was to have a barrel outside their back kitchen door. Providing clean drinking water to the general public is a very expensive process. The other day we had a Private Notice Question on the problem of dirty water going into people's homes.  To ensure that individual houses get a good clean water supply costs hundreds of pounds.  Charges of £30, £40 or £50 go nowhere near paying for the maintenance of a clean water supply, providing extensions to reservoirs and providing new pipes in older areas where the pipes have become dirty and unusable and need replacement.  I abhor this irresponsible attitude on the part of people who are organising public meetings for reasons we all know.  They are trying to stir up opposition to these charges.  If you talk to the ordinary person who is trying to make both ends meet he or she will understand the problems facing councillors.</P>
    <P>In any review of local government the financing of local authorities is of major concern.  Local authorities cannot continue as they are.  In Dublin County Council, 75 per cent of the allocation for the sanitary services budget goes on paying loan charges.  This does not leave much money for new work.  It was decided that three new towns would be developed in Dublin county, but no allocation was given to Dublin County Council to finance them.  They have had to finance the development of those new <Col N="1564" /> towns within the framework of the ordinary money they get.  That must be taken into account by the people looking into this reform.  If individual councils are set up for these new towns these problems can be tackled when they have financial autonomy to run their own affairs.</P>
    <P>There is no point in passing on new legislation, desirable though it may be, to the local authorities and turning the authorities into a dumping ground for new legislation.  There is no point in saying we have introduced water pollution control, new litter Bills and new dog control legislation and they are now the responsibility of local authorities.  Local authorities cannot implement that legislation because they have not got the money.  They cannot provide the refuse dumping places which are required under the Litter Act.  They cannot provide dog control officers.  They cannot provide water pollution officers.  They are stretched to the end of their tether to keep the existing services going.  We are fooling ourselves by enacting legislation and passing it on to the local authorities as they are structured now.  D day has come for local government reform.</P>
    <P>I welcome this postponement to allow the minds of the two Ministers responsible, the civil servants, the members of local authorities, the political parties, independent members of local authorities and the public to concentrate on the problem.  I hope a call will go out from here today to interested bodies to start gathering their thoughts together.  I would be afraid that Deputy G. Mitchell's suggestion that this matter should be hived off to the legislation committee might delay the proceedings.  I hope submissions are already coming in.  If not, I hope the Minister will call on the interested groups to make their submissions now so that the process will not be delayed further.  If it is decided that the matter should be sent to the legislation committed I will agree to that when the time comes, but we should be looking for these submissions now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The longer this debate goes on the less convincing are the arguments used on the other side of <Col N="1565" /> the House.  Back bench Members are now being whipped in to try to convince themselves that this is all about postponing the elections until we have had local government reform.  Many of the points raised by the last speaker are not related to reform.  They are administrative matters relating to improvements and the more efficient and effective provision of services in all local authority areas.  That should be an ongoing process.  It is not an issue to be raised in this House as an excuse for doing something which is openly seen to be a political exercise.</P>
      <P>Only once in the past 30 years Fianna Fáil faced local elections in Opposition. That was in 1974.  Every politician knows that there is immense electoral benefit to be gained by the Opposition at local election time.  The point I am most concerned about is the maintenance and continuance of democracy.  We all like to be protected from elections for as long as we possibly can.  I agree with Deputy Mitchell that Deputies should be councillors, although that is not always possible for many reasons.  I did not come through the apprenticeship of a local authority.  I was a Deputy before I was a county councillor. My years of service with a local authority and some of their subsidiary committees were extremely useful to me as a Member of this House.  They made me aware of the many ordinary problems which arise in the administration of local affairs.  Every Member of this House should remember the importance of local administration and local government control in their own areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will have an opoportunity to resume this debate later on.  At this stage it is difficult for me to open up the avenues about which I wish to speak.  I am disappointed that the local elections are not going ahead.  I have referred to democracy and its importance.  It is being attacked and abused now.  Traditionally local elections have been used by all parties &mdash; and perhaps by parties in Opposition more than by parties in Government &mdash; to introduce new people.  They give small parties and independent groupings an opportunity to nominate a person to contest them.  This helps to maintain democracy and gives young <Col N="1566" /> people an opportunity to become aware of the very important aspects of local government administration, the problems and advantages and the ability to maintain links with bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>Reform is a very big area.  It is a very important word, but it cannot be used as an excuse by the local authority of which Deputy Owen is a member for not making administrative decisions which are necessary.</P>

      <P>The matters to be discussed at European Council meetings and the order in which they are taken are settled at the meeting by the participating Heads of State or Government.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to suggest to the Taoiseach that considering <Col N="1567" /> that Article 104 of the Treaty of Rome specifically asks each member state to secure a high level of employment and that it was largely on this assumption, as was stated in the White Paper of 1972, that we joined the EEC, we have a strong case before the Heads of State of Europe to make a special plea in regard to unemployment. Is the Taoiseach aware that the convergence of member state economies, particularly the convergence in unemployment figures, is a major objective of the EEC?  Considering that our unemployment rate is 17 per cent, and worsening by the day, while the European average is 11 per cent, does the Taoiseach hold the view that European action to assist us in this time of crisis is a legitimate request, not a begging bowl request, Ireland being one of the more difficult areas in Europe?  On the figures alone, particularly those released in recent days, will the Taoiseach agree that Ireland now rates as a disaster area in Europe in regard to unemployment?  Will the Taoiseach accept that it is legitimate for him to say to the Heads of State at the meeting that Ireland seeks special assistance to at least help get us down to the European average of unemployment, which is 11 per cent?  We are sticking out in Europe as an absolute disgrace in regard to unemployment.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The points made by the Deputy, even if not in order, are cogent ones.  The fact is that the European Social Fund, the fund that produces resources of nearest relevance to this problem, is one from which we are already major beneficiaries, indeed to a greater extent than we anticipated when we joined the Community.  Having said that, we would be concerned to secure, as far as possible, a reorientation of Community policies in the direction of unemployment, in the direction of dealing with the problems of unemployment specifically.  I will not pretend to the Deputy that that will be easy, although there is a general consensus for <Col N="1568" /> a movement in that direction.  I share the Deputy's concern that the Community should address these problems in a more thorough and effective way than it has done hitherto.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach if he accepts the view that convergence of economic policies is a specific aim of the EEC and that what is happening with regard to the employment policy in the EEC is divergence, that Ireland is totally out of line with virtually all its neighbours and most of the Western world?  It is not just an economic recession.  Ireland has special difficulties. Will the Taoiseach consider raising this point?  Will be consider saying to the other Heads of State: &ldquo;Look, Ireland has a particular problem and, although I know Ireland does well from the Social Fund, from the figures it can be seen that our country is a difficult area and will the community take account of that?&rdquo; The Taoiseach should ask for that treatment if for no other reason than to even out the regional imbalances.</P>

      <P>I would not want to comment on that at this stage.  These meetings have their own internal dynamic.  The Deputy will be aware that this meeting is potentially a very crucial one for the Community and the issue that has to be faced is whether agreement can be reached on the continued expansion of Community resources, which at this point are effectively exhausted in relation to existing or new policies.  It is towards that that we have to direct ourselves primarily at this meeting.  That that should be the case and that we should be having to face an issue of that kind, and that the Community should not have the resources to tackle a problem like this, must be a matter of regret and concern to all of us.  However, the reality is that <Col N="1569" /> this meeting is one which has to determine not only a specific issue of vital importance to Ireland, the super-levy, but also whether the additional resources will be available for the development of new policies or the expansion of existing ones.  It is on that issue that we have to concentrate at this point in time.  I do not wish to diminish the force of what the Deputy has said, with which I agree, although we have to be conscious of the fact in presenting our case in Brussels that we are in a way which is not true of any other country a major net beneficiary from Community funds.  The Community is already providing us with resources to help to reduce our economic problems to a significant degree.</P>

      <P>I can only ask supplementaries one at a time.  My supplementaries so far related to unemployment, which, as the Chair will appreciate, is a crucial area.  Question No. 2 deals with interest rates.  Is the Taoiseach aware that the official growth projection for the EEC is about 1½ per cent for the next year compared to about 5 per cent for the United States?  Considering that and the need for investment &mdash; investment, as the Taoiseach will be aware, is something we do not get unless interest rates come down &mdash; will the Taoiseach agree that what is holding back employment and growth in Europe is the high level of interest rates?  Will the Taoiseach ask his partners at the meeting of Heads of State <Col N="1570" /> to tell the United States that they will have to stop this lunatic interest rate policy they are adopting and try to bring down interest rates in America which will have a direct effect on us here and boost the economies of Europe?</P>

Considering the importance of interest rates to a recovery in Ireland, will the Taoiseach ask the Heads of State at the forthcoming Summit to tell the United States that they will have to change their interest rate policy which is a direct result of military spending in the US?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I need to ask my colleagues to press this issue because it has been a preoccupation of all member states and one raised consistently and persistently by the Governments of the Community countries with the United States over the past year or, indeed possibly two years.  On this there is unanimity within the Community. Nonetheless we have to face two facts; one is that there is a connection between interest rates and the scale of the American deficit and that action to deal with the deficit could itself affect American growth.  There is an interaction there of which we cannot be unaware.  Secondly, we have to be and are aware of the fact that the United States at the moment is in the throes of one of its prolonged presidential election campaigns and that such election campaigns can have an impact on policy in the short-term.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may answer the point made, interest rates are not determined by one single factor but by a number of complex factors.  One of these is the level of exchange with the United States which exercises a great influence. The other is the domestic inflation rate of <Col N="1572" /> the country concerned and disparities in interest rates within the Community reflect fairly accurately disparities in inflation rates.  If we are to reduce interest rates here to as low a level as is practicable in the light of the American situation then we have to tackle the problem of inflation.  That is what the Government is presently trying to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say I was not aware of the problem.  Of course I am aware of the problem.  A special subsidy was provided for the veterinary services <Col N="1573" /> in question back as far as 1947.  The subsidy in question was £500 of which £150 was for transport alone.  The subsidy scheme was reviewed in 1971 and it was decided the subsidy should not be increased but would be allowed continue until the incumbent veterinary surgeons had ceased to practice.  My Department have no plans to continue the scheme once the present incumbents cease to practise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the farmers in Connemara for the most part are small herd owners because of the poor quality of the land and, because of the sparse population, veterinary surgeons have to travel huge distances and would he accept that a subsidy based on 1947 figures of £500 is not acceptable today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  This is a matter of private enterprise and the incumbent veterinary surgeon received and accepted £16,000 in the year 1982/1983 on TB and brucellosis testing alone and his son during that period received and accepted a sum of £11,000.  They are also employed by Galway County Council and as well as that they are private practitioners, so I really cannot see the need for continuing a subsidy of the type described.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to make an estimate of the need.  The present incumbent is considerably overworked.  He cannot service the area properly, or as properly as he and the local farmers would want and, as a result, there are huge delays because of the difficulty in getting from one place to another.  Huge distances have to be travelled and I would ask the Minister now to have another look at the situation to ensure that farmers in Connemara get equal service to that in other parts of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Exports of the main agricultural products, namely cattle, sheep, beef, lamb, dairy products and pigmeat are already being promoted or carried on by centralised bodies and assistance to exports generally is provided by Córas Tráchtála.  There is no evidence that overall export performance would be improved by the establishment of yet another body.  It should, of course, be borne in mind that under EEC rules it is not possible to confine exports to a particular body and so any centralised exporting enterprise in any sector would have to be acceptable to a substantial proportion of exporting interests in that sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that unless we change drastically our lines of production we shall have to look outside of the EEC for our markets?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a slightly different question.  I agree we need to diversify more and have a greater range of goods. We have too many items which do not stand up very well.  We have that problem at the moment with butter and skimmed milk powder.  There are a number of agencies.  There is CBF to market beef and lamb, Bord Bainne to market milk products, the Pigs and Bacon Commission to market pork and bacon.  We have a very wide range.  Quite recently I was considering an extension of the type of exporting boards involved, that is a separate board for sheep meat which is becoming very important.  At the moment sheep meat and beef are lumped together and dealt with by CBF.  It is worth considering whether it might be better to have two separate boards.  The <Col N="1575" /> Deputy made the point about other countries wanting to deal with State agencies. That is true and that is why we send bodies like CBF and Bord Bainne abroad.  They are as close as one can get to State agencies in a free enterprise democracy and they are doing a very good job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture the number of incidents of warbles affecting livestock which have occurred in this country over the past year; the counties in which this has happened; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of cattle infested with warbles in 1983 was 1,038. The counties affected were Cavan, Clare, Cork, Galway, Kerry, Kildare, Leitrim, Limerick, Longford, Mayo, Meath, Offaly, Roscommon, Sligo, Tipperary, Westmeath and Wexford.</P>
      <P>The number of cattle affected varied from one in County Sligo to 337 in County Westmeath.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that warbles have a detrimental effect on the quality of beef in the affected animal and also that it destroys the hide of the animal?  Further, will he agree that the fact that warbles has occurred again is very serious for our livestock industry? On the basis of the information he has given us, will he consider putting into operation in the affected counties a special departmental scheme to ensure that the disease does not spread?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation has improved considerably in recent years.  The year 1981 was the last year in which there were compulsory measures for the eradication of warble fly.  The incidence of the disease decreased from 5.81 per cent in 1978 to 0.17 per cent in 1983.  Last year it was somewhat higher than in 1982 when the figure was 0.07 per cent but the exceptionally long, warm summer last year was regarded as the reason for the increase. Nevertheless, we shall keep a very watchful eye on the situation and if there is an increase in the incidence of the disease we will bring back the compulsory measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister has power to bring in compulsory measures but this power is not being used at the moment.  It is up to every farmer to treat his own cattle for warbles if he wishes to do so.  Will the Minister consider having a special scheme to ensure the termination of the disease, particularly in the counties where it has been rather widespread?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years progress has been very encouraging and there is a low incidence of the disease.  Herd owners are compelled to notify my Department of an infestation.  If we see a significant increase in the disease and if the eradication scheme is not completely successful we will concentrate on the troublesome areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has agreed that the scheme has been a success and that the incidence of disease is low.  However, will the Minister not agree that in this case &ldquo;a stitch in time saves nine&rdquo; and that if his Department were more strict with offenders at this stage we could eradicate the disease entirely?  Does he not agree that this should be done immediately?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>A reliable figure is not available at present but ACOT are currently conducting a detailed survey of farmers specialising in horticultural production and this should be completed in about a month.  I will arrange to have the information requested supplied to the Deputy then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that since the collapse of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann in the production of vegetables there have been massive imports.  Is it not time that the Department of Agriculture or ACOT made an effort to ensure that we will not import fresh vegetables such as turnips, carrots and cabbages, as has been the case?  This is a ridiculous situation considering we have the climate and the soil conditions to grow those vegetables.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no denying that and all of us agree with what the Deputy has said.  A number of voluntary groups or semi-State bodies are getting together in various areas to do something about the matter.  On the outskirts of Waterford a scheme is getting off the ground, where groups have come together and are providing valuable employment.  This trend may develop elsewhere and it is something we should encourage.  There is a national awareness of the serious problem of horticultural imports, particularly of products that could be grown here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the shortage of horticultural instructors and advisers is prohibiting the development of the horticultural industry? Would the Minister agree further that, at a time of such high unemployment, when self help would aid those who are unemployed &mdash; offsetting our balance of payments by curtailing our imports &mdash; there is a major need for his Department, in co-operation with ACOT, to ensure that there are sufficient advisers available in each county?  Is he aware that in the west, in some of the larger counties, there is an average of two horticultural advisers only to cover the whole county?  Would the Minister examine that situation and ensure that there are sufficent advisers available to farmers and all people interested in the horticultural industry?</P>

      <P>The question, as drafted, does not give rise to a full dress debate on horticulture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that that is the sole or main reason; probably it is one of the many reasons.  But then if we had money to do all of these things we really would not have a problem.  Awareness of the shortcomings of our horticultural industry is not yet sufficient and, until such time as it is, probably we shall not solve the problem.  But the message is getting home slowly.</P>

      <P>There are very few committees or bodies for that matter that have as much funds as they would like.

As the House is aware this is not the best year to be looking for new schemes within the EEC &mdash; I might as well say that quite plainly &mdash; because all they are seeking is ways of cutting back.

A very full opportunity has already been given to local bodies and individuals to make submissions for changes and I doubt whether any further submissions at this late stage of the review would serve any useful purpose.

      <P>During this debate, the arguments being made from the other side of the House have been particularly weak.  The Government Members spoke about alleged local Government reform which, of course, should mean the improvement of the normal administrative operations of the services of any local authoritiy.  The main reason given by many speakers for this postponement is democracy.  Local elections serve a very useful and important function in that they give an opportunity to so many young boys and girls who have political interests to offer themselves as candidates for their parties, or, indeed, as Independents.  If successful in launching themselves in their parties, they can then offer themselves for election to obtain the necessary experience of an election campaign.  If successful in this they learn the elementary and ever so important administrative aspects of local government.  This is extremely important. The vast majority of the members <Col N="1621" /> of this House came through that system and were county councillors before becoming TDs.  I went in the other direction &mdash; I was a TD for a few years before I succeeded in being a member of a local authority.  I found that membership extremely educational and helpful to me during my political life.</P>
      <P>No valid excuse is being offered by the parties opposite for the postponement of these elections.  I have listened to some of the arguments being made, which all centre around reform.  Reform is very important, of course, and local government reform is something which must continue regularly and not be interrupted because of local elections or whatever else may be happening.  Many of the points made demonstrate the need for reform and I support the need for local government reform.  However, that does not mean that we have to stop our democratic process to achieve that reform. Rather are we using the postponement of the elections as an excuse because of that need.  Reform must continue year upon year to make local government more relevant and bring it closer to the affairs of the community.</P>
      <P>Points were made this morning by Deputy Mitchell regarding the number of representatives per head of population in Dublin city as compared with rural Ireland.  They both have their own different, distinct and separate problems.  I accept the points he makes about the large numbers now being catered for per head of elected representatives.  On the other hand, the rural member has a big geographical area to attend to.  He has a lot of road mileage, perhaps not as many people to cater for, but certainly his is a more difficult task to communicate with them or be in contact with their daily needs.</P>
      <P>I travelled the Beara peninsula at the weekend on other missions and was shown where the road had recently collapsed, necessitating an extra journey of ten miles for the inhabitants of that peninsula. I accept that this is a sparsely populated area, but that demonstrates the difficulties encountered by a representative of such an area, or any similar area along the west coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1622" /> The downgrading of democracy is the kernel of the postponement of the elections. It is understandable that some political advantage would accrue to the Opposition party, as indeed has happened so many times in the past.  This is the first time in 30 years that Fianna Fáil will face these elections from the Opposition side of the House, and perhaps there would have been some political gain for this party.  Obviously, the Government opposite were fearful of facing the electorate.  They knew that the issues would be many and varied and that the ineptitude and bad performance of this Government would be clearly demonstrated by the results of the polls.  Of course, the real reasons for the postponement could be given in a long list, starting with the most important of all &mdash; that of the worsening unemployment situation. The main reason for these elections being postponed is the employment situation which is showing absolutely no sign of improvement and indicates an appalling trend for February, with daily factory closures.  Can the Minister present in the House honestly say that he or his party could with confidence face the electorate of Cork city, Cork county, or the town of Youghal?  He could not and he knows that.  The Government have shown themselves not to be interested in and to be inept at their job creation programme.  I could demonstrate many instances where they have lost the heart and the will to try.  My colleague, Deputy Reynolds, referred this morning to the 1,000 jobs in the micro-computer industry which has gone to Scotland.  These are the issues which are responsible for the postponement of the elections.</P>
    <P>In 1979 we, as a Government, deliberated as to whether we should go ahead with the local elections in line with the European elections being held for the first time in that year.  We decided &mdash; I think, courageously &mdash; to go ahead because we believed that it would be the right thing to do.  We believed that it would do two things &mdash; give the people the opportunity to vote at the various local authority levels and, in addition, encourage them to vote in the European elections.  One must wonder about the <Col N="1623" /> commitment of the present Taoiseach, for long regarded as the great European, and how he presided over the decision not to go ahead with the local elections on the day of the European elections.  All Members of this House and all commentators are saying, with some degree of accuracy, that the turn-out at the polls will suffer because of not having the local elections.</P>
    <P>Let us go back over the lead-up to the decision.  It started shortly after the last election &mdash; in fact, in the early spring of 1983, when a well known Fine Gael Senator, obviously keeping in close contact with his electoral college, circulated all Fine Gael county councillors asking for their views as to whether there should be a postponement.  No mention was made in that circular of the word &ldquo;reform&rdquo; or of local government reform.  It was purely a postponement for political purposes. All of us in this House are fully aware of the outcome of that circular and the replies received.  It was an overwhelming yes.  They wanted a postponement for two years.  Pressures began to build up in the Labour Party and there were many bitter clashes about whether the local elections would be postponed.  Then it went to the Government and we were promised a decision in a few weeks.  That dragged on until the eve of Christmas.  It was hoped that the media coverage given to the decision would be limited.  This is why the announcement coincided with the eve of Christmas.</P>
    <P>A whole year of political manoeuvering led to this decision but we are now being told it is because there is need for local government reform.  I agree that there is.  It must be an ongoing process. Early last year we put a Bill through the House changing An Bord Pleanála and setting up a new board.  We were told that the main reason for that Bill was the need for reform.  What happened?  The board has not been set up yet.  The delay between refusal and decisions on appeal has lengthened.  We must make the local bodies relevant and my argument is that we do not have to stop the democratic process to do this.  Let us continue to work to achieve this.  Once decisions are <Col N="1624" /> implemented we will find that there is further need for reform.  If the arguments made by Deputy Owen were an indication of her thinking on the issue there would have to be administrative changes every hour of every day to make it acceptable, suitable and efficient.</P>
    <P>Young people are cynical about politicians. This is unfair.  It is encouraged by certain elements of the press.  I am not sure why.  This would give an opportunity to young people to come forward for election and perhaps be successful. Instead of that we hear about early retirement in the public sector.  Perhaps we should encourage early retirement in the political sector.  There will be no need to do that if young people come into the system.  They would encourage early retirement.  Either they would keep the sitting Member on his toes or would replace him at a reasonable age in or about when a person should retire.</P>
    <P>We have a very cost-conscious Government in many ways.  We heard about the possible loss of 130 jobs in the Southern Health Board.  That is another reason for postponing the local elections.  The same threatened job loss applies to every health board.  As they are a cost-conscious Government why do they not take into account the cost of running these elections in conjunction with the European elections?  There would be a saving to the economy and that should be a factor.</P>
    <P>In the House last week we legitimately proposed the moving of the writ in the case of the by-election caused by the death of my late colleague and very good and esteemed Member of the House, Deputy Cowen.  Deputies opposite spoke about the cost and the amount of business to be done.  They said the election could not be held now but would be held in conjunction with the European election to save costs.  Having decided on that, the Government did a U-turn.  They will not have the local elections on the same day because now they have introduced a new excuse and it is the word &ldquo;reform&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I was looking at <i>Today Tonight</i> last night which featured an exposé of the Minister for the Public Service.  I am sure it had been canned for some time.  Having <Col N="1625" /> no-one else to portray, they decided to do their weekly contribution for the Government and let the matter rest. During the interview the Minister said he did not like the term &ldquo;review&rdquo; in the public service.  He would prefer a different word.  He was probably conscious that &ldquo;reform&rdquo; would have bad connotations because of its use here for blatantly obvious political reasons.</P>
    <P>The real reason for the postponement is the chaotic state of the economy. Hair-shirt policies are being used and we are far worse off than we were a year ago. We have a changing scene in many areas. Agriculture is one of the areas which is changing.  The fact that local elections would be held would mean that on various committees of agriculture there would be new members.  There would also be new people on health boards.</P>
    <P>I wonder if my experience of planning is different from that of other Members? As regards planning, we have gone backwards. It is now more difficult to obtain planning permission because there are fewer applications and more time can be devoted by people who go to great efforts to find a reason for refusal at a time when permission would mean employment for people.  The sooner planning control reverts to the elected representatives of this House and local authorities the better for the country.  Bureaucracy has stifled it to the extent that it is now at a serious stage.  It is costly, anti-development and anti-employment.  The elected representatives in the past may have erred from time to time although their errors were few by comparison with those of their successors because they were always conscious of the fact that they would have the obligation of facing the electorate.  If their decisions were not in accordance with what was best for the public interest &mdash; a balanced view of a well projected and clean environment as against development that is so badly needed to create jobs &mdash; they would be the sufferers.</P>
    <P>I know there are many other Members wishing to speak and I do not want to hog too much time.  However, I know now why the Fine Gael Senator launched the campaign to postpone the elections which <Col N="1626" /> culminated in Government backbenchers putting forward weak arguments as to why this postponement took place.  It is purely a political decision because the Government are afraid to face the electorate. In 1979 when we were in Government and having difficulties, even though we realised the risk we were taking we courageously took a decision to hold local elections.  There is need for reform of the local authorities but that is not why the local elections have been postponed.  The real reasons are the number of unemployed, there is a deterioration in the February figures when in any reasonable year the reverse is the case.  Closures are being announced weekly with further job losses.  There are cutbacks in services, particularly health services, so different and far removed from the halcyon days of the election campaign when the parties opposite promised that they would not do as Fianna Fáil did.  Now we know how empty those promises were.  If the Government have any vestige of honour they will hold the elections.</P>
    <P>I asked the Taoiseach yesterday to recall the Ford closure in Cork when he visits America.  It was made clear to us that a very demanding request had been made to the management of Ford in Detroit regarding meeting the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Deputy Bruton said they would not let Ford walk away from their responsibilities to Cork.  Since then there has been a deafening silence about the issue. When I asked the Taoiseach yesterday if he would raise the issue on his visit to the United States he refused to be drawn.</P>

      <P>I was also very disappointed when I found out that the local elections were being postponed and <Col N="1627" /> many of my constituents were also disappointed. Every five years the electorate have an opportunity to elect their county and urban councillors to represent them.  This is a great privilege because if they are dissatisfied with their local authority representative they have that opportunity to show it.  A very flimsy excuse was put forward by the Government as to the reason for deferring local elections.</P>
      <P>We heard about the need for restructuring local government or local government reform.  I agree that there is need for local government reform but the local authorities should make a contribution to the type of reform they would like.  They could make submissions to the Government and to the Minister for the Environment. That would be the proper way to do it.  However, it is not a justifiable excuse for deferring the local elections. As pointed out by Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, the real reason for the deferment of the local elections was that the Government were afraid to face the electorate. When they made this decision before Christmas they knew quite well that if they held local elections this year Fianna Fáil would get a majority on most local authorities.</P>
      <P>We had a similar situation last week in the Dáil when a writ was moved by our party to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Deputy Cowen by way of a by-election in the Laois-Offaly constituency. The Government postponed this election also and are now planning to hold it on the same day as the European elections. If they were honest they would tell us that the reason for the postponement is that they were afraid to face the electorate. It was strange that the Government did not make a decision to defer the local elections until after a very controversial by-election in Dublin.  Our party did very well in that by-election and the two parties in Government suffered a great humiliation in the loss of a considerable number of votes.  This made them make up their minds very quickly to defer the local elections as well as the pending by-election in Laois-Offaly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of county and urban councillors <Col N="1628" /> is a very important one.  It is essential to say that they are unpaid representatives and the majority of them do their job very effectively.  Many county councillors from my party in County Kerry were anxious to have the local elections this year.  They were not afraid to go before the electorate and face the consequences. They have been doing their job well and they are aware that the Government are not doing well and would suffer a defeat at the polls.  Their constituents are anxious to have an opportunity of deciding whether after five years their local representatives have been effective and they wish to vote accordingly.  I am sure our party would have a good result, especially in my county</P>
    <P>One of the Dáil representatives from Kerry is the Tánaiste who held office as Minister for the Environment when this decision was made.  He knew, as did the Fine Gael Party, that their standing was not very high in county Kerry and this spurred him to make a decision in the interests of his own party and to encourage those in Coalition at Cabinet level to defer the local elections for another 12 months.  Have we any guarantee that they will not be deferred again next year and that the electorate will not be deprived again of the opportunity of electing local representatives?  I would ask for an assurance from the Government side on this point.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are very effective, especially when nothing is being done at Government level.  Kerry County Council recently had a very important discussion about the serious unemployment problem.  The unemployment rate in Kerry is 28.7 per cent and one-quarter of those unemployed are under the age of 25.  This was highlighted in the press, especially the national press, and it was stated that it was the first time ever that a local authority had devoted a whole day to discussing the unemployment problem in their area.  We have the second highest unemployment rate in the country after Donegal.  Much publicity has been given to unemployment in the neighbouring county of Cork but the percentage of <Col N="1629" /> unemployed people is greater in county Kerry.  This is one of the reasons the Government are not anxious to have the local elections.</P>
    <P>The number of people unemployed in the State has risen to 216,000, the highest ever recorded.  At this time of year the unemployment figures are usually falling and an increase in the month of March is unusual.  This is a very good reason for trying to defer the local elections.  The Government should be honest and tell us the real reason &mdash; that they are afraid to face the electorate.  They showed the white feather in relation to the local elections and the by-election.  The Government owe it to the electorate to give them an opportunity of rejecting them or voting in favour of them.  The local elections would have provided an ideal opportunity of proving whether the Government have maintained their majority position or whether they had suffered a loss of support from the electorate.</P>
    <P>Local elections are a great way of determining the feelings of the people.  A Fine Gael Senator from my county, not my constituency, sent a letter to the Fine Gael county councillors asking them to express their views on whether they wanted the local elections deferred.  Naturally he got replies saying they were terribly anxious to have them deferred due to the bad performance by the Government over the past 14 months. Some time ago unlimited power was given to the county managers to introduce service charges of any kind they could think of and, without consultation with the local elected representatives, they could make an order to have service charges introduced or increased.  It did not make any difference if the local authority in question voted unanimously that those service charges should not be introduced or increased.  They did not count.  That power should not have been given to the county managers.  It should have been left with the local authorities.</P>
    <P>In the past local authorities got 100 per cent rate support grants.  An allowance was always made for inflation.  The amount allowed for inflation over the past two or three years was in the region of 12 per cent to 15 per cent.  Last year 15 <Col N="1630" /> per cent was added to the rate support grant.  This year only .8 per cent was added.  Inflation is running at about 10 per cent or 11 per cent.  How do the Government expect the local authorities to carry on with an increase of .8 per cent in the rate support grant?</P>
    <P>Kerry County Council have a shortfall of £2 million in their estimates.  That has to be made up in some way or another, by service charges or by curtailments.  I cannot see where there can be any curtailment in the services given to the people of County Kerry.  A 100 per cent support grant should be given to the county councils and an allowance should be made for inflation.</P>
    <P>The people in North Kerry and South Kerry &mdash; the people I know best &mdash; were very disappointed when the Government deferred the local elections this year. They wanted the opportunity, which is their right every five years, to elect the county councillors or urban councillors, as the case may be, of their choice.  They were denied the right to do that this year by the Government.  The Government knew that the respective parties in Government, Fine Gael and Labour, would not do well in the local elections and would possibly fail to achieve a majority in all the local authorities.  That would not look well for the Coalition, and that is the real reason why the local elections were deferred this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ColmMHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to speak on how central Government can provide a better way for the local authorities to function in the interests of the people in the local areas.  It is essential that we get the best value for the tax-payer's money.  It is logical that a survey should be made on local government reform to enable us to get better value for public money and bring our administrative procedures up to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are the Government really serious about this matter, or is this exercise a camouflage to give the public at large the impression that the reason for postponing the local elections is proposed local government reform?  I doubt that is the real reason.  I am disappointed that we have no proposals from the Government <Col N="1631" /> side.  We have no plans or suggestions either from them.  Are the Coalition Government looking for ideas from this side of the House?</P>
    <P>I find it very difficult to accept that the reason for postponing the local elections is due to the fact that the Government are looking for new ways of financing local authorities.  Local authorities are being forced to impose charges which probably will not be feasible or acceptable in future years.  Government grants should be based on efficiency within the county council regions and not on a flat percentage base as they are at the moment.  We have very efficient county councils and some county councils are not very efficient, but grants are distributed to all local authorities on the same basis.  Some councils do more work than others and because of their geographical position have more difficult problems to deal with.  That should be investigated. The efficiency and quality of work by councils, the labour costs <i>versus</i> the material costs, and the time taken to complete schemes are factors that should be considered under any new proposals to deal with the financing of local authorities.</P>
    <P>In County Meath, where I come from, people are frustrated because of the condition of the roads.  The upkeep of county roads in our county is a major problem. It appears that the county is being severely penalised by the system of allocation of grants from central funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I was anxious to highlight the need for an improvement in the system of financing of local authorities from central funds.  Some counties should get more money than others.  I understood I was entitled to make that point during this debate because we are dealing with local government reorganisation.  Road grants to Meath should be a lot higher than they are and should be considered by the Government when restructuring local authority finance.  County Meath at one time consisted of large estates and that land was divided up by the Land Commission.  The roads provided later consisted of tar top dressings.  Money was not provided by the Government for that work.  Now milk tankers, oil tankers and heavy farm machinery use those roads with the result that their condition has deteriorated.  Grants are not paid to the council to carry out improvements.</P>
      <P>The Government are collecting a lot more revenue now than heretofore.  It is estimated that in 1983 £4,681 million was collected and that in 1984 £5,254 million will be collected, an increase of 12½ per cent.  However, the Government allotted .8 per cent of that revenue to local authorities but Government programmes got an 8 per cent increase on average. That is an indication that the Government are holding on to more of the money being collected from taxpayers. They are not distributing it to local authorities in the way they should.  The plan for better financing of local authorities should have a minimum and maximum percentage grant from central funds for local authorities.  Councils are being forced to collect taxes locally because of the failure of the Government to allocate sufficient money.  The Government should have made a proper allocation in the budget and they should not be asking local authorities to rubber stamp taxes which they themselves did not have the courage to include in the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In County Meath we have a Labour TD and councillors and a Fine Gael TD and councillors trying to cod the people by saying that they are not in favour of these increases although they supported them in the House.  I do not think the electorate in the constituency will forget <Col N="1633" /> this.  Local authorities are being forced to re-introduce rates but Fianna Fáil refused to support that system because it is an unjust way of collecting money from people.  It is wrong to charge a flat rate of £20 for refuse collection or £30 for water rates per house because it does not take into consideration the income of each household.  In one household the weekly income could amount to £500 while the next house may be occupied by an old age pensioner and his wife.  The system is unjust, but councils are being forced to implement it because the Government decided to limit the increase to them to .8 per cent.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that because wages, salaries and travelling expenses paid by local authorities have increased less money is available for work on schemes. Local authorities can only do a minimum amount of work but must pay the maximum wages.  They are fully occupied collecting car tax, supervising planning permissions and investigating loan and grant applications.  A lot of money is spent on administration but there is very little development work taking place.  That must be sorted out by the Government. I cannot understand the reason for postponing the local elections.  We have been told that the Government want to reorganise local authorities but yet they are forcing such bodies to impose new charges that may not be suitable in the future.  Would it not be more sensible to hold the elections and permit the newly-elected councillors sort out the financial problems of the councils?</P>
    <P>In the region of £13.7 million will be spent in County Meath on capital programmes but a big percentage of that figure will be paid in wages.  Successful contractors should be asked to produce clearance certificates from tax inspectors indicating that all PRSI deductions are made, that all PAYE is deducted and so on.  There have been cases where some contractors did not send in all the money. I think it would be very simple to have a clause in the contracts to the effect that money would not be paid unless all these matters were clarified beforehand.</P>

      <P>I want to protest in the strongest possible manner against the postponement of the local elections.  I can see no good reason whatsoever why these elections should be postponed for 12 months and we have no guarantee that at the end of that period this Government will not come along again and seek to postpone them for a further 12 month period.  We all accept there is need for local government reform and if I thought for one moment that the Government were sincere in their claim that the elections are being postponed to allow reform to take place I would not object.  Indeed, I would actually welcome the decision. But I doubt the sincerity of the Government in this matter.  I doubt it because they have had plenty of time since coming into Office to put before this House their proposals for reform.  We do not know if there are any proposals.  We do not know if there are any discussions going on with regard to the changes considered necessary. We can only come to the conclusion, therefore, that this Government are afraid to face the electorate in any contest at the moment.  This means they realise they are very unpopular and they know and anticipate what the answer from the electorate would be were they to seek a contest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a very serious aspect to this, serious in any democracy but especially at a time when a Government is unpopular, unpopular because of their mismanagement of the affairs of the nation. In such an atmosphere it is even more important to give the electorate an opportunity of expressing themselves and letting the Government know what they <Col N="1635" /> think of them.  It is important the electorate should be allowed to express their feeling through the ballot box.  What makes me very suspicious as to the reasons for the postponement of the elections is that we had the writ for the by-election in Laois-Offaly strenuously opposed by the Government only last week.  Taken with the decision to postpone the local elections, that leads me to the conclusion that there are no proposals being formulated with regard to reforming local government.  This is a smoke-screen designed to cover up the real reason and that is why I regret this action so much.</P>
    <P>I was first elected to a local authority way back in 1950 and I served on the county council for over 30 years.  With that experience I realise full well the responsibility of a member of a local authority and the type of decisions that have to be made.  Unfortunately today the responsibility of a member of a local authority in the decision-making of that authority is declining all the time and the latest action of the Government in allowing county and city managers to reintroduce service charges at whatever rate they saw fit, regardless of what elected members might think, was a retrograde step indeed.  To me it was a dangerous step from the point of view of democracy, because county and city managers do not have to offer themselves to the electorate and give an account of their stewardship. Elected members are the best to decide what is suitable in their particular areas and so it is vitally important that local elections should be held.  They should be held next June.  They should be held in conjunction with the European Parliamentary elections.  That would go some way towards saving the cost of local elections. It is something worth considering in the tight financial situation we are in today.  Local authorities are starved for money.</P>
    <P>Having said that, the real reason why these elections should be held is that there are many important decisions to be made by local authorities, decisions which will affect the people within the particular local authority area now and <Col N="1636" /> for many years to come.  The local authority scene is changing and changing rapidly and therefore it is important that members be elected at regular intervals in order to give the electorate an opportunity of bringing new people in on the local councils.  I know there are many young people with fresh ideas only waiting to offer themselves to the electorate if they get the opportunity by way of a local election.  There are, too, many older members of local authorities who would wish not to go forward again and it is a burden on them to have to continue for another 12 months or possibly two years. It is shameful of the Government not to give young people an opportunity of presenting themselves to the electorate and not to give the electorate an opportunity of putting young people on the councils to deal with the many problems that exist.</P>
    <P>We have problems in many areas and it is high time more authority was given back to the members and more say with regard to planning.  Because local authority members are local they are conversant with the local situation and they are therefore better fitted to deal with planning. They are aware of the needs and requirements of the area.  Greater powers must be given to them and this Government took a step backwards when they took away from local authorities any say in the financing of what are now called &ldquo;services&rdquo;.  Service charges are just another form of taxation, another form of rates, an extra burden the people are unable to bear.  Taking the power in this particular matter away from locally elected representatives is very harmful to local democracy in the eyes of the electorate. This is the action of a Government who in their election campaign promised the people that they would confer greater powers on elected representatives.  This situation is a complete turn-about on that promise.</P>
    <P>With this kind of carry on it is no wonder the people are losing respect for those in public life.  It is all the twisting and turning that give rise to this situation. I recall when local authority members had the right to raise the rate and I remember the democratic manner in which that rate was struck.  I remember <Col N="1637" /> people protesting against an increase of a few pence in the pound and marching to express their views which were taken into account by the elected representatives. Because this power and authority are removed from elected representatives the people are frustrated and the frustration will have a very bad effect on the local scene as far as democracy is concerned.</P>
    <P>We hope that the elections will not be postponed for two years but one never knows what will happen when this Government are in power.  They have postponed the local elections and they have opposed moving the writ for the by-election.  Will they also ask to extend the period of Dáil elections to seven years because they are afraid to go before the people?  I want to warn them that when they get the opportunity the people will deal with them most severely.  As far as democracy is concerned, it is a mistake to deny the people the opportunity to vote in local elections.</P>
    <P>Many important decisions must be made with regard to financing local authorities.  I doubt that we will have reform of local government under this administration because they back away from taking decisions.  Their only objective is to remain in office and they use their majority in this House to achieve that.  However, if we are to have reform the whole scene will have to be reviewed completely.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister of State that we must consider at this stage the amalgamation of counties perhaps on a regional basis.  Machinery and materials are under-utilised.  The county system is too small a unit to operate in a proper and cost-saving way.  Roads in one county can have an effect on an adjoining county or city.  Perhaps we could have a national road authority.  We know there is a difference in the standard of roads in many counties and this is showing itself in many ways.  There should be some uniformity in the allocation and spending of money in respect of local authorities.  That is not the situation at the moment.</P>
    <P>If we have reform, I ask the Minister of State to ensure that it is proceeded with speedily.  The Government should <Col N="1638" /> honour their promises.  If they prove me wrong and if they have given us the genuine reason for the postponement of the local elections, then I shall not worry about it.  However, I honestly believe the local elections are being postponed because the Labour Party and Fine Gael are not prepared to go before the people next June.  This is a blow to democracy at local level.  Many young people want to put their names before the electorate but they are being denied that right.  Even at this late stage the Government should reconsider the matter.</P>

      <P>I hope I will not be repetitive but, as a democrat, I must state my disappointment with the decision of the Government to deprive the people of Ireland of what was provided for in legislation, namely, that there would be quinquennial local elections.  It is not because I am the product of such an election procedure myself that I have this respect for and attachment to the importance of local elections.  There are many people, professional and non-professional, who are inspired by the highest motives and who regard local elections as an opportunity for them to say what motivates them towards improving society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt the Government have postponed the local elections because they knew the voters would indicate their dissatisfaction with the way they have performed in office.  Understandably the Government are fearful of losing their stranglehold on many local authorities.  It is possible for them under the legislation to postpone the elections but it is not in accord with the high principles and the many statements of this Government in which they claimed to have regard for the man in the street, for <i>vox populi.</i> They told us they were going to decentralise and that they were going to use all community efforts and voices in the administration of services.  Today they say that in deferenece to that principle they are trying to introduce community policing. In the past they said they were concerned <Col N="1639" /> about giving rights to community councils.  We cannot accept anything from this Government.  We cannot accept their bona fides when we see that they are denying people the opportunity to vote in local elections and return their elected representatives to deal with local affairs.</P>
    <P>Understandably, the Government did not wish to give the people an opportunity to vote in local elections because they could anticipate the result, but that is not a good reason for postponing the elections.  That is not what democracy is about.  In addition, the normal pruning of parties and personalities cannot be done.  The normal induction of new members which would occur is being denied and the whole system will be much the poorer for it.  I had the pleasure and opportunity of serving on Dublin Corporation with the Minister of State present. In passing I must say he is carrying a fairly lonely burden on those benches. Since the debate resumed he has not had the companionship of any Member from the Labour Party or from his own party. I know that any of those Members who are also members of local authorities are quite happy to soldier on: they are quite happy to keep someone else at bay.  I say unashamedly that probably there are people in all parties who welcome that aspect of it.  But we should not be catering for that insular and mean approach to local elections.  The local election is the best mechanism of which I am aware of allowing new blood to enter into administration and simultaneously provide a launching pad for people who would have the capacity, intelligence, motivation and ambition to reach this forum.  That is being denied them, and the nation and society are the poorer for it.  I shall keep repeating: the only reason it is being done is that this Government know that the voice of the people would be against them.</P>
    <P>I do not like commenting on matters I hear about discussions in other parliamentary parties.  It is well known that when this was being deliberated there were very few defenders of this system, <Col N="1640" /> not because they did not admire the system or because they do not recognise the importance of local authorities but because it would prove embarrassing for them.</P>
    <P>I know also it can be said correctly that there was an occasion when the Fianna Fáil Government postponed local elections. That is the only reason that has been advanced from the other side of the House.  I put it to them: are they happy with what they know to have been an undesirable feature of administration? Are they happy to take refuge in that excuse for postponing it themselves?  Are they happy that by doing this for one year now, perhaps two, they can live and face the people at a future election?  It has been done in the name of setting up new structures, that they are examining the whole structure of local government.</P>

      <P>All right, my understanding might not have reached the pinnacles of those of the Minister of State.  But I defy the Minister of State present to convince this House, or to demonstrate to the people in his constituency, how it is in their best interests that he is taking refuge in this clap trap, maintaining that they are doing it in the interests of reformation. For example, how does he relate that to what he promised them in the last general election that he would involve them, include them, in government? How can he relate it to the addresses he gave individually and collectively to people in, say, Meath Street or Francis Street in his constituency when now he is afraid to meet them?  That is the whole reason it is being done, because he cannot account for his stewardship in the whole area of Government whether at parliamentary or local level.  He can sit there in his safe seat and smugly say that we do not understand the high principles that motivate him.</P>

      <P>He will have the claptrap of local government reformation.  But he will be unable to demonstrate how, by denying people the right to voice their opinion after a five-year period, they are doing so in the interests of the people, because they know they are not and the Minister of State knows they are not. Deputy Gay Mitchell knows they are not. I suppose all politicians &mdash; especially as they move on in years &mdash; might be somewhat fearful of colleagues who are with them.  Some might be looking over their shoulders saying: &ldquo;If they are held, X, Y and Z will make his or her presence felt and the seat I hold in parliament will be put at risk&rdquo;, But that is what democracy is about; this is the perfect system.  That is how it should be: there should be no safe seats in any party in any constituency. Rather should the system be refreshed at regular intervals so that the holders of office will apply themselves to the carrying out of their duties in a fashion that they will not have to fear anybody in pursuit of them.  That is the ideal way.  But where the system is stagnate, where this complacency is allowed enter in, where people are guaranteed that instead of what was initially to be a five-year period they will be cushioned if things are not going well for them so that they will get another one, two or three years, unspecified extensions, that is not a very good system.</P>

      <P>I never did it at all.  If the <Col N="1643" /> Minister is happy to set as his standards the inadequacies of any former Governments then he is welcome to them.  That is not the way in which I operate.  One does what is right irrespective of what anybody else did.  We can talk about this until the cows come home and think we are codding the people, but as far as I am concerned there is no justifiable reason ever to postpone local elections.  It happens only when those in power are fearful of the consequences.  That is so, no matter which Government do it.</P>
      <P>Before I was encouraged into other avenues by the Minister of State I was indicating that what is being done now is entirely contrary to what the Government told us in regard to their respect for and anxiety to engage people in the running of the business of the country.  The insincerity, the illogicality and the downright untruthfulness of what is being paraded for us now cannot be unrelated to the purpose behind postponing the by-election in Laois-Offaly.  The Taoiseach said he did not want to confuse the electorate in respect of the European election by holding the local elections simultaneously.  I have a personal interest in not confusing the electorate in that respect, but I cannot see how we would be confusing the electorate in regard to the holding of the European elections on the same day as the local elections and not be confusing them by holding the by-election on the same day as the European election.  That illustrates the insincerity of the Taoiseach in this respect.  I have no doubt that after the European election and when things have made themselves visible, the Taoiseach will find some other justification for again postponing the local elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear occasionally in the House about the different strands of democracy and how they might operate.  Often we go across to Europe and cite what happens in countries there.  It is worth considering the situation until recently in Switzerland, and even now, where not alone do they have these elections but when any matter affecting the democratic <Col N="1644" /> rights of the people arises they are asked to vote.  We do not hear such instances being quoted here now.  We have a denial to the electorate of a right prescribed by statute to elect local representatives once every five years.</P>
    <P>I am not about to generalise on a particular case but I am especially annoyed at the postponement of these elections because, apart from a miscellany of considerations, the elections would have allowed the people of Dublin to give expression to their anxiety and frustration and fear in regard to the water supply. The Department of Health have not yet given us a report on how dangerous it is for the people of Dublin to drink the water with which they are supplied. There is particular concern among the people who receive their supplies from the Leixlip reservoir.  More recently we have read in the newspapers how a new element has appeared in the water supply in Stillorgan where the reservoir is in such a thin state that they may have to ration water there.

The kernel of the matter is that the people are being deprived of their right to flush out or to retain people whom they think are fit to serve on local authorities.

      <P>I have looked for the reformation promised to us by the Minister of State, his senior Minister and the present Minister for Labour.  If I had any indication to date of the nature of such reformation and of the benefits that would accrue therefrom, then I would sit back and wait patiently for these manifestations. None of them has come, none will come.  The truth is that people's rights are being denied to them because we fear what they would tell us.  I suppose that fear is understandable for any inefficient Government, but if that is so, let the Government tell us so.  Do not let them give a veneer of virtue to what is mean and undemocratic.  You can employ people to do that for you, but the gain in it is very short-term and it is a gross injustice and affront to what we call democracy.  It is a gross injustice and insult to the electorate, and the deprivation in it can prove most harmful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the position in respect of men and women, people young and not so young, outside who are looking forward to the local elections as the means by which they can avail of this thing which we call democracy?  Are they to be frustrated? I am sure they are.  Are they to contain their frustration for another year <Col N="1647" /> or two, for this undefined period?  Having established that the Government are postponing the elections on the grounds that they cannot face the electorate, it is fairly obvious to everybody that such grounds will obtain for two, three or maybe five more years.  What about people outside who are waiting in the queue to demonstrate that they are prepared to offer themselves to the people? What are they to do meanwhile?  I do not think that they will be as patient as people here would hope.</P>
    <P>That is all I wish to say on this very important matter.  I suppose there is little point in appealing to the Government to change their mind.  What they are doing they have the power to do.  They have not and should not have the right to do it.  They have the power&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It was not my intention to speak on this debate, but after listening to Fianna Fáil speakers all day I feel I have just a few words to say.  Most Deputies spoke about democracy and the lack of it in postponing local elections.  During my 23 years in this House local elections have been postponed on four occasions. In 1965 they were postponed to 1966 and that matter was not debated for a full day.  In 1966 they were postponed to 1967 and the Opposition of the day accepted that.  In 1973 they were postponed until 1974 and a different Opposition accepted it.  They were postponed in 1974 to 1975 and the same Opposition accepted it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I may have got my years wrong, but not alone were they postponed on one occasion for a year but immediately that year was up they were <Col N="1648" /> postponed for another year.  I cannot understand the lack of trust on the part of the present Opposition or that the same attitude should not apply again when the present Government put forward a reason for the postponement of the elections.</P>
      <P>I listened to a radio news bulletin at 8 o'clock one morning last week and then I heard the same news bulletin at 9 o'clock and again at 10 o'clock.  I could not help but think that the Northern community were very lucky that they had damn all to do with us.  There we were in the Dáil talking about bugging and a by-election in Laois-Offaly when 212,000 people are unemployed, people are looking for houses and we need all the services to mobilise the resources of the State to take us out of our difficulties.  All the Opposition are talking about is the postponing of by-elections and local elections. Where are we going?  What guidance are we giving to both communities in the North of Ireland, especially the community who do not want to join with us and are probably quietly thanking God for being right in their judgment in wanting to have nothing to do with us because when real problems are to be resolved we are Mickey-Mousing about when it is right to hold a by-election or local elections &mdash; as if it is of any moment to the person going to the labour exchange and from whom Deputy Tunney will be looking for a vote in a few months.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The reflex thinking that came into my head was that both communities in the North of Ireland were clapping their hands and saying that they were very fortunate to have had damn all to do with us from the beginning if this is <Col N="1649" /> the leadership we are giving.  If Deputy Tunney wants to debate the democracy of local elections <i>vis-á-vis</i> general elections or whether local elections can prove anything on the performance of a government in power, I will be prepared to debate it with him for as long as he wishes.  He is an experienced Deputy in this House.  He is a man of wisdom and maturity and he knows as well as I do that people vote in local elections for totally different issues.  They vote for the local man, and politics very seldom comes into it.  The hardened party supporter, no matter what his affiliation, will vote on the party ticket, but a surprising thing in local elections is that the basic party vote is much smaller than it is in a general election.</P>
      <P>Therefore, there is no relevance whatever in saying that a Government in power should not postpone local elections because they might be a barometer of the popularity or otherwise of the party in power.  Deputy Tunney knows that well and I am disappointed in the extreme after listening to the type of speech that he, a man so long in this House, has been making for the past hour.  I have always looked on him as someone who could give a particularly interesting point of view to the House.  You might not agree with it, but at least he has thought the matter out well and can put it forward for the consideration of Deputies listening to him.  What brought me into the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just giving my reason. I was sitting in my office and switched on the monitor to find out what was happening in the House.  I listened to Deputy Tunney for about 20 minutes and have never heard him being so ill-informed. He is either filibustering to keep this debate going for some reason which I cannot understand or he is totally out of touch.  A local election is held to elect a local Government &mdash; a county council.  I do not profess to be an authority on what <Col N="1650" /> would happen in the city of Dublin or in my neighbouring counties, Leitrim or Sligo, but I have a fair enough idea of what would happen in county Donegal.</P>
      <P>The people there would agree, including the Fianna Fáil members of the county council, that, by and large, if we had a local election in Donegal at present every candidate offering for re-election would be returned and if there were a change of personnel it would be one member of a political party replacing another member.  Whether we lost or gained 100 votes in an electoral area would prove nothing other than that a candidate went or did not go out to fight for votes.  It would not act as a political barometer that a Government were or were not doing well in office and Deputy Tunney and the other members of the Fianna Fáil Party know this.  There is as little political involvement in a local election as the political system will allow. People are not interested to the same extent in voting for a county councillor &mdash; and here I am speaking about the Donegal people &mdash; in a local election there.  They are not as particular about the politics of a candidate for a county council election as they would be for a Dáil election.</P>
      <P>It is remarkable that the former Senator McGlinchey when first standing for the local elections proposed a Fine Gael candidate and the Fine Gael candidate signed Senator McGlinchey's nomination paper.  That is a matter of public knowledge in County Donegal.  One of those men has gone to his just reward, but Senator McGlinchey had a certain amount of affection towards the person who stood for the Fine Gael Party and the candidate who was not elected &mdash; who was a personal friend of mine &mdash; would often tell me that he did it out of fun &mdash; that there were no real politics about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am at a loss as to why the Fianna Fáil Party, who should be helping the Government to find the proper direction in resolving the problems facing this nation, are not doing so and they disappoint me.  The arguments put forward are that it is wrong for the Government to postpone the elections because if they do, they will be beaten when they go to the <Col N="1651" /> country.  In other words, it is suggested that it is not really in the Opposition's own interest, but in the interests of the two parties in Government to hold these elections.  Nobody would be fooled by that argument.  In the discussions which I have had with Fianna Fáil Deputies and councillors in this matter, nobody is getting hot under the collar about whether or not the elections are postponed.  The back bench Members of the Fianna Fáil Party would willingly and openly admit &mdash; they would certainly not cloak it &mdash; that they are not up in arms against the Government for postponing the elections. I do not know who on the part of the Opposition has taken this decision to have a filibustering debate here, but it does no credit to their party and does not bring any credit on this Parliament. There are far more important things to be debated here and it is time we attended to them.</P>
    <P>Water charges have been given as the reason for the postponement and the Opposition regard these charges as a hot potato, politically speaking.  These charges result not from a fault of this Government, but of the Fianna Fáil Party who, without planning an alternative way of collecting finance and for no good reason, certainly no good economic reason&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As the former Deputy, Seán Collins, would have said &ldquo;It was to get back near the loot, it was to get back into power&rdquo;.  That was the only reason.  The effect of abolishing the rates on very large houses whose owners could have afforded to pay £500, £600 and £1,000 a year, while people living in county council cottages were being charged about £45 a year rates &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Having listened to the debate for the last half hour or so, I am wondering what I can or cannot say.  If I wander from what the Chair thinks I should be saying, I know that he will interrupt me.  This debate is about the Government's reason for postponing the <Col N="1654" /> local elections this year.  It was stated that local elections have been postponed before, and that is true.  However, this postponement is for a very different reason.  The Coalition are afraid of the outcome.  They realise that if the people voiced their opinion on the performance of the Government in the local elections it would be to their detriment.  Even though it might not bring about a general election it would damage the Government considerably.  That is why they have decided to postpone the elections.</P>
      <P>The Minister said they are reforming local government.  Have they started? How far have they got?  Will they reform it before June 1985?  It would take considerably more time than that to have complete reform.  In the meantime the people should have their say in the local elections.  That is democracy.  If we believe in local government and believe it is important, the people should be allowed to voice their opinion and cast a vote in the local elections.</P>
      <P>Tonight at seven o'clock Dublin Corporation will move that the estimates for the coming year be adopted.  I am certain that they will be passed because Fine Gael and Labour have a majority in Dublin Corporation.  This has been so for a number of years.  Speaking of democracy and how we should represent the people, it has been the custom for the Lord Mayor of this city to alternate between Fine Gael and Labour each year.  Now that they will be there for a further year, I wonder how they will resolve the issue and which party the Lord Mayor will be chosen from.  They will have to toss a coin about it.  The second largest party in Dublin Corporation, Fianna Fáil, have not had an opportunity of having one of their councillors being made Lord Mayor for a number of years.  If the Government held the local elections there would be big changes in every local authority.  I disagree with what Deputy Harte said.  They would not hold the chairmanship of many of the local authorities.  They would lose a vast number of seats and that is the main reason why they are not holding the elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Chair has made it clear that he <Col N="1655" /> does not want Deputies to speak about water charges.  Included in the corporation's estimates are water charges. Before I came to the House I had a telephone call from a constituent of mine complaining about the dirty, filthy water coming through the water system in her house and asking why she should have to pay water charges when she cannot get a decent pure supply of water.  It is extraordinary that we will charge people another water charge for the coming year when the majority were not able to pay the last one.  Dublin Corporation only managed to collect £800,000 out of the £3.5 million they needed.  How are they going to collect that money this year?</P>
    <P>Deputy Harte said it would not make any difference to those on the labour whether there were local elections.  It would make a hell of a lot of difference to some of them because the environmental works improvement scheme brought in in 1977, which proved to be a great success and employed many people over the years, will be devastated this year.  In 1983 a total of £4.8 million was expended by the corporation under this scheme.  This sum was fully recouped by the Government.  This year the Government have indicated that an allocation of only £1.6 million will be available to the corporation.  The present work force of the environmental works section is 319 and it would require a sum of £3.8 million to retain this number in employment during 1984.  The Government allocation of £1.6 million will be fully expended by the end of May.  Due to current financial constraints the corporation are not in a position to provide for the continued employment of these men after that date unless additional Government funding is received.</P>

      <P>I was replying to a remark Deputy Harte made that it would not matter one bit to those on the labour <Col N="1656" /> whether there were local elections.  If this is the policy of the Government, it would make a great deal of difference.</P>
      <P>There have been cut-backs to the local authorities.  They now have to find money which should have been provided by central Government.  Over the years we have been providing small community buildings in the Dublin area.  In 1984 one single such building will be provided.  This is at a time when we have so many young people unemployed and so much hardship in homes with many women under great financial stress.  Small community buildings would be an exceptional help in local communities.  People would have a place to go to talk to each other, have a cup of coffee and bring their children; but we have not any money for that.  The provision of play centres has been almost brought to a standstill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EileenLemass" hpid="Mrs. Lemass Mrs. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do it tomorrow so. The Government are not calling the local elections because we all know they will lose a great number of seats.  It is only fair that the Government give the people an opportunity to voice their opinion.  I know the result would not be good as far as the Coalition are concerned and that is why they are afraid to allow the people to cast their votes next June.  Deputy Tunney asked them to reconsider their decision but I do not suppose they will at this stage.  I hope the same thing does not happen in 1985 if times do not improve and the Government are of the opinion that they will not get a good result in local elections.  If that is the case it is on the cards that they will be postponed until 1986, when the Government would be very near a general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all missing an opportunity to give the people a chance to criticise the Government.  Criticism is needed, and it might not do the Government any harm to hear the voice of the people and to realise that their policies, which are causing such drastic unemployment and hardship, are not acceptable.  It might do them all the good in the world to hold local elections and perhaps they would come <Col N="1657" /> to the conclusion that their policies have to be changed.  It will do no good at all to postpone the elections and probably will do them harm.  We are restricted to a very narrow debate here but we know why the local elections are not being held. The Government should admit they are not holding them because of fear of the electorate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend speaking in this debate but having heard some of the contribution from Government benches I felt I must comment.  The Government are very good at lecturing us on this side of the House, telling us to be responsible and not to cause increased difficulties.  They do not like us performing our duty as the party in opposition.</P>
      <P>I should like to believe the reasons which the Minister for the Environment gave for deferring local elections.  Unfortunately, I cannot do so because of events last year when I listened to members of the Government party discussing local elections and whether they would be held.  There was divided opinion regarding that issue but it is clear that the Taoiseach's commitment to holding local elections was genuine and sincere.  If the local elections had been held on the same day as the European elections it would have ensured the public casting their vote for the Euro candidates at the same time as they were voting for the local government candidate.  Unfortunately, events since then changed the minds of some people &mdash; perhaps not the Taoiseach's mind &mdash; and I refer to the by-election in Dublin. The people there had an opportunity of showing the Government their dissatisfaction with them and they did so in a very efficient way which did not suit the Government, the Labour Party in particular. The result of the Dublin by-election had a very important bearing on the decision of the Minister to defer local elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is need for reform in the area of local government but that does not justify the Government deferring local elections. One would think that because the elections are put off for 12 months or two years everything in the local government area will become very straightforward in <Col N="1658" /> a short time.  The Minister and the Government have had a number of opportunities to show their genuine concern for reform in local government but they did not do so.  Fianna Fáil opposed legislation which was passed last year with regard to local government charges and we asked the Minister and the Government to allow councillors to decide where a charge would be made. We were outvoted on that issue, which is another indication of the hypocrisy of the Minister and the Government, who have tried to pull the wool over our eyes in saying there is no need for local elections.</P>
    <P>The Government are appointing assistant secretaries and other civil servants to bodies and boards.  This is taking responsibility away from public representatives and those elected by the people.  We intend to play our role here and we will not be intimidated by Government speakers who have accused us of being awkward and irresponsible in looking for local elections.  We are only seeking the democratic right of the people to elect representatives at local elections as they do in general elections.</P>
    <P>Some speakers stated that over the last five years councillors of the Government parties had performed very well and that they had carried out their duties at local government level.  I accept that, but I wonder how those same Deputies can vote for the postponement of local elections when on one hand they are saying councillors are doing a good job and on the other that they want elections postponed. It is very clear that the Government are afraid to face the people.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is on record as asking the people to have confidence in him for our future; yet he lost confidence when he was faced with a decision.  Everybody knew that the Taoiseach wanted to hold local elections because it was an opportunity to save expenditure.  If there were no Euro elections there might be some justification for deferring them, but the Government could have gone ahead and held the local elections on the same day. The confidence of the people in this Government is at the lowest possible level.  It was stated by a speaker opposite that this Government should be praised <Col N="1659" /> for their efforts to tackle the problems of the country.  The people do not feel the same way.</P>
    <P>Before this Government took office they said they would tackle the problems, that there would be no health or education cuts.  They were aware of the problems but when they took office they claimed they did not know things were so bad.  They were irresponsible in the promises they made.  We in Cork were told that Fine Gael would make Cork a force again.  I would ask Members to look at the condition of that city.  Government indecision and lack of interest in Cork is very clear.</P>
    <P>It is the greatest hypocrisy to say that the Government do not want the local elections because they want to carry out reforms.  There is gross dissatisfaction among the public regarding the performance of the Government.  They should not use side issues as an excuse to defer the elections.</P>
    <P>The country faces very real problems which are the responsibility of all of us. Government Deputies should stop saying that we are behaving in an irresponsible manner in using our democratic right to call for local elections.  They should look up the statements they made while in Opposition and realise how contradictory their contributions to this debate have been.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with three aspects of local government in the context of the postponement of the local elections.  There has been a lack of action by the Department of the Environment and the Government in relation to the pollution of Dublin Bay, the ecology movement and the relevance of environment to employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin Bay has become an open sewer and year after year it is claimed by the Department of the Environment, Dublin Corporation and the Dublin Port and Docks Board that bathing is safe.  It may well be safe in outlying areas such as Skerries, Portmarnock and Malahide but it certainly is not safe at Seapoint, Sandymount or Dollymount where the levels of pollution are very high.  It is a <Col N="1660" /> tragedy that in a city such as ours we have local authorities who have in some cases ignored the obviously high levels of pollution.</P>
    <P>The EEC published Directive No. 76/160 concerning the quality of bathing water and it is to be regretted that the Government have not ratified this excellent document, although it does contain some faults.  The directive concerns the quality of bathing water, with the exception of water used for therapeutic purposes and water used in swimming pools.</P>

      <P>Dublin Corporation have a responsibility for the ultimate cleanliness of the water and the environment of the city as well as for the general improvement of living conditions of citizens in the city and county.  The Government recognise that they have done nothing to improve environmental standards in the Dublin area.  Dublin Bay is polluted and the EEC directive has not been ratified by the Minister for the Environment. Consequently the Government have not given Dublin Corporation the authority to carry out their responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have postponed a by-election and, even more important, they have postponed the local elections.  The people will not be allowed to give their verdict on the issues to which I had intended to refer: the environment, pollution, the ecology movement here and in Europe generally.  The Minister's office is in the Custom House which is one of the finest examples of its type. There has been a hoarding around the Custom House in the middle of the city for the past three or four years.  Apparently some of the stones in the upper <Col N="1662" /> regions of the building are falling down. It is symbolic of this Government that the Department of the Environment are running away from their responsibilities.</P>

      <P>At a time when we have 67,500 people unemployed in Dublin city and county the local elections are being postponed for the obvious reason that the Government know they have no possibility of winning.  They have treated the people with contempt.  There is a lack of funding for local authorities. There is a lack of acceptance in the Department of the Environment of the various directives which would help and assist the local authorities.  It seems quite extraordinary that, at a time when the people need an outlet to point the finger at the Government, they are being forbidden to cast their votes, apart from the European elections.  The Government have run from one issue after another. They are afraid.  To put it in a Dublin manner, they have funked the issues and, in so doing, they have destroyed whatever credibility they had left after only one year in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the ecology movement, we are far behind the ecology <Col N="1664" /> movements in Germany, France and elsewhere.  The environment is an issue of major importance.  In the local elections we would have had an opportunity to discuss all these issues with the public. Unfortunately that opportunity is being taken away from us.  We may not have local elections for three or four years. Judging by the way the Government are behaving, they may find some suitable security reason to suspend the Constitution and not hold a general election.  We will then have the ultimate dictatorship. That would be a regrettable and retrograde step.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It was approved by the Minister's inspector and that is to be regretted.  We have a great responsibility in this area because local democracy is very important.  Local authorities are in a desperate position in regard to finance and the Government are suggesting many ways of dealing with that problem including organising lotteries.  I suppose the next thing they will suggest to county <Col N="1667" /> councils is that they establish gambling casinos.  It is hard to know what the Government will come up with next. They certainly are not in the business of reorganising local authorities.  That is not the reason why the local elections are being postponed.  In my view those elections are being postponed because the Government rightly fear what the people will decide.  They have learned a lesson from the by-election in Dublin Central where Deputy Tom Leonard was returned.  He received a massive vote and that amounted to a vote of no confidence in the two Government parties.  The electorate in that constituency indicated to the Government in no uncertain manner that they were not wanted and should get out.</P>
      <P>However, there is a light at the end of the tunnel in the form of the European elections on 14 June.  I have no doubt that in those elections there will be a massive vote of no confidence in the Government.  They will get a message to remove themselves from office because of their inept way of managing our affairs.  Rarely have we had a Government who have feared the electorate so much and who are afraid to present themselves in a by-election.  The Government are aware that the majority Fianna Fáil received in 1977 will be repeated if local elections are held in June.  That would mean that the Government parties would lose local authority chairmanships, privileges and perks.  They would lose the positions of mayor in major cities, including Dublin.  The Government are also aware that a loss in the local elections would mean that they would not have many councillors to vote in the Seanad election.  Above all they are aware that they would lose prestige.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have ignored the wishes of the people.  Our environment is a mess.  Dublin inner city is falling down and little is being done for the people in that area.  Directives from the EEC about such work are being ignored and local authority schemes have not been approved.  The Government have received a directive from the EEC on the <Col N="1668" /> question of bathing places and the quality of bathing water, and local authorities would like to have that directive.</P>

I do not know if they do anything collectively because the Taoiseach does not seem to know what the Ministers are doing and Ministers do not know what their colleagues are doing and I think that is one of the reaons why they are running away from the people.  It is symptomatic. We had the Mallon phone tapping.</P>

      <P>I am trying to show how the Taoiseach has lost control over his Ministers and as a consequence of that he is afraid to allow a debate to take place among the people on the streets, a debate with candidates in local elections. The Government are split.  They will be defeated by the people in the local elections. They will be destroyed by the people in the local elections and no amount of half truths, no amount of innuendoes or hints or suggestions about the Government, the Opposition or <Col N="1673" /> anybody else will work because the propaganda machine has ground to a halt.  It has been discredited and I am glad to stand here and watch its demise.  The postponement of the local elections is symptomatic of the fear that machine has in presenting candidates on behalf of Fine Gael or Labour to the people.  The Fine Gael people are obviously aware of the position within their own party.</P>

The people over there do not have splits. They have formulas and the formula they have put together has been a disaster for the country and certainly a disaster for the local authorities.  It is to be deeply regretted.</P>
      <P>The Government have postponed the local elections with a very good reason from their point of view.  They have shown themselves to be a failure.  I do not think it is unreasonable that they should acknowledge they have been a failure.  The reason they have postponed the elections is that they know in their hearts the people want to get at them. They know in their hearts that people are sick to death of them.  Basically they have been discredited.  That is why they do not want to hold the local elections.  We have been the victims of whispering campaigns over the years.</P>

      <P>I am sorry.  I have been a little bit lost because of the rather rowdy Members on the Government benches.  The motion is designed to allow a thorough-going review of local government. How many reviews of local government are we going to have before a decision is reached?  We have white papers and green papers and every other kind of paper, this paper and that paper, and we have the former Chairman of Dublin County Council and we have the former Lord Mayor of Dublin, and a good Lord Mayor he was, a better Lord Mayor than he was a Minister.  You were a very good Lord Mayor and, I have often said it, you were possibly one of the best.</P>

He is probably one of the people who should still be chairman of Dublin County Council rather than in here.

He happily had Mr. Tully remove me from his bailiwick, and then he was safely ensconced.  I do not regret that decision at all except that I did lose the people in Ballybrack and Cabinteely and the other side of the Stillorgan Road.  Three thousand of those lovely votes made it a little <Col N="1675" /> more difficult because they went from me.  But I will take them up now in the European election.  It seems to me a tragedy that, with all the money, all the work, all the expertise, we will now spend another two years without local authority elections.  I will lay a pound to a penny that there will be no election next year because if things go on the way they are going there will not be any country left. The morale of the people will be destroyed if it is not already beyond repair.  The people are not prepared to allow their children to grow up in a community that is without hope for them. They will not allow their children to grow up in a community deprived of such basic things as swimming facilities.

They have lost touch with the people and with reality.  Rarely in the history of this State have we seen a Government run away from all their responsibilities.  They have failed in their duty with regard to local democracy, planning, the environment and housing. The people would like an opportunity to pass judgment on the Government by way of the local elections but the Government are afraid to accept that challenge.

Those speakers spoke of a discredited Government who are running away from their responsibilities, running from the local elections in June because they know the people would give them their comeuppance. They know the local authorities would be taken over by Fianna Fáil, that they would be run properly and that pressure would then be put on the Government to sort out the problems facing the local authorities.  The Government know their number is up.  They are afraid, and <Col N="1678" /> no wonder.  They have been incompetent in dealing with local authorities.  In Dublin city and county the basic fabric of the environment is collapsing.  There are many derelict sites, there is sewage on the doorsteps and the excellent work of the Department of Fisheries and Forestry in regard to the environment has been stopped.  Planning permissions have been granted for sites on the sides of beautiful mountains, thus destroying the scenic amenities.  What has been happening is a tragedy beyond belief.  The Government have not the imagination, the will or the courage to accept their responsibilities.</P>

      <P>The European elections <Col N="1681" /> will be their answer.  That is where Fine Gael will meet their Waterloo, when the Battle of Clontarf will take place, because the Government will be positively dealt with by the people from whom they have run away on different occasions and from whom they continue to run away.  They continue to portray nonsense and rubbish as something they are doing or are about to do, about something they will not do and have no intention of doing.  They continue to talk on televison about the lovely ideas and concepts they have, but they do nothing.  It is a &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; Government slipping on orange peels destroying themselves.</P>
      <P>The tragedy of that is that in the process they are destroying the people of Ireland and their morale.  The people are not afraid to take a look into their hearts and see the necessity for some stern measures, but they are not prepared to be made the victims of public relations activities; they are not prepared to be deceived by them.  They see the tragedy of this country amply reflected in the motion before us.  It is a total reflection of the failure of this disastrous Government, made up in the main of decent people who unfortunately have not the capacity to undertake the job needed to be done and to utilise our resources for our people.  They have had a disastrous first year.  I have no doubt but that their ensuing years will be equally disastrous. But hopefully the message will be clearly received from the people that they do not want them any more on June 14, which is the only opportunity they will be given, all the others having been taken from them by this Government.  That is the tragedy of local democracy having been swept away for some spurious reason, as if we did not have sufficient ideas on how to reform government.

      <P>If the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach wants to be sarcastic, that is his business; but as far as I am concerned I can stand over anything I say in this House.  I might say that never have I run away from anything, whether it was in Laois-Offaly or anywhere else, and I will not run away from my responsibilities.  Putting off the evil day is not the issue here.  Rather is it the cowardice of the Government to face the public on the real issues.</P>
      <P>In 1979 we did the right thing &mdash; we tested the people.  There were many disputes in those days.  We had them in the local authorities and in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  People did not endorse our policies on any local authority. But I always accept the ballot box.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view, local elections will not be held next year.  There will be more lovely phraseology, more opportunism.  We will be told that the Government are waiting for further submissions from local authorities in regard to reforms.  There will be another stalling operation to put off the evil day.  Last year we had the Minister for Foreign Affairs saying that the local elections would be held in conjunction with the European election. When the Government came to office they spoke about financial rectitude but it would seem now that has gone out the window.  Survival is now the name of the game.  They have taken a U-turn.  There <Col N="1684" /> will be many others and we will be prepared for them.</P>
    <P>If the local elections were held coincidentally with the European election the Exchequer would be saved a considerable amount of money.  Earlier this year the Taoiseach said he did not want to distract the electorate or, to use more lovely phraseology, he did not want to confuse them by holding the local and European elections coincidentally.  Last week he decided to oppose the moving of the write for the Laois/Offaly by-election towards the end of March, and the Minister of State, Deputy Barrett, said the election would be held on 14 June, the day of the European election.  That is very confusing.  It is all right when it suits in one way but it is all wrong the other way.  I want to assure Deputy Dowling that we will treat him extremely well in Laois-Offaly, with courtesy and kindness. The people there will give their information through the ballot box.</P>
    <P>The postponement of the local elections means that the electorate are not being given a chance to voice their opinions not alone in regard to members of my party but in regard to Deputy Dowling and others.  The people of Laois-Offaly have looked after me for many years and when Deputy Dowling is as long representing those people he can say a little.  I have tested the people's opinion at local authority and national level and even when the wind was blowing in my face the people decided I should continue to represent that famous constituency.  I am glad the people have honoured me over so many years.</P>
    <P>I always like to see a good test, to see how I am doing apart from anything else. You cannot beat the voice of the people who take the pens in their hands on election day and decide.  The people are entitled to the opportunity to voice their opinions, especially at local level.  There are many grave matters coming up for debate.  Offaly County Council have taken very important decisions.  The Labour and Fine Gael members of that authority at last month's meeting decided to put 198 workers on short time.  They may ask what did I do when I was in O'Connell Bridge House and when the <Col N="1685" /> Minister, Deputy Ray Burke, was in the Custom House.  I was in O'Connell Bridge House and I had some happy moments there.  When I went to that Department I had a look around and very quickly I realised that local authorities were suffering from a serious shortfall of funds because of the previous Government who had underestimated seriously. Subsequently, every week I met representatives of local authorities in the period between April and June.  Deputy Burke and I made additional moneys available to maintain employment and to have important works carried out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the abolition of the rates?  The Deputy never made up the shortfall then.</P>

I was not a week in the place when I saw that and we were quick to rectify it.</P>

      <P>Yesterday a reference was made to the ESRI and their warning about the proper assessment of a cost-benefit analysis of all arterial drainage.  I emphasise, as I was doing yesterday when the debate was adjourned, that it is important also to take cognisance of what the most recent ESRI report on employment says.  It says that the £500 million spent on unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance and redundancy is equalled by £500 million more through loss of income tax, social insurance revenue and indirect taxation.  Therefore, it is shortsighted policy to cut down on productive schemes of arterial drainage and to lay people off, because the State is losing on several fronts.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance pointed out yesterday that the expenditure provision for arterial drainage in 1984 was £11.650 million.  The outturn for 1983 was £11.817 million, so that we have a reduction there already of £167,000.  These figures are in the summary of the Public Capital Programme 1984 which was issued by the Minister.  Taking inflation into account there is a further £1.1 million reduction based on a 10 per cent inflation rate. Therefore, there is no point in coming in here and saying that everything is rosy with regard to arterial drainage and that we are maintaining our expenditure levels. We are not maintaining our expenditure levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention was made also of the Boyne scheme and that it was within 10 per cent of completion.  I want to call attention to one river in the Boyne catchment area. I think the figure given to Deputy Conaghan in answer to a parliamentary question during the week was that only 10 per cent of the Boyne drainage scheme remained to be completed.  I refer to the Killinkere river which has been the subject of debate between the local people and their public representatives, the local <Col N="1687" /> authority and the OPW for many years. I appeal now to the Minister of State &mdash; I have mentioned this to him privately already on one occasion &mdash; to include that Killinkere river in that scheme before he pulls up stumps and moves away from the Boyne-Killinkere area.  It is probably inexpensive to finish.  The cost-benefit analysis, due to the industry of the people in the area, could not but show that the State would gain from finishing that scheme.  It is the area from Lough Ramor to about 400 yards downstream to a bridge called Lundy's bridge, although I do not want to emphasise the man's name.  In June 1978 the OPW wrote to Cavan County Council saying that the river would certainly be drained. Deputy McEllistrim confirmed this when he was in charge of the OPW.  Therefore, I make that strong appeal to fit it in before the Board of Works move out of the general Boyne area.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Ulster Blackwater in a joint effort between South and North is to be drained.  I gather that the southern section for purposes of outfall must be done first.  I understand that the scheme is prepared, and I am pleased about this, not merely for its economic consequences but for its social consequences also.  I will have more to say about that when I come to the Erne catchment area in which also I have a strong interest.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance outlined the criteria that were worked out in connection with the Maigue scheme when he was speaking here last night.  He gave four headings in his speech and of them the Erne catchment area would come out on top.  The first question is whether the scheme will achieve its objectives.  I will not give the answers because they are obvious.  Will the achievement of the objectives represent an economic return on the investment?  Could the objectives of the scheme be achieved more economically by alternative means?  There are no alternative means for draining the Erne catchment area.  What principles of use for assessing future schemes might be observed from the analysis?  That is a matter of putting the philosophy together.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1688" /> We are now fast developing paranoia. We are wondering whether anybody cares a tinker's curse about the Border or Border areas.  We have appealed time and time again across the floor of this House from every political party for special consideration for the Border area. We have not got it and it seems we will not get it in the near future.  Every single Department that was affected from Finance up or down, depending on your rating of Finance, we have made appeals to.  For that reason there is a special obligation on the Government to consider the Erne drainage scheme.</P>
    <P>I will go quickly through some of the points I want to make because I have only a short time to do so.  The area covers 4,375 square kilometers, that is 5.2 per cent of the area of all Ireland.  It is the fourth largest river catchment area in Ireland.  More than 130,000 people are living in the area.  The population density is low.  Emigration has been hitting this area, mainly because they have no work on the land, which is flooded for a large portion of the year.  Of all the farms in the Republic, 19 per cent are there and also 34 per cent of all the farms in the North.  The size of the farms is 20 hectares or less with 78 per cent of them in the Southern part and the rest in the Northern part.  As I have said in this House, there is potential for tourism in the area.  Upper and Lower Lough Erne, Lough Oughter, rivers or canals connecting the Erne scheme with the Shannon scheme would have tremendous potential for that if the basic drainage was done. In the 1950 Act certain regulatory levels were settled for Upper and Lower Lough Erne in connection with the generation of electricity.  With goodwill and commitment this can be undertaken and achieved.  The Social and Economic Committee of the EEC might even succeed in getting a 75 per cent funding from the EEC for that project.  That is another reason for my appealing to the Minister and his Minister of State to have a strong look at this whole scene.  FEOGA gave 50 per cent for drainage in the west and the Regional Development Fund gave 30 per cent as far as the Maigue was concerned. There is a possibility that we may get 75 per cent for the Erne scheme in <Col N="1689" /> our area.  The Blackwater scheme points the way.</P>
    <P>I said that there were economic reasons and that the cost-benefit analysis will stand up.  Above all, there are social and political reasons why this project should be undertaken.  The obscene murders, hatred and destruction going on the Six Counties at the moment could, in a sense, have a counterweight in this large cooperative scheme which we are urging on the Government.  As I said, the Blackwater is an indication of what can be done.  It is a sop in ionad na scuaibe.  The Erne is the huge scheme which, from a farming point of view, from the point of view of the economy, both North and South, from the point of view of tourism and of political and social development must command&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance last evening made it quite clear that we, on this side of the House, are not seeking to evade the issues raised by the Opposition motion. We have not sought to introduce our own amendment but are tackling the motion head on, confident that the facts will establish that, despite the present stringent financial circumstances, provision has been made to maintain an adequate arterial drainage programme in 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before dealing directly with arterial drainage, I would like to say a few words in relation to the general economic situation. Deputies from all sides of the House are well aware of the present state of the country's finances and of the need for rigid control in order to set the <Col N="1690" /> economy on the road to recovery.  The Government have made substantial progress on this front and the future economic outlook is far more encouraging now than when this Government first came into office.  I make this point purely to set this motion in context.  I do not propose to hide behind these facts when dealing with this subject, but neither do I intend to conveniently forget the overall economic situation which obviously has a bearing and which the Opposition have ignored.</P>
    <P>When one considers the arterial drainage programme in the context of the overall economic situation, a different scenario emerges.  It would be unrealistic to expect that a massive injection of funds to arterial drainage could be made available this year.  The reality is, that despite the constraints imposed by our economic situation, the Government have made a significant allocation to arterial drainage in 1984.  In terms of the historical treatment of arterial drainage in regard to financial allocations, this year compares favourably with the trend in recent years.</P>
    <P>I would like to highlight some aspects of the funding of arterial drainage by successive Governments which the Opposition have conveniently chosen to ignore.  Firstly, there has been a consistent history of underfunding by successive Governments.  This is reflected in the length of time which many of the schemes are taking to be completed.  The Boyne drainage scheme was commenced in 1969 and was originally due for completion in 1979.  The Maigue scheme commenced in 1973 and was originally due for completion in 1981.  The principal explanation for these situations is that insufficient funds were supplied by successive Governments to the Commissioners of Public Works over a long period to have these schemes completed on target, both timewise and costwise.  In the light of these facts, I find it rather hard to take some of what the Opposition have said on this subject.  It would seem that the previous record of what has been spent on arterial drainage has been forgotten for the purposes of this debate and that this Government are being blamed for what is really a long-term problem which <Col N="1691" /> has been fuelled by the policies of successive Governments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy and listened to a lot of rubbish from him last night.  The Minister for Finance has dealt comprehensively with the question of the overall funding of the entire arterial drainage service since 1978.  The Opposition have chosen to concentrate their criticism on the employment aspect of the current drainage programme.  I freely accept that the employment issue is extremely important and I propose, therefore, to give the House the facts relating to that particular aspect.  Deputies will recognise that not all of the money allocated to the arterial drainage services relates directly to the creation and maintenance of employment. Substantial sums are necessarily allocated to and expended on related ancillary services such as the purchase of machinery, collection of data about river flows and studies of special problems that arise in the course of preparing a drainage scheme.  Effectively, employment is created only when the actual construction works are put in hands.  This activity is funded from subhead G2 of the Vote for Public Works and Buildings of the Office of Public Works.  Let me, therefore, put on the record the amounts made available for this subhead down through the years from 1978 to 1983 and these will be very interesting.  I would point out that these figures have been brought to present day values.  I want to stress that point. They are as follows: 1978 &mdash; £9,043,000, 1979 &mdash; £8,771,000, 1980 &mdash; £9,874,000, 1981 &mdash; £11,148,000, 1982 &mdash; £11,030,000, 1983 &mdash; £11,200,000.  I must again emphasise that these figures are in constant 1983 terms.  Turning now to the 1984 provision of £10.95 million, this represents a decrease of only 2¼ per cent on last year's provision of £11.2 million, which in fact was the highest ever provision for drainage construction works in the history of this State.  I anticipate that the Opposition may seek to belittle the <Col N="1692" /> G2 1984 provision but, here again, thanks to the policies of the present Government, which have succeeded in effecting a dramatic cut in inflation rates, I must point out that the provision, in real terms is, as the Minister for Finance pointed out yesterday, a generous one.</P>
      <P>Let me now draw the attention of the House to the amounts provided for this service from 1978 to 1980 when the Opposition were in Government and let me repeat again that we are speaking in 1983 values.  The amounts provided in each of those years was less than £10 million.  This was the supposed era of plentiful cash when money was freely available and more freely spent on all sorts of projects, few of which could claim to be as soundly based in economic terms as arterial drainage.  Indeed, the current allocation, as I have indicated, compares very favourably with the amounts made available by the Opposition when in Government.</P>
      <P>We are providing almost £11 million this year while, as recently as 1980, the Opposition &mdash; then in Government &mdash; provided less than £10 million again, let me emphasise in 1983 terms.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>How then can the Opposition sustain a charge that the Government are not providing finance to maintain an adequate arterial drainage programme?  If there is criticism to be made, it is that successive Governments over many years have not provided the funds necessary to ensure that the various schemes were operated at the optimum rate to get full value for the investment. However, when all is said and done, I think I have demonstrated from the figures I have quoted that in these difficult times the Government have treated and are treating arterial drainage more generously than did the Opposition when they were in power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must come back again to the fact that the present is a time of financial stringency. Yet, in the late seventies and early eighties Fianna Fáil were prepared to make money available left, right and centre for projects, many of which were <Col N="1693" /> of dubious merit.  Despite this fact, the level of expenditure on arterial drainage during those years, in 1983 terms again, was below the £11.20 million allocated by the Coalition Government last year and compares favourably with the allocation for this year.  It would seem to me that if the Fianna Fáil Party were genuinely committed to arterial drainage in times when money was abundantly available there would have been a greater allocation for arterial drainage in those years. In addition, I think that their attitude at present of ignoring the economic realities and the vastly different situation in relaation to the availability of money leaves them open to charges of political opportunism at the very least.</P>
    <P>Despite what I have said already and which I have put on the record in the interests of a more balanced presentation than that being given by the Opposition, I would not like to give the impression that I am entirely happy with the situation in relation to arterial drainage.  It is of particular concern to me as a Labour Minister to find myself in a situation where men are being laid off.  The reality of such a situation is only too well known to me.  However, there are some points in relation to the present redundancies which must be stressed.  Arterial drainage, by its very nature, provides temporary employment only for the bulk of those working on the schemes.  Schemes start initially at a very low level of employment, then gradually build up to a peak which then tapers down as the schemes draw to a close.  There is some element of tapering down in the redundancies which are proposed and no amount of additional finance could have prevented this.</P>
    <P>Furthermore it appears to me, from what has been said, that the Opposition see something sinister and unusual in laying off men on schemes which are in progress.  The plain fact of the matter is that men have always been laid off when works move from their own areas.  For example, the Boyne scheme stretches from above Edenderry in Offaly, where the works were carried out some time ago up to Deputy Wilson's constituency in <Col N="1694" /> County Cavan where work is in progress at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Let the Minister not forget the Killinkere river.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>In the ordinary way, the men employed from the Edenderry area would be laid off when their sector of the scheme is completed.  In other words, there is a continuing turnover of the labour force as the points of operation move with the progress of the works.  This process is accelerated as the scheme tapers to an end.</P>
      <P>If unlimited finance had been available to the Government this year, there is no doubt that greater progress could have been made in the schemes and some of the redundancies avoided.  However, I would submit that despite this fact the Government's strategy is the best one to follow.  Unlimited financial inputs to drainage would have ensured that 90 per cent of the drainage workers on the Boyne, Maigue and Corrib/Mask/Robe would probably have been laid off in the next year to 18 months.  Such a large number of lay-offs in a particular area at one time would have a serious impact on the local economies of the areas involved. There is merit in phasing the redundancies over a lengthier period in order to lessen their overall impact.  I can appreciate, however, that such a claim is obviously one which is arguable.  Another point worth bearing in mind, however, is that if these schemes had originally been sufficiently funded by Fianna Fáil we would not now have this problem of stretching scarce resources to complete them.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy and he said some very foolish things which I shall deal with later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point I want to take up is the numbers being made redundant.  Deputy McEllistrim repeatedly alleged here yesterday evening that 300 men were being made redundant because of a cut-back in the finance being made available.  This is <Col N="1695" /> nonsense.  I do not know how he could be under such a misapprehension.  The figure is nearer to 100 men.  As was made quite clear yesterday by the Minister for Finance, 140 men have been or are being let go this year but some of these are being let go because of the winding down of works.  In fact, the figure of 140 men includes 26 men laid off in January on the Corrib/Mask scheme because of the state of works there and the labour requirement at that time.  This reduces the number of workers being made redundant for financial reasons to 114 but there will be a small increase in the work force on the Boyne and Bonet schemes so that in round figures 100 redundancies only can be put down to lack of finance.  So much for Deputy McEllistrim's 300.</P>
    <P>This is a far cry from what Deputy McEllistrim repeatedly alleged here yesterday. The current arterial drainage programme is alive and well and continues to give employment to a very substantial work force of 750 men on the construction side and 300 men on the maintenance side.  The allegation was made by Deputies Noonan and Wilson yesterday that the reduction achieved in the numbers which it was originally thought would have to be made redundant should be attributed to pressure from Fianna Fáil and the trade unions.  This is a complete misrepresentation of the situation and the view suggested from the Opposition benches is a poorly thought out exercise in political opportunism.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance refuted that allegation in his speech and I would now like to put on the record how it became possible to make that reduction in the numbers laid off.  The money to save those 90 jobs was originally earmarked as part of our contribution to the cost of works in Northern Ireland which will provide an outfall into Lough Neagh for flood waters from the Monaghan Blackwater. The programme for those works is monitored at regular meetings between officials from my office and officials from the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland.  From those contacts it became clear a few weeks ago that the amount which we would be expected to <Col N="1696" /> pay for those works in Northern Ireland in 1984 would be less than had been forecast by the Northern Ireland authorities and it was possible, therefore, to divert the saving to the on-going schemes in the Republic.  It was as simple as that and there is no basis for the suggestion that I or the Minister for Finance was forced to bow to pressure from any quarter.</P>
    <P>While I am on the subject of cross-Border drainage I want to reiterate the present position as outlined by the Minister for Finance yesterday.  As I have said, there has been close co-operation between my office and the Northern Ireland authorities in the planning of the entire scheme so that the two parts will dovetail exactly.  This entailed our preparing a scheme for County Monaghan under the 1945 Act and the Northern Ireland authorities preparing a complementary scheme under their legislation. The two schemes have been brought along to the final stages required by the respective legislation and regulations. The Northern Ireland authorities are examining tenders which they received in mid-February on the basis that they would place a contract within 90 days. We, for our part, have considered the observations of affected land owners in County Monaghan and when the statutory period for the county councils' observations expires on 9 March, the way will be open to deal with those observations and to submit the scheme to the Minister for Finance for confirmation under the Act.  Indications are that no insuperable obstacles are foreseen on either side and I expect the confirmation of the scheme to coincide with the placing of a contract for the first stage of the works in Northern Ireland.  As I mentioned, there is money available to meet our commitment in 1984 and provision will be made in 1985 and in the following years as necessary.</P>
    <P>It was Deputy Wilson, I think, who challenged what the Minister for Finance said about maintenance of completed schemes.  The Deputy implied that the cost of maintenance should not come into the reckoning since the expenditure is met by the county councils.  I want to put the Deputy right on this matter.  The cost <Col N="1697" /> of maintaining completed drainage schemes is a charge in the first instance on Subhead G.3 of the Vote for Public Works and Buildings.  The commissioners are required by statute to maintain the completed schemes to ensure that the capacity to give protection from flooding is not impaired by the passage of time.  In fact, the commissioners will spend £4 million on this service this year and, as I said, will give employment to about 300 men.  The amount spent is demanded back from the county councils but in present circumstances the councils depend heavily on Government subvention to meet those demands.  It would be fair to say, from my experience of county councils &mdash; I have been a member of Kildare County Council for many years &mdash; that at the present time the cost of maintenance is, in fact, borne by the State although the repayments are channelled through the county councils.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson had some disparaging remarks to make about the review of arterial drainage mentioned by the Minister for Finance yesterday.  I want to take up this matter now to refute the suggestion that the review is a convenient way of putting off hard decisions.  The programme of arterial drainage on the entire catchment basis with which we are all familiar has been running since the passing of the 1945 Arterial Drainage Act. The 40 years that have passed since the Act became law have seen many changes and developments.  There have been developments in engineering methods, in economic techniques, in employment and trade union codes, in environmental considerations and especially in agriculture. In line with those developments the methods employed in designing, assessing and executing drainage works have evolved to meet changing needs and I think an excellent job has been done with the resources made available.</P>
    <P>It is only right and proper, however, that every now and then those who are engaged in a complicated long-term programme like arterial drainage should stop and look closely at what they have been doing and how they have been doing it. It is a good idea to re-examine from time to time the standards which have been <Col N="1698" /> accepted down through the years &mdash; the standard of flood protection, the standards by which the economics of schemes should be measured, the standards against which environmental impact should be viewed.  These and other aspects of drainage are at present being reviewed by the commissioners.</P>
    <P>Arterial drainage is a subject of great interest not only to Deputies &mdash; their interest is amply demonstrated in this House frequently &mdash; but also to economists, agricultural and fishery bodies and to environmentalists.  Specialists in these fields publish their views on drainage and it is important that their views should receive due consideration.  The Economic and Social Research Institute published a major study on &ldquo;Land Drainage Policy in Ireland&rdquo; in July 1982.  That study questioned some of the standards and practices employed up to now in arterial drainage and the Government decided that the time had come to review the whole basis of arterial drainage.  As I said, the review which has been undertaken by the Commissioners on lines agreed with the Department of Finance is almost complete and will be available to the Government this summer.  I might mention in passing that this is not the first time that drainage has been the subject of a close study.  The Minister for Finance yesterday mentioned the Browne Commission which sat from 1938 to 1940 and made recommendations which form the basis of the 1945 Arterial Drainage Act. There were two previous examinations of the drainage problem since the Commissioners first became involved in 1842.</P>

      <P>The Allport Commission in 1887 and the Binnie Commission of 1905-7 looked at the problems as they then saw them.  The current review is a logical further step which a prudent Government should take to <Col N="1699" /> ensure that policies are right and that resources are used to best advantage.  I must say that, without wishing to prejudge the outcome, I am confident that the best method to continue the arterial drainage programme will emerge.</P>
      <P>Another matter mentioned by Deputies yesterday was EEC funding.  The western drainage scheme i.e. the Corrib-Mask, the Boyle and the Bonet are aided by refunds from the FEOGA (European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund) of 50 per cent of expenditure incurred and the Boyne and Maigue schemes attract refunds of 30 per cent of expenditure from the ERDF (European Regional Development Fund).  While this is a very useful additional source of funding the fact remains that substantial capital amounts must first be raised and expended.  There are, of course, other projects competing for ERDF funds and it does not necessarily follow that drainage should necessarily have first call on ERDF funds.  This would of course be one of the considerations which the drainage review would help to clarify.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wilson pressed the case for a drainage scheme for the Erne catchment. This is a large and complicated catchment lying on both sides of the Border.  The whole question of the drainage of the Erne is a difficult and complex problem which I would not have time to deal with adequately today.  I am bound to say, however, that the studies carried out are not encouraging for a scheme acceptable from an economic and environmental viewpoint.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kitt raised the question of the Dunkellin. There seems to be some misapprehension about what is being done in this catchment. This catchment has three problems associated with it which are of a special nature, namely &mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  A very extensive groundwater system which could be seriously affected by a surface water drainage scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1700" /> 2.  The existence of the well-known oyster beds at Clarinbridge at the mouth of the river and</P>
    <P>3.  The Rahasane turlough &mdash; an extensive wild life habitat in the lower reachers of the catchment.</P>
    <P>Each of these problems is the subject of detailed investigation by specialists in their respective fields.</P>
    <P>The first problem is being investigated by Dr. Drew, a hydrogeologist in Trinity College who was commissioned to examine the effect which a drainage scheme might have on the groundwater system. This involves monitoring underground flows over a period of a couple of years. Dr. Drew's report is expected in 1985.</P>
    <P>The second problem is to gauge the effect which the release of flood waters into the bay would have on the salinity of the sea water at the oyster beds.  This investigation is being carried out for the Commissioners by Professor McK. Bary of Galway University.  This study which involves a hydrographic survey of the bay and a monitoring process over a two-year period is also expected to be completed by next year.</P>
    <P>The effect of a drainage scheme on the Rahasane turlough is being investigated by the Forest and Wildlife Service of the Department of Fisheries and Forestry.  I understand that the necessary field work will be undertaken this year.  When the Commissioners have received and considered these reports they will be in a position to take decisions on the feasibility of the drainage scheme.  I can assure the Deputy that money is available this year to pay for the reports commissioned by my office.</P>
    <P>The drainage of the river Nanny was also raised by Deputy Kitt.  As the Deputy is well aware, this river is part of the Corrib-Clare catchment which was drained about 20 years ago.  Works on the Nanny river were not proceeded with because of problems which Galway County Council expected would arise in relation to the water supply to Tuam town.  The intention was that Galway County Council would provide an alternative supply which would clear the way to having the drainage works carried out. Galway County Council have not yet <Col N="1701" /> solved the problem to their satisfaction and are not yet prepared to agree to the drainage works being carried out.  The drainage works are, of course, feasible as I informed the Deputy in 1981 but the Commissioners would be most reluctant to proceed with the works without the full agreement and co-operation of the council.  I can only suggest that the Deputy who is a member of the council takes up the matter with them.</P>
    <P>Some mention was made yesterday of the drainage of the River Shannon.  I am afraid that I cannot take these comments very seriously.  Fianna Fáil have been making political capital, particularly at election time, about the drainage of the Shannon for as long as I can remember, and I think at this stage that I am one of the oldest members around.  I do not accept any of the Fianna Fáil charges in this respect and will not until I see some evidence of Fianna Fáil putting their money where their mouth is.  At least this Government are honest enough to say that no progress is being made on this front rather than continue with a patently false pretence.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartin suggested that it might be better to do drainage works by contract than by direct labour.  I do not know what the evidence is for this view. Each scheme carried out is subjected to a cost-benefit analysis and goes ahead only if it proves worthwhile.  Each section of the works is costed as it proceeds and compared with the target figures used in the analysis.</P>
    <P>I believe &mdash; and I am prepared to stake my reputation on it &mdash; that as far as arterial drainage is concerned the Board of Works can compete with contractors of any size.  I have set out a very reasonable case here which proves that the Opposition are not sincere.  I want to go back over the figures which I gave which prove that although Fianna Fáil threw money round as if it was going out of fashion, we are providing more money in 1984 than they did during those golden years when they were throwing money around left, right and centre.  As a result, every taxpayer in the country is paying for it.</P>

      <P>Drainage is of special significance in the Border region.  Before we joined the EEC there was not much hope of drainage work being carried out. In south Monaghan the River Fane, which flows southwards to Dundalk, was flooding between 5,000 and 6,000 acres. The Blackwater, which flows into Lough Neagh, affects 5,900 acres.  The Erne catchment is the fourth largest catchment after the Shannon, the Bann and the Barrow and it covers 5.2 per cent of the land of the entire island.  It affects the five Border counties in that 75 per cent of County Cavan is covered by the Erne catchment, Donegal 2 per cent, Leitrim 30 per cent, Monaghan 40 per cent, Longford 15 per cent, as well as County Fermanagh. In Cavan 57 per cent of the land is rated as wet drumlin soil in need of drainage.  Of 13,933 holdings in County Cavan, 9,673 have a valuation of £20 or less.  Of 10,655 holdings in County Monaghan, 7,565 have valuations of £20 or less.  All these rivers straddle the Border and many of them form part of the Border for long distances.  In the North they carry out drainage works on a tributary basis but here we deal with the complete catchment.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the OPW for the work they carried out following our entry to the EEC when funds were made available. They carried out a land valuation study and an engineering study of the Blackwater and they are now ready to begin work with the intention of completing drainage within five years.  This is the first time the OPW have operated at that pace and I hope the pace will be continued.</P>
      <P>We also have in the area the Ballymore-Ballyconnell canal and we saw an opportunity to link the Shannon and the Erne, the finest waterways in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has talked about problems which have arisen but I do not accept this argument.  I was involved in initiating drainage works in mid-Ulster from 1973.  I have been a member of every committee and I know that the <Col N="1703" /> problems are not as the Minister says. We were told there were problems on the inter-lough channel at the sluice gates at Portora but I know they can be overcome. A former Stormont Minister told me that they had examined it and that the generating station could be by-passed. The Minister is only using it as an excuse.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil were returned to power in 1977 one of the first things the then Taoiseach did was to set up a steering committee of civil servants from both sides of the Border.  We worked with elected representatives, North and South, and with officials of the local authorities.  The steering committee and the monitoring group continued their work and made great progress.  Land valuation and engineering surveys were carried out.  On 19 December 1980 we met the then Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, but following that we ran into the problem of the Northern troubles and the H blocks and progress was retarded.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred last night to certain savings on the cross-Border project which came to light during the past few weeks following consultations with the Northern Ireland authorities.  In other words, they saved money there in order to keep men employed in some other area.  The money for the Blackwater was allocated through Directive 79-197 and the EEC were to reimburse 50 per cent of the expenditure.  The money is now being diverted to drainage works in the west covered by Directive 78-628.  I hold that the Government cannot do this, that it is irresponsible and illegal.  That money was made available for cross-Border drainage development.  It is positive proof of the insincerity of the Government.</P>
    <P>On 20 February 1974 I put down questions to the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy FitzGerald, regarding money for arterial drainage.  The Minister replied:</P>
    <P>However, the general tendency of expenditure from the fund will be to create industrial employment or infrastructures related closely to industrial <Col N="1704" /> development so that expenditure on arterial drainage will remain a matter solely for national administration.</P>
    <P>That was the attitude during the Coalition years and it is still the attitude.</P>
    <P>In March 1975 I put down questions to the then Minister for Finance and he replied that there was no guarantee that money would be provided.  It is typical of the Government that they are trying to siphon off this money.  I hope the EEC are aware of it.</P>
    <P>I have always been very concerned about drainage problems and I wrote to Antonio Giolitti, the European Commissioner responsible for the Regional Fund. He replied to me on 11 April 1983 as follows:</P>
    <P>Thank you for your letter of 9 March 1983 concerning development of the border regions of Ireland and, in particular, the Erne Catchment Area.</P>
    <P>I must admit to being a little perturbed at the implication that the Erne Catchment Study, which was jointly commissioned and financed by the Irish and British Governments and the Commission and which, as you point out, raised high hopes in the area, had not given rise to concrete action.</P>
    <P>That answers it all.  By the Minister's own admission he is siphoning off this money and diverting it to another area.  I say this cannot be done and I do not intend that the Government should be allowed to do it.</P>

      <P>The money will have to be used in the Border region.  The Government will have an opportunity of securing further funds if they make a pound for pound contribution.  They are a Coalition Government with no commitment and I hope the EEC will pursue the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A speaker opposite regretted that while money was spent on land reclamation there was not a corresponding improvement in cattle numbers or improved farm development in the <Col N="1705" /> region.  This is regrettable and the only hope for the development of the region is large scale arterial drainage.  In those three or four catchments I have walked every small tributary which was cleaned and scrubbed as a small job in County Fermanagh.  If the Office of Public Works ever intend to make progress with arterial drainage, they will have to remove the obstacles which are doing so much damage in many rivers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Like many Deputies I was very taken aback when I read recently that quite a significant number of men who were engaged on arterial drainage would be laid off by the Office of Public Works and that, in real terms, significantly less money would be spent this year on this very important activity. I understand there is a study, which we have heard a great deal about, in train at the moment.  Hopefully it will be completed and published shortly.  We all await its conclusions with considerable interest.</P>
      <P>The ERSI study which was conducted a couple of years ago came up with certain conclusions in regard to the value of the cost benefit of certain catchment areas which have been drained over the past ten or 20 years.  They came to some fairly unfavourable conclusions.  The catchment areas they chose to study are mainly in the west of Ireland, of very poor quality land and in what one would call dole areas.  For much of the period in question there was not much incentive to farmers, if they were on a non-notional or actual valuation of what they were doing, to produce any more.  I want to make a plea here tonight in relation to arterial drainage of the better catchment areas which have not yet been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irrespective of whatever conclusions may rightly or wrongly be come to in regard to catchments in poor land, those conclusions cannot apply to catchments where the land is of high quality.  In the Mulcaire in County Limerick a drainage society was formed some years ago to endeavour to bring about the drainage of that catchment.  They have done a tremendous amount of research. Recent research indicates &mdash; based on <Col N="1706" /> some very conservative estimates &mdash; that, in that relatively small catchment area the value in 1983 terms of increased agricultural output per annum would be £27 million.  That is at a stocking rate of one cow per 1.5 acres, which is not particularly ambitious as things go, and each cow yielding 750 gallons which is not particularly good either.</P>
    <P>I quote those figures to show how conservatively the society, consisting mainly of farmers and other interests in that catchment area, have approached the scientific study they have done.  Their figures are entitled to be listened to with some care by the Office of Public Works and the Department of Finance.  It has to be realised that not to drain a catchment of that kind is crazy in present circumstances with the high value of the land there and the tremendous potential it has &mdash; rich land which is constantly being flooded.</P>
    <P>The Mulcaire is in an unusual situation. The uplands behind it where its seven main tributaries rise just inside County Tipperary in the Rear Cross and Newport areas and further up, have qualified it for field drainage grants under the EEC in recent years.  A great deal of field drainage has gone in there, where it never took place before.  The result is that the volume of water coming down into the Mulcaire and its tributaries has increased enormously. As a result there is flooding in the main river which is quite a short river in itself.  It is less than ten miles in length between where the last of the tributaries comes in and the main river enters the Shannon just above Limerick.  The volume of water going in there is enormous.</P>
    <P>It has taken on the new dimension that it is no longer simply an agricultural problem of constant flooding of agricultural land throughout the winter and flash flooding in the summer which takes away hay and things of that kind which has happened from year to year.  It is also a very serious problem in terms of the damage being done to the dwellinghouses of farmers and of non-farmers, and damage done in particular to the village of Cappamore, half of which on two occasions in each of the past two winters has been under several feet of water and, but for <Col N="1707" /> the mercy of God, a number of people would have been drowned in and close to the village because of the extent of the flooding and the suddenness of it because of the new factors which exist.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works will have to look at this Mulcaire problem not just as an agricultural drainage problem in comparison with other catchment areas. They will have to realise that enormous damage is being done to property, much of it non-agricultural property, and that some person or persons will be drowned one of these winters.  The problem is getting worse each year.  That cannot be tolerated.  The Office of Public Works will have to look at it in that light and take emergency measures to ensure that this is rectified very quickly.</P>
    <P>There is a bridge which I pass over many times a week, the bridge on the Mulcaire at Annacotty.  When you look up to your left you see the weir above that bridge absolutely clogged because of the recent floods with more and more tree trunks and other obstructions along the lower part of the river which could be quite easily moved.  This would make a major difference.</P>
    <P>In engineering terms the Mulcaire is difficult enough because of the various levels involved in it.  It is also a relatively easy river to drain because of its unusual shortness and because it has a large number of small tributaries each of which in itself is relatively easy to deal with.  I suggest to the Government and the the Department of Finance who, presumably, will make the decisions on these matters that arterial drainage cannot be looked on as something to which the same criteria apply in all parts of the country.  The underlying value of the catchment area as an agricultural producer will have to be looked at.  The new elements in this particular catchment area of constant danger to life and damage to property, agricultural and non-agricultural, every winter will also have to be taken into account.  The present situation cannot continue.</P>
    <P>I hope to God that it never arises that I, or some other Deputy from East <Col N="1708" /> Limerick or North Tipperary, will have to come into this House some day and raise on a Private Notice Question or on the Adjourment the drowning of one, two or three people somewhere in that catchment area as a result of the Mulcaire and its tributaries overflowing and flooding one of these villages to a depth of three, four or five feet which we have seen in recent times.  Then everyone will wring their hands and say that something should have been done about it.  I am making it clear now that that will happen, and I am also saying that on very conservative estimates the Government are chosing, if they decide not to go on with the Mulcair, to cast aside £27 million of additional agricultural production that can be done in a short number of years. I do not think it is reasonable that these things should be ignored in the fashion they have.  That will have to be faced up to now and a very serious look taken at it by the Office of Public Works.</P>

      <P>At a time when only 25 per cent of our farmers are at full production it is wrong to cut back on such work.  We must realise that the reason why 75 per cent of our farmers are not at full production is because of the quality of the land, the topography of the soil in the area in which they live, and the need for proper main arterial drainways so that land drainage can commence.  That work should be carried out so that land that is flooded periodically can be brought into full production.  At a time when we are fighting a super-levy in Europe it is crazy financial policy to be cutting back on a scheme that will bring such land into production. The Government should reconsider this matter.</P>
      <P>Since the Act was introduced in 1945, 620,000 acres of land have been drained, but more than 600,000 acres remain to be drained in the 12 western counties.  That is an indication of the amount of work that remains to be done after almost 40 years work under that scheme.  My constituency has been bedevilled with problems due to the flooding of the Shannon and its tributaries, the Suck and the Bunowen, the Dunkellin, the Corrib and further afield in Mayo the Moy, and the Bonet in Sligo.  Great work has been done under the Corrib drainage scheme.  In particular great work has been done on the Corrib-Headford and that scheme has now moved on to the Corrib-Mask in the Mayo area.  I understand that 80 per cent of that scheme has been completed.  The scheme has been of great benefit to mid and northern Galway and the southern part of Mayo.  I am aware that quite an amount of land has been drained under the western drainage programme.  Were it not for the fact that the arterial waterway of the Corrib, and its tributary, the Clare, was carried out prior to that scheme it would not have been possible to retrieve the land in north Galway and south Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1710" /> It is vital that the Government ensures that the programme is not alone improved but escalated in the years ahead.  The sooner we get our farmers to the European productivity level the better for our economy.  We will then find it easier to compete with other European countries.  Until we reach that stage it is not right that our European partners should penalise us for something that has not been created by our production levels but has been artificially created by our competitors in the EEC.</P>
    <P>The water levels of the Shannon seem to be abnormally high even at times when there is little or no rain.  The ESB play a major part in this.  I do not know what system they operate to ensure that we have sufficient power through the use of the sluice gates and the waterways, but farmers in Galway, Offaly and Tipperary suffer.  The Minister of State should ensure, as far as possible, that the Shannon water levels do not damage farm land adjoining that river.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to a river in my county which has been the subject of a lot of discussion in recent years, the Dunkellin river in south Galway.  That river has a total catchment area of 91,000 acres of which 15,000 are severely flooded.  The average farm size there is only 25 to 30 acres, and that river directly affects almost 3,000 farmers and indirectly affects a further 6,000.  Arterial drainage work has not been carried out in that vast catchment area, which has one of the lowest stocking rates in the country.  In fact the stocking rate is about one livestock unit per ten acres.  There is a need, because of that, to proceed with the major scheme for the Dunkellin catchment area.  If the drainage work was carried out the stocking rate there could be increased to six livestock units per acre, a 500 per cent improvement in production. That would be a great contribution to the economy of the west.</P>
    <P>The failure to carry out this drainage work has meant that there is a low quality herbage, which leads to poor livestock performance because livestock are restricted to grazing only.  We have low fertility in that area and endemic diseases rampant there such as fluke and red <Col N="1711" /> water.  The land can be used for six months of the year only.  In 1982 I was delighted when the Taoiseach of the day, Deputy Haughey, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry, gave a commitment to provide the finance to carry out studies on the Dunkellin river.  Studies were to be carried out on the ground water position, the oyster beds on Clarinbridge and the Rahasane turlough, the well known bird sanctuary.  The Leader of the Opposition of the time, Deputy FitzGerald, in the course of the by-election of July 1982, gave a commitment that if he was returned to power he would ensure that the drainage work was carried out on the river.  However, the first thing he did when he was elected Taoiseach was to terminate the studies in the cutbacks in the 1983 budget.</P>

      <P>One person worked there in 1983 and he is the only person who is working on the studies.  The Dunkellin drainage scheme, in addition to giving the 6,000 to 8,000 people living in the catchment area an opportunity to earn a good livelihood, will also create the motivation when applied throughout the country to solve our chronic jobs problem.  The Government should ensure that a comprehensive arterial drainage programme is prepared and submitted to Brussels immediately.  In our ten years of EEC membership we have not taken up the financial aids that are available for our disadvantaged areas.  I hope the Government will submit a programme to Brussels to ensure that arterial drainage work is expanded in the coming years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the beauties of being in Opposition is that one can promise everything but deliver nothing and, in fairness, the Opposition speakers have been consistent in their attitude and their approach towards this matter.  Since the independence of this State they have held power for approximately 51 of the 60 years.  They have always drained the <Col N="1712" /> Shannon before each election, they have promised a biscuit factory in Ballina and many other things.  Their three main aims are: the restoration of the Irish language, the reunification of the country and aid to small farmers.  The fact that the Government have not tabled an amendment to the motion indicates their concern and their understanding of the problem. They have given a detailed and constructive analysis of the exact position in relation to arterial drainage.  We understand the harsh realities imposed by the current economic difficulties and in their interpretation and presentation of the problem the Government have been realistic.</P>
      <P>It has been demonstrated that sufficient finance is available to maintain an adequate drainage scheme during 1984 and, within that, cognisance has been taken of the employment position and the contribution to agricultural development by the maintenance of an adequate programme.  Some 750 men are employed by the Office of Public Works and a further 200 are employed on maintenance work, and the agricultural development of the areas being drained has been assisted.</P>
      <P>A sum of £11.65 million is available this year, which compares more than favourably with the amounts granted in other years.  It is true that there should be a complete review by the Office of Public Works because, as the Minister of State has indicated, all may not be well in some areas with regard to this matter. In the light of our present economic situation, the Opposition speakers should indicate the sources of revenue available as alternatives when they propose vast drainage schemes throughout the country.</P>

      <P>It is not good enough for the Opposition to say we should run to the EEC.  Deputy McEllistrim, who was a former Minister of State dealing with the Office of Public Works, knows well the problems associated with arterial drainage.  His interpretation that 300 people will be made redundant should be <Col N="1713" /> withdrawn or substantiated.  The Minister has proved his figures tonight but there has not been any withdrawal of that false allegation.</P>
      <P>Coming from my constituency I know full well the value of the work of the Office of Public Works in relation to the Corrib-Mask drainage scheme.  On completion of the scheme in 1986 some 24,000 acres will have been drained.  If any of the Opposition speakers wish to know the feelings of the farmers who use that land they should go down to the area and speak to the people concerned.  The Office of Public Works have done a most worthwhile job in draining the land. There are always cases where there are claims for further extensions, for bridges to be built, for better slipways and approaches to land, for fencing and compensation. There are always such claims, but generally the overall work of the Office of Public Works has been first-class. I ask the Minister to keep up the good work in dealing with claims from farmers in respect of extra extensions.</P>
      <P>The advantageous effects in economic terms should be monitored.  The work carried out by the Office of Public Works must be proved in terms of a cost benefit analysis.  The effects of drainage work should be monitored by the Office of Public Works or by a special commission to ensure that the various agricultural agencies will provide the necessary incentives, motivation and encouragement for farmers to avail of grants and incentives to increase the agricultural production of the drained land.  There is no point in carrying out major drainage work if it is not followed up by intensive agricultural development.  The Government have indicated the true position in relation to finance this year, and that is why there has been no amendment to this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMorley" hpid="Mr. Morley Mr. Morley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution, however short, to the debate.  I have personal experience of arterial drainage because my constituency has benefited by two schemes that have been carried out.  The Moy drainage scheme was completed about 12 years ago and at the other end of my constituency there is the Corrib-Mask-Robe <Col N="1714" /> scheme which is 80 per cent completed.  The Office of Public Works have done an excellent job on both schemes, and that is recognised by the local community.  The farmers in the catchment areas have made full use of the drained land, and on this matter I agree with my colleague across the floor of the House.  The majority of farmers have availed of grants under the Farm Modernisation Scheme and under the Western Development Scheme to carry out the drainage work, and they have brought their holdings into higher productivity.</P>
      <P>I was amazed to hear Deputy McCartin last evening say that borrowing money for drainage in the west of Ireland was a waste of money and time.  He said it had not led to increased productivity, or at least that is the implication I took from what he said.  I wonder where were his eyes when he was campaigning in 1979 in the Connacht-Ulster constituency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMorley" hpid="Mr. Morley Mr. Morley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morley</NameTxt>
      <P>At that time he must have travelled near the Moy drainage catchment area.  I hope he will open his eyes when he travels through the Robe catchment area on this occasion.  If he does this he will see the excellent work that has been carried out and the use the farmers are making of the drained land.</P>
      <P>There is an increasing demand for improvement work on channels, but the Office of Public Works have not the money to reconstruct the channels which would allow many farmers to participate in drainage schemes.  They have not the required outfall to qualify them for grants under the Farm Modernisation Scheme or the western package.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know it is impossible to include every extension or every scheme, but I wish to refer to one request.  This is a request by 50 or 60 farmers to have the Hollymount River included in the Robe drainage scheme.  This is an area of 600 acres to 700 acres of fertile land, and I ask the Minister to give the matter sympathetic consideration.  The farmers are affected by the flooding which takes place every <Col N="1715" /> winter and which subsides during the summer.  A report on the matter is due to be presented shortly, and I hope it will be favourable, but even if it is not favourable some drainage work should be carried out.  There is a surplus of water in this area during the winter when there is an abundance of water everywhere, but there is no water there in the summer when there may be a scarcity of water also in surrounding areas.</P>
    <P>There is a fear that drainage works would interfere with local water supplies, but I maintain that that argument does not stand up.  Certainly some drainage work should be carried out.  Reducing the winter level of the water in that channel to its summer level obviously would not affect surrounding water supply schemes or anything else.  I regret the redundancies that 50 out of 250 men are being laid off a project funded 50 per cent by the EEC.  Putting those men on unemployment assistance and pay-related benefit is standing economics on its head.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Fianna Fáil front bench and Parliamentary Party decided to put this motion down in Private Members' Time it was on the basis of national priorities, that we would at least focus on this issue as being a national priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of Deputies who have offered to speak, the number of those who could not, the number of Government Deputies who for one reason or another have endeavoured to turn figures on their head &mdash; as Deputy Kenny has just done &mdash; contending that when one provides less this year than last year one is looking after arterial drainage as effectively as ever, all demonstrate that any Deputy in this House knows its significance. Why do we?  It is because the farmers and those of us who represent rural constituencies &mdash; where the agri-food industry is so dependent on agricultural productivity &mdash; all realise the problem with which we are faced but perhaps, more importantly, the immense potential in this area.  It is a question of choice, of developing our natural resources, amongst the most important <Col N="1716" /> of which is agriculture, ensuring that present unproductive land &mdash; and I will mention just one or two examples &mdash; will be released for the benefit of the nation.</P>
    <P>Our spokesmen on agriculture last evening advanced cogent arguments in terms of the input to the balance of payments. I cannot repeat them in the limited time available except to adopt them as spokesman on Finance &mdash; the downstream industries in the agri-food area, all of that vitally important.  In this connection I want to stress three or four points.  What is at present lacking is a national comprehensive development plan.  We have been waiting for it.  Therefore it is not surprising, in the absence of any such national development plan that there is no plan for arterial drainage.  Clearly there is no indication of a consistent programme, not just for next year or for the following year but, in the nature of arterial drainage, for ten or 15 years to maximise the benefit of present unproductive land.  For instance, when we hear of a cutback of 1 per cent in money terms over last year &mdash; and there is no disagreement on that &mdash; an effective cutback of 12 per cent in real terms from last year, is that not clear evidence of lack of any plan or, if there was a plan &mdash; and there was &mdash; an absolute rejection of such plans as existed?</P>
    <P>Of course there is not any comprehensive national agricultural development plan.  There was one such plan one and a half years ago when this Government came into office.  But one and a half years later they are still wondering and waiting what they will do about discussions with various groups and social partners, asking others to do the job they asked the people to put them here to do.  There is no plan for agriculture, no plan for the economy and certainly no plan for arterial drainage.</P>
    <P>Within the capital programme for agriculture, which is related to this also, we find a cutback of the equivalent of 50 per cent of this year's allocation in farm modernisation over the last two years.  The reduction since 1982 is 50 per cent of the total capital allocation for farm modernisation this year.  It must then be asked: where are we going? The reality is that even with 50 per cent support available from the EEC the <Col N="1717" /> FEOGA funds, even in good years by comparison with this year much less next year, have not been fully taken up. FEOGA funds, through which these grants for arterial drainage percolate, have never been fully taken up here.  Next year they will be very much below the quota.</P>
    <P>With a 50 per cent support from Europe can we really say that this Government have any notion of the development of priorities for this nation? We on this side of the House, particularly in recent times, have endeavoured to stress in a positive way the development of our natural resources, whether that be our children in education or above all else here, land, agriculture.  What we are getting is a series of platitudes from the Government.  I might tell the Minister of State present in the House that it does not really matter.  I would prefer to rely on Deputy McEllistrim's figures because they will form the basis for reply by the Minister.  Does it really matter whether the figure is 260, 270, 280 or 140 less?  It is going to be less anyway for people engaged in arterial drainage than it was last year.  Are we going to boast about that?  With so much to be achieved, with so much support from the EEC, this Government have no plan and are actually reducing in money terms &mdash; never mind real terms &mdash; the development potential.</P>

      <P>Good ones as well, as Deputy Wilson from Cavan correctly recognises.  This has been the pattern all this year in that area.  I believe the House has heard about the River Mulcaire this evening.  They will hear more about it now but merely as an example, where the potential is so enormous, perhaps the most fertile agricultural land in the country. We are allowing that kind of scandal to continue.  What is more, under this Government's programmes, we are telling the people of regions like that: &ldquo;We are now suspending any plans; the plans that were on the way are being suspended. The hope you might have had is gone.&rdquo; The people who have been available from other schemes, when completed, are now being let go.  That is the reality we are facing at this stage.</P>
      <P>Can anything justify that kind of situation? Scenes like that &mdash; and I will not be too graphic about it &mdash; aggravate the bovine TB problem.  Is it any wonder that in that region bovine TB is probably at a level higher than anywhere else in the country?  With flooding of that kind is it surprising?  Is it any wonder that nobody will fertilise lands which, in bad conditions, can be flooded like that, but unfortunately where the potential is so enormous? Is it any wonder that farmers are losing heart, leaving the land, telling their sons that there is no place for them on the land of Limerick/Tipperary because this flooding continues year after year? And for the sake of what?  Deputy Kenny asked me to put up alternatives &mdash; for the sake of an extra couple of millions of pounds this year.  I would prefer to see £2 million being spent on arterial drainage than to see that amount of money being provided by this Government this year for public relations exercises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1719" /> If one studies the Estimates one will find in every single Department extra consultants for every Minister to put across an impression while they ignore this reality.  I will tell the Government where they can cut back &mdash; on all their consultancies.  They have recruited more consultants to advise them, a Government incapable of making a decision. Which is the priority &mdash; our natural resources or public relations?  This debate has demonstrated that we believe it to be our natural resources.  This Government believe it to be public relations.  That is the difference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask a question? Will the Minister of State name the consultants who are skulking somewhere behind his Department and who reported wrongly on the Erne scheme, or will he sack them, get rid of them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for affording me the opportunity to raise this matter which is of great importance to Tallaght and to the city and county of Dublin.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Moynihan, for his presence, but I am disappointed that the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy Bruton, is not here to deal with it.  There are other representatives of the constituency here and I will not take up my entire time quota so that they may give the House their views on this important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem is that Irish Biscuits Limited, once known as Jacobs, who moved to Tallaght some years ago and have been giving employment to between 1,000 and <Col N="1720" /> 1,300 people in permanent jobs and to 200 to 300 people doing summer work, last Monday put 850 to 900 workers on short time, working weeks about, and another 350 on a three-day week. Frequently when problems such as this arise in firms we hear a lot about irresponsible employees, but in the case of Irish Biscuits Limited the workers put their case early last winter.  A number of them met the Minister, Deputy J. Mitchell and they saw Deputy Cluskey before he resigned from the Cabinet.  Some senior members of the staff saw the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I do not condemn any of those Ministers but the word coming back to me is that very little encouragement was received and that the representatives of the workers did not get an acknowledgment of the case they put.  The workers behaved responsibly and came here for help when they realised what would happen in the firm, but they received little help or acknowledgment from the people who matter.</P>
    <P>I am sure the other representatives of the constituency will agree with me that this situation has not arisen because of irresponsibility on the part of the workers.  It is on a par with the Clondalkin Paper Mills.  After their visit to members of the Government, the workers were very annoyed that they did not receive an acknowledgment.  It was the duty and responsibility of the Ministers to listen to the people concerned and to try to have something done to protect their jobs.</P>
    <P>The company have said that stocks are too high and sales too low.  We must look at the reasons for this situation.  One of the many is the high rate of VAT on their products and I appeal to the Minister of State to ask the Government to consider reducing the rate of VAT.  In their memorandum to the Minister the workers have asked for a reduction of the VAT rate on some types of biscuits.  Recently a problem regarding disemployment arose in Cork and there was tremendous publicity.  The Taoiseach went there and said special attention would be given to Cork.  Tallaght needs the same attention now.  Some years ago Dublin County <Col N="1721" /> Council decided that Tallaght should be a new town accommodating anything from 150,000 to 175,000 people.  At the moment between 80,000 and 90,000 live there.  There are more than 5,000 people unemployed in Tallaght and another 3,000 in neighbouring Clondalkin.  Industries like Telectron, Glen Abbey and others have laid off workers and the situation has become extremely sad in Tallaght.</P>
    <P>Will the Government give some special consideration to the serious situation in Irish Biscuits Limited?  We hear about areas in the country being designated disadvantaged or special category areas. Tallaght demands some such designation because of its massive unemployment rate.  Something must be done about those on short time in Irish Biscuits Limited. There has been talk about special consideration being given to some firms in the matter of gas supplies so that their energy costs would be lower.  VAT and many other proposals can also be considered, but there is no point in my raising this matter here tonight unless the Government give some consideration to it.  I am disappointed that the Minister concerned, Deputy Bruton, is not present tonight.  I appreciate that a Minister in Government is very busy, but there are a number of other Ministers in the Government, and if the Taoiseach thought fit to go to Cork he could equally come to Tallaght and meet the workers there.  During the last election campaign we heard a great deal about the proposals of the two parties now in Government and what they would do for employment and what our party were not doing.  Now is the time, this is the place and I hope that from tonight onwards some consideration will be given to this very serious situation.</P>
    <P>Irish Biscuits Limited have 1,050 workers on short time, week and week about, and about 350 working a three-day week.  The Glen Abbey workers are on a three-day week and a number of other firms have closed, bringing the total unemployed in the area to approximately 5,000.  I hope that the Government will give special consideration to this matter.</P>
    <P>I thank you, Sir, for giving us an opportunity <Col N="1722" /> to raise this matter.  I appreciate your consideration.  We have raised many matters here in relation to Tallaght and you have been most helpful, considerate and courteous in this regard.  Again I thank the Minister of State for coming here tonight, but I am very sorry that it is not the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism or at least some senior Minister.  Now I will give way to the other Deputies who have something to contribute on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am most grateful to my constituency colleague, Deputy Seán Walsh, who in accordance with his universally courteous manner has given way to allow me to make a few brief comments on this subject.  I will take only a few minutes because our colleague, Deputy Harney, is anxious to make a contribution.</P>
      <P>Irish Biscuits Limited is the only remaining biscuit factory in this country. The country is flooded with foreign biscuits and the workers there now are on short time.  If something is not done about it the writing is on the wall and if matters are allowed to continue in this way the factory could close down and fold up altogether.  What is the reason for this? The imports are coming in here freely on a basis of unfair competition.  They are based on subsidised products and subsidised energies from other countries, and we do nothing about it.  We allow that to continue.  Protective walls are thrown up against our goods when we seek to export them both within and outside the EEC and our Government are slow and, it would appear, reluctant to counterbalance that by affording protection and providing some reasonable basis of ordinary competition for the biscuits that can be manufactured at Tallaght to supply the entire country.  Neither the firm nor the workers in Tallaght are afraid to take on fair competition, but dumping of foreign biscuits here is putting at risk the jobs of those workers in Irish Biscuits Limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government should use the measures available to them under the EEC Treaty which provides opportunities to avail of anti-dumping measures and protocols <Col N="1723" /> that can be used if the will is there to use them.  Other countries &mdash; France when it comes to meat and other products, Germany, Italy; the list is as long as your arm &mdash; are not slow to avail of these protective measures provided by the EEC protocol to protect vital industries and jobs in their countries.  Why can we not do the same when our last remaining biscuit factory, which can cater for all the needs of the country, is put at risk in this way?</P>
    <P>I want to say a word here to the shopkeepers and supermarket owners, native or multinational.  Have they no sense of responsibility to this country?  They are prepared to stock their shelves to the ceiling with biscuits from all round the world, from Korea, Britain, Australia, the lot, when they have available for them all the supplies they need which are every bit as good as, if not better than, the foreign product.  Where is their patriotism, where is responsibility shown by those supermarket chains who are prepared to go out of their way in stocking these foreign biscuits?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister &mdash; Deputy Moynihan, Deputy Bruton or any Minister responsible for this &mdash; why he does not call in those supermarket owners and directors and lay it on the line that they are required and expected by the Government to show some degree of patriotism and use Irish goods that we can make and are in a position to make. I could say more on this subject but I want to leave a few minutes to our constituency colleague, Deputy Harney.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Walsh for affording me the opportunity of contributing to this discussion on the serious situation in relation to Irish Biscuits Limited in Tallaght.  I do not wish to repeat what was said by Deputy Taylor and Deputy Walsh, but none of us can say loudly or often enough how serious the unemployment situation now is in Tallaght.  Deputy Walsh has outlined that almost 5,000 people are unemployed currently in the Tallaght area.  That may not appear to be very many, but when it is realised that the vast majority of the <Col N="1724" /> people living in Tallaght are still young and will come on to the work force in huge numbers in the next few years, it will be seen that the area has a crucial and serious unemployment situation and unless something is done about it very soon the whole future of the town of Tallaght will be seriously affected.  It appears that no job opportunities or new industries are coming into the area and all we can hope for is that at least the industries there are maintained and allowed to stay in existence.</P>
      <P>Some industries, such as the biscuit industry, are very labour-intensive. These industries are the kind that our Government, be they Coalition or Fianna Fáil, must give every possible support to. What do we do?  We tax labour.  We give great concessions to people who have machines and buildings but if they have labour they are taxed more and more. Our PRSI scheme has made it impossible for many people &mdash; Irish Biscuits Limited are a case in point &mdash; to employ staff.  Their wage bill is enormous.  The amount of money contributed to the State in the form of PRSI contributions is enormous and is crippling Irish industry. All our industries &mdash; again Irish Biscuits Ltd. are a case in point &mdash; suffer greatly from energy costs compared to their competitors in the UK.  Last year the energy costs of Irish Biscuits Ltd. came to £844,000.  A similar operation in the UK cost £681,000.  That is a margin 24 per cent higher in Ireland for energy than in Britain.</P>
      <P>How can our industries survive under such conditions?  We have had this in the case of Clondalkin Paper Mills and Telectron.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have made our case here and either a Government Minister is not here to listen to us and take action or we are ignored totally and the matter is never raised.  That is no reflection on the Minister of State whom I am delighted to see here, but is a sad, poor reflection on Fine Gael that no member of that party from the area is present this evening and that no senior Cabinet member or any Cabinet member is present either.  It is only the Government who can take the necessary decisions in this case.  As <Col N="1725" /> Deputy Walsh said, the imposition of VAT on biscuits at 23 per cent is totally unacceptable.  It means that Irish people cannot buy Irish made biscuits at a competitive price.  Deputy Taylor referred to our supermarkets.  These are flooded with biscuits from the UK which are dumped here at unrealistic prices with which no Irish manufacturer could compete. It is about time we came to grips with the problem and dealt with it realistically.</P>
    <P>Firms like Irish Biscuits Limited, labour intensive, employing over 1,000 workers have made a very significant contribution to employment in my area. They must be encouraged and supported in every way.  Three things must be done. Firstly, some relief must be given to such industries in relation to PRSI and to all Irish industries in relation to energy costs and, lastly in relation to VAT on biscuits. The rate of VAT must be either decreased or perhaps abolished altogether. We are taxing our own products completely out of the market, which is absolutely ridiculous.  Unless we face these problems as they arise and take courageous decisions, by giving incentives to industrialists who give employment, we will find ourselves in an extremely serious situation before long. Our unemployment is now at an all time high level.  Unless these industries which are labour-intensive and major employers are given that kind of support &mdash; the cost of which would not be enormous &mdash; it will be a sad reflection on all of us politicians.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. M. Moynihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the three Deputies concerned for their realistic appraisal of the problems confronting our biscuit industry.  As Minister for State responsible for industrial development, it always saddens me to see how a world recession can have adverse effects on firms on our own doorstep.  The heartening thing is that, in most cases, firms pull out of their particular difficulties and develop once again their original momentum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am naturally very concerned that Irish Biscuits Limited, which are one of <Col N="1726" /> the corner stones of our industrial fabric and have for so long been a feature of Irish industrial life, should be so affected by the general recession that they are obliged to introduce short-time working.</P>
    <P>I do not want to enter into the realm of debate and try to ascribe the decision of the company to any one particular problem.  The fact is that we operate in a very open economy and, as one of the prices for competing in international markets, we must face up to the competition from products coming into our market. I hope that the House will accept that the era of protectionism is no longer a realistic option.  Apart from EEC and other considerations, it would be a short-sighted policy to try to take unilateral action against imports, as other countries could operate a tit-for-tat and prevent Irish exports from reaching their shelves.  The impact of any such extreme measures is too horrendous to contemplate.</P>
    <P>In every world recession, people's purchasing power is limited.  Foreign manufacturers of biscuits and, indeed, all consumer products, find that their traditional outlets abroad are adversely affected, and they look around for new markets for their goods.  Unfortunately, they, too, cast their eyes on Ireland, as will be clear from a visit to any Irish supermarket. Clearly, cost competitiveness is the answer to the problem, and not short-term protectionist measures.  It is a matter for management in industry to achieve this cost competitiveness.  However, I am not by any means saying that loss of competitiveness is entirely the fault of industrial management.  That would be a naive statement.  Cost competitiveness can be achieved, or adversely affected, by a number of factors and attitudes.  I know that the popular thing to say is that the Government policy on taxation is to blame for all these ills and far be it from me to say that it has not had some impact. What must not be lost sight of is that there are a number of social partners, and it behoves each of the partners to look critically at their own involvement in this industry.</P>
    <P>On the taxation front, a delicate balance must be struck between the need to <Col N="1727" /> collect enough revenue to run the economy and the need for industry to survive and develop.  Management must manage effectively while workers must, through attitudes and wage and other demands, have full regard for the interests of their firms.</P>
    <P>The Government are extremely concerned about all components of industrial costs.  The Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, has established a committee to investigate electricity charges as they apply to industry, and this committee are still examining this urgent matter.  Within the present Department, a committee on industrial costs are investigating the whole matter in depth.</P>
    <P>I am also glad to advise the Deputies and the House that the Minister is arranging, at the earliest date, to meet the owners of all our major supermarkets with a view to impressing upon them the need to give every possible facility to home produced goods on their shelves.  In this connection, I must put on record the fact that VAT on imported biscuits is the same as that applicable to home produced biscuits, and it is not right to imply that there is an advantage here for the imported article.</P>
    <P>While it may be small comfort to Irish Biscuits Limited, the general international consensus seems to be that the world recession is easing and that there is a modest but growing confidence in an upturn shortly.  While again expressing my concern at the proposed short-time working, I would like to think that it is a prudent decision by the company's management aimed at not only stabilising existing production but expanding at a <Col N="1728" /> later stage to take advantage of the more favourable world climate for industrial production.  I assure Deputy Walsh that I shall immediately bring his anxiety and that of the other speakers to the attention of the IDA, to see what further investigation might be engaged in so that no stone is left unturned to ensure the safety and prolonged security of Irish Biscuits Limited.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point made by Deputy Taylor, dumping would have to be proved.  This dumping may be occurring but in order to be effective in opposing dumping, it must be definitely proved, and this is extremely difficult. Certainly, if Deputy Taylor or any other Deputy can bring evidence to our Department of dumping on a scale which can be proved, I shall be happy indeed to investigate the matter.  With regard to the point made by Deputy Walsh that a number of meetings between the workers and different Ministers had taken place, unfortunately I was not present at those meetings.  However, I understand that they are mainly related to VAT and PRSI deductions, and these would be primarily a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputies and the House that we will have these matters reactivated with the Minister for Finance to ensure that, having regard to the gravity of the situation, every co-operation is forthcoming from the Department side to meet the worries and anxieties of the Deputies on the opposite side of the House.</P>

As soon as the matter is finalised all members concerned, including those who have retired since 1 October 1982, the operative date of the award, will be informed of the position as it affects them.</P>
