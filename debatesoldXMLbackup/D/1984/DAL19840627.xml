      <P>On a point of order, I am sure you are aware, Sir, that on a number of occasions the Minister for Foreign Affairs has referred matters to the Whip's Office.

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy Skelly is in possession.  I might remind the House that this Bill must be concluded by 11.30 a.m. and I shall be calling on the Minister to conclude at 11.15 a.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be a few minutes only summing up what I had been saying yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the 1977 Misuse of Drugs Act provided the legal framework for a wide range of controls over the supply and distribution of certain dangerous and harmful drugs difficulties have arisen in recent years because of the scale of their misuse.  It is necessary to update that legislation, and I accept that.  This Bill's strength is in the area of detection and detention in cases of drugs abuse.  It is really an attack on criminals.  Hopefully it will be in aid of the Garda in the detection of the godfathers in this area of crime and also constitute an attack on drug pushers.  But it will not help to any great extent in eliminating the problem obtaining with drugs and will not provide any <Col N="714" /> extra facilities needed in the fight against their misuse.  I would ask the Minister to pass this message on to the Minister for Finance and, because this does constitute a genuine emergency, to ask that the necessary funds be made available for the provision of facilities and back-up services, where needed, for the victims of drugs abuse.  Such facilities are needed in all communities.</P>
    <P>I do not know what help may be available from EEC resources in that respect. I do not have comparative statistics with other countries, as to how they are tackling this problem.  Although we are in the midst of a recession it must be said that we have not got our priorities in order with regard to the prevention of drugs abuse.  In recent years we have provided an extra 144 churches in the Dublin area, the churches being built first and ancillary facilities coming later but, in most cases, those facilities have not been provided at all.  The relevant communities provided the moneys for the building of those churches but without any facilities being provided adjacent thereto.  In my constituency recently a community centre was built in preference to a church &mdash; by the prisoners of Mountjoy &mdash; when the priest involved was quite happy, feeling that the priority was to have a community centre, with facilities for the people living in the area, especially the young, because of the large numbers of children between the ages of 11 and 16 who are the victims of drugs abuse and because there was no place available for their treatment. Because facilities are so lacking in our community, especially in the city of Dublin, that is an area in which tremendous inroads could be wrought.  Perhaps somebody in the religious area would take note of that.</P>
    <P>I was recently in another part of my constituency where the insistence was on the provision of a church first, this was about six years ago, although the community concerned had offered to build a complete community or village centre with facilities for everybody from the very young to the very old.  That was rejected by the relevant church authorities in favour of the traditional method of providing first a church for the community. <Col N="715" /> Today that community has its church but no other facilities whatsoever. Although a fairly well-off community it is impoverished and does have all of the other problems of this age, drugs, drink, vandalism and so on whereas, had such facilities been provided, they might have been avoided.</P>
    <P>I realise this debate is limited, and I shall afford other Deputies an opportunity to speak.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Like most other speakers on all sides of the House, I welcome this Bill.  It is obvious that drug abuse is directly related to its availability in the community.  Until spring of 1981 there was hardly any drug abuse in this country, then there was an extremely sudden epidemic and this is thought to have been due to the Iranian revolution to some extent.  At that time a large amount of heroin flooded the world market.  It has been suggested that a certain Dublin family saw an opening in the market in Ireland and flooded this city with illicit drugs, but I believe this is an over-simplification of the situation.  Ireland has a burgeoning young population.  Let me say that drug abuse is a crime of the young.  The young have a proportionately large amount of disposable income and Ireland was used as a conduit for drugs going to Britain.  At that time security in regard to drugs was relatively lax as it was not perceived as a problem in this country.  The incidence in Ireland is rising while in all other high abuse areas such as New York etc. it is dropping.  It reached an all-time high in the US during the Vietnam war period, again at a time of high availability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do we realise how much the general attitude of the community influences the incidence of drug taking?  In the US it was considered the &ldquo;in thing&rdquo; to smoke marijuana.  Cocaine sniffing has now replaced this and a party is not considered to be a success if &ldquo;coke&rdquo; is not offered to all present.  In Ireland alcohol is the drug of addiction which is socially accepted.  A night or a party is good in Ireland if the amount of alcohol consumed is so much that no one can remember the next day. <Col N="716" /> I noted the publication on Sunday of figures suggesting that Irish families spent more of their housekeeping budget on alcohol than families in nearly every other country of the world.  One-eighth of all our spending was on alcohol.  Of course, I realise that part of this was due to the high VAT and excise duties, but a fact even more interesting is that Irish people deny the amount of money they spend on alcohol.  They underestimate the amount spent.  Maybe this means that our attitude to the abuse of alcohol is changing and that a climate may yet develop where the abuse of any drug, be it tobacco, alcohol, soft or hard drugs, is considered reprehensible.  Also I suggest that long-term barbiturates and tranquilliser abuse needs a good deal more research into it and education of the public. In this I commend the new self-help groups set up to help tranquilliser addicts, but let me give a word of warning and suggest that there is a need for medical control of tranquilliser withdrawal as with all other hard drugs.</P>
    <P>The Medico-Social Research Board survey on drug abuse in Ireland in 1982-83 pointed out how very often drug abusers come from families in which drink is a problem, even though the abusers or addicts themselves are not into alcohol. They also pointed out that heavy cigarette smoking was the almost invariable rule in these families.  The sad thing about this survey was that some of the children involved were aged 12 to 14, some of them only ten years of age.  They were experimenting with heroin at an age when they could not know the problems and the only reason for their doing it was that it was so easy to get and they thought that everyone else was doing it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has talked about irresponsible prescribing of controlled drugs and the investigation of this in accordance with the procedure set out in the 1977 Act.  He says these procedures are cumbersome and time-consuming, and I agree with him.  However, he must realise that time is required where the investigation may lead not only to the taking away of a person's livelihood but also to a permanent blot on the person's character. Why should sections 3 and 4 enable <Col N="717" /> the Minister to set up the exact same committee of inquiry as is now being set up by the registration authority in order to prevent a practitioner from continuing to prescribe dangerous drugs?  I agree that the Minister should have the authority to issue, where he considers it necessary, a temporary prohibition, but a more permanent prohibition should be left as heretofore, in the hands of the registration authority.</P>
    <P>To put this whole matter in its proper perspective, in the five years of the life of the first council &mdash; prior to that our council was based in England with Irish representatives &mdash; a total of nine doctors were investigated for irresponsible prescribing. Of these, in the case of four the adjudgment was no case to answer; in other words, these four practitioners were cleared.  One practitioner was declared incompetent, two were found guilty, one of whom went quietly and the other contested the case in the High Court but lost.  One doctor was found to be unregistered, in other words not entitled to write prescriptions.  As can be seen from this, despite the high profile publicity given to &ldquo;rogue&rdquo; doctors, this problem is indeed quite small.  Nevertheless I agree, as a medical practitioner, that the whole process of rooting out the bad apple must be simplified and speeded up.</P>
    <P>I would also advocate some bar to the irresponsible prescribing of tranquillisers and barbiturates.  Although tranquillisers are not included under the DDA, they are nevertheless drugs of addiction and are extremely widely used with, in many cases, medical complicity.  It has been suggested that, as in Britain, addicts should be registered and have small doses of drugs prescribed for them.  Controlled studies there have suggested some benefits for patients.  There are also obvious benefits for the community in that, theoretically at least, if the addict does not need large amounts of money to support his habit then the level of crime in the community must automatically drop.  In the Dublin North-Central study both phases I and II confirmed repeatedly that the daily requirement of heroin for a full-blown abuser or addict in this town costs £100 to £200, and that was at 1982-83 <Col N="718" /> prices.  I shudder to think what it is today.  However, in the sixties in Britain uncontrolled prescribing by private practitioners led to a severe spread of addiction. This was reduced when controls on heroin and cocaine were introduced, but subsequently methadone, diconal and ritalin were unduly liberally prescribed. The obvious way to prevent this occurring is to restrict prescribing of all DDA drugs for addicts to certain treatment clinics staffed by doctors with special licences to prescribe where no fee would be involved.  In Britain it was found that addicts would sell out part of their prescribed drugs in order to pay the doctor or for additional drugs elsewhere.  In view of that it would be necessary for prescriptions to be made out on a daily basis with unalterable date, otherwise addicts could sell part of their supply or they might use more than their allotted daily dose at one time, thereby leading to an increased tolerance level and a greater requirement. I am not necessarily advocating this method of addiction control but I feel it warrants consideration by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 6 refers to mandatory prison sentencing of a drug addict on a third offence.  This seems somewhat harsh, particularly if we accept that once addicted a person is now a patient and ill. As a result, are we not locking up people as a punishment for their illness?  Perhaps mandatory rehabilitation would be more to the point.  In any case, as Deputy Gregory said last night, drugs are definitely available in Mountjoy and other prisons. A study of drug addicts in Mountjoy was completed recently and the lack of rehabilitation facilites came out very strongly in this.  Therefore I ask the Minister to reconsider this measure.  I believe it is too harsh.</P>
    <P>The most worrying aspect of the drug problem is the widespread availability of drugs.  I welcome the proposals in sections 9 and 10 which seek to tackle this problem by giving wider powers of search to the Garda.  Though I quibbled earlier, I agree with sections 3 and 4 which propose to streamline the investigation procedure in regard to rogue doctors.  I disagree with parts of those sections but I <Col N="719" /> will await the Committee Stage before commenting further.</P>
    <P>I welcome also section 5 though the matter with which it seeks to deal is not a problem at the moment so far as I am aware.  Perhaps there are available in Dublin magazines which advertise the sale of drugtaking equipment but this is not the situation in Waterford.  In relation to health education, perhaps career guidance officers who are being used to teach life skills could be used to educate on drug addiction.  I deplore the cutting back in the area of career guidance teachers but that is a matter for another Minister and another day.</P>
    <P>There is proof that drug addiction and crime are related directly to unemployment, so perhaps if we could correct that problem there would be no need for Bills such as this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with the other speakers in this debate I welcome the Bill as part of the broad programme of action aimed at tackling the drug problem. The welcome elements of the Bill include the closing of certain loopholes in definitions and allowing wider powers of search in situations of the importation of drugs or of the movement of drugs from one country to another or within the State.  There have been too many cases of people going free because of loopholes in the law.</P>
      <P>I welcome also the proposal to increase the power of the Minister in respect of intervening in cases of abuse of power by medical practitioners in prescribing drugs.  The proposal to bypass the low investigative powers of the registration board is a good development because there have been many reports of serious abuse in this area.  It is important that such reports be acted on quickly.  This is all the more important in areas of high medical card usage where even in the use of ordinary medicines there is an element of over prescribing and perhaps a higher level of visitation to doctors.  There is a special need to be careful in the medical card area for which the Government have responsibility, having provided the facility in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="720" /> Another important proposal is the one relating to making it an offence to produce books or to bring into the country books that will encourage the use of drugs.  Such publications are not commonly available here but we must take steps to prevent their becoming available.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the proposals in respect of making it an offence to pass information or documents to another in order to enable him to acquire prescribed drugs.  I have heard of two or three addicts in my constituency using the same medical card.  It is important that such activity be made an offence for all involved.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister proposes to increase the penalties having regard to the level of addiction.  Obviously, the godfathers have little to risk as the law stands.  Profit levels for them are very high while the highest level of sentencing is of the order of eight years.  They might consider it worth while to risk eight years imprisonment for the sort of profit they could make in one year beforehand.  If then they were sent to prison their families could live very well financially and other benefits could be retained by the criminals' associates.  Increasing the penalties indicates the seriousness with which we are treating the problem and is a reflection of the attitude of our people to the abuse of drugs and related crimes.</P>
    <P>However, I would call on the Minister as head of the Department who spearheaded the Government Task Force on drug abuse to assume an overall responsibility in the broad programme which is needed to ensure success.  Those of us who listened to Deputy Gregory will have heard another side of the story but one which I am sure the Minister is familiar with.  The Deputy's contribution was very impressive though in many respects very sad in putting before us the reality of the problem in his constituency.  I do not have the direct knowledge in this area that Deputy Gregory has because the problem has not reached such an extent throughout Dublin but there are areas of high risk in my constituency and that is why I am asking the Minister to ensure that the Government maintain their commitment <Col N="721" /> to keeping a watch on these high-risk areas and to taking the action outlined in the report.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the further strengthening of the Garda Drug Squad and I am glad that ban ghardaí are to be deployed in this area, not only for reasons associated with the drug problem but also because of my belief in the potential of women in many other areas.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need for the development of treatment facilities, an area for which the Minister has direct responsibility. It is unacceptable that after 18 months in office the Government have failed to develop treatment services. Until we have delivered on that aspect, we cannot claim to have made any significant progress in respect of the commitment to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>Because of the seriousness of the drug problem there is a need for action on the lines of the action taken by a former Minister, Dr. Noel Browne, when he tackled the problem of TB which was one of the greatest scourges of previous decades. The drug problem needs to be tackled, contained and eliminated but that will only happen if it is tackled wholeheartedly, and this includes the provision of treatment facilities.</P>
    <P>The commitment in respect of areas at risk and also the development of educational services in this whole area of drugs are two matters that should be tackled quickly.  Generally the profile of the drug addict is one of a youngster who for one reason or another has failed.  He or she is a drop-out and may have some background instability with perhaps their parents missing for one reason or another. There are certain areas in the city where there would be large numbers of such youngsters at risk.  Parts of my constituency were identified as being at risk. There are indications in the task force report that teachers in those areas should give a great deal more time to life skills. I have come across examples in the past year of the fruitless attempts of schools in those high risk areas to receive any kind of sympathetic treatment from the Department of Education in relation to ratios, remedial teachers or guidance teachers.  If we are serious the fine proposals <Col N="722" /> in this report must be made a reality.  Special efforts must be made in the educational sphere and in the youth work development field.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that a high level of funds was given by the Minister, Deputy Birmingham, to the north suburban areas. Ballymun and Finglas received £24,000 each.  There is need for a co-ordinated effort to be made in these high risk areas to ensure they do not have to argue on the same basis as areas with a lot of resources for treatment under the general educational scheme.  There must be progress or these areas will remain at risk. They have the potential to solve their problems.</P>
    <P>The problem in Ballymun is containable within the estate.  The people who work with the drug addicts in that area have identified a need for an alternative constructive environment free from drugs for example, the Coolmine Therapeutic Centre.  They need the assistance of every Government Department to create such an environment.  One youth worker will not do it.  I ask the Minister to undertake that co-ordination of the efforts of all Departments and ensure they focus on the areas of high risk in particular.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for updating the 1977 Misuse of Drugs Act.  It is important that all legislation be looked at after a certain length of time. It is timely that legislation should be brought in now to supplement that Act. However, we might be a year too late.</P>
      <P>In the past few months we heard about the reported involvement of subversives in the Dublin scene.  It is an indictment of politicians and the Government that we have not brought in legislation to complement the 1977 Act.  Subversives will always find a way to infiltrate communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the Bill and the power it gives to the Garda.  They are the ones who have to control the drug problem.  The problem is not confined to large urban areas but is a national one.  One has only to go to any large centre of population and one will find a drug problem of some kind.  The Minister should consider the <Col N="723" /> causes of the problem.  One of the biggest factors is unemployment.  Young people leave school at a very vulnerable age and have no prospects of employment.  Some of them are aged 15 years.  The drug pushers approach such people and have little trouble in pushing drugs on them.</P>
    <P>In a recent survey 10 per cent of those surveyed between the ages of 15 and 24 years were abusing heroin in parts of Dublin.  That is an indictment of the Government and all politicians.  I compliment the Garda Drug Squad for the work they are doing in controlling this problem.  With very little accommodation and funding they are doing a good job. When this Bill passes, the Minister should turn his attention to the problem of unemployment.  That is the underlying cause of the drug problem.  When we solve that problem we will be well on the way to reaching an ultimate solution of the drug problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions to this debate.  I am very pleased with the positive way in which Deputies have greeted the introduction of this Bill.  All the law enforcement in the world, Garda drug squads, social workers, doctors, treatment centres or educationalists cannot cure the drug problem unless there is a personal responsibility on the part of the individual not to blow his mind with drugs.  People who consciously decide to blow their minds and their lives and in the process destroy society make a personal decision.  That must be stressed. We must stress the havoc and human disaster which can be visited on the life of a person who indulges excessively in drugs.  I include in that drink, cigarettes and drugs in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to respond to the main points made by the Deputies during our discussion.  Deputy O'Hanlon is anxious that the registration authority concerned should be involved in the investigation procedures provided for in section 3 of the Bill.  I should say that the Medical Council, the Dental Board and the Veterinary Council each approved of the procedures provided for in both section <Col N="724" /> 3 and section 4 of the Bill.  In fact, the Medical Council requested that they should not have the responsibility of investigating such cases, to avoid prejudice to any action they might wish to take under their own disciplinary powers as provided for in the Medical Practitioners Act.  They will, however, as requested by themselves, be supplied with copies of the reports of the committees of inquiry for any further action they may wish to take under their own disciplinary powers. This might extend to the removal of a doctor from the register, as in the case of the first doctor to be banned from prescribing under the Misuse of Drugs Act procedures.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon also expressed some concern with the fact that there is no time limit on when the Minister must take a decision following receipt of the report of a Committee of Inquiry.  The purpose of streamlining the investigation procedure was to enable the Minister of the day to reach a decision quickly.  The Minister, having insituted inquiries, can hardly be expected to delay a decision and the imposition of a time limit on him is not appropriate.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies suggested that a minimum sentence of 14 years for drug pushing should be provided instead of a sentence to life imprisonment provided in section 6.  I would point out that minimum sentences are not usually provided for in legislation as it is an important general principle of the judicial system that the courts be allowed discretion to deal with individual cases in the light of their particular circumstances.  I would like to make it quite clear that a life sentence is indeterminate and that any decision to release a life sentence prisoner is one made by the Minister for Justice.  As the purpose of law enforcement must be primarily reform, not simply punishment, there must always be scope for reduction of sentence after a period of careful assessment and before the prisoner has become institutionalised. Provided there is good reason to believe that the person concerned is unlikely to be a menace to society, he will be released at the discretion of the Department of Justice.  A minimum of 14 <Col N="725" /> years would be regarded as amounting to abandonment of any hope for the prisoner's reform.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon suggested that licensed premises be included in the Bill. I will examine this although such inclusion is probably not legally necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa expressed some reservations about section 11 of the Bill in which it is proposed to amend section 28 (1) (a) of the 1977 Act to remove the obligation on a court to refer persons convicted of serious offences for medical and other reports in all cases before passing sentence.  The reason I propose to amend section 28 in this respect is that it is inappropriate to defer sentences on drug pushers who do not have a serious addiction problem while reports are being sought on their medical and social circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa expressed concern about the provision of section 6 which allows prosecution on indictment for simple possession of cannabis while at the same time retaining the present reduced penalties for posession for personal use. The Deputy is also concerned that we are proposing to introduce a prison sentence in the case of a third or subsequent offence. This provision is already contained in section 27 (1) (a) of the 1977 Act and we are not providing for anything new here.  I think it is reasonable to let it stand.</P>
    <P>The committees of inquiry will be representative of the practitioners' profession, appointed by the Minister of the day from nominations by the medical organisations and others chosen by the Minister. Deputy Cosgrave referred to the proposed new National Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse which I hope will be set up in early September.  Meanwhile the chairman of the task force is keeping progress under review.</P>
    <P>I agree that it is of great importance that our customs officials should be working in an effective manner and that there be full co-operation with the Garda authorities both as regards exchange of intelligence and prompt action for apprehending the culprits.</P>
    <P>The Task Force on Drug Abuse considered this problem of illicit importations <Col N="726" /> and made several recommendations in the areas of legislation and equipment which are being considered by the Revenue Commissioners.  The proposed new National Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse will also ensure that whatever administrative action is necessary to deal with them will be implemented by the responsible Departments.</P>
    <P>I now come to the implementation of the task force recommendations.  I am &ldquo;browned off&rdquo; at the negative carping one hears in this House.  When one is trying to implement the task force recommendations, all one gets is ignorance and abuse from some Deputies.  I am glad to be able to report that significant progress has been made to date on most of the recommendations.  On the law enforcement side the introduction of this Bill is implementing one of the recommendations. The Criminal Justice Bill made significant progress last week. Additional ban-ghardaí have been assigned to the drug units in Dublin, Cork and Limerick as recommended by the task force.  A more rigorous checking system for applications for passports has also been introduced by the Department for Foreign Affairs.  This is progress.  Deputy Gregory and others come into this House but never mention the implemention of these recommendations.  For example, the recommendation relating to the appointment of one judge of the Circuit Court and one district justice who would have special responsibility for all cases involving drug offences in the Dublin area is being pursued actively with the appropriate authorities.</P>
    <P>In the area of education, a set of five video films has been developed by the Department of Education, in co-operation with the Health Education Bureau in second level schools, youth club settings and parent groups.  I was surprised to hear Deputy Gregory refer to these videos in a disparaging manner.  I would have thought those who suffered from illiteracy in his constituency could valuably use those films.  The Minister for Education asked the new Curriculum and Examinations Board to examine the introduction of health education in schools at both primary and post-primary <Col N="727" /> levels.  It is also planned to develop the programme of training in drugs education so that selected teachers would be able to attend longer courses and progress would be made towards the stated Government aim of having at least one teacher in every school who would be in a position to advise on aspects of the drug problem in &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; areas.  Again I regret the dismissive attitude adopted by Deputy Gregory.  I have made substantial sums of money available to Trinity College to provide a diploma course in addiction studies.  This course commenced in January 1984 and provides specialised training for people such as social workers, teachers, guidance counsellors and garda in direct contact with drug abusers and their families.</P>
    <P>On the youth and community development side, the task force have met the Health Education Bureau, Cospóir, the National Youth Council and the National Youth Policy Committee.  In Ballymun there was a major meeting on 10 April 1984 convened by the city manager.  That meeting was quite successful and considerable work is being done in that area.</P>
    <P>The Medico-Social Research Board are currently carrying out four research projects on specific aspects of the drug problem among adolescents and progress is being made in this area.  I have been involved with the position in St. James's Hospital and Jervis Street Hospital and I thank the boards of those hospitals for agreeing to implement the relevant recommendations.</P>
    <P>I have made additional funds available this year to assist the Coolemine community. This was hardly referred to in the debate.  It is suggested that there are no facilities in the Dublin area but in Coolmine there is provision for 18 year olds and over, who constitute the majority of abusers.  I have visited Coolemine and 76 people are being helped there.  A large amount of State resources is being spent in this community where outstanding work is being done.  I suggest that Deputies go out there to see what is being done instead of talking off the top of their heads.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gregory referred to five deaths <Col N="728" /> over a recent weekend.  He said five young people died within five days.  I do not have that information.  The Garda Drug Squad are aware of seven deaths in the past six months and Jervis Street Hospital say there were nine deaths.  It is true that three of those deaths occurred over the weekend 8-9 June.  The question of heroin abuse and deaths arising therefrom must be kept in perspective.  To come into this House and try to twist the facts is not effective.</P>
    <P>I have opposed the Provisional IRA getting involved in concerned parent groups.  They have become involved, they are involved, and I urge parents in certain areas who are very concerned about drug abuse to beware of the extent to which the Provisional IRA move in because they will exploit the situation. There are a number of concerned parent groups who are aware of this situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Skelly referred to the size of the drug squad.  All Garda recruits are given special training to deal with the drug problem.  It is not just a question of the role of the drug squad; it is a question of the role of the Garda generally.  In recent months Garda authorities have increased the number of seizures.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gregory said nothing was being done in the inner city area.  Does he know what goes on in the Talbot Centre or in Sherrard Street?  Does he know they have a project leader and a group worker?  Does he know what is being done in Donore Avenue and the amount of money being given to that and other centres?  Does he know what is happening in the Cherry Orchard and Ballyfermot area where the health board have assigned a public health nurse to act as a tracer counsellor?</P>
    <P>A senior professionally qualified counsellor in substance abuse has been appointed to provide a service in Dún Laoghaire-Ballybrack.  In addition she is a qualified nurse.  She provides clinics and is involved in counselling and outreach work.  She is co-ordinating the efforts of voluntary groups in the area to ensure a co-ordinated balanced programme for the families of addicts and for community groups.</P>
    <P>The board also pay a grant to the Rutland <Col N="729" /> Centre which in recent years has extended its services for the treatment of alcohol abuse to include services for illicit drug abusers.  The board are in the process of building a youth development centre in the grounds of the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum.  The centre will provide accommodation for 31 young disturbed males and females whose behaviour, including drug-related offences, has resulted in their having difficulties with the law.</P>
    <P>In the youth work services area, the grant scheme for youth employment, operated by the Department of Labour, provides grants towards wages of young people employed on two projects in the Dublin area which are directly related to prevention of drug abuse.</P>
    <P>A grant was recently given to a group &ldquo;Teen Challenge&rdquo; in Ballybrack to assist them in their work educating young people about drugs and drug prevention. A grant has also been allocated to the Anna Liffey Project which provides support for ex-addicts through group work and counselling.  In addition, grants are made to a number of youth and community organisations to help them staff drop-in centres and expand youth services in built-up areas where drugs might be a problem.</P>
    <P>The death of Niall Rush was raised by one Deputy and I should like to make a personal statement on it.  I have been examining clincial trials since 3 December 1983 and there was an article on it in the <i>In Dublin</i> magazine.  I have been engaged in continual consultations in drawing up the difficult heads of a Bill to give statutory force to these matters, despite the abuse and the defamation heaped on me, particularly in the <i>Sunday Press</i> which eventually had the good grace to withdraw the allegations.  I have been working in an area where nothing had been done by the previous administration. This work will be given full statutory force in the near future.  I thank Deputy De Rossa for his concern in recent months and I can assure him that his observations have been taken into account.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to provide for an extension of the period of operation of the special ground rents purchase scheme that is administered by the Land Registry, subject to an increase in the fees payable under the scheme.</P>
      <P>This purchase scheme supplements the scheme of ground rent purchase that is provided by the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1967.  It was introduced by the No. 2 Ground Rents Act of 1978; it applies to dwellinghouses and it was originally given a life of five years to 31 July 1983.  However, its life was extended for a period of 12 months, that is, to 31 July next, by the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (Amendment) Act, 1983, subject to an increase in fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I explained to this House in the course of debate on the Bill that became law as the 1983 Act, there were two main reasons for providing last year's extension of the life of the scheme.  One was the large number of purchase applications that began to pour into the Land Registry as the original five-year period drew to a close.  It became clear that, were the scheme not to be extended, many intending purchasers might be unable to lodge completed applications in time.  The other main reason was that, because of mounting arrears of work arising from these belated applications, the Land Registry staff concerned would in any event have to continue their work under the scheme until well after the original termination date.  That being the case there might have been little enough actual saving if the scheme had been <Col N="731" /> allowed to end last year, as against providing some extension.</P>
    <P>In the event, however, last year's rush of applications continued at such a pace that any idea of disposing of arrears within the following 12 months became impracticable.  In the second place, it became clear that fresh applications made under the scheme during the period of its extension were by no means confined to applications from those who might have been unable to lodge completed applications before the original expiry date for the scheme.  The fact is that, for quite some time past, the Land Registry have continued to receive fresh applications at a remarkably steady rate of about 400 per month.</P>
    <P>Clearly, there are still numbers of ground rent tenants who are anxious to avail themselves of the scheme and who see it as a relatively simple and inexpensive way of buying out the fee simple of their properties.  Given the problem posed by the arrears from last year, however, the Land Registry are yet some considerable time away from being able to deal on a current basis with even this moderate flow of applications.</P>
    <P>It is in these circumstances that the Government have decided to propose a further extension of the scheme, this time for a period of three years.  The extension is being accompanied by a further increase in fees.  The fees that were fixed when the scheme was introduced in 1978 did not by any means cover the cost of administering it.  This was understood and accepted at the time.  It was recognised that the fees were little more than nominal and the idea was to encourage ground rent purchase.</P>
    <P>However, last year's extension of the scheme was accompanied by an increase in the fees payable, although public funds have in fact continued to bear a significant part of the cost of the scheme even following the introduction of last year's increase in fees.  The main reason for this is the large number of applications that were made at the old fees and that are still being processed.  This makes it difficult to estimate what level of fees would actually cover costs if arrears did not <Col N="732" /> come into the reckoning.  The best estimate that can be made is that an increase of 75 per cent in the level of fees is the minimum that is needed to cover costs in respect of new applications.  Provision for that increase is made in section 3 of the Bill so far as concerns applications from purchasers who are in occupation of their dwellinghouses.  Corresponding increases in the remaining fees will be promulgated by way of a fees order, following enactment into law of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Since the scheme is being extended for a further period of three years, since costs could change in the course of that period and since the increase of 75 per cent is very much a minimum estimate, it is necessary to make provision for further changes in the level of the fees so as to keep them in line with costs, and that is what is proposed in subsection (2) of section 3 of the Bill.  It provides that the existing power to change fees by order will in future extend to all fees &mdash; up to the present some fees have been fixed by the statute and could not be changed by order.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill proposes certain changes in relation to the fee payable under section 26 of the 1978 No. 2 Act. Section 26 of that Act gives ground rent tenants of housing authorities the right to buy out the fee simple, subject to certain conditions.  The fee simple is vested in the purchasing lessee by way of a transfer order under section 90 of the Housing Act, 1966, and section 26 of the 1978 No. 2 Act fixes a fee of £5 for the issue of that transfer order.  This fee has so far remained unchanged, despite last year's increase in the fees payable under the Land Registry scheme.</P>
    <P>It may, perhaps, be accepted that the considerations that apply in the case of the section 26 fee are not those that apply in the case of the Land Registry fees. Nevertheless, the lowest fee payable under the Land Registry scheme was also £5 in 1978, was increased to £15 last year and is now to become £26.  In the circumstances it is, I think, only reasonable that the section 26 fee should now be increased to £20, and that it should be open to variation in the future by way of a fees order in the same way as fees <Col N="733" /> generally may be so varied.  Section 4 of the Bill provides for these changes.  Any fees order under section 26 of the 1978 No. 2 Act, it is proposed, will be made by the Minister for the Environment since the section 26 fee is payable to a housing authority.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>We welcome the extension of the special ground rents purchase scheme for a further three years which scheme as the Minister said, was introduced in 1978 by Fianna Fáil to facilitate purchase.  Last year I proposed that the one year extension then being given should be extended to three years, which was reasonable.  I am glad that the Minister has now come around to this point of view.  Administratively, it will be far more preferable.</P>
      <P>We totally reject and oppose the proposed 400 per cent increase in fees over those which applied a year ago.  This time last year the fees were £5 without arbitration and £12 plus £5, making £17, when there was arbitration.  Now a fee of £26 is proposed without arbitration and an additional £63; making it £89, if there is arbitration.  We are opposed to these increases on the grounds that the basic intention of the Bill was to have a very nominal fee.  In our view these proposals are going well beyond that level.</P>
      <P>We also oppose the power which the Minister is seeking under section 3 and to which he referred in his speech.  This will enable him to raise these fees at any time to meet the full cost of dealing with applications by residents of dwellinghouses who wish to buy up their ground rents.  Not only is the fee being increased excessively at this stage in our view but, in addition, the Minister is taking the power to increase it at any time in the future over the three year period &mdash; for instance, in six months, a year or 18 months, whatever the case might be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The danger is that the Minister for Finance will ask the Minister for Justice in the next Estimate to meet the full cost which will be reckoned at considerably more again.  We have lost totally the nominal character of the measures in this Bill and are opposed to this change.  We <Col N="734" /> believe that the Minister's proposals as outlined will have a disastrous effect on the scheme to buy up existing ground rents.  The excessively increased charges which initially will amount to £89 where arbitration is involved will be a very distinct disincentive to those who want to use the scheme.  The Minister's proposals are a very definite departure from the initial concept of the fees being nominal and from the spirit of this legislation as introduced initially.  I know that the Minister will say, as he did last year when increasing the charges threefold from £5 to £15, that this is only allowing for inflation in the intervening period.  In effect, to allow for inflation would have brought the fee then from £5 to just over £9.  It is quite clear that going from that up to £26 and, where arbitration is concerned, to £89, is going far beyond the effects of inflation and is changing the character of the scheme.  The Minister may say that we must save money where we can from the public purse and that there is a question of staff involved.  He made much play of that last year in the debate on this whole issue.  That is to set aside the character of the scheme and to attempt to regard it in the same way as all other schemes.  The whole intention was to encourage and assist people to buy out the basic fee simple of their dwellings. This legislation was brought in because of constitutional difficulties which existed in abolishing ground rents altogether. People on all sides of the House were anxious to see an end to the ground rents system and in order to encourage that wanted a scheme introduced which would be particularly attractive.  We are now departing further from that and while we welcome the extension as being wise and very helpful, the increase in fees will have a very bad effect.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to some of the people involved in ACRA.  In my innocence I thought that they might be disappointed that the fees were so increased but their approach is that they are delighted with that because they do not want people to pay any more ground rents on private dwellings.  They say that this increase will be a very distinct discouragement to people to do so.  It suits their overall plan <Col N="735" /> of encouraging people not to buy out. Unfortunately, that is the effect of this increase.</P>
    <P>The Minister will argue that the amounts of money are relatively small but the ground rents themselves, as the Minister said last year, are relatively small, being of the order of £80, £100 or £150.  The principle involved here is distasteful. People on all sides of the House support the abolition of ground rents at the earliest possible date.  It is for that reason that they have been abolished on all future dwelling houses.  That has been operating now since 1978.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the number of applications is running at a fairly satisfactory level of about 400 a month, which is 4,800 a year.  In reply to my parliamentary question of 14 June 1983, the rates at which it was running were given as follows: in the year 1980, 5,181; in 1981, 5,838; in the year 1982, 6,128.  It was estimated at that time, on the basis of the seven months which had elapsed that it would be in excess of 6,000 in 1983.  Perhaps the Minister, when replying, or on Committee Stage, would tell us just how many there were at that stage.  I accept that there is a continuing demand but if anything it has dropped somewhat.  The figure given by the Minister of 4,800 is less than any of the figures which I have quoted.  On the basis of the demand continuing, however, it is well worth while extending the scheme.  The danger is that the numbers will drop further following the increase in fees.  I know the attitude of the people involved towards ground rents and can well imagine their approach to these increases.</P>
    <P>We call on the Labour Party to oppose these enormous increases in fees which change the character of the legislation and to support our amendment which will prepare the way for the abolition of existing ground rents on dwellings which come under the control of the local authorities. There was a very extensive debate this time last year and I do not wish to delay the Minister by extending this debate in this area.  We covered then the situation in relation to local authorities.  The local authorities or the housing authorities are <Col N="736" /> the ground landlords.  This applies to many areas throughout the city and the country.  Some of them are areas like Blanchardstown, Donaghmede and Tallaght where land was provided by the local authorities and consequently they are the ground landlords.</P>
    <P>In these cases where the ground rents are under the Government's control through the local authorities, we have been requesting the Minister to provide a scheme for the termination of these ground rents to show cause on the part of the State in relation to the abolition of ground rents.  We have put down an amendment the purpose of which is to give power to the Minister for the Environment, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to fix by order a termination date for ground rents on dwelling houses which come under his own control or the control of the local authorities or the housing authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister is doing something similar in relation to fees.  He is introducing a section which will enable the Minister for the Environment to set the fees which should be charged in future.  The Minister for the Environment may be put under pressure to bring fees up to a level which would no longer be nominal.  Other than that, it is an administrative arrangement.</P>
    <P>We are suggesting that there should also be a simple enabling section in the Bill which would allow the Minister for the Environment to make plans to bring in a termination date for these ground rents.  This should be the first step. Legislation should be introduced in the near future to bring to an end ground rent on dwellings generally.  That is a broader matter which may be pursued later.  In this Bill we have an opportunity to give the Minister for the Environment power to set a termination date.  The Government can consider what date they want to set and how it should be set.  That would be a useful development in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Some 300,000 householders are affected by these ground rents.  Around 10 per cent of them availed of the purchase scheme.  As the Minister said, about 400 a month are continuing to avail of it.  In our view it is time to advance the <Col N="737" /> whole process of terminating ground rents on dwellings, especially where the local authorities are involved.  On Committee Stage the Minister may be able to tell us more about the income which local authorities receive from these ground rents.  The amounts of money are very small.  In 1980, the figure for Dublin County Council was £11,000.  This would involve the big tracts of land on the outskirts of the city including Tallaght, Blanchardstown and Donaghmede.  I assume the figure has not changed very much since then.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation gave a figure of £120,000.  The difficulty in collecting this money and the desirability of doing away with ground rents ultimately would indicate that we should provide an enabling section in this Bill to allow the Minister for the Environment to introduce a scheme which would set a termination date.  We had detailed consideration of this question this time last year when the one year extension was given.  The points made then are still relevant.  The only change since then is the Minister's proposal to extend the scheme for a further three years.  We welcome the extension for three years.  We are opposed to the size of the fees and we want to amend the Bill to enable the Minister to set a termination date for ground rents controlled by local authorities.  It is time this was done.  We will discuss it further on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that The Workers' Party are opposed in principle to the idea of ground rents.  We consider it a feudal rent which has outlived its time, and for which no service is provided by the landlords who are in receipt of this rent.  It provides no service to the householder or the community at large.  Perhaps ground rents had the function when they were introduced of requiring leasehold tenants not to engage in certain developments, and so forth.  At this point they have no social function and are purely a means of exploiting householders who are already more exploited then they ought to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various schemes were introduced over the years to cope with this problem.  The <Col N="738" /> campaign organised by the Association of Combined Residents' Associations was largely instrumental in pressurising various Governments to introduce reforms of the system.  The reforms which have been introduced to date have been quite useful.  The one which has been most useful of all was the prohibition on the creation of new ground rents.  The denial of the landlord's right to evict a person for non-payment of ground rent was a milestone on the road to the elimination of ground rents.</P>
    <P>The scheme we are discussing today was introduced in 1978.  It was an amendment of an earlier scheme of 1967 which allowed householders to buy out their ground rent.  It was proposed by the then Government as their scheme for the final determination of this problem.  The fact that six years after the introduction of that purchasing scheme hundreds of thousands of householders are still paying ground rent to landlords is a measure of the opposition there is to ground rents and the very idea of paying these landlords any more money.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposals today are acceptable in some respects and unacceptable in others.  The proposal to extend the scheme is welcome, but the Minister could have accepted an extension of the scheme last year when he was proposing a one year extension, when I was proposing a five year extension and the Fianna Fáil spokesman was proposing a three year extension.  The effect of the Bill before us today is to extend the period for four years in all since June of last year.  The Minister's argument last year that if he were to accept our argument for a five-year extension he would have no grounds for arguing against a permanent scheme is just as valid today as it was then.  There is no argument for not having a permanent scheme until such time as all the residential ground rents have been eliminated.</P>
    <P>I oppose the Minister's proposal to increase the fees.  As the spokesman for Fianna Fáil has indicated, when the scheme was introduced the fee of £5 was intended as a nominal fee in order to encourage people to purchase ground <Col N="739" /> rents.  The Minister now seems to be going totally against the spirit of that measure by introducing a charge of £26, which is totally unacceptable.  I am not happy with the fact that the Minister proposes to take powers to enable him or the Minister for the Environment to fix fees by order rather than having to come before this House to vary the fees in the next few years.  He is proposing that he or his successors or the Minister for the Environment may by order vary the fees as they see fit.  That is not an acceptable situation either.</P>
    <P>The whole matter of the abolition or termination of ground rents is still not being dealt with by this Government. Given the history of this scheme, there is no reason to believe that in another three years the 300,000 householders involved will have caved in and bought out their ground rents.  The Labour Party who are also in Government are on record as being totally opposed to ground rents. They have declared this on numerous occasions and at their annual conference prior to the 1982 General Election they called for the Parliamentary Labour Party to refuse to support a Fine Gael Government unless they got a promise to abolish ground rents, but today they do not even think it worth their while to come into this House and contribute to the debate.  The running sore of ground rents will continue so long as the nettle of abolition is avoided.</P>
    <P>On other occasions when the matter of abolition was raised the Minister argued that there was a constitutional problem and he said one could not abolish ground rents without providing for compensation. The point the Minister has missed on several occasions is that The Workers' Party's position at all times has been that compensation should be paid.  However, if one examines the situation for most householders it is they who should be entitled to compensation in view of the fact that they have not been getting any service whatever for the rents they have paid during the years.  It has been proposed on many occasions that where there is a dispute over who should pay compensation a tribunal should be established <Col N="740" /> to enable decisions to be made as to who should receive and who should pay compensation.</P>
    <P>This Bill is extending the scheme and it is to be welcomed for that reason, but sections of the Bill are not acceptable and they will be opposed by me today.  We have proposed a number of amendments. I urge the Minister and the Labour Party element of the Government to come to grips with the matter of ground rents and to make a final decision to abolish them. They should ensure that the necessary machinery for doing this is established immediately.</P>
    <P>In the past year in this House The Workers' Party have proposed a termination date for ground rents.  I note the Fianna Fáil spokesman has indicated that they support the idea of a termination date for ground rents.  I note also that in the published documents of the Labour Party they also support this.  Unfortunately, when The Workers' Party proposed such a Bill in this House last year neither the Labour Party nor Fianna Fáil supported that Bill or even supported it to the extent that it could be discussed here.  Given the history of this problem and the history of the promises to date by the Labour Party, by Fine Gael and by Fianna Fáil, we must question their seriousness with regard to this issue.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister not to bother us here in three years' time with a request for a further extension but in the meantime to introduce a Bill that will lead to the abolition of these rents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): I thank Deputy Woods and Deputy De Rossa for their agreement to the principle of what I am proposing here, namely, the extension for a further three years of the purchase scheme under the 1978 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Woods asked a number of questions about the numbers involved and he quoted some figures.  For the record I wish to give the following data: the number of applications under the scheme from 1/8/1978 until 31/5/1984 was 44,465.  Of these, over 20,000, that is, 45 per cent, were lodged since the 1/1/1983. Thus, almost half were lodged when the <Col N="741" /> scheme began to terminate: in other words, people were trying to get in before the scheme terminated.  There is a guesstimate that there are almost 250,000 residential ground rents.  The arrears on hands at 31/5/1984 amounted to 16,968, that is, 13,083 applications made with the consent of the landlord and 3,885 applications for arbitration.  The Land Registry have estimated that this means an applicant would have to wait two or five years for his vesting certificate, depending on whether it is a consent or an arbitration case.  The number of applications completed during the period since the Bill was introduced, from 1/8/1978 to 31/5/1984, was 27,497.  With almost 17,000 applications on hands in the Land Registry one can see the reason for the waiting period.</P>
    <P>The Land Registry estimate that if the scheme were to continue after July 1984 on a self-supporting basis the fees would need to increase and I have made that point already.  What is at issue here is to allow people the opportunity to continue to purchase.  The scheme was introduced with the intention that it would be a scheme of limited duration, that at the end of five years people could still purchase but they would have to go to a solicitor and pay full legal fees if they did not avail of the opportunity over the five-year period of working through the Land Registry at nominal fees.  The fee that applies in the vast majority of cases is the fee required on consent applications. The fee for a normal detached or semi-detached house ranging in price from £33,000 upwards to any price one likes to pitch will be a sum of £26 as a result of what I am proposing here.  A fee of £26 to deal with the legal end of the purchase of ground rent is not a very large amount, and if somebody wants to consult a solicitor I am sure it would cost a lot more.  We can talk in terms of percentages but the reality is that it is being increased from £15 to £26 and that will apply in the majority of cases.  The arbitration case is going from £51 to £89 because it costs a lot more and there are more administrative and legal costs.</P>
    <P>We must watch the ordinary case where an individual resident acting for a <Col N="742" /> residents' association puts in an application and they usually have an agreement with the landlord, have the consent and can get their ground rent for £75, £80 or £90.  In that case the legal end will cost £26 so that even though people will talk about the increased fee, we are speaking about an overall fee of only 26 per cent in most cases.</P>
    <P>Deputies have said that the principle is distasteful and of course it caused many problems in the seventies and is still causing a certain amount of concern.  The difficulty is that compensation would have to be paid.  People have a right to private property under the Constitution. The right to an annuity under ground rent legislation is a form of private property. We have the conflicting interests of two people with a right to private property, the landlord as a result of the original contract and the person who owns the house.  When we speak about ACRA, in the vast majority of cases we are speaking about people who own their houses. We are also talking about houses built prior to 1978 because one cannot impose a ground rent on houses built after that. I do not know what compensation would amount to but various estimates between £40 million and £70 million have been suggested to compensate landlords for their loss of revenue as a result of abolishing ground rent.</P>
    <P>Where is that money to come from? From the taxpayer and who is the taxpayer? He is the person paying PAYE in the house you are trying to relieve of ground rent.  That would mean another of these transfer payments which have bedevilled the country in recent years.  A man would be paying extra tax in order to get an extra benefit from the State. The result would be that the level of compensation would be up to the full multiple of 7.2 or 7.3 whereas individual residents' associations at present can negotiate with a landlord and come out with multiples of 3½ or 4.  If the State agree to compensate the landlord they will end up paying twice as much as individuals would pay because individuals can make a better arrangement with landlords.</P>
    <P>The objection to the increase in fees <Col N="743" /> falls into the same category.  If we leave the fee at £5 although the scheme is costing £26 per application on the consent side and at least £89 or £90 in other fees which do not even cover the full cost, where is the money going to come from? I have to go to the Minister for Finance to look for extra money which will have to come from the taxpayers.  Circular transfers make no sense.  Why should people who own their own houses and are taxpayers have a further imposition put on them so that they can get benefit back from the State in ground rent?  Why not bring the fee up to the suggested figure of £26 which is roughly what it costs to process the application?  There are no free meals any more; I do not think there ever were although there was a time when we were borrowing so much that people did not realise that they had to pay for services.  It is reasonable to continue with a fee which meets the costs and which will be a lot less than if we abolished the scheme and people had to consult solicitors and pay full legal fees.</P>
    <P>To abolish ground rent on the lines which Deputy De Rossa suggested amounts to confiscation.  We cannot confiscate property without compensation which would have to come from the taxpayers. I am surprised that The Workers' Party should suggest something along these lines because we are talking about people who own their own houses.  They may not be very well off but at least they are better off than those who do not.  We are talking about people in private estates which were built prior to 1978, of an asset which starts at £30,000 and is, on average, much higher.  The Deputy seems to think we should put a scheme together so that the taxpayers would compensate people who pay ground rent.  It does not make sense when you realise that the old age pensioners, the poor and people in local authority houses, would be paying that tax to relieve householders of the burden of paying £15 or £20 per annum.  People should have the freedom to relieve themselves of the burden of ground rent if they wish.  However, I do not think people see it as a financial burden.  They are annoyed at the principle of paying <Col N="744" /> ground rent.  They can buy their ground rent under this scheme which will be extended for another three years.  If they want to avoid the increase in fees they can apply between today and the last day of July and they will be able to avail of the fees which pertain at present.</P>

      <P>I should like to tell Deputy Woods that &ldquo;Act (No. 2) of 1978&rdquo; is the draftsman's formula in this Bill for the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978.  It does not cover the number of the Act and the year, No. 16 of 1978.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The effect of section 2 is to extend the operation of the special ground rents purchase scheme for a further period of three years, until 31 July 1987.  Part 3 of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978, under which the special ground rents purchase scheme for tenants of ordinary dwelling houses was to operate was for a period of five years under section 18.  This period was extended to six years, until 31 July 1984 by section 1 of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (Amendment) Act, 1983, the Bill we passed last year.  Section 2 of the Bill extends it for a further period up to nine years.  Rather than saying we are extending it for a further three years we are saying that the duration of the 1978 purchase scheme will now go to nine years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage I welcomed the extension in this section and made the point that in June last we proposed that the figure should be ten years rather than six years as proposed by the Minister.  At that time the Minister said in response to our proposal:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, these arguments afford no support for an extension of the scheme for a further five years.  If a further five <Col N="746" /> year extension were to be regarded as acceptable there would be no evident ground for refusing an indefinite extension, that is for refusing to make the scheme permanent.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell us what has led him to change his mind now because it seems that effectively he has brought it up to nine years?  The argument still seems to be valid that the scheme should in some way be permanent if it is to have the effect he proposes it should have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard the extension of the scheme as highly desirable.  All Members should encourage people who have not done so to avail of the scheme because it will help wipe out something that is very much a running sore for many people.  As the Minister said the cost of buying out the ground rents is reasonable and generous on the part of the State.  If the scheme was to be extended indefinitely it would not have the desirable effect.  The fact that it would be for a limited period has encouraged people to buy out their ground rent.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out to the Minister that the solicitors in some building societies are anxious about vesting certificates.  The Minister has said that an effort will be made to rectify the problems that have arisen.  It may transpire that after a person who believes he or she has the fee simple interest in a property lodges the papers and documents it may be discovered that he or she is not the real beneficiary.  The beneficiary may be a person of unsound mind, a person suffering from a disability or an under-age person.  The certificates are then called into question.  Solicitors for building societies are reluctant to advance loans on foot of such title.  Is the Minister in a position to tell the House how long it will take to resolve that problem?</P>

      <P>We welcome the extension for a further three years.  Three years is about right to encourage people to purchase the ground rent.  People are now aware that the scheme will not be open indefinitely.  Last year I suggested that the extension should be three years and, <Col N="747" /> naturally, we support the extension this year.  With regard to the statement by Deputy De Rossa about the termination date I should like to point out to him that last year we put forward a proposal that the scheme be extended for a further three years and that the Minister consider introducing a termination date for local authority ground rents.  We are following that up now by tabling an amendment on that.  The Deputy should not doubt our seriousness and interest in getting finished with ground rents.

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Deputy De Rossa asked me why I was extending the period to three years now when previously I was only prepared to extend it for one year.  I would like people to purchase their ground rent if they find it an aggravation.  The original scheme was for five years and it seems to me, looking at the figures, that people need the stimulus of the scheme being about to terminate before they apply.  Although the purchase scheme was available for five years initially, 45 per cent of the applications, 20,000, were made in the last six months of the scheme.  We had 55 per cent of applications made in four and a half years and within the last six months of the scheme 45 per cent of the applications arrived.  It seems that many people allow the bill to mount up and then deal with it every four or five years while others pay £15 or £20 every year.  It appears that many people do not want to buy out their ground rent at all and are happy to pay £15 or £20 annually.  However, other people are anxious to buy out their ground rent.  I believe it is the idea that a scheme is about to terminate that is the stimulus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to tell the House that there is about two years' work on hand at present.  A person applying now will not get a vesting certificate for about two years.  By extending the scheme for three years we will have a period when there will be a stimulus for people to purchase. The three-year extension is reasonable. To have an indefinite scheme could bring about a situation where people would not <Col N="748" /> apply or where there would be a trickle of applications.  It is also important that the matter is brought to attention every so often.  As a result of the debate held in the House last year there was a flood of applications because people's minds were directed towards the benefits of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright raised an important point.  The law society have drawn attention to certain difficulties that the operation of the scheme in its present form raises for purchasers and for conveyancers dealing with property.  They have asked that the scheme should be extended for one year or, at most, two years and want a commitment to review the scheme further and an improved form introduced.  We can commit ourselves to reviewing it further and at the same time extending it for three years.  The difficulties outlined by the Deputy are real but they are not things that can be changed administratively.  It will mean that I will have to come back with a separate Bill. The difficulties were brought to my attention quite recently and I hope to come back to the House some time next year to deal with them.  It is difficult to give a date on something like this because, as the House will appreciate, conveyancing is a very tricky area of law.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The effect of subsection (1) is to increase by approximately 75 per cent with effect from 1 August 1984 the fee set out in section 23(1) of the 1978 (No. 2) Act as amended by section 2 of the 1983 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a need for an explanatory memorandum and I would like to know why such an explanatory memorandum was not circulated with this Bill.  It would have been very helpful particularly in a case like this amendment to the existing Act.  It says in section 3 that in section 23(2) of Act (No. 2) of 1978, the words &ldquo;other than the fees mentioned in subsection (1)&rdquo;, and in section 23(3) the words &ldquo;With the exception of these fixed in respect of the cases mentioned in subsection (1)&rdquo; shall cease to have effect.  Let us be very careful now to determine exactly what that means in practice.  The Minister has spelt out quite clearly that the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Lands, may by order fix the fees to be taken in the Land Registry for the purpose of this part and may revoke or amend any such order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of this will be to leave it open to the Minister to fix any fees and that is something that should be pointed out very clearly in an explanatory memorandum. It is a point that could easily be missed in relation to the other changes taking place.  The other changes may be minor while this is a substantial change. It changes the whole character of the setting of the fees.  The Minister for Justice is entitled by order to set the charges in future.  Fees are set today by some process of calculation such as the £23 and £26, plus £63, which is £89 in the case of arbitration.  We could have in any period of two weeks to six months or one year <Col N="750" /> a doubling of that fee because we are told the overheads of one sort or another would be added on.  From that point of view it is important that an explanatory memorandum should accompany even a small Bill like this.  It seems a very simple one until one looks into it in depth and finds the effects are not quite so simple as they appear to be at first sight.  Section 3 is an example of that.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say it is a very simple Bill and therefore an explanatory memorandum is not necessary but I have seen many very simple Bills being introduced with an explanatory memorandum so that all those concerned were able to see exactly what changes were being proposed. Such a memorandum obviates the necessity of pouring over the Bill in an effort to work out what exactly is happening. I would ask the Minister to provide in future an explanatory memorandum even with apparently very simple Bills.  We are opposed to the increase in fees and giving the Minister the power to determine the fees on a day-to-day basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister says the fee is a very reasonable one and no one should quibble about it.  It is a question of doing away with a system in regard to which all those involved declared themselves to be in favour of abolishing and changing the 1978 Act and subsequent Acts in line with that.  The nominal nature of these fees should be maintained.  The Minister may say £26 is very small, but where you have a large group of residents the figure could be very high.  Surely there could not be all that enormous difficulty once you have established the position for one and cross checked with the others involved.  The corporation have the duty to clear ownership and it should be a very simple matter to cope with the 30, 50, 300 or 600 or whatever the number may be.  When one multiplies the £26 by all those involved the sum is quite substantial.</P>
    <P>We have argued about this with solicitors in the past where a large number were involved in one area and each person was charged a similar fee.  The work involved would be very simple and solicitors in cases like that have often come up with a package deal.  There is no package deal proposed here.  The Minister <Col N="751" /> mentioned that over this period of two years some 16,968 cases were awaiting. There is a staff of 12 and this staff of course is subject to the embargo.  The Minister also gave us the cost of this staff as £117,000 per annum.  If we take the two amounts given so far, we have the 3,885 arbitration cases and we have the 16,968 total number of cases awaiting which leaves one with 13,113 at the £26. Take the 13,000 at £26 and the other 3,885 at the £89 and you get a figure of £345,000 and £341,000 which comes to £686,000.  I do not know where the rest of the money goes but in relation to a staff of 170 and the fact that it takes two years one is talking about £340,000 for staff presumably.  But the Minister would appear to have doubled the amount here and it certainly looks somewhat doubtful from the point of view of the actual cost. The State is also involved.</P>
    <P>The increase is moving too far away from nominal sums and on that basis we are opposed to the section.  We want to maintain the nominal sums.  We are also opposed to giving the Minister the power to increase these fees continually.  It is not that we do not trust the Minister, but he is subject to the authority of the Minister for Finance and the Department of Finance.  When Estimates are being drawn up there will be demands on him to provide for increases.</P>
    <P>It is important that the backlog of work should be cleared as soon as possible. The Minister should attempt to get an exemption from the embargo in this case. The fee is being charged to cover costs in any event.  Many people have already applied and if three or four people working in that section decided to leave and work elsewhere the job would not be done.  A special effort should be made to clear up the matter.  We are opposed to the general principle of moving away from a nominal charge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to section 3 which provides for an increase in fees. I am also opposed to the Minister seeking power to increase fees by order.  He made great play of the fact that we are dealing with people who own their own houses. <Col N="752" /> The vast majority of people are paying mortgages and many thousands of them are put to the pin of the collar to meet their repayments.  Many of them are unemployed and have had to make arrangements with the building societies to defer payments.  Certain people have mortgages due to arrangements made some years ago where they were pushed into that situation, although they would normally have qualified for local authority housing.  They are now in a position where they are simply unable to meet their mortgage repayments.  It is the building societies who own most of the houses in this country, not the people who live in them.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about the value of these houses being not less than £30,000. My information is that there are very few three-bedroomed, semi-detached houses in the Dublin area fetching anything like that price at present.  It may have been the case two years ago but that kind of money is not now available.</P>
      <P>The Minister also said that the abolition of ground rents would involve compensation of between £40 million and £70 million.  A &ldquo;guesstimate&rdquo; of the number of people involved is 250,000.  Many ground rents range between £3 and £7 per annum and some of the later ones are about £20, but the average is about £15 per annum.  Even if the compensation were to be the full amount provided under the 1967 Act which is related to the return on the latest Government stocks, my calculation is that the total compensation involved would be in the region of £10 million.  Even if we were to double that figure to allow for errors on the basis that we are dealing with estimated figures we are still a long way from the frightening figure the Minister mentions. He is ignoring the fact that if these cases were to go to arbitration it would be the landlords who would be liable for the compensation, not the tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in charges is a breach of faith with the Association of Combined Residents' Associations who were clearly given to understand in 1978 when the scheme was introduced that the fees would be maintained at a nominal level and that there would be no question of <Col N="753" /> the fees being raised to cover costs.  While ACRA had their reservations about the scheme they accepted it on that basis.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the Minister's argument that the fee must be related to the value of the house.  It must be related to the ground rent being demanded.  The scheme for purchasing is in effect a device to give the landlord a capital sum which, if invested in Government stock, would give him a return equal to the ground rent which he is losing.  It is a scheme to give him a capital sum which will pay him the ground rent in perpetuity.  That is the basis on which we should approach this matter, not the value of the house.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that, even as the law stands, a landlord is entitled when a lease expires to retrieve not only the land but the house and everything else standing on the land, despite the fact that he does not own the house and that the person living in it has paid for it.  That is the kind of principle which people oppose.  They are not concerned about the payment of £10 or £15 per year; they are concerned about the principle that the landlord has superior powers.  We are not talking about elderly widows collecting ground rents.  We are talking about very big land owners who are collecting millions every year in ground rent.  There is a very substantial lobby opposed to the abolition of ground rents.  That is why we get these types of Bills here endeavouring <Col N="754" /> to deal with the edges of the problem instead of homing in and getting rid of ground rents altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, before section 4, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash; The Minister for the Environment may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, by order fix a termination for ground rents on dwelling houses, where these come under his control or under the control of the local authorities (Housing Authorities)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are proposing that the Minister raises the question that there are constitutional difficulties in abolishing the remaining ground rents.  We accept that there are constitutional difficulties and that these will not be met in any global Bill to deal with the remaining ground rents. <Col N="757" /> However, we contend that these ground rents are under the control of the Minister in so far as the Minister for the Environment is responsible for them and in so far as the Government and the State are directly responsible for them.  We believe that here the State should give a lead and set a termination date for ground rents in these cases.  Consequently, we call on the Members of the House to support this amendment.  We ask the Labour Party in particular to support it since they themselves are so committed to the abolition of ground rents and have stated so repeatedly, as has been said here in the House. We feel that this is a fairly small step for the Labour Party to take if they are to encourage their Coalition partners to do something even as small as this which would affect those houses the grounds rents of which are held by the local authorities or housing authorities.  That is the case in regard to a private house built on local authority ground and a house which was originally a rental house and has been purchased by the individual under the transfer order.  It is time to bring these ground rents to an end and we would like to see the Minister for the Environment being enabled to do this, and that is the purpose of the amendment which we are proposing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The section deals with the question of giving power to the Minister himself and to the Minister for the Environment to set fees where the ground rents refer to local authority dwellings or dwellings which come under the control of the local authority or have been under the control of the local authority.  We oppose this section on the <Col N="758" /> grounds that, as I said earlier in relation to the increase in the fees, the clear intention of the original Bill was to have nominal fees set and there was never any indication in the original Bill that it was intended to increase the fees.  Here we have assessed the situation where the Minister has in two years in a row increased the fees.  He has extended the operation of the scheme for a further three years and is looking for the power to increase the fees by order.  There is nothing to stop the Minister from increasing the fees every month for the next three years or every six months for the next three years.  Clearly, pressure will be on the Minister, particularly from the Minister for Finance, to raise what money he can through this scheme.  For that reason I oppose it.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy Woods' amendment which is seeking to introduce the termination date on ground rents of houses under the control of the Minister for the Environment.  The only quibble I have with it is that it does not go far enough and that by far the greatest number of dwellings are held under lease from private landlords and not from local authorities. The ground rents collected by local authorities are very nominal and are not a big problem.  Generally people have not the same opposition in principle to ground rents held by local authorities because they see them as being held by the state rather than by private landlords who are making money from them for their own private gain.  I support the amendment introduced by Deputy Woods and I oppose section 4 in general.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Section 4 replaces section 26(8) of the 1978 (No. 2) Act which concerns purchases by ground rent tenants of housing authorities and provides for an increase to £20 from £5 in the fee to be taken by a housing authority.  Section 4(2) enables any further changes in the fee payable by a purchaser from a housing authority to be <Col N="759" /> effected by way of fees order to be made by the Minister for the Environment rather than the Minister for Justice with the consent of the Minister for Finance. Therefore, section 4(2) is giving the power to the Minister for the Environment to arrange the fees rather than the Minister for Justice.  Of course, section 4(2) allows the Minister for the Environment to vary the fee up or down as he sees fit.  It does not tie him to increasing the fee; he can also reduce the fee if circumstances change and he thinks it is the appropriate thing to do.</P>
      <P>The point here is the same as previously. When tenants of local authority housing authorities are involved here there is an administrative cost and if the administrative cost is not paid by the person who is benefiting it is going to be paid by the taxpayer.  It is very easy to propose schemes with no fees or nominal fees, but the bottom line in no fees and nominal fees is that somebody takes up the burden, and it is the taxpayer who takes up the burden.  I am one of the Deputies in this House who believes that the taxpayer is overtaxed already and that there is not room for extra taxation. An increase here to £20 is not a very major increase in actual terms even though it is a big increase in percentage terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa has made the point on a number of occasions that we are departing from the spirit of the 1978 Act. Of course we are departing from the spirit of the 1978 Act because the 1978 Act would have terminated last year if we had not brought in a new Bill.  The idea of a nominal fee was tied into the idea of a restricted five-year period and if a person did not avail of the nominal fee during that five-year period all brakes were off and the person would have to go to a solicitor.  Instead of that we are still providing <Col N="760" /> the facility of the scheme now for another three years except that the administrative cost will have to be borne by the applicant.</P>

      <P>The final point made by the Minister raises the whole question of the acceptability of assurances given by Ministers in relation to legislation brought into this House.  A clear commitment was given to the Association of Combined Residents Associations, ACRA, that there would be a nominal fee and that the legislation would exist for five years and would be extended therefrom if a need was seen to extend it.  It was clear from the number of people who did not avail of the procedures laid down under the Act until the very last minute &mdash; indeed, more than a quarter of a million householders still have not availed of the provisions of the Act &mdash; that the Bill did not have the desired effect and that there was a need to extend it on those grounds.  Either commitments given by Ministers in relation to what they propose to do with legislation are to be stood over and accepted or we simply ignore commitments made by various Ministers at various times.  That is what it boils down to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. O'Toole) Paddy O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. O'Toole)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department were consulted in January 1977 regarding an application by Galway Corporation for a foreshore licence in respect of a proposed sea outfall at Mutton Island for the Galway main drainage scheme.  This proposal incorporated a contingency plan for the erection of an effluent treatment plant at Mutton Island if adverse effects were indicated as a result of the proposed discharge.</P>
      <P>As the proposals constituted no apparent threat to fisheries interests, my Department indicated that we had no objections from the fisheries viewpoint to the issue of a licence, though on the condition that the corporation undertake a programme, to be discussed and agreed with the Department, to monitor at regular intervals water quality in Galway Bay.  The purpose of this condition was to ensure that any adverse effects arising would be quickly detected, and I understand that it was incorporated in the foreshore licence subsequently issued to the corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been significant advances in recent years in scientific knowledge regarding the effects and consequences of sewage contamination of shellfish.  In the light of information currently availmentarie <Col N="767" /> able, my Department recently initiated a re-examination of the position regarding the proposed discharge at Mutton Island, and I will let the Deputy know of the outcome of these considerations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to the Minister for the full and frank answer he has given which will help to alleviate much of the concern in the Galway area. It is clear now that the Department are taking some action in this matter.  It was felt that the previous permission they granted was allowing the corporation to proceed with the discharge of this effluent without treatment.  Can I take it that the Minister supports the need for treatment of the effluent prior to discharge into Galway Bay as was originally proposed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out to the Deputy and the House that it is an offence under sections 171 and 172 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1979, to discharge deleterious matter into water. There is a statutory obligation on me to ensure that this does not take place. Where I have a suspicion or where there is any chance of that taking place, I have a statutory obligation to act.  The Deputy can be assured that, until we are satisfied with the discharge proposals including, if necessary, the provision of a full or adequate treatment plant, we will not allow a discharge which could be harmful or damaging to the fish stocks in the area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no evidence that the discharge of sewage from the Knocknacarra scheme presents any threat to the quality of shellfish on commercial beds in Galway Bay, the nearest of which is some distance from the outfall point.  Accordingly, I have no reason to object to the discharge.  My Department will, however, keep the situation under review. What I said previously will apply here also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to hear that.  Is the Minister aware that many lobster pots are laid in the area adjacent to the discharge point and I am surprised to hear that his Department do not think it interferes with shell fishing.  Will he <Col N="769" /> review the matter because all the Barna fishermen fish for lobsters along that coast?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Lobster pots are of a mobile nature in that they are put in a certain place and taken away.  If they are set close to an outfall point I agree damage may be caused to them but it is the fishermen who come near the discharge point and not the other way around.  It is not the same as having a permanent structure for mariculture purposes in place and having a discharge point put beside it.  Lobster fishing takes place on a mobile basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>

They do not consult the Departments until the design work has been completed and much money spent, as happened in the case of Oranmore.</P>

      <P>The quotas agreed for 1984 at the Council of EEC Fisheries Ministers held on 31 January 1984 are now legally binding under Community law.  As the Deputy is aware, there is now a historical base for the setting of such quotas, that is, the agreement of 25 January, 1983.  If the Irish allocation for a particular stock has been taken, further fishing on that stock by Irish vessels will be illegal for the remainder of this year. I do not, however, envisage this arising in many cases because of the satisfactory level of quotas negotiated.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may have in mind a restrictive licensing system on the lines of that recently introduced by the British Government but I have no proposals to introduce such a scheme here at present. However, licences will be required by Irish vessels, as in the past, to fish for western stock mackerel and Celtic Sea herring in order to ensure a fair distribution of catches and to avoid market disruption.</P>

      <P>In relation to the mackerel quota, there was an increase from 80,000 tonnes to 85,300 tonnes for this year.  In relation to Celtic Sea herring, an increase was negotiated there and that was on account because the final ICES figures were not available when the quotas were set.  Those figures became available at the beginning of May.  A subsequent Council meeting in Brussels decided there was a sufficient quantity left in the quotas to allow us to fish.  They may be looked at again in September or October when, based on increased figures, stocks will be further increased.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider introducing legislation which would require the fishery board to issue a set number of licences, the number to be determined annually by the Minister, rather than leaving discretion to the boards who, in the main, are comprised of people who would be opposed to sea drift netting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am totally opposed to that suggestion &mdash; and I hope the Deputy agrees with me &mdash; because of the fluctuating nature of salmon stocks which differs from year to year.  While a board may see fit to issue X number of licences this year, they may see fit to issue X minus ten or X plus ten as the case may be next year.  Therefore, it would be wrong to restrict boards to a set number of licences because of the fluctuating nature of salmon stocks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister could exercise that function in determining whether there should be a fluctuation in the number of licences issued?  I am sure the Minister is aware that the majority of the members on fishing boards are mainly opposed to drift netting for salmon in the sea and the representation for salmon drift net fishermen on the boards is a very small percentage of the overall membership on those boards.</P>

At present much progress has been made on development, not to my full satisfaction or to anybody's full satisfaction, but within the resources available to them both in finance and manpower they are doing a first-class job.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry the changes he has made to the fishing regulations for the 1984 salmon season; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the following changes in the fishing regulations for the 1984 salmon season: (1) in the southern fisheries region the commercial salmon fishing season is being extended by one week so that the close season will commence on 8 August, and the draft and snap net season by a further five days so that the close season for these engines will commence on 13 August; (2) the draft, loop and snap net fishing season is being extended by one week after the close of the drift net season in all areas, i.e. the close season for these engines will commence on 1 August, except on the east coast and in the southern fisheries region where the close season will commence on 13 August; (3) the by-law banning the use of monofilament netting for salmon fishing is being retained but is being amended so as to ensure that fishermen engaged legitimately in fishing for species other than salmon are not liable to conviction; (4) the angling season on the River Fane is being extended to 13 October; (5) the angling season on the River Owenea has been extended by two weeks, i.e. the annual close season on this river now ends on 14 March.</P>
      <P>These measures were taken following detailed consultation with the various salmon fishing interests concerned and their effects will be kept under review by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Minister's objective <Col N="780" /> in introducing these changes?  Is it his objective to conserve stocks or have them more fully exploited?  There seems to be a contradiction in some of the decisions made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for the changes in dates is to try to distribute the stock more equitably.  Drift nets take 83 per cent of the total catch as against 11 per cent by draft nets while other commercial fishing engines take 3 per cent. Anglers in total take 3 per cent.  From those figures one can see that there is an imbalance.  The changes are being made in the dates in an effort to redress that imbalance.  The second change is being made in order to eliminate an anomaly because of the increasing use of monofilament for the fishing of species other than salmon.  Heretofore persons found with monofilament net on board their boat were breaking the law in spite of the fact that they may not have had the net for the purpose of fishing for salmon; they may have had it for the purpose of fishing hake or other species.  It is in order to regularise the position and eliminate the anomaly that existed that an amendment to the by-law is being introduced.</P>

      <P>When is it hoped to make the order in relation to the use of monofilament net for species other than salmon?  Will the Minister accept that many of the boats that traditionally fish for salmon have changed to dog fish now, an activity which is reasonably remunerative? Those fishermen are having great difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am continuing to work closely with my colleague, the Minister <Col N="781" /> for Foreign Affairs, who is handling the Irish input to these negotiations to ensure that the position adopted by the Community in the negotiations is satisfactory from our point of view and protects Irish interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Negotiations in relation to the accession of Spain and Portugal by their nature have to be confidential.  The Deputy can take it that the preservation of our position <i>vis-à-vis the</i> Community, and in particular the enlarged Community when it comes about, will be protected. I should like to tell the Deputy that already we have publicly made our position clear in regard to Portugal.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Barry, made it clear about six weeks ago at a meeting in Brussels.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that up to 100 Spanish fishing vessels are fishing illegally inside the Irish 200-mile limit for prawns on the Porcupine Bank?  Will he take that into consideration when the enlargement of the Community is being negotiated to protect the interests of Irish fishermen?  What steps is the Minister taking to ensure that this illegal fishing stops?  It is well known that the Spanish are offering a decoy in that when Irish naval vessels appear in the area one or two Spanish vessels are arrested and the other 90 can carry on fishing illegally. They are making life very dangerous for our fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The Naval Service are aware of the decoys and ploys being adopted by some of the boats when carrying on illegal fishing.  As the House is aware a number of boats operate under licence west of Ireland but I am convinced that there are a number of boats illegally fishing there.  We have quite a good record in apprehending those boats and I should like to express my thanks to <Col N="782" /> the Naval Service who work under fairly severe conditions, on their track record which is a very good track record.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The time has come to introduce some type of positive licensing system under which each nation will be allowed a certain number of boats inside the limits.  Will the Minister accept that in the event of any boat which holds a licence breaking the regulations they should not be allowed to fish in those areas in the future?  This is the system operated in Iceland.  Some positive decision of this kind must be taken in order to conserve our stocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a licensing system in operation in respect of Spanish boats west of this country.  Boats normally apprehended for illegal fishing are non-licence holders.  All these matters will be considered in detail in the context of the Spanish accession.  It may well be that this kind of approach would be best but I am not prepared to say at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister make available information on the Spanish vessels licensed to fish prawn in the Porcupine?

      <P>I can readily appreciate the secrecy of the negotiations and the Minister's difficulty.  Nevertheless, there is well-informed speculation that we are doing pretty badly.  People in the industry seem to be aware of the way the negotiations are progressing and they are totally dissatisfied with the way in which the issues have been faced up to at Community level.  They feel that things are not going favourably for us.  Once the negotiations are concluded very little can be done and we want to impress upon the Minister the seriousness of the situation and the danger to the Irish fishing industry if there is a widespread invasion of our traditional fishing grounds by Spanish <Col N="784" /> boats when Spain joins the Community. What attitude is the Minister adopting to ensure that this will not happen?</P>

As the Deputy is no doubt aware, a major contract for infrastructural work at the harbour comprising mainly dredging, land reclamation, pier and breakwater construction, is at present in progress and is due to be completed this year.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Exported Live Stock (Insurance) Board was set up under statute in 1940 at the request of the Irish livestock trade. The Bill now before the House arises from a request from the trade and from the board themselves to wind-up the board because of the decline in live cattle exports to Britain.  The basic legislation contained no provisions whereby the board might be dissolved and winding-up, therefore, requires enabling legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Exported Live Stock (Insurance) Acts, 1940 to 1950, exporters of cattle, sheep and pigs are required to pay into an insurance fund a levy in respect of each animal exported direct, or via Northern Ireland, to Britain.  The fund is administered by the Exported Live Stock <Col N="837" /> (Insurance) Board, a statutory body set up under the Acts and appointed by the National Executive of Irish Live Stock Trade.  Payment of the levy entitles the exporter to compensation for damage to, or loss of, animals from the time of shipment, or from the time of entering Northern Ireland, until up to 84 hours after release from the landing place in Britain.  These statutory insurance arrangements were set up at a time when livestock exports were almost exclusively to Britain and they were designed to be entirely self-financing.</P>
    <P>In the past ten or 15 years there has been a sharp reduction in live cattle exports to Britain and in recent years disbursements &mdash; mainly administrative expenses &mdash; from the fund have exceeded receipts from the levy.  In the forties exports of live cattle to Britain and Northern Ireland were running at 430,000 head per annum.  In the late fifties they exceeded 700,000 head but by 1983 they had fallen below 24,000 head. Exports of live sheep and pigs to Britain over the years have not been significant.</P>
    <P>The balance in the fund is presently less than £10,000 and consequently the board are operating under the threat of possible insolvency.  The National Executive of Irish Live Stock Trade and the board have indicated that the possibility of regaining a situation of financial viability either by extending the compulsory insurance arrangements to cover exports to all destinations or by increasing the rates of insurance levy would not be acceptable to the live stock trade generally.</P>
    <P>The current non-UK trade, which is mainly to North Africa, involves a much greater insurance risk and would call for very high premiums.  The exporters involved in that trade prefer to make their own insurance arrangements, as would exporters to Britain if faced with substantially increased rates of levy.  The National Executive and the board, therefore, see no option other than to wind up the activities of the board.  Exporters of livestock to Britain will then have to make their own insurance arrangements in the same way as shippers of live stock <Col N="838" /> to other destinations do at present.  In view of the precarious state of its fund, the board have taken steps to have the risk of possible claims arising during the winding-up process underwritten by a commercial insurance company.</P>
    <P>In addition to the fund balance of under £10,000 the only capital asset which the board own is an office at North Circular Road, Dublin, which was acquired in 1972.  The Bill proposes that the disposal of these premises should be subject to my approval.</P>
    <P>The board currently employ two officers who have service of 41 years each. Two other officers who had service of 39 years and 32 years were made redundant in March.  The board have been contributing to a pension scheme with a pensions firm on behalf of the staff and the determination of final pension and other arrangements for the staff on the termination of their employment is a matter for agreement between them and the board management within the resources of the board.  However, there is a provision in the Bill whereby the Minister for the Public Service will be the final arbitrator in the event of any dispute on pension or other terms between staff and management.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Bill contains a provision whereby the disposal of any residue after all claims and liabilities have been discharged will be subject to my approval.</P>
    <P>Because of the precarious financial state of the board it is important that the possibility of claims should cease as soon as possible.  Therefore, I thank the House for agreeing to deal with this matter quickly so that the winding-up process can be concluded as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> We agree with the Minister that the winding up of this board should be proceeded with as quickly as possible and consequently we are prepared to give the Bill a speedy passage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister rightly pointed out the purpose of the board was to provide insurance for the export of live cattle to the UK.  It did not apply to the export of cattle to any other country.  It is sad that <Col N="839" /> the decline in cattle exports to the UK is continuing, and that has been the situation since the board was set up.  The Government must devise ways and means of ensuring that that situation is reversed.  The request for the winding up of the board has come from the livestock exporters.  I shall deal in more detail with the Bill on Committee Stage and I will be asking the Minister to let us know what proposals he has in mind to ensure a sufficient number of cattle for export both for the live cattle trade and for the dead meat trade which is an important element also.  We hope the Government have some programme for the further expansion of cattle numbers especially since beef production is one of the most important enterprises in our economy. Despite that, however, it is also the least developed and perhaps the most under-capitalised sector.  Down through the years cattle production has been on an extensive rather than an intensive scale. Profits fluctuated and at times were quite low.</P>
    <P>Down through the years also the cattle trade has been characterised by different stages of production such as calf rearing while summer stores, grazing and beef production were distinct and were not integrated in any way.  This led to a major difficulty because in some instances good profit margins in one sector were at the expense of another.  The recent trend of encouraging calf-to-beef production is very sensible and should lead to much greater stability in the trade.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the calf subsidy will help in a major way towards this trend.  It is important to realise the crucial role of the cattle industry in our economy.  In 1983, for instance, cattle output was valued at approximately £700 million.  I consider it to be feasible to increase our exports of cattle by at least 20 per cent in volume alone within a relatively short time.  This would result in increased earnings of perhaps more than £130 million having regard to the comparatively low levels of imports in respect of agricultural production compared with the imports for industry.  This increase would be equivalent to about £400 million <Col N="840" /> in terms of industrial exports.  Such increased outputs is well within our capabilities. It is a guaranteed market.  The main problem is one of increasing the cattle herd numbers.  Apart from providing extra employment such expansion would have tremendous benefits for the community.  The effects on the balance of payments would be dramatic.  Like many other industries, the means and technology to secure this expansion is readily available.  We must motivate farmers, ACOT and other agencies to pursue as vigorously as possible a programme which would increase cattle numbers.  It is important to have a plan of development.</P>
    <P>Our beef cow numbers, which are very responsive to the prevailing economic climate, have fallen dramatically over the last number of years.  That decline is continuing. It is incumbent on the Government to provide guaranteed support for at least five years in the form of grants and capital at reasonable interest rates. In no other area would the return to the economy be greater.  Interest rates are very high at the moment and the provision of such capital at subsidised rates is necessary.  With the recent decline in farm incomes it would be unrealistic to expect farmers to expand their beef herds.  If we had a greater number&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> It is important that we embark on a campaign of increasing cattle numbers.  In the late fifties we exported of the order of 700,000 <Col N="841" /> head of cattle to the UK.  We will not reach that figure again.  The fact that our exports fell below 24,000 head in 1983 is something we should be concerned about.  I know that the export of cattle to countries other than the UK is somewhat responsible for the low numbers exported to the UK.  This situation has been allowed to continue for too long and not sufficient attention was paid to increasing the cattle herds.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would consider encouraging the formation of producer groups and provide positive incentives.  I understand these groups can be assisted through the EEC.  I ask the Minister to look at this.  Such groups are successful in other EEC countries.  Community aid is available for their formation.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a very narrow one.  It does not give scope for expanding on the cattle industry.  It is simply to wind up the livestock insurance board.  It is sad that the occasion has to arise where we have to wind up the board because of a decline in the export of cattle to the UK.  I know exporters are prepared to take the risk on their own insurance as they do when exporting to other countries.  We support this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse some of the remarks made by the previous speaker. It is sad that we have now reached the position with our nearest trading neighbour that we only export 24,000 head of cattle to them.  In the late fifties we exported 700,000 head or more.  British policy was to buy beef as cheaply as possible. They bought beef from us and we were condemned, so to speak, to accept low prices for our beef.  We are now free from that since we have expanded our markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is basically about the winding up of the Livestock Insurance Board. There is no need for it any longer.  In the main, livestock exporters provide their own insurance today.  It is probably the cheapest way to do it.  Producers and exporters want it that way.  For that reason, there would appear to be agreement in the House about the quick passage of the Bill.  The direction of live <Col N="842" /> cattle exports is of considerable significance.</P>
    <P>I hope that we would not forget that the UK was once a very important market for us and we should strive, as the previous speaker said, to encourage further development of that market.  The beef industry generally is of great importance and significance to our economy and without a thriving and expanding cow herd number there will not be the requisite number of beef cattle for either export or processing.</P>
    <P>There has been much conflicting opinion over the last number of years, particularly because of the job creation potential on the processing side.  Nonetheless, there must be a balance between exporting live cattle and processing, as otherwise the producer would suffer in the longer term.  That has been the experience, particularly since coming into the Common Market.  Perhaps our entry in 1973 had something to do with our present situation, as Britain was no longer able to get beef at the customary low price &mdash; although that is a good thing as far as the Irish beef industry is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Bill is designed to wind up the board and take account of any liabilities that might accrue in relation to the protecting of staff and so on, but that is clearly catered for in the Bill.  In relation to the situation which has developed over the last four or five years, and perhaps even going back into the late seventies when there was a great investment and build up of confidence not only in the milk but in the beef area, we have now got what most Irish farmers would regard as a considerably good deal in the beef area and have secured what they would regard as a very good deal with regard to the super-levy.  Perhaps we may reach a stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This is important in relation to the possibility of levies on the export of beef or of live cattle, and we <Col N="843" /> must take note of that.  There is an oversupply of beef in the developed world, even though we know that there is a market provided one goes after it.  This is all about marketing and we should be grateful, even if there is a change in the direction of our live export trade.  If that trade were not there and if the markets with North Africa, were not there, many farmers would find their incomes much less than they are.  The export refund makes it profitable for them.</P>
      <P>I draw the Minister's attention to a problem which is particularly prevalent in my own county, the number of locked up herds.</P>

I am suggesting ways and means of increasing that supply and there are incentives which the Minister must take account of in this area of agriculture.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly, this Bill is a non-contentious one and we are winding up the Export of Livestock Insurance <Col N="846" /> Board because of the decline in live cattle exports to Britain.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Dowling concerning the importance of the live export trade.  It is one which affects small producers and in particular, small producers in the west of Ireland.  As Deputy Dowling said, we hear much debate and argument about live export as against processing in this country.  A balance must be struck.  I am sure that the House will agree with that.  I shall not go into the arguments for and against but am concerned that the Minister states that we have seen a big drop in exports to Great Britain and Northern Ireland from 430,000 head around the forties to 24,000 head in 1983.  My information is, in fact, that in the first six months of 1984 the trade in live exports to Britain has fallen even further compared with last year. Obviously, in a situation like that we all agree to the winding up of the board.  For that reason, this Bill is not contentious.</P>
      <P>I would add to what our spokesman, Deputy Noonan, said, that we should be concerned about increasing our cattle numbers and about our live export trade. Even yesterday I heard the CEO of the Meat Exporters Association mentioning their concern about that trade.  Mention was also made of the price of meat in the shops to the consumer.  These are all important matters when we are talking about the beef industry.</P>
      <P>I commend the board for the work done down through the years.  Before 1940 when the board was set up livestock had to be insured through Lloyds of London. It was a good idea to set up the board because it enabled exporters to lower their costs when sending livestock to Britain.  When the Act was passed in 1940 exporters could insure their cattle with the one board which obviated their going outside the country to insure.  Britain has now become more self-sufficient in livestock and I would like the Minister to comment on the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to raise the situation of the members of the board and the people who are now employed.  They will obviously not be going back to work in the public service.  Taking their ages into consideration I would like the Minister <Col N="847" /> to tell us if there is any question of compensation being paid to these four people.  I take it their pensions will not become operative until they reach the age of 65.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us what will happen to these people. There is also the question of the building in the North Circular Road which will be disposed of.  If that building is disposed of there will be a capital sum available to the Minister.  Some of the people employed by the board have seen service of up to 40 years.  There are others with 39 and 32 years service respectively.  I trust all these will be treated fairly and generously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Many issues arise when one examines the question of cattle production and cattle exports generally. One point made by the Minister was that the trade mainly to North Africa involves a greater insurance risk and calls for higher premiums.  Even if that is so those exporters are well able to look after themselves.  For too long we seemed to be trying to put our shoulder under every wheel until eventually we have not enough shoulder for all the wheels that exist.  It is a great change to see exporters looking after themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a £760,000 industry in 1983 in the context of overall foreign trade. While the value content is increasing we are not able to increase our cattle numbers to the extent to which they should be increased.  At one time it was claimed cattle numbers would increase to nine million by 1980 and ten million would be the figure based on the quality of our soil and based on what we are capable of doing.  In fact we are just holding the line. That is one of the most dissatisfying features of the industry.  Exports to Britain numbered 24,000 cattle.  In 1983 we had a total export figure of 360,000.  There had been more processing.  That was the figure in 1982.  In that year 59 per cent of sales went to the meat plants and of that 59 per cent 22 per cent went to Britain. There are some who talk about our losing the British market.  The fact is we had a bigger export of dead meat to the British market than we had to the EEC and other <Col N="848" /> countries.  Admittedly only 3 per cent of live exports went to Britain but we made up for that in other areas.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to increasing the numbers of live cattle.</P>

      <P>There have been tremendous strides in technology and new techniques and the Minister now has before him a complete new field from the point of view of the breeding and development of cattle.  We will be looking to this area of cattle production because of the problems we have in other areas of production, notably milk.</P>
      <P>Some time ago I was concerned when the EEC Commissioner for Agriculture referred to the need to control beef production and he referred to the action proposed to be taken.  He gave the impression that there could be a problem in beef production in the years to come.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputies who took part in the debate.  It is a quite restricted Bill.  It is enabling legislation.  Everyone is relieved &mdash; and probably the National Executive of the Livestock Board more than anybody else; it was at their request that this legislation was introduced &mdash; that the Bill is now about to be passed. Unlike some speakers, I am not sad because this body is being wound up.  I do not think we should worry too much about the end of the livestock trade with Britain, for a number of reasons.  One reason is that the livestock which were <Col N="849" /> being exported were store cattle, not finished cattle.  Any cattle we export nowadays are finished cattle.</P>
      <P>I should also like to point out that their numbers are greatly diminished.  In the late fifties, we were exporting over 700,000 head of store cattle to Britain. Today we are exporting 20,000 to 24,000 head.  Admittedly we are exporting 200,000 head of cattle to North Africa, and principally to Egypt and Libya.  It is a greatly diminished number from 700,000 to 200,000.  The cattle which are being exported nowadays are finished cattle.</P>
      <P>I want to make a point which has not come across during the debate.  The bulk of the beef exported from here at present is in a processed or semi-processed form. In 1950 the value of processed beef leaving here was less than £1 million.  In 1980 the value of processed beef leaving the country was £466 million which constitutes the majority of all beef exported whether dead or alive.  That is a tremendous turnabout in the cattle trade and a most welcome development.  That point was not alluded to in the debate and it is a matter of paramount importance to the cattle trade.  Nowadays cattle are being slaughtered at home and thousands of jobs are being created at home.  By further processing of that slaughtered beef we can provide more and more jobs.  That is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>In recent years with the help of the national meat board, CBF, we have been involved in further processing and in the production and exporting of vac-packed meat.  It is to be found all over Britain and continental Europe.  This development is very welcome indeed.  I have some reservations about certain developments which are taking place.  I notice that in Western Germany Irish beef is the best on offer.  It is marketed as the best quality beef on offer.  It is sold as Irish beef.  It is up in front in the major supermarket chains.  It fetches the highest price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a little disturbing that our beef is marketed in Britain and France without being labelled as Irish.  There are certain problems with the French farming unions and they do not like to have competition <Col N="850" /> from Irish beef.  They would rather not have it labelled as Irish beef.  Because of certain political events in recent years, the retail outlets in Britain decided it would be wiser not to label the beef as Irish.  That is unfortunate, but it is a fact of life.  I was looking at the same supermarkets in France and Britain quite recently and this is a marketing strategy.</P>
    <P>The important thing is that we are not exporting the same volume of beef on the hoof, and we are not exporting store cattle to Britain as was the case in years gone by.  Last year we exported 200,000 head of cattle live.  We exported 231,000 tonnes of beef.  I am told the conversion rate is that one tonne of beef equates to 3.1 animals.  Do not ask me how the .1 comes into it.  It is an approximation.  So, the 231,000 tonnes of beef would equate to about 700,000 head of cattle.  Whereas 25 years ago we were exporting 700,000 head of store cattle on the hoof, today we are exporting the equivalent of 700,000 finished cattle in the form of processed beef.</P>
    <P>We are exporting a further 200,000 finished cattle to North African countries because that is the way they like it.  They like a mix of beef slaughtered and live. That is a very vibrant trade.  It has done wonders for the beef trade generally. While people say we should abolish the live trade altogether, we all know that the competition between the live exporters and factories makes for very good prices for Irish farmers.  While the number of live cattle being exported will decrease until it eventually becomes zero, we have to leave that to take its natural course.  That is as it should be.</P>
    <P>The figures which the Central Statistics Office produced &mdash; I am not referring to the more infamous figures which were produced a month or so ago &mdash; for live cattle differ somewhat from the figures I have from my veterinary people but they indicate that some cattle instead of going directly to Britain are going to Northern Ireland and then to Britain.  Members of the House will be pleased to know that whereas last year we exported 176,000 head of cattle to Northern Ireland the figures for the first half of this year indicate that the numbers are down to something <Col N="851" /> like 27,000 head of cattle.  That is directly related to the modification of the variable premium subsidy which the British producers were getting.</P>
    <P>It has eliminated the inequity which existed between processors of beef in Northern Ireland and in the South.  That massive flow of cattle over the Border into the northern meat factories is virtually coming to a halt.  Everyone will welcome that move.  It means more business for the meat factories in the South. Actually that gives a distorted figure of the live cattle exports.  Those cattle are staying in the 26 Counties at present and are providing considerably more employment in the meat factories.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that there are not sufficient cattle in the country.  I would not blame that on the decline in the British cattle trade, because this was a type of trade which we are glad to see disappearing as they were store cattle.  A day may come when we will be glad to get back a live trade with Britain.  We will have to wait and see if that occurs.  The dying out of that trade has not caused any problems for the cattle business here. Actually it is welcome for the reasons I have outlined.  A day may come when we will be glad to get it back, but hopefully it will be finished cattle and not store cattle.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest drawbacks to agriculture is that despite all the incentives we have not been able to increase our cattle numbers sufficiently.  That did not happen this year or last year but it goes back to the past 20 or 30 years.  If anyone can tell me of some way to increase the herd number dramatically I should be glad to hear their ideas.  There are enormous incentives for increasing our herd numbers but measures taken so far have not been effective.  I am open to ideas as to how the numbers could be increased.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Members of the House have welcomed the legislation and that they regard it as necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should state at the outset that, while the Bill is rather complex in its terms, its purpose is to close off a potentially serious loophole that has come to light in the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1965. That Act deals, <i>inter alia,</i> with the Minister's powers in regard to the regulation <Col N="854" /> of air fares and it is in respect of those powers that I am now proposing to clarify the situation.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the 1965 Act provides for the approval by the Minister for Communications of airline fares proposals for air services to, from and within the territory of the State.  A requirement to secure approval for international air fares is the accepted norm applied by aviation regulatory authorities worldwide, a requirement that is reflected in the various inter-governmental bilateral and multi-lateral agreements that govern the operation of international scheduled air services.  The various bilateral agreements and arrangements covering the exchange of traffic rights between Ireland and other countries generally include a provision relating to the approval of tariffs and it was in recognition of that situation that the 1965 Act embodied in Irish law provisions giving the Minister statutory powers to control air fares.</P>
    <P>Airlines accept the fact that scheduled service fares require Government approval and carriers serving Ireland submit their fares proposals for approval as a matter of course.  For practical reasons, control of air fares has been applied at the level of fares to be actually sold to the public and proposals are submitted to the Minister on this basis.</P>
    <P>Developments which occurred in the Irish market last summer affecting fares between this country and the United States, and which saw some fares being sold at below approved levels, threatened to undermine this control.  Steps taken by my Department at that time resolved the then prevailing difficulties.  More serious difficulties emerged early this year when a large Dublin travel agent widely advertised Shannon-New York services at fares which did not stand approved by me. Efforts to resolve the difficulties through consultations between my Department, the airline and the travel agent concerned failed and, since the stance taken by the other parties constituted an effective challenge to the generally accepted interpretation of the 1965 Act, I sought and obtained a temporary High Court injunction restraining the airline concerned from selling fares which did not have my <Col N="855" /> approval.  The injunction was to have effect until the substantive hearing of the case, but on appeal to the Supreme Court the injunction was lifted, the Court taking the view that, given the terms of the 1965 Act, the airline concerned had an arguable case and that what the court termed &ldquo;the balance of convenience&rdquo; rested in not continuing the injunction.  I should add that both the High Court and the Supreme Court refused to grant an injunction directly against the travel agent, the view being taken that the scope of the 1965 Act did not extend beyond airlines.</P>
    <P>While the court decisions to which I have referred do not reflect a definitive judgment on the legal issues involved &mdash; that would have to await the substantive hearing of the case &mdash; I have been considering the implications of the present situation.  A final determination of the legal action could take up to 12 months and the legal advice available to me suggests that in the meantime my powers to control air fares would be severely undermined. This could lead to considerable instability in the market place, with discounting and other malpractices emerging on a scale that would undermine approved tariff structures and could have serious financial implications for airlines generally and for Aer Lingus in particular. In the long term, such a situation would only serve to put at risk the range of air services which Ireland enjoys, a development which would not be welcomed by either business or tourism.</P>
    <P>Given the present situation, I am satisfied the best course of action is to proceed with the legislation now before the House.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not introducing any new principle.  Its objective is to remedy a defect in the 1965 Act and to close off a loophole which can be used to effectively render meaningless the control of air fares which I must exercise having regard to our bilateral commitments to other countries and in the general national interest.  As I have indicated already, Government control of air fares is the accepted norm and that applies even in the case of administrations who are to the <Col N="856" /> fore in advocating liberalisation.  I should add that the EEC Commission, which has recently put forward proposals aimed at developing a Community air transport policy, also accepts that fact.</P>
    <P>I should stress that the proposed Bill is a neutral measure, which is not biased in favour of either high or low air fares. Accordingly, it is inaccurate to describe the Bill as an anti-consumer measure. The prerogative to submit fares proposals at whatever levels they wish will continue to reside with the airlines and I will examine all proposals on their merits.  All I am seeking to do in the Bill is to ensure that once an airline has received approval for its air fares proposals it will stick to selling at those levels both directly and through intermediaries such as travel agents.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should say that, in the light of my decision to introduce this Bill, I have decided to terminate the court proceedings to which I have made reference.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>This side of the House, as always, has particular concern for the national airline, Aer Lingus-Aer Línte and will in future, as they have in the past, support and sustain it.  We gladly provided the company with equity in the past and also made provision for a cost alleviation, a substantial sum of money to aid Aer Lingus and the trans-Atlantic route.  We know what happened as a result of excessive competition on the North Atlantic route to the Laker venture which was much publicised in its flight and fall and we know too what happened to Braniff which also went down on that route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is as well to ponder on what happened, <Col N="857" /> which has been touched on in the Minister's speech, and what prompted introducing this Bill before the House.  I took the trouble to read through the debate on the Second Stage of the original Bill which is being amended and strengthened by the Bill before the House.  It is the 1965 Act.  It is interesting to note that the late Mr. Childers was Minister at the time and that those who contributed to the debate were, Mr. James Dillon, General Seán MacEoin and Mr. Robert Briscoe.  The latter Member had an interesting comment to make on the difficulty membership of IATA involved for companies such as Aer Lingus and their customers.  It is revealing that he stated that when he was negotiating at some stage with Aer Lingus he found that the company could not charge beyond a certain amount &mdash; he was talking about freight rather than passengers &mdash; because the IATA agreement would not allow them to do so.  He also made the point that in order to get something through IATA it was necessary to get unanimity and that this in itself was a weakening of the arrangement involved in being a member of that organisation. He advocated that a majority vote would be better for the airline.</P>
    <P>The High Court was specific when granting the temporary injunction.  Mr. Justice McMahon said it appeared clear that what had been taking place was a clear breach of the Act and conditions attaching to permission to operate.  That seemed to have settled the point until the matter was taken to the Supreme Court. As the Minister stated, the Supreme Court judges, in their wisdom, stated that Trans America and Club Travel had an arguable case and that the balance of convenience lay in not allowing a continuation of the injunction.  That forced the Minister to present this Bill to the House. As was noted by the Minister another way of dealing with the matter would have been to take the substantive case through the courts and get a decision on it.  Apparently, it was a matter of the consideration of the time it would take to do this that caused the rush to the Dáil with the Bill.  We are a little alarmed at the speed with which the Bill was brought <Col N="858" /> before the House and the attempt being made to push it through the House today. I am pleased that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has been informed that only Second Stage will be taken today.  The delay will give an opportunity to the Government and the Opposition to consider the implications of the measure in full.  That is the least that can be expected because there are many implications in the Bill.</P>
    <P>This side of the House will, as in the past, do everything possible to protect the national airlines and in all prudence will aid that company when we are convinced it is necessary.  However, it should not be thought that this will be done at all costs.  Taxpayers are coming to the conclusion that all companies operating in their name and with their help should be subjected to the closest scrutiny.  They have come to the conclusion that competition in their field should not be killed, particularly by legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister rightly pointed out that deregulation had taken placed in the United States.  Deregulation was introduced by President Carter and, undoubtedly, the result has been to bring down internal air fares.  However, as the Minister pointed out, regulation applies to international traffic but we should look at the advantages and disadvantages of deregulation in the United States.  There has been a definite advantage in that customers have to pay lower fares.  I made a check among people who use air travel frequently since the Bill was published and the general judgment was: &ldquo;to hell with regulations, we want to get the best possible deal and fares at the lowest rate possible&rdquo;.  That is an understandable approach.  There are disadvantages involved in deregulation, even for internal flights.  In the United States there have been complaints about low quality service and low quality planes being used. If red roaring competition is allowed, red roaring capitalism, red in tooth and claw, difficulties will arise.</P>
    <P>There is a climate of opinion coming from a particular political ideology, maybe from the Right, which says that there should not be any more State or semi-State companies, a privatisation of <Col N="859" /> everything with the maximum of competition from which the private citizen will benefit.  Such an attitude leads to the Laker and Braniff position.  The difficulty is that if a company feels it is being cosseted and can stick its hand into the public purse again the competitive edge is blunted.  We should take such considerations into account.  In the UK an attempt is being made to slough off most of the State companies in the transport area as much as any other area.  We are aware that Sealink and British Airways are scheduled for privatisation.  Going down that road all the way would not be to the advantage of Aer Lingus or the country.</P>
    <P>People are complaining that because of the arrangements on tariffs and fares we are losing out anyway.  It is true that people are using services from Northern Ireland to get to North America because, even taking the 20 per cent currency differential into account, it is cheaper to go from there.  One of the dangers is that if companies are allowed to operate in the peak season and undermine the operations of a national airline, then there is no substance to support the scheduled flights throughout the year.  I am thinking specifically of the North Atlantic run.  As a matter of balance we must take this into account.  The fares charged on European routes seem to be scandalously high and comparisons are being made with internal routes of a similar distance in the United States.  We were led to believe that the European Economic Community was a single economic unit and there were all kinds of aspirations that it would become more and more united.  It could be argued that by analogy flights within the EEC should at least compare in price with internal flights in the United States, taking into account fuel price differences and so on.  If we say in a &ldquo;barn door&rdquo; way that we will protect Aer Lingus even if it means bleeding the taxpayer, then we are not doing justice either to the taxpayer or to Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>The Minister states that it is inaccurate to describe the Bill as an anti-consumer measure.  He goes on to state:</P>
    <P>The prerogative to submit fares proposals <Col N="860" /> at whatever levels they wish will continue to reside with the airlines and I will examine all proposals on their merits.</P>
    <P>That sentence should be studied carefully. If a proposal came from the company named in the two cases in the High Court and the Supreme Court that the Minister should sanction fares at the existing level, would he sanction those fares?  That is the test of the value of that statement in his speech.</P>
    <P>This Bill has aroused a great deal of interest.  It was discussed today at the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party meeting and attracted so much interest that we could have spent practically the whole day debating it.  I am glad the Minister has decided that only Second Stage will be taken today.  This will give an opportunity to other speakers to give their views and as a result of the more widespread discussion we will have a better Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>In examining this Bill I was struck by the monopoly situation of the national airline.  I am concerned at the restrictions being imposed in this Bill at a time when the international trend of air fares is upwards.  Some airlines have gone out of business because of fare competition internationally and within the United States.  Those companies which have survived have devised a new structure whereby cost savings are passed on to consumers in the form of reductions in fares.  In this instance it would appear that there was competition between agents but the introduction of the regulations contained in the Bill seems to be an interference with the free market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency we have our only international airport.  Shannon is enjoying a good season so far.  The number of charter seats allocated at Shannon to other airlines has been increased by the Minister and this has led to an expansion of employment there and an increase in sales in the shops.  I am concerned because the Department of Transport seem to be introverted in drawing up these regulations rather than developing <Col N="861" /> a planned programme for 1985.  I appeal to them to liaise with other State agencies, which they have not done in the past.  There were problems where either SFADCo or Aer Rianta were canvassing for business in the United States only to find out that the Department of Transport had sent a telex stating that airline companies should not apply for additional charter seats because all the available seats had been taken up.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to see that all other competitor countries have the type of regulations we are proposing in the Bill.  We would seem to be giving away an opportunity.  When the airline companies operating in the UK, France and elsewhere have the same kind of protection for their national airlines as we are proposing here, then it will be time enough for this provision.</P>

      <P>I warmly welcome this Bill.  I am glad that in his introductory speech the Minister of State clearly gave the lie to those who have been debating this measure in public during the past few days and who say it is anti-consumer and anti-liberal.  He stated:</P>
      <P>Government control of air fares is the accepted norm and that applies even in the case of administrations who are to the fore in advocating liberalisation. I should add that the ECC Commission, which has recently put forward proposals aimed at developing a community air transport policy, also accepts the fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had over the last couple of days a repetition of a debate which took place here 20 years ago when the talk was: if only Pan-Am or TWA could get landing rights at Dublin instead of going straight into Shannon it would liberalise air transport into this country and the consumer and country would benefit from the additional tourists carried here, that Dublin and Ireland generally would be highlighted in the advertising and promotional campaigns of both airlines.  We saw what happened when they did gain landing rights at Dublin.  They stayed a while and then collapsed.  Why did they collapse?  Because at that time they <Col N="862" /> wanted the cream of the business only in the summer season and were not prepared to accept what Aer Lingus had had to accept, that is, 52 weeks of travelling across the Atlantic, carrying people to this country throughout the range of their scheduled services at times when it is not an economic proposition as well as the cream, the summer season, the period around Christmas and St.  Patrick's Day.</P>
    <P>As an island nation it is vitally important that we have a stable, national carrier providing a network of scheduled year-round services.  That is essential from an industrial point of view.  I had the privilege of serving as a Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce for three years when on a number of the IDA promotions worldwide in which I was involved the point was always emphasised, particularly in the USA, that we had a scheduled service from Dublin to America and also a network of scheduled services throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>What will happen if this Bill is not passed?  We will then have a free-for-all situation in which the Trans-Americas, the North-West Orients and others will service this country, but they will cream off for three months of the year the tourist business available without providing any additional business.  They will not add one iota to the overall number of tourists coming here.  If they do carry a small percentage of tourists the number will be minimal compared with the national damage that will be done if our national carrier is driven to the wall off the North Atlantic route.  Let it be said quite clearly that it is the Coalition Government policy &mdash; and it was Fianna Fáil Government policy in the decision we took in July 1982 and eventually implemented by this Government in March 1983 &mdash; that Aer Lingus should continue on the North Atlantic route.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus themselves had severe reservations about it.  They felt that because of the economic situation they would be unable to bear the burden it imposed on their organisation overall. From a national point of view the present Government and ours saw the need for Aer Lingus to continue a scheduled <Col N="863" /> service across the North Atlantic 52 weeks of the year.  Are we now prepared to allow that national interest to be sacrificed on the altar of consumerism?  I say &ldquo;no&rdquo; and I would be prepared to stand over such decision in any forum.  Are we prepared to see Trans-America, North-West Orient and other operators come in and cream off the best of the business for a couple of months for their profit motive alone?  If the North Atlantic service of Aer Lingus were to go it would mean that up to 1,500 jobs would be lost in Aer Lingus.  That is something I am not prepared to foresee &mdash; 1,500 jobs being lost in Aer Lingus alone leaving aside altogether the damage it would do us internationally in so far as our industrial and commercial development are concerned, because we would not then have scheduled services.</P>
    <P>We have heard talk of liberalisation before.  We have experienced the example of Laker when he set out initially with his package tours and was then going to provide a walk-on/walk-off service across the Atlantic.  He spoke of the damage he was going to do, the lessons he was going to give to British Airways and other carriers across the North Atlantic operating out of London.  What did we see?  We saw Laker go to the wall, but very nearly bring the national carriers to the wall with him.  We saw the same thing happen to Braniff.  Are we prepared to see the same thing happen to our national airline representing a small island nation whose industrial, commercial and tourist life is dependent on them for communications with the outside world?</P>
    <P>It has become somewhat the in-thing to attack IATA and the role Aer Lingus have played within that association. IATA was established by Governments, including ours, to ensure the orderly development of aviation, to protect consumer interests and to set fare rates at economic levels enabling international aviation to be operated commercially &mdash;&ldquo;commercially&rdquo; seems to be the sacred word nowadays &mdash; together with consumer interests.  It is important that Aer Lingus and other national carriers be allowed develop on a commercial basis, <Col N="864" /> providing scheduled services not merely in the high, peak season but also in the bad winter times.  IATA was established not alone to organise air transport and order its development but also to protect consumer interests.  Surely the interests of consumers are best protected when they know that they have guaranteed national carriers rather than the pirates who come in and out with the tide, the odd time they come in on a high tide but they come and go?  As a nation are we to be dependent on these types of operators coming here for their short-term commercial gain and then departing from us as they did in the past?  I gave the House an example of the Pan-Am/TWA situation as it affected Dublin Airport.  The damage they did Aer Lingus during that period should be remembered.</P>
    <P>This is not legislation merely to protect Aer Lingus.  The suggestion is that Aer Lingus is inefficient in this, that and the other way.  I reject that whole insinuation with regard to their efficiency, because they have taken great strides in the past couple of years to render themselves even more efficient.  They have reduced their workforce by up to 9 per cent.  They have introduced new turbo prop aircraft on feeder flights into the midlands of England, Liverpool and other areas.  Aer Lingus' continuation and strength are essential, not just for their sake as an organisation, but for us as a nation overall in regard to communications with the outside world.</P>
    <P>I make no apology for saying that this is national business in which we are engaged.  It is not merely the protection of the jobs of Aer Lingus workers, the managment of Aer Lingus or anything else.  This is essential national business in order to protect our interests so that our industrial and commercial development and job creation programmes can proceed. Let us never fall into the trap, as we did before, of accepting the short-term service to Dublin provided by Pan-Am and TWA.  For Heaven's sake let us recognise that the overall development of airline transport around the world must take place in an organised and orderly manner without bowing to any of <Col N="865" /> these foreign carriers who come here for short-term private gain rather than in the national interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies who have spoken, I welcome this Bill.  I would broadly agree with the remarks of the previous speaker.  However, he appears in one sense to be rather contradicting himself by saying that he does not view this Bill as a protectionist measure but rather as our engaging in national business. I see it as a protectionist measure endeavouring to give commercial protection to Aer Lingus.  I am not ashamed of saying that.  On the contrary, I want such measures.  It is right and proper that every possible protection should be extended to this important industry and to any other of our industries that are under pressure and attack by unfair trading practices &mdash; and there are many of them.</P>
      <P>In some circles the concept of protectionism for our industries is regarded as a dirty word.  I do not see it in that way; quite the reverse.  I have said in this House in other contexts that other countries worldwide within and outside the EEC have no hesitation in protecting their own industries and dumping their products here, just as airline tickets have been dumped here in this context.  We have exercised a restraint in that context well beyond the call of duty and it is time for us to look at this industry as this Bill does, and at other industries also in the same context and adopt like measures.  It is essential for the protection of the national airline and the preservation of the jobs in it that the question of ticket sales to which the Bill addresses itself be controlled in an orderly and understandable manner and that a proper regulation is seen to be done in a fair and proper manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We live at a time of increasing complexity in all walks of life.  We came to expect it in, for example, the fields of taxation, with a healthy crop of taxation experts and consultants creeping up.  We have seen our social welfare code likewise increasing in complexity beyond the understanding of the man in the street. Likewise, an expert is required here to unravel the complexities of the various <Col N="866" /> kinds of airline tickets.  I have heard said what I know to be a fact: that an airline setting out from Dublin to London, New York or whatever, you might be hard put to find more than 10 or 20 per cent of the people paying the same fare.  A variety of fares could apply and the various permutations, computations and complexities in ticket prices requires an expert consultant to unravel.  That should not be so.  A simplicity that the man in the street can follow should be written into this system.  The Minister, under the powers he takes under existing legislation and this legislation, should ensure that prices are kept to a minimum, that they are understandable and consistent and that this enormous complexity is taken out of the system.</P>
    <P>At the same time, there is more to it than just the pricing.  When the Minister takes upon himself, rightly &mdash; and I support the concept &mdash; control of the pricing he also has to ensure and insist that the level of service that the airlines provide in exchange for those prices is maintained. I am afraid that the pattern as I have seen it in air travel over the last decade or two presents a sorry picture. We have seen airline fares on scheduled services escalating out of all recognition at an appalling rate.  On the other hand, we have seen deteriorating the level of services that the airlines provide to the customers who use those services.  I remember the time when you arrived at Dublin Airport and people employed there would take your case, carry it in, see you in, you would get a cup of tea on the plane to London and some assistance with your baggage and so on.  All these services have dissipated over the years and the people employed to provide those services no doubt have joined many others on the dole queue.  The level of services has gone down and down, but has there been a reduction in prices commensurate with that?  Quite the reverse, even making allowance for the inflation which we know has been there.  I am quite sure that a comparison of the index would show that these prices have escalated well beyond the rate of inflation.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to look closely when the airlines put up their pricing figures to <Col N="867" /> him, and not just to look at the pricing but see what level of servicing is provided and insist that they stop the existing practice of treating people like sheep, herding them around, having scant regard for their customers.  I would also ask him to ensure that the uniformity we want here is not abused.</P>
    <P>The practice of over-booking should be examined.  It is standard practice in the airlines.  They do not mind.  They sell an extra 10 per cent or whatever above the number of tickets that will fill the plane in the hope and expectation that that number will not show up.  It is true that sometimes they do not show up, but sometimes they do and unfortunate people who thought they had a guaranteed seat are left stranded.  We know full well that this practice of over-booking is standard procedure with the airlines and it should not be permitted.  The prices are high enough.  The people are entitled to have a guarantee in this kind of situation that they will have their seat and also a reasonable level of service.  There are two sides to the coin.  If something is to be organised on a proper basis, if prices are to be organised properly, that is all right; but the level of service and the guarantee must also be provided for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this Bill very strongly and I am surprised to find it produced here at a time like this and in these circumstances.  It has all the hallmarks of emergency legislation.  Apparently it became available only this morning and the original intention was that it would be rushed through this House in all Stages at 8 o'clock tonight.  There have been second thoughts and now it is proposed to complete only Second Stage by 8 o'clock tonight.  I do not know what date has been fixed for Committee and remaining Stages.  I hope that sufficient time will be allowed to enable the fundamental errors that I think underlie this Bill to be fully realised and that the Government will think again about the steps they are taking and realise that they are flying in the face of normal economic sense and good commercial practice. They are making a laughing stock of this <Col N="868" /> country through the Irish Government being the only Government that I know of in the western world at present who are bringing emergency legislation into their own Parliament to push up air fares as much as possible.  This is happening a week or two after the signature of an important bi-lateral agreement between the British Government and the Dutch Government which has been widely welcomed in both countries and has had the effect of reducing the return fare between London and Amsterdam to £49.  The distance between London and Amsterdam is roughly the same as the distance between London and Dublin, and what is the return fare between London and Dublin?  Why should Irish passengers and British passengers who want to come to Ireland be caught at such an enormous disadvantage?  The fault of the high level of fares between Britain and Ireland does not lie with the British Government or British airlines, and the sooner we realise that the better.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note the joint statement issued last week by the British and Dutch transport Ministers, Mr. Nicholas Ridley and Mrs Nellie Smit-Kroes and which was reported in the <i>Financial Times</i> of 21 June, 1984:</P>
      <P>For too long civil aviation in the EEC has been constrained by rigid and inflexible rules which have stifled its development.</P>
      <P>For too long cost cartels and protectionism have been the order of the day. This has been bad for airlines and bad for their customers.  The agreement we have reached today enables the industry to break free.</P>
      <P>The report continues:</P>
      <P>The two ministers said they hoped the new agreement would spur other EEC countries to abandon airline cartels.</P>
      <P>It is too bad if they expect that sentiment to extend west of the Irish Sea from the evidence that is before us in the form of the Bill, a Bill which runs totally counter to what the British and Dutch are doing and to what the EEC Commission as well as every other western Government are endeavouring to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="869" /> The Minister's three-and-a-half page speech is a low-key effort which indicates nothing.  There is no attempt, for example, to reply to the arguments put forward in the past few days by a number of prominent economists and in particular there is no attempt to reply to the arguments outlined in an article by Mr. Seán Barrett of TCD which appears in today's <i>Irish Independent.</i> But that is not surprising since it would be difficult if not impossible for the Minister to reply to most of these arguments.  There is no reply to them.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that when this fundamental step is being taken by the Government, the Minister for Communications has not seen fit to come into the House but instead has rushed in the Minister of State in an attempt presumable to keep the whole matter in a low key.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to be here the Minister would have to fly back from Japan and air fares are very costly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust he is having a nice time in Japan and, from the point of view of the country, a profitable time, I am tempted to ask whether the Minister knows about the Bill, whether he was told about it before leaving for Japan, because there seems to have been a last-minute decision to produce the Bill at this time and to make the people aware of it.  In discussing a Bill which has as its main purpose the prevention of competition between travel agents, one is entitled to ask the Minister for Communications via his Minister of State what is his attitude to the situation in the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism where within the past few days the Restrictive Practices Commission have presented that Minister with a report of the travel agency business in this country, a report which, it is fair to assume, contains a long series of recommendations as to how travel agents should compete more openly and more freely with one another and should be involved in less restrictive practices than is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Presumably on the basis of statements <Col N="870" /> the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism has made about general principles of competition policy, he will accept that report and implement its recommendations but how can this be reconciled with the provision in this Bill to make punishable by way of a fine of £100,000 or of two years in jail or both a situation in which a travel agent would compete with another?  In relation to trans-atlantic air fares travel agents get a commission of up to 15 per cent and it has been the practice in recent times for Irish travel agents, in the interest of competition, to share some of that commission with their customers.  What is wrong with that?  It happens among travel agents around the world.  However, such action is to be brought within the criminal code here and is to be considered not in any way a minor offence but an offence punishable by the penalties I have outlined. How can such a proposal be reconciled with the stated principles of the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism who has expounded frequently and laudably the benefits of competition in this economy?  I wonder if that Minister is aware of this proposal.  Is he aware that while he is fixing maximum prices, the Minister for Communications will have the task of having people prosecuted for charging too little?  The Bill is ridiculous but we are expected to vote it through in the national interest.  It cannot be regarded in that light.</P>
    <P>We have had to endure what is probably the highest level of air fares in the world and which is out of all proportion to that pertaining in de-regulated countries and in other parts of Europe where the degree of de-regulation is less than is the case in the US.  Mr. Barrett points out that the cost per mile of an air fare between Dublin and London is 39 cents whereas the corresponding cost for the journey between New York and Buffalo, a similar distance, is 12 cents.  He did not point out, though it is equally relevant, that the cost per mile of an air fare between Los Angeles and San Francisco, a roughly comparable distance, is 8 cents per mile.  Therefore, the Irish consumer or the person wishing to come here is expected to pay almost five times as much <Col N="871" /> as people travelling similar distances in the US pay.  A plane flying in the US does not use less fuel or otherwise incur less costs than is the case here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>At a time when our tourist industry is suffering so severely and not likely to have a good year this year even if it is better than last year, one would have thought that our national interest lay in maximising the number of people who might come here.  This is a time when hotels around the country are closing down or are for sale.  We should remind ourselves that we are an island off an island off a continent and that we have a vested interest in ease of access and that in the eighties means cheapness of access.  But instead of decreasing access to the country, making it cheaper for people to come here, we are introducing legislation which will ensure that our already extraordinarily high fares will be higher.</P>
      <P>This legislation will seriously affect Shannon Airport because the situation at present is that Trans-America, the airline against which this legislation is primarily designed at the request of Aer Lingus via their sub-office in the Department of Communications, are offering a fare from Shannon at a saving of £90.  That is being done away with.  A great many people who would wish to avail of that saving will be able to avail of it by travelling via Belfast.  Trans-America are providing a bus service for passengers from Dublin to Shannon at a cost of £5. Passengers can avail of that and still save £85.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That would cost a lot more.  In future a passenger from Dublin will not make the long journey to Shannon. If he does he will have to pay the same fare.  He will make the shorter journey to Belfast and the fare will cost him £90 less than the Aer Lingus fare.  Is it in our national interest that this should be <Col N="872" /> so or will we continue to make the mistake of equating Ireland's national interest with the health of Aer Lingus's balance sheet?  Tragically we are continuing to make that mistake.</P>
      <P>Any other country would see that its interests were served by maximising the number of people who visited it.  They would make sure they had cheap access and they would make more and more flights available.  We do the exact opposite. Aer Lingus take the view that it is better to sell 100 seats at $200 rather than 200 seats at $100.  The revenue would be exactly the same and the national interest would be greatly helped by having an additional 100 people visit this country but Aer Lingus would prefer to fly the plane with 100 empty seats.  Ireland has lost out by that and will continue to do so.  Any hope that there might be an improvement in the situation from the point of view of tourism is dashed by this Bill if it is passed.  Until such time as it is set aside by the European Court under Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome it copperfastens the present policy which is to deplete to the greatest possible extent the number of people coming to Ireland by keeping the fares at the highest possible level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other airport which will be primarily hit by this proposal is Cork.  I read with interest this morning the submissions made by the Aer Rianta staff at Cork to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies. They said the whole policy which it was necessary to pursue in Cork was one of maximising the use of the airport.  They have fixed costs there and whether 100 passengers or three million passengers went through Cork each year there costs would be the same.  Their idea was to make the airport more profitable.  What has happened?  There is no possibility whatever of cheaper flights into Cork and no possibility of more people using the airport or of it becoming economically viable.  This is happening in the first year ever that there was no ferry or passenger shipping service between Cork and Britain. It is happening at a time when a wise Government who wanted to help the economy would go to the British and tell <Col N="873" /> them they had made an arrangement whereby they have £49 return fares between London and Amsterdam and ask them to make an arrangement so that there would be £49 return fares from London to Cork.  Instead of that the opposite was done.  Fares will only move in an upward direction.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go on at too great a length about Aer Lingus.  The tragedy is that if one criticises anyone or any organisation one is painted as, in some way, casting a personal slur on everyone involved and on every member of the organisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be said that O'Malley is anti-Aer Lingus.  The truth is that Aer Lingus &mdash; this has been my opinion for some years and I did what I could when in Government to change their attitude but without success &mdash; have followed policies which were ill-advised and damaging to our economy.  If this Bill is passed it copperfastens for all time those policies.  That is a tragedy and a disgrace.  It should not happen.  I will be voting against the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder whether Ministers such as the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism know what is in this Bill?  It has apparently been rushed out in the last 24 hours.  I know how Governments operate.  Not every Minister can attend every meeting and it is conceivable that the Minister did not even see it.  If he had he must have been revolted not just at the detail in the Bill but at the very principle involved.  If a travel agent gives one per cent discount to a good customer from whom he makes thousands of pounds each year he is committing a crime for which he can be fined £100,000. We must be the only country in the world that puts people in jail for charging too little and for not making the maximum profit.  It is a regular feature of the travel trade business that travel agents give occasional free tickets to very good customers. For example, if a man travels ten or 12 times a year to New York it might not be unknown for his travel agent to <Col N="874" /> offer a free ticket for the man's wife once a year or once every two years.  If he does that now it is a crime and he will be subject to a possible penalty of £100,000 or two years in prison.  Everyone outside of IATA are against what is being done in the Bill.  I am sure many of them do not know about it yet but they will break their sides laughing at what the Irish Parliament are doing.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a report of the fifth meeting of the Ad Hoc Group on Inter European Air Transport Policy of the European Civil Aviation Conference which was held between 5 and 7 May 1981.  It was attended by the air transport regulators of all the European countries and was chaired by a distinguished Irishman, Mr. G.W. Lumsden, who was then in the Department of Transport but has since been seconded temporarily to the European Civil Aviation Conference as a full-time official.  Among other things they stated:</P>
    <P>Because of the dual government involvement in airlines' international routes, it is not possible for any one state's national legislation to override the provisions of bilateral air services agreements and the requirements for inter-governmental agreements on tariffs. It is possible of course that national anti-monoply legislation could influence a government's approach to international tariff negotiations but no one government can enforce its national law on another.  To attempt to do so would be to lay claim to extra-territorial jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>That is a statement of fact.  It is not a revolutionary recommendation.  If this Bill is passed it will attempt to lay claim to extra-territorial jurisdiction.  I draw the attention of the House to what Mr. Nicholas Bethell said in his submission to the Commission of the European Communities recently on the question of air fares within Europe.  He is a Conservative member of the European Parliament for London North West.  I do not know if he was re-elected recently but let us hope that he was, because he seems to be a sensible man.  He says in his submission: <Col N="875" /> I believe the present system by which air fares are determined for travel on the main airlines of the European Community to be contrary to Article 85 and Article 86 of the Treaty of Rome.  Paragraph one of Article 85 forbids undertakings to fix selling prices or to share markets with the object of restricting competition.  Article 86 forbids undertakings with a dominant position within the Common Market to impose unfair selling prices or apply dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions.</P>
    <P>What is being done by this Bill other than precisely that?  The only difference is that it is assumed in other countries that it is airlines, big companies and so on that come together and do this surreptiously or clandestinely.  It is not assumed that states would impose breaches of Articles 85 and 86 on companies trading internationally.  However, that is what is happening here.  Mr. Bethell goes on to say:</P>
    <P>By agreeing to almost all the proposals for route sharing and price fixing proposed by their main publicly owned airlines, by consistently refusing proposals by privately owned airlines which would provide regular air services within Europe at sharply reduced cost, the governments of member states are clearly in violation of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>If they were, how much more so are the Irish Government in violation of those two Articles of the Treaty if they seek to pass this legislation?  It is worth briefly calling the House's attention also to the Proposal for a Council Directive (EEC) on Tariffs and Scheduled Air Transport between Member States, presented by the Commission to the Council in Brussels, 26 October 1981.  At page 3, paragraph (n) the Commission says:</P>
    <P>The Commission considers that the present fare structure is too much a result of the interests of the airlines and that there are many routes where the consumer choice is too limited and <Col N="876" /> where no low tariffs.  e.g. based on a break-even seat factor of 85% are available;</P>
    <P>It is perfectly clear what the attitude of the Commission is.  As far back as 1981, with Commissioner Burke then and in earlier years, the Commission endeavoured to break the European cartel of which Aer Lingus, with Lufthansa and one or two other airlines are the main upholders but a much more up-to-date quotation from the Commission, from a document sponsored by a Mr. Giorgios Contogeorgis and a Mr. Frans Andriessen respectively, the Commissioners for Transport and for Competition reported in the <i>Financial Times</i> of 14 March 1984:</P>
    <P>Fares would remain subject to Government approval</P>
    <P>&mdash; and the Minister of State is, of course, right is saying that.</P>
    <P>&mdash; but if the two sides cannot agree, then the country originating change should be allowed to go ahead.</P>
    <P>The House should ponder for a moment on that.  What that means in this context is that if the American side want a change then, under the Commission proposals laid down there, the side who want to change are entitled to make the change.  The Americans want to charge less to get into Ireland.  They want to bring more people in here.  It is the legal duty, I suggest, of an Irish Government not to stop them, but it is certainly the political and economic duty of an Irish Government not to stop them.  If the Government want to stop more people coming in here and the airlines from bringing in more people, I suggest that the Irish Parliament should exercise its powers to try to stop them from acting so foolishly.</P>
    <P>I have by no means dealt with all the many points which arise on this, but it would be unfair to go on for too long as I know that there must be many other Members from all sides of the House who want to contribute.  However, I would ask the Minister of State, as it is hoped that he will have an opportunity between now and October of thinking about Committee <Col N="877" /> Stage, to have a fundamental rethink.  I would invite Members of this House who are concerned with the state of our tourism industry and with the vulnerable position of airports like Cork and Shannon, in particular, to join with me when I challenge a division on Second Reading of this Bill tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I am glad that the Minister has agreed that this matter be confined to Second Stage debate and that this legislation would not be rushed through the House.  It has opened up a debate &mdash; and, if I may say so, a can of worms which needs to be opened up.</P>
      <P>The Minister said at the outset that the purpose of this legislation is to close off a potentially serious loophole.  I think that he has a duty in that respect.  Otherwise we should be talking of doing away with the 1965 Act altogether.  To the extent that in its narrow sense the Bill just does that, I could support it for that purpose alone; otherwise I would be supporting chaos.  Either we have a law that is capable of being enforced fully, or we do not.  I have grave concerns and worries about other issues which this Bill has opened up in this debate.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wilson very adroitly referred to page 4 of the Minister's statement in which were the words &ldquo;The prerogative to submit fare proposals at whatever levels they wish will continue to reside with the airlines and I will examine all proposals on their merits&rdquo;.  I should like to hear the Minister at some stage give his views and thinking on that statement.  If it means that he will, for example, go along with a percentage of low cost carriers getting on to the Irish market, then I should be less concerned than I am.  I think that the record of all Ministers in this area is that they have tended to support relatively high fares in their perhaps understandable concern about sustaining the national carrier, about which we all must have a concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like therefore to direct my comments to that sentence to which Deputy Wilson alluded.  What is the Minister's attitude to the whole question of air fares?  I should like to say a few things about the pros and cons, if I may.  First, <Col N="878" /> whether we like it or otherwise, Aer Lingus are there.  We are proud of them in most respects.  They have done a good job in the country.  We needed them and we still need them.  Therefore, no Minister can address this subject without that concern.  However, at times we have faced those issues here by an overriding concern which disregards the other side of the picture.  As a result of that approach, this is the most expensive island to get on or off, no matter how you travel.  As a result of the same philosophy we have the highest energy costs in Europe; we have extremely high postal charges; we have a whole series of results of that concern to protect national undustry. I suggest that we must look very seriously at that.  In addition to the need to protect Aer Lingus, we must have some concern, also, about the other international carriers who come in here on the basis of the same price structures as Aer Lingus.  We have to protect the viability of our routes, particularly across the Atlantic and therefore cannot just cut and run for the lowest cost on the basis that that is necessarily the right thing to do.</P>
    <P>On the one hand, I would say that we must be very concerned about Aer Lingus, about making our routes attractive to international carriers and also about the viability of travel agents.  We have seen some very unfortunate crashes, with disastrous results for the consumer.  If we go for an absolutely uncontrolled cut-price situation, clearly some travel agents will go out of business and the consumer will be the sufferer there.  There is that side of the coin and that case is very well articulated generally in this House.</P>
    <P>The other side of the coin, of course, is, what is in the national interest?  What is the real consumer interest in all this? Deputy O'Malley has spoken about the two airports outside Dublin.  Certainly I know little enough about Shannon, but can vouch for the fact that Cork Airport is, and has always been, starved of business relative to its size and the minimum infrastructure which is necessary to have an airport there at all.  Even though this legislation is only closing a loophole, any legislation which creates an atmosphere <Col N="879" /> of relatively high fare protectionism is certainly not a good development from the point of view of Shannon Transatlantic or of the future viability of Cork airport. I want to make that point to the Minister when he is dealing with the broad question of his approach to fares applications, which I hope he will deal with.</P>
    <P>I also want to refer to the need of slotting into our general travel policy a place for the low cost traveller and the low cost travel agent.  There are certain people who could not fly at all unless there is a fare they can afford to pay and we must have a place for them.  In my opinion we cannot support Aer Lingus to the point of that company not making that provision.  That is where I would draw the line, without allowing a total free-for-all.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to the cost per mile of comparable distances in various parts of the world as reported in today's papers compared with the cost of getting on and off this island.  It is a national scandal.  There is no question about that.  The cost of flying from Cork to Dublin is impossible.  Only a tiny minority can afford it.  Only those who are subsidised can afford to fly from Cork to Dublin or Dublin to London and back. Added to that as of now we have no ferry to the UK.  That is a serious problem for the viability of the south-west of the country.</P>
    <P>With regard to tourism, the argument has been advanced that the viability of Aer Lingus takes precedence over the liability to tourism.  That balance has not been correctly struck and nothing will convince me that any policy other than an open-sided policy will bring us the maximum number of tourists.  We accept the need to sustain Aer Lingus but there is another road we should travel.  It is absolutely ludicrous when one talks to American travel agents and to people in the United States about the possibility of visiting Ireland and they respond by talking about the impossibility of visiting Ireland because they cannot afford it. There are millions of Irish Americans <Col N="880" /> overflying this country to the United Kingdom because they cannot afford to stop here or they are not willing to stop here because of the fare structure and policy we follow.  That must be bad.  It is certainly not in the national interest.</P>
    <P>If the Minister does not make a fairly dramatic break from the traditional approach to fares in and out of this country tragedy will inevitably follow in that people will find a way outside of the Republic just as they have found a way across the Border in Belfast and over in London and there will avail of cheap air fares and we will lose that traffic.  I have not read the Bill line for line but my initial reaction is that it seems to me the penalty is very severe for what could not be regarded as a major crime.  To summarise, I could support a very narrow view that the purpose of the Bill was nothing more than the closing of a serious loophole in order to ensure that chaos would not prevail.  I have very serious reservations about the general tone of the Bill and the disregard of consumer interests.  Without a very comprehensive statement from the Minister on his general attitude to the cost of air fares I could not be at all happy about this Bill being enacted in its present form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt at all this Bill was speedily put together for some reason known only to the Government and to the Minister.  It was admitted by the Minister on the Second Stage that the Bill is in reply to a request from and in support of the Aer Lingus situation.  That demonstrates the influence Aer Lingus apparently has in these matters when dealing with the Department of Transport. I suggested not so long ago that the time had come when there was an obvious need to separate the controlling Department from the fare structure.  This is a clear example of that step not having been taken.  It has been clearly shown now that a particular organisation can move not alone a Department but even the Government to meet a point of view. In this instance the result is anything but satisfactory.  It is not fair that the Second Stage should be taken today.  Amendments will be necessary and we will certainly <Col N="881" /> be obliged to oppose the Bill in its present form.  Certain sections may be in the national interest but, taken as a whole, it will militate against the consumer. It is odd, to say the least of it, that a Department interested in consumer legislation should introduce a Bill against the consumer.</P>
      <P>The existing fares are most unsatisfactory. Money which should be coming into the country is actually going out of the country.  That is most unsatisfactory.  It is a reflection on the Department of Transport. Tourists are flying out from outside destinations to their ultimate destination whether it be on holiday or on business. Apparently in other countries the kind of pressure brought to bear on the Department of Transport here does not exist. The whole thrust of this Bill is in support of Aer Lingus.  We have all stated our position where our national airline is concerned. We are proud of the service and we are proud of their record.  As an island country it is necessary for us to have a working national airline providing a service, irrespective of who might or might not withdraw their service for any reason at any time.  But that is not to say that we should close our eyes entirely to the demands and the needs of the people who are using these airlines and who need the service from a consumer point of view.</P>
      <P>This Bill does not effect passengers alone.  It also affects the airlines and the travel agencies and, to a greater extent, it affects tourism.  The only solution to our tourism problem is to get more people to come here.  This legislation would have a detrimental effect on tourism. Sooner or later we will have to divorce the controlling Department of the national airline from the fare structuring mechanism which binds all airlines including the national airline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill was introduced in some haste. No copies were available in the Government Publications Office for the general public who might be interested in it. More than selected interests are involved.  Huge numbers of people are involved and concerned about this Bill. Their livelihoods depend upon it.  They feel very aggrieved to learn that the <Col N="882" /> Government would move in this way without any consultation with the concerned parties except one party, the party the Minister states he is seeking to support, the national airline.</P>
    <P>This Bill is introduced in the last dying days of this session in the hope that all Stages will be passed on the nod.  To put it politely, that is sneaky legislation.  It is viewed outside as such.  The Minister had quite a long time since the court action he referred to, to bring in legislation and have it given a proper airing in a democratic fashion, instead of lumping it in at the end of a session in a conglomeration of measures.  That is not good practice, and it has raised the hackles of many people inside and outside the House.</P>
    <P>The suggested urgency cannot be justified. The practices which the Minister says he wants to regularise have been with us for quite some time.  The Minister could have moved at his leisure at any stage and dealt with this matter in a slow, premeditated way, taking account of all the interests involved, the agents, the airline, the consumers and the operators, and particularly the tourist interests which have such a great bearing on this.</P>
    <P>For some years travel agents found it necessary to increase their sales if they were to stay in business.  For that reason they were prepared to take a lower profit on the sale of tickets by taking a lower commission.  That is all that is involved. They shared that commission with the consumer.  The ordinary passenger got a rebate on his fare, and he was very happy to get it.  The airline received the very same net fare.  There was no loss to the airline, whichever airline it was.  The loss was suffered by the agent who was prepared to share part of his commission to generate extra sales and keep in business in very trying times.</P>
    <P>The travel agents have increased their sales and the travelling passengers have got a cheaper air fare.  We have the most expensive air fares in western Europe.  If travel agents were prepared to take less commission from the sales of tickets, and pass the saving on to the consumer, why should the Department act like big daddy and say they could not have that little reduction in the fare because that was not <Col N="883" /> playing the game according to the Department's rules.  It makes no financial difference to the airline.  The airline will get its stated price.</P>
    <P>The Department should be the supporter and the safeguard of the consumer. They should welcome this as a protection and support for the consumer. It is extraordinary that that is not so.  The Minister said the Department feel threatened. I do not know why the Department feel threatened.  I presume it means that if they do not get their own way they will use the big stick to get their way.  That is not in the interest of reform as outlined by other Ministers.</P>
    <P>Quite a battle has been going on for some time between the various interests involved in this matter and, in particular, between the Department, certain airlines and certain travel agents.  The Department want to have their way come what may.  They must have taken that attitude when they commenced the High Court action last year and sought to have commission-splitting made illegal.  The High Court may have accepted that the Department were entitled to a temporary injunction at that time but, according to the Supreme Court, they were not entitled to that injunction against the airlines. Since they did not get their way under the rules, the Department are now trying to change the rules so that they will be beyond the rule of law.  That is not in the best interests of the Department or the consumer.</P>
    <P>If there is such urgency, what were the Minister and the Department doing since last April?  Were they waiting for the last few days of this dying session to sneak in legislation in the hope that it would be passed on the nod and they would have their way?  That is not the kind of performance we would expect from a regulatory Department.  There is no stated reason that can stand up as to why the Department should get involved in the ordinary price competition which exists in the market place between one travel agent and another.  Why are they getting involved in this area of activity?</P>
    <P>This has not been the practice of the Department in any other type of legislation. <Col N="884" /> It is in the interests of the consumer and the general efficiency of the travel agency business that the cheapest possible fares should be available to those who want to travel.  Surely everybody could subscribe to that principle.  The hard-pressed consumer is entitled to get the best deal he can.  The Department are trying to muck into an area of commercial business in which they were never formerly involved.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that if they were genuine in their interest they would have been much more explicit in sections 3 and 4 of the Bill about what they would do if difficulties arose.  Why was the Minister not asked to take account of the fare-paying passenger in the legislation as proposed? There is not a word about the consumer.  Why does the Minister not encourage competitive pricing?  Why is it that he always makes a decision as to what suits him irrespective of anyone else?  In this case he is giving no say to the consumer, the unfortunate person who would like to avail of a cheaper fare that he could get in any other jurisdiction on either side of the Atlantic.  Why is the Minister not obliged under the legislation to give a written reason for the decision as to whether he approved of a particular fare?  In addition, why is he not obliged to justify the reason to a particular operator for not granting a particular fare structure?  This is extraordinary legislation in that it is acting as a bulwark for one particular interest, namely, the interest that has been displayed by the Department in their dealings with the national airline for many years.  I do not believe the national airline want that situation to continue and certainly the consumers do not want it to continue.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate thing about this legislation is that it will tie the legislation of 1982 dealing with tour operators and travel agents into the Acts dealing with air navigation and transport.  These are two completely separate codes of operation. It was never intended to regulate the commercial practices of the tour operators under the 1982 Act.  That was introduced to secure the financial stability of travel agents and to require them to have a bond available for display <Col N="885" /> to the Minister to guarantee that they were viable and had the necessary finances to meet their commitments under the licence granted by the Minister. That is a far cry from trying to tie them into the Acts dealing with air navigation and transport, as is being attempted in this Bill.  This Bill is attempting to do something that was not intended in the other legislation in 1982.</P>
    <P>The situation will be that if a travel agent offers better value to any person seeking his business he will be in danger of losing his licence.  It is my belief that if section 10 were challenged it would be unconstitutional under Article 43 of the Constitution because it denies the right to an individual to carry on in a commercial way.  The Act of 1982 was introduced to remedy a situation that had gone a little astray with regard to the viability of tour operators and it provided that they should have a bond to ensure they did not go bankrupt, thus putting a strain on the Minister's fund.  I understand this represents about £4 per ticket sold.  I do not understand why the Minister has got involved in tying together these two separate types of operation so far as transport is concerned.  That is what this Bill is proposing, but it was never intended that the Minister should get involved in the commercial practices of the tour operators.  To suggest to a tour operator who gives a cheaper rate to a group or to an individual that this will be taken into consideration when he applies for renewal of his licence and that he is in danger of losing his licence is, to my mind, grossly undemocratic and unconstitutional. It would not stand up in any court of law.</P>
    <P>Tour operators and travel agents have endured difficulties and there have been some collapses which were the subject of much discussion in the past few years. For that reason in 1982 the Government were forced into doing something about it and, as a result, the Act of 1982 provided for bonding.  Because of that and because the recession has been biting so hard, it has been necessary for travel agents to sell as much business as possible in order to remain viable.  They have provided certain discounted fares at the <Col N="886" /> last minute to minimise their losses.  If the Minister had been allowed to complete all Stages of this legislation today he would put some of the tour operators in financial difficulties and this would rebound back on himself in the short-term because he would have to make up the losses through the compensation fund.  If the legislation as proposed is implemented no longer will it be possible for a tour operator or an agent to give any concessions with regard to fares.  Discounting of business goes on in every walk of life and for Members of the Dail to show the consumers outside that we are so forgetful of their needs and to say that nobody is entitled to a discounted fare borders on the ridiculous.  When the Minister has time to consider the matter, I am sure he will be delighted to remove that provision.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not take account of the fact that air services are operated under international bilateral agreements between countries.  This Bill should not apply to travel between countries where the bilateral agreements do not make provision in relation to the fixing of fares. Otherwise the State will be in violation of its obligations under some of those bilateral arrangements which the Minister has trotted out in trying to support his stand on this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister poses as the protector of Aer Lingus.  All of us accept that Aer Lingus must stay in business and provide a service.  Nobody is suggesting otherwise. If we were suggesting otherwise the action of a former Fianna Fáil administration in introducing what can only be called a subsidy in respect of the North Atlantic route would not have been contemplated at the time.  Then the subsidy was £5 million and it may have been reduced to £4 million since.  From the point of view of tourism and industry, it is in our best interests to have a national airline but it is ludicrous to tell the consumers who are paying that subsidy to Aer Lingus that they are not entitled to benefit by way of discounted fares that are available through other airlines who, for reasons best known to themselves, can do the job cheaper.  By doing that we are asking the consumer to suffer on both <Col N="887" /> accounts: he pays the subsidy but he cannot have the benefit of discounted fares. Aer Lingus should not be entitled to use the Department as a battering ram to do down the consumer just to get a fare that is still out of line with competition on both sides of the Atlantic, even though the operators concerned attempt to give a little fair play to the customer.</P>
    <P>I should have thought it would have been in the interests of all concerned to have more airlines operate in and out of Ireland, thus increasing the number of visitors.  It is in our long-term best interest to get as many airlines as possible interested in flying here from destinations that may not now be catered for by the national airline.  Certainly it would be in the interest of the tourism business because so far as that trade is concerned we are a second-location destination in any event.  Until such time as the question of access transport has been properly thrashed out we will not maximise the potential that exists from the point of view of worldwide tourism.  This legislation is militating against any development in that area and, consequently, should not be supported.</P>
    <P>Perhaps this is an appropriate time to apply the Restrictive Trade Practices Acts to air transport.  At present those Acts do not apply to air transport and there is no reason why one industry should have less stringent requirements than others.  If we applied the Acts perhaps we could find out precisely who is making what and where the malfunctions are in the system.  From that investigation perhaps we would get cheaper rates to which we are entitled at the same time as protecting Aer Lingus in the national interest.</P>
    <P>It has already been stated that this legislation is more than likely in contravention of many EEC rules.  With regard to competition, it is contrary to EEC law for any country to pass legislation in support of a particular industry or operation that is directly under its control.  There is no question but that Aer Lingus are under the control of the Department of Transport, or perhaps it is the other way round.  Whichever has the final clout, it <Col N="888" /> is not permissible under EEC law for the regulating authority to pass specific and selective legislation in support of their own interests.  That would be going against all kinds of fair trading and the EEC are already on record as working towards cheaper air fares.  That is the trend, and why are the Department running against the tide in not giving the same advantage to the consumers that is available in other jurisdictions?  It is well known in the trade that large numbers of consumers are leaving the jurisdiction and getting flights from London or Belfast. You can even get an APEX fare to London and then qualify for a discount for the rest of your journey.  Think of the loss of revenue to the State; and it also puts the operators and agencies here out of business.  It also makes a laugh of open fair trading between member states.  It is a backward step and there is no way, as Deputy Wilson said, that we could support it.</P>
    <P>There are many other aspects of the legislation which cause concern including some of the language in the Bill, which is somewhat unusual to say the least.  For example, section 5(4) (ii) says:</P>
    <P>that the relevant contravention was committed without his consent, connivance or default or that he took, or caused to be taken, reasonable steps to prevent or avoid the contravention.</P>
    <P>That puts the whole question of the framing of this legislation in question in that it was done for a particular purpose.  The kindest thing that one could say in that regard is that it was sneaked in here in the dying days of this session to give the Department the power to change the ground rules on which they had lost their case not long ago.  I do not think that is in the best interests of the national airline, tourism, development or passengers. For that reason I support our spokesman when he rejected this legislation. I hope the Minister will accommodate us by amending some of the offensive sections, especially sections 5 and 10, which should be repungnant even to his thinking and possibly are also repungnant to the Constitution.</P>
    <Col N="889" />
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a brief contribution to this Bill which will not be entirely on the lines of the first few speakers. I do not think there is anything sinister about the legislation and I do not necessarily agree that the Bill has been sneaked into the House.  I can understand the need for it and the necessity for taking quick action.  It provides an opportunity which we do not often get to look at this kind of legislation and the protection it gives to Aer Lingus and the artificial way it keeps air fares high.  I agree that fares are a scandal here, so this Bill is an opportunity for somebody to look seriously at the whole business of air transport to and from the country.</P>
      <P>I am not sure that I agree with Deputy Flynn in his understanding of the Bill. People in Aer Lingus might be concerned if Deputy Flynn was in charge of this legislation because if we were to apply the Restrictive Practices Acts and allow open competition, letting airliners in from any source to provide cheap fares, it would be the end of Aer Lingus, even trimmed down, as we know it because it would do them so much damage.  I hope this is not Fianna Fáil policy.  However, I also have constructive criticisms in regard to fares because, as Deputy Flynn said, they represent a tax on consumers. The Minister said it was not meant to be anti-consumer, but the Irish consumer has been very badly affected by this form of tax over the years.  Not many people can avail of air fares.  Indeed, many people never go abroad either on holidays or on business and they could not contemplate a holiday by air due to the high fares.  Perhaps it is an attempt to keep people at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Coveney mentioned the fare from Cork to London.  The fare from Dublin to London is artifically high and there are terms in the speech that worry me &mdash; for instance, &ldquo;at whatever levels they wish&rdquo;.  There is a kind of cartel operating and fares are kept too high.  I was in the House when Supplementary Estimates were passed to help Aer Lingus on the North Atlantic route where they had lost heavily.  I cannot remember the exact figure but I think it was around £20 million.  There is an argument for <Col N="890" /> asking why we should subsidise the North Atlantic route if there are plenty of other carriers willing to fly the route and can afford to run it more cheaply and better than we can.  Why must we have the flag flying over the Atlantic?  It seems a childish attitude to say that at all costs we must continue to have our North Atlantic route although it is losing a fortune annually but at least we can fly to America in an Aer Lingus plane.  I do not think it would make any difference to fly to America with TWA or any other airline if the fare is reasonable.</P>
    <P>People seldom contemplate leaving Ireland although there are millions of Irish people living on the different continents. Irish people often return to see their relatives but the traffic in the other direction is not great.  In recent years the only time there was a lot of travellers from Ireland to places like America was when there was a cheap rate to Florida. With air fares being controlled by legislation and the price pitched as Aer Lingus apply them it will be almost prohibitive for a family to contemplate going abroad for a holiday.  I checked to see what it would cost to go to the United States with my wife and four children and discovered that although one of our children is very young it would cost £1,600 just to get there and back.  That would be out of the question.  We must take a realistic view of this.  The efficiency of the company must be looked at.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley, in the course of his contribution, gave examples of the price per mile in the United States.  On the eastern side of the US a company called People's Express charge air fares that are pleasantly low for inter-state travel. Their aircrafts are used almost like taxis because people can afford the fares.  We are tied to Europe, a continent with a population equivalent to the United States, and there is no reason why this corner should not offer fares on a par with those offered by airlines like People's Express.  That company offer special fares for journeys to Canada and Texas.  Their service is very competitive.</P>
    <P>Our fares are well out of line and there can be no justification for that.  I urge the Minister to carry out an objective <Col N="891" /> examination of them or, perhaps, call in a firm of consulants to do that work.  It amounts to an unfair tax on the consumers, those who use the airline.  I do not know of any argument that would prove that it is not a tax.  There is no doubt that the fact that the air fares are so high means that we lose out enormously on the volume of traffic.  We are inclined to forget the amount of extra revenue that could be earned if people could travel with ease in and out of the country.  For as long as the tariffs are high the volume will be low and that does not make economic sense.  The fares between here and the UK are ridiculously high.</P>
    <P>While I realise it is necessary for the Department to have control over the tariff rating that does not mean that prices will remain as they are.  The Minister will still have the opportunity to refuse to accept the high level of fares and carry out a reappraisal in his Department.  He will be in a position to examine the effect of high fares out of the country.  The high subsidies the company have been getting could be used in areas that are crying out for investment.  Too often we say we do not have money for projects and yet we lash out £90 million to Irish Steel and money to Aer lingus.  Yesterday we heard of the pathetic story that very little money is being spent on the enormous drugs problem we have.  We must look at the fares package in the context of the Irish consumers.  In future I will be slow to accept this form of artificial control and the easy way that huge sums of money can be allocated to different projects while it is not possible to provide small sums for worth-while ones.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill because I believe the Minister must have control.  It is reasonable to ask him to examine the air fare structure and not accept without a close examination the fares suggested by the airlines.  If he does, it is an invitation to the airline to pitch their own prices.  It is unnecessary and high-handed to have a prison sentence in addition to the very high fines for breaches of this legislation. The fines are adequate.  If the breach of the legislation continues the fines can be added on daily but there is no need for a <Col N="892" /> prison sentence.  I will deal with this matter in greater detail on Committee Stage but I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the legislation applies to all employees.</P>
    <P>The legislation removes the possibility of low fares here because it rules out competition.  I disagree with what Deputy Burke said about Freddie Laker and so on.  New airline companies took the place of Freddie Laker and are operating on the North Atlantic route successfully. Freddie Laker fought a battle with the major companies who did not want low fare competition.  From the point of view of the good of the country we should have a closer look at the fare structure.  We are all aware of what it is costing the country to subsidise Aer Lingus and we should examine the effect of a reduction in fares which are scandalously controlled between British Airways and Aer Lingus on the routes between the UK and here. Competition has been cut out.  That is an example of what happens when we become over-protective.  I have no doubt that ways will be found around this and that there will be organised trips to Belfast in the same way that buses leave Dublin city for rural areas at weekends charging fares that are much lower than those charged by CIE.</P>
    <P>In the same way there would be cheap helicopter flights to Belfast.  There might even be more competition and more airlines might come in if there was a reasonably priced service.  The number of people travelling could possibly double or triple.  Many people travel only once in a lifetime or at most every few years. Regular travel by scheduled flights is for business people or people whose fares are subsidised, not for the average earner.  I certainly could not afford to take my wife and three fare-paying children, as well as one not paying, on a trip to the United States and pay £1,600 for it.  The newspapers keep saying that I am very highly paid and pointing out that part of my salary is tax-free.  The average wage would be only half of the amount I receive.  Most of the population would be earning amounts between £7,000 and £9,000 per year, while I am earning about £16,400.  I cannot afford to go to London <Col N="893" /> because it would cost about £200 for a one-day round trip.  The cost is absolutely ridiculous.</P>
    <P>I realise that the purpose of the Act is to plug a loophole.  The Minister had to act and it is a bit unfair to attack the Department.  If they did not act there would be a hullabaloo.  If an assault is being made on the national airline they should be given an opportunity to examine realistically their whole operation so that they can adjust to meet a changing market situation.  Nobody wants to damage an enterprise which has been patiently built up and has been very successful. It has been a source of pride to the population and has done an excellent job.  At the same time we should not give a licence to any institution to charge what they like or to be inefficient.  I am not suggesting that they are trying to do these things but it is incontrovertible that the fares Irish consumers are asked to pay are grossly out of proportion and that this is another tax on the consumer.  The poor old taxpayer is burdened so much that he ought to be able to save for a holiday.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to re-examine the question of air fares with a view to making travel cheap.  We should not always kick the private enterprise person or those who try to introduce competition and give a better service.  One small airline last year nearly succeeded in giving a service all over the country.  There is no reason why we should not have such a service provided by Aer Lingus at reasonable prices.  It would make the whole country accessible and would take a lot of pressure off cities like Dublin which have become grossly overcrowded.  It might even bring about some decentralisation. I do not know when the Minister proposes to take Committee Stage but I will reserve further comment until then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief because I am aware that previous speakers have probably made all the obvious points.  What we are confronted with is the tension caused by an airline or any other semi-State body feeling that they are the answer to Irish needs and should be supported at all costs.  We are conscious that we are venturing towards new <Col N="894" /> horizons &mdash; perhaps that is an appropriate term to use in regard to air travel. We are constantly being challenged by a world which is shrinking into a global village.  No longer can we see ourselves as an isolated country where our perfect Irish airline can be preserved in aspic.  I take the thrust of Deputy Skelly's remarks.  In no way can this be seen as an attack on Aer Lingus and their proud record built up over the years.  We as legislators and distributors of taxpayer's money, as well as Aer Lingus, have to take into account that there is competition.</P>
      <P>While the world is becoming a global village we are still a small spot on the outskirts and our physical isolation demands that we employ air travel.  We do not have the advantage of rail travel such as enjoyed on the Continent and in the United States.  Because of our geographical situation we must look practically at the demands made by the people who wish to travel abroad for work or long-sought holidays.  This is becoming more and more relevant as our young people look outwards.  They save all year to go on holidays.  They have a greater sense of adventure than I and my generation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only type of travel our age group contemplated was that of the emigrant ship.  Most of us did not have enough money until we had gone abroad and saved it to fly back.  Hopefully today our young people will have jobs that will enable them to save toward an objective like that, which should be encouraged. This is part of the anxiety of members of this House, that young people having saved hard wishing to go abroad, see absolutely nothing but added adventure in travelling to Northern Ireland or to Great Britain and availing of a much reduced fare in getting to their destinations. This must be of grave concern to Members of this House who have seen that kind of drain already in regard to cross-Border activity.  There is no doubt that discussion of this Bill will heighten awareness amongst our people wishing to travel to avail of such opportunities.  We have seen the cost already to our Exchequer. <Col N="895" /> None of us should encourage any further process in that direction.</P>
    <P>As some other speakers have said, there appears to be a perception of this Bill as being anti-consumer.  Bearing in mind the tremendous tax burdens imposed on people already perhaps this will be seen as an insensitive method of covering a loophole, the last people to be considered, in the public perception, the poor consumer.  In saying &ldquo;poor&rdquo; I use the word in the context of high air travel costs at present prevailing to and from Ireland.</P>
    <P>I know that Aer Lingus, the national airline, would be concerned with the protection of employment within the company. I would call for some kind of consultation, as has been called for by other Deputies, with regard to cost effectiveness <i>vis-à-vis</i> our national airline.  We must remember the skills of people, such as travel agents in not only running their agencies and maintaining the numbers employed by them but actually increasing them.  We must not sacrifice the protection of employment in one area to the detriment of another.</P>
    <P>We have been told consistently of the problems that agriculture, our greatest resource, has run into and the the tremendous pressures to which it has been subjected in these recessionary times, that there is need for tremendously increased productivity so that that industry may achieve its potential.  We are reminded constantly that running edge to edge with that is our tourist industry which, with proper supports and incentives, could be our next greatest resource.</P>
    <P>Neither the Bill nor this debate does anything to increase perception abroad that we are serious about reducing air travel costs to this country, about which we must think seriously.  I am glad that we are taking Second Stage only today because much thought, discussion and consultation must take place with various interest groups before we come to Committee Stage.  Let us concentrate the minds of Members of the House on the fundamental issues raised in this Bill.  By the time we reach Committee Stage, hopefully the consultations sought with <Col N="896" /> Aer Lingus and all the other people working in the travel business will have taken place so that we may be able to bring home the harsh reality that there is no way in which a competitive tourist industry, or even the protection of consumer rights or best deal for the consumer can be achieved unless we all recognise that what is needed is cost effectiveness, the elimination of wastage, with competitive air fares obtaining, enabling us to compete with the rest of Europe and the world.</P>
    <P>I hope this debate will continue outside the House where we must be aware of and sensitive to the advice and indeed solutions offered by other interest groups.  We gave a commitment, on entering Government, that all our semi-State companies would be examined closely with regard to their giving the best value for money and eliminating every possible wastage.  Certainly we shall be asking Aer Lingus to do so because that is what this discussion has raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon) Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Wilson and several other Deputies have raised the question of the time table involved in the introduction of this Bill. Deputy Flynn, colourful to the last, spoke of sneaking it in in the run-up to the recess.  I want to make it very clear that the Supreme Court delivered their judgment on 2 May last, not in April as indicated by some speakers.  Anybody familiar with the introduction of legislation will realise the various consultations the Minister had to have with the Attorney General, with his legal advisers, with the draftsmen, so that getting the Bill on to the floor of the House even at this late stage is quite an achievement.  It was felt prudent that it be introduced at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies commented that the Department were using what was described as the big stick or excessive measures against airlines or agents.  This was the point made by Deputy O'Malley and I think also by Deputy Flynn.  As far as we are concerned there is absolutely no wish to engage in confrontation of any kind with individuals involved in these enterprises over this issue.  I should say <Col N="897" /> that it was only after very extensive consultation had failed to resolve the matter that the Minister found it necessary to have recourse to the courts in order to uphold the generally accepted interpretation of the 1965 Act which has worn for a long time and been generally accepted. Airlines for the past 20 years have accepted that their duty was to ensure that those fares approved by Ministers prevailed in the market place.  That has been the situation which has failed now in one specific case.  The provisions of the Bill seek only to confirm the position by placing a specific legal onus on airlines and agents to sell approved fares. Ireland, in common with other States, must retain the right to act in the national interest; that will be the main effect of the provisions of this Bill.  Deputy R. Burke said that where necessary the national airline should act in the national interest and they must be able to do so effectively.  Those are the implications of the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The observations of all Deputies followed a number of main streams, one of which being the perception that this Bill was anti-competitive or, if you like, anti-consumer.  There has been a degree of misrepresentation, or perhaps representation of one side of the case only, over the past couple of days.  Deputy Burke referred to this also.  The Bill is no more restrictive in its provisions than the corresponding control available to other aviation administrations.</P>
    <P>As I said in my opening speech, Government control of air fares is the accepted norm that applies even in the case of administrations which are to the fore in advocating liberalisation.  That goes as far as the fares are concerned from the carrier and as applied by the agents, or intermediaries as they are called, in certain states.  It applies in states like the UK and the Netherlands which were refered to as introducing very low fares in recent times.  The control still exists with the Governments of those countries.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the Bill grants the Minister for Communications discretionery powers to require airlines to submit tariff proposals and to exercise control over air <Col N="898" /> fares.  As a general rule the focus of all these regulatory actions by successive Ministers for Communications &mdash; Deputy Wilson has been in that position &mdash; has been limited to scheduled services.  In other words, the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1965, has not been used to determine charter fare levels in the marketplace and no change in this position is foreseen at present.  The House will appreciate that charter services play a significant role in providing low-priced holiday packages for the public.  In respect of the scheduled air services it would not be the Minister's intention to use the Bill to prop up inefficient airline operation or to sustain unnecessarily high air fares.  Similarly, he does not envisage using the Bill unduly to prevent airlines and travel agents from competing for business.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my opening speech, all the Bill seeks to ensure is that once an airline has received approval for its air fare proposals then it will stick to selling at that approved level both directly and through the intermediaries such as the travel agents.  The primary objective in exercising powers in respect of scheduled air services under the Bill will be to ensure that the public have available the lowest possible economic fares consistent with market stability and the maintenance of a wide range of direct scheduled services to and from Ireland. Any instability in the market or excessive competition, where some of the major airlines now serving here might find themselves in a non-profit situation, could be very counterproductive as far as the availability of services to this country is concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson asked, very fairly and pertinently, if the Minister would approve of the fares under dispute if they were now submitted to him for approval. The Minister did approve fares with the airline involved and it is the breakdown of this approval that has led to the present unsatisfactory situation.  Deputy Coveney asked the same question in another way.  The answer is that all fares submitted by any airlines will have to be examined on their merits.  They will have to take into account the implications for all <Col N="899" /> sorts of travellers, discretionery travellers, the tourist, the business traveller and the whole area, and also the interest of the national carrier and other carriers serving the market.  All of these would have to be considered.  Indeed, consultations would have to take place.  Therefore, I cannot give an answer to the Deputies on that and I do not think that anyone could.  The breakdown of agreed fares has led to the difficulty that now exists.  Remember that the system operating has operated satisfactorily for over 20 years but consultation in this case has failed to get a proper answer and that is why court action ensued and why the Bill is now ensuing.</P>
    <P>I must reiterate the points I made in my opening remarks, namely, that the Bill is not biased in favour of either high or low prices.  All states, I repeat, including Britain and the Netherlands, retain the power of regulation over their air fares.  It is not the intention of the Minister to use the Bill to maintain artificially high air fares or inefficient airline operations. This has never been the case.  On a positive note, I would point out that in these negotiations, as Deputy Wilson knows, the Bill does not restrict or confine to any one fare level the tariff that may be approved by the Minister.  Also, as I have indicated, I am prepared to examine on their merits whatever tariff proposals will be submitted by the airline. Therefore, there is the extra implication that the Bill can be exercised in a very liberal manner to modify proposals brought forward, including bringing about fare reductions in particular circumstances. The Minister may choose as he sees fit in particular circumstances to take either approach &mdash; in other words, examine on its merits.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable discussion by Deputies about the fact that air fares are too high.  I think Deputy Wilson said that the natural inclination of all of us is to say &ldquo;To hell with the regulations as long as we get the cheapest possible fare&rdquo;.  That is a very natural reaction especially in modern times and times of economic stringency for us personally as well as for the country as a whole.  Concern <Col N="900" /> was expressed at the prevailing level of air fares from Ireland.  In answer to these criticisms I will take some concrete examples.  While fares are or appear to be high we should have concrete examples of comparison before us, taking first of all the trans-Atlantic market.  One of the major objectives of the Minister for Communications is to ensure maximum growth of the tourist traffic from North America.  This requires regular and reliable services at fares which are competitive with our main rival market.  Of course, London is the major gateway as far as travelling to North America is concerned and it is highly desirable therefore that the price differential in favour of travel to Ireland should exist in the interest of the Irish tourist industry <i>vis-à-vis</i> London.  For this summer the generally prevailing promotional return fares from New York to London on the main trunk airlines &mdash; British Airways, Pan-Am and TWA &mdash; are in the region of $614 to $669. Corresponding fares for the New York-Shannon route are in the region of $499 to $549 with charter levels as low as $399 eastbound.  It will be seen, therefore, that the fares to Ireland on scheduled services are more than $100 below the New York-London rates with charter fares available at rates of a further $100 below these levels.  A similar differential is enjoyed by travellers from Ireland to the US.  Services such as those provided by the People Express, which gets all of the publicity, on the Newark-London route attract a great deal of publicity because of the low return fare, $318 eastbound and £Stg.283 westbound.  However, it must be borne in mind that these services account for just a tiny fraction of the US-UK traffic and the scale of the People Express operation is very limited on the insistence of the UK Government.  In other words, it cannot have total expansion. It is very limited and confined.</P>
    <P>Within Europe itself we have much criticism.  Indeed, I have voiced it myself very often in the past and I recall doing a television programme some years ago about the cost of the Dublin-London flights, and I must be honest about that. On a rate per mile basis London-Düsseldorf, <Col N="901" /> London-Paris and Paris-Geneva, to mention three, are dearer than is the Dublin-London flight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>What about Amsterdam?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  Obviously it does not compare at all with the Amsterdam example given by Deputy O'Malley, but the fact remains that some routes are dearer.  Obviously others are very cheap. Given the multiplicity of European routes that exist, generally fares to and from Ireland are not out of line with those prevailing elsewhere in Europe.</P>
      <P>Comparisons have also been drawn at the level of intra-European fares <i>vis-à-vis</i> the levels prevailing domestically within the US.  The EEC has been quoted here. The recent memorandum on EEC aviation policy by the Commission, which has been quoted on the other side in the course of this debate, acknowledges that the level of air fares in Europe is frequently criticised and compared unfavourably with those in the US and the North Atlantic.  Having studied the matter, the Commission concludes that in most cases fare levels within Europe are not unreasonably related to costs.  This is a significant finding from an independent and objective body like the EEC Commission which has been concerned to promote lower fares, as we all know.  They have acknowledged that costs bearing on the airlines in Europe are higher than those obtaining in the US and that many of those costs, such as fuel, are beyond airline control.</P>
      <P>In order to increase competition among airlines with a view to reducing costs the Commission suggests in its memorandum some liberalisation of the European air transport arrangements as a means of securing lower air fares in the future.  Ireland will be actively participating in discussions on the Commission memorandum in the coming months when during our Presidency of the EEC we will chair Community examination of this memorandum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only fair in the general context to read a brief extract from the May issue of <i>In-Flight</i> magazine.  This refers to competition and the fact that there are so many states operating their airlines in <Col N="902" /> Europe.  It is stated that each of these nations will fight to the death for its right to maintain a healthy national airline or even several healthy home-based airlines. It poses the question that if completely unrestricted competition were allowed in the EEC, how long could Aer Lingus, for example, survive against Lufthansa and makes the point that Aer Lingus has a doorstep population of fewer than 4 million against 60 million in West Germany while Dublin is not exactly the industrial centre or the travel crossroads that Frankfurt is.  That is a fair statement that puts into perspective the very serious task so far as our national airline is concerned.</P>
    <P>A number of statements made appear to suggest less than a full knowledge of the competitive situation in Ireland both in respect of the trans-Atlantic and European routes.  There is a suggestion that we are involved in monopolistic tendencies or in protectionist principles and that there is no competition in operation. That is a serious misunderstanding of the position.  On the North Atlantic routes to Ireland there is no formal limitation on the number of American carriers who may be designated to serve the market, though the economics of trans-Atlantic operations impose their own constraints. At present there are two US airlines operating scheduled services to Ireland &mdash; Northwest Orient and Transamerica &mdash; in addition to the services provided by Aer Lingus.  During the summer period the services of these airlines are supplemented by a large number of charter services provided by three non-scheduled operators.  Far from being restricted, the North American market is probably the most competitive in the world.  This has been illustrated by the fact that a number of US carriers who previously served Ireland withdrew services entirely a few years ago and I need hardly remind the House of recent failures by large carriers on both sides of the Atlantic.  Deputy Wilson has referred to the collapse of many airlines on both sides of the Atlantic.</P>
    <P>The cross-channel and European markets also have a degree of competition greater than is represented by many observers of the scene.  It may not be <Col N="903" /> realised generally that the provision of services between Ireland and the UK is not confined to the well-known operators like Aer Lingus, British Airways and Danair.  There are a total of eight airlines serving cross-channel routes.  In the course of recent years as many as 12 carriers have been involved in Ireland-UK operations.  Unfortunately, many of these were unable to survive on the routes and eventually withdrew services.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered also that the cross channel airlines are subject to very severe competition from surface transport. The network of ferry services operating at very attractive rates are taking an increasing share of cross-channel traffic and represent a counterbalance against excessive fares.  We have, I am glad to say, a very healthy degree of competition.</P>
    <P>While experience has shown that excessive competition involving the dumping of spare capacity at uneconomic rates can destabilise the industry and acts in the long run against the consumer interest, it is clear that a judicious degree of competition can have a salutary effect in promoting efficiency and cost reduction as well as stimulating the market. Deputy Wilson said he welcomed very much the level of competition and did not favour any airline being cossetted to such an extent that it became flabby.  In the context of this Bill it is only right to point out that the Minister for Communications has demonstrated his commitment to stimulating competition on the market by breaking new ground in the allocation of routes to independent airlines both on internal and cross-channel routes.  The collapse of one independent Irish carrier and the significant curtailment of services by another represented an unfortunate setback to that policy and a loss or reduction of service to certain communities.  At the Minister's request Aer Lingus have partially filled the gap at least for the current season but the Minister remains receptive to applications for the provision of internal and commuter type operations from Irish aviation interests.</P>
    <P>I think I have demonstrated that the <Col N="904" /> policy of the Minister and of the Department has not been anti-competitive.  The problems in the air transport sphere arise from a variety of economic reasons and it is facile to suggest that they can be magically resolved by a <i>laissez faire</i> policy. A degree of regulatory action combined with an efficient and commercial approach represents the best balance. That is the approach on which the Bill is based totally.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to a certain ECAC document.  I do not have the document but I listened carefully to what he said and I think he may be under some misapprehension on this point.</P>
    <P>Existing bilateral agreements and arrangements provide normally for the approval by both states of fare proposals on scheduled services.  Therefore, each state exercises a veto over the level of fares that may be applied to or from its territory.  Consequently the question of extra-territorial jurisdiction does not arise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson, and many other Deputies too, referred to the US policy on deregulation within the US domestic market.  But they retain control as far as international travel is concerned, precisely as we maintain such control, that is, control so far as the carrier are concerned and also the possible intermediary sellers of their tickets.</P>
    <P>A study just published by the Civil Aviation Authority in the UK, who have been examining the effect of deregulation in the US, is of interest.  Their first conclusion indicated a wide divergence in the effects of deregulation in the US.  The UK study acknowledges that deregulation has increased both the scope and the intensity of competition.  However, within the overall conditions the effect on users, both in terms of price and of service quality, has varied enormously from city to city and from route to route. As one would expect, the trunk routes have experienced some reduction in fares, substantial reductions in some cases, while on the less competitive routes normal fares have increased sharply.</P>
    <P>The range of promotional fares has become much more restrained and some <Col N="905" /> services have been discontinued, but there has been a considerable internal reorganisation of activity.  Many of the airlines have now moved into a different type of operation which is known as the hub and wheel operation and which is better known in this part of the world in the context of packages or goods carried, where one of the operators would establish a central hub that all would fly into and operate out of.  I do not think that could be of benefit to many areas although I have no doubt that it would be greatly of benefit to the air companies. Deregulation cannot be a panacea for everything.  The UK experience has shown this.</P>
    <P>Taking a broader view, we must realise that there are 20 major airlines operating in the US with 50 smaller airlines and up to 100 other carriers.  The collapse of one or two such airlines would not adversely affect the scale of internal activities in the US.  The situation here is vastly different. Each European state normally has only one or two airlines and would be anxious to safeguard them in the national interest. They would set their face firmly against the collapse of a national carrier.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey referred to the volume of US charter traffic into Ireland.  The volume of traffic approved by the Minister from the US to Ireland is 50 per cent up on 1983 <i>vis-à-vis</i> traffic from New York and Boston in the peak June to September period.  I am satisfied there will be adequate capacity to cater for the volume of traffic.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley made comparisons with certain low fares available on domestic routes.  I dealt with those earlier in reply to a point raised by Deputy Wilson. We can never aspire to organise our affairs as they have in America.  In Europe, there are over 20 sovereign states each with its own national carrier and with a specific interest in protecting its carrier.  Comparisons with the United States are not valid.  Carriers coming into Ireland whether through Shannon, Cork or Dublin are only interested in making profit.  We must ask whether we could rely on foreign carriers to provide year round service into Ireland.  Would areas like Cork and Shannon be abandoned by <Col N="906" /> foreign carriers if we had a free for all? These are the points which must be taken into consideration.  They are often overlooked in the national concern to have the lowest possible air fare.</P>
    <P>It is too simplistic to argue that the measure we are introducing is anti-consumer or anti-social.  Ireland and our national carrier are only one element in the European and global air transport network.  Neither Ireland nor Aer Lingus acting alone are in a position to bring about benefits for the consumer of the kind mentioned by various speakers.  We can only move in concert with other states with whom we have bilateral arrangements. To do so would be to abandon the national carrier and the Irish consumer to the whims of an unpredictable foreign service.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies, including Deputy Skelly, commented on the penalty provisions in the Bill.  These were worked out in consultation with our legal advisers but I am prepared to consider the comments made and will look again at these provisions.  Deputy Flynn referred to the possibility that certain aspects of the Bill could be regarded as unconstitutional, and he specified some of them.  The Bill has been looked at by the office of the Attorney General and they are satisfied that the provisions are constitutional.  If I were asked for a choice I would come down in favour of the Attorney General's opinion as distinct from Deputy Flynn's although he might deliver his opinion in more colourful language than the Attorney General as a legal expert would choose to do.</P>
    <P>Deputy Skelly raised the need for the Irish flag carrier on the North Atlantic service.  There is no question about that. Deputy Burke raised it earlier in a trenchant fashion and described clearly how the national interest was involved.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley compared the low fare on the London-Amsterdam route at £49 with the Dublin-London fare.  I do not know if that is £ sterling or IR£.  It must be pointed out that the £49 fare is a one way fare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="907" />
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, it is not a return fare.  On a round trip basis the fare is £98 sterling which is equivalent to about IR£125.  The equivalent Dublin-London fare is IR£157 with lower Apex fares of £105.  I am glad to be able to put that into perspective.  The public interest requires protection against excessively high fares involving the exploitation of a dominant position.  That is accepted.  They also require protection against increasingly low fares which could constitute dumping.  That would create difficulty for the regular services.</P>
      <P>All governments recognise the importance of air service as a tool of economic and social development.  Many states own and operate a national carrier because of the widespread belief that they should not depend on foreign airlines to provide the necessary access to and from their neighbours.</P>
      <P>Ireland, too, has a national airline which has served us well in the past and which currently provides us with a good range of air services to the US, Europe and the UK.  Indeed, Aer Lingus has a significant market share which it has earned because of its sustained and comprehensive commitment to that market. In order to maintain economic operation of existing services, airlines must be able to obtain a reasonable return.  While this has not always been possible in recent years, most airlines are making considerable efforts to cut costs and improve productivity. As a result many airlines, including Aer Lingus, are now showing improved performance after years of heavy losses.</P>
      <P>Many carriers, however, still reflect the serious losses already incurred.  The problem of fleet renewal or replacement which will face the airline industry during the coming decade represents a serious challenge for the future.  The industry will need a period of sustained profitable performance if it is to retain its capacity to serve the travelling public and the needs of business and tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland, the Government's ability to exercise control over air fares was curtailed in the recent court decision referred to earlier.  While a definitive judgment in the matter would not have <Col N="908" /> been available for possibly another year, the effect of the decision was that while the 1965 Act continued to apply to airlines sales to the public, no similar controls applied in respect of sales by travel agents.  Apart from the anomaly which this created, a considerable potential existed that excessive competition, leading to market instability, would arise as a result of airlines being prepared to condone, if not actively encourage, their agents to exploit this legal loophole.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding any short-term benefit that could ensue for the consumer from the sale of air fares at levels below those approved, the Government considered for sound reasons that it was highly desirable to confirm the right of the Minister for Communications to control air fares. In the first instance, airlines with worldwide networks and enjoying economies of a scale not available to small and basically short-haul operators like Aer Lingus could exploit the loophole through cut-price and cross-subsidised fares in order to improve their market share or cream off peak period traffic.</P>
    <P>That is something which was referred to by both Deputy Wilson and Deputy Burke in their contributions.  The services provided by foreign carriers are welcome and, indeed, are an essential part of our access transport and our tourism system, but experience has shown that undue dependence on external airlines for regular services, particularly outside those peak periods referred to, would be very imprudent.</P>
    <P>Secondly, as a relatively small world carrier Aer Lingus, in meeting this competition head on could also suffer proportionately more than its bigger competitors on its main trunk routes.  Regard must also be had by the Government to the fact that Aer Lingus have reported significant financial losses in recent years. The Exchequer is not in a position to meet demands for further equity beyond the financial package already agreed by Government.  As I have already mentioned, significant profits must be earned by the company in future years to finance the high cost of fleet replacement towards the end of this decade.</P>
    <P>Finally, any excessive competition <Col N="909" /> over prolonged periods would reduce airline leads and endanger the maintenance by all airlines of the existing scheduled route networks serving Ireland.  This situation could be particularly serious for a year-round North Atlantic service.  May I say, and I did not mention it during the course of my remarks, excessive competition and price cutting could also create major difficulties for travel agents and lead to some further difficulties, as we had in other years.</P>

      <P>The operation for some of the companies in economic terms is marginal, given the low proportion of high yield business traffic on the route and the large volume of traffic in the peak summer, relative to the winter period.</P>
      <P>In summary, this measure was seen as essential in the national interest as a means of maintaining access for the needs of business and tourism to our main markets in the US and Europe.  I think that the debate has been very constructive and very important points have been raised.  It shows the deep interest aroused, and I am glad of that and I shall have benefited enormously from the points made, and make use of them.</P>

      <P>I quoted a sentence from the Minister's speech and said that I thought that was the nub of the whole matter.  Deputy Coveney agreed with me. The Minister answered this question, but in a certain way.  I am not saying that he was avoiding the issue, but would the Minister approve the fare in dispute, net or discount, if it came up to him?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or the original question, I said that as far as the situation was concerned this difficulty arose because a particular fare had been negotiated and <Col N="910" /> a loophole was found around it, operating through a travel agent.  If it were submitted now to the Minister, as regards what his reply would be, I cannot answer that in all honesty.  I said that a whole variety of things would have to be taken into consideration, including consultation with a number of people, as far as passengers are concerned, both business and discretionary travel, the tourism interest, all of these.  I cannot honestly say, Deputy.  I should like to be able to answer, but cannot say what the Minister's answer would be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £229,715,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December 1984 for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Defence, including <Col N="911" /> certain services administered by that Office, for the pay and expenses of the Defence Forces; and for payment of certain grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>The Defence Estimate for the year ending 31 December 1984 is for a net sum of £229,715,000 of which £172,572,000 or 75 per cent provides for pay and allowances. Provision has been made in the Estimate for increases in pay granted under the First and Second Phases of the Public Service Pay Agreement.</P>
    <P>The Estimate is based on an average strength of 1,537 officers, 90 cadets and 12,450 other ranks &mdash; a total of 14,077 in the Permanent Defence Force.  The net provisional outturn for 1983 amounted to £199,759,000 which included £3,529,000 charged to the Vote for Remuneration.</P>
    <P>The gross provision in the 1984 Estimate is £240,471,000 and represents an increase of 8 per cent on the 1983 outturn. It includes £67,899,000 for non-pay items.  The provision of £10,756,000 for appropriations-in-aid shows a reduction of £12,368,000 on the 1983 provisional outturn &mdash; mainly due to the fact that the balance remaining to be recovered from the EEC in respect of the fishery protection programme is £1.2 million compared to a sum of £12.759 million for 1983.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, considerable demands were made on the officers and men of the Defence Forces during the past 12 months particularly in relation to internal security matters.  While the Garda Síochána have primary responsibility for such matters the involvement of the Defence Forces in this field derives from their role of rendering aid to the civil power.  It is unfortunate that the present security situation in the country continues to necessitate the deployment of military personnel and resources on a large scale in providing assistance to the Garda Síochána in the maintenance of the rule of law.</P>
    <P>The need for the maintenance of strict security measures will be evidence to all having regard to the difficult situation which the State has faced in recent times. The Defence Forces have performed a very positive role in the security area in supporting the Garda Síochána in enforcing <Col N="912" /> the law of the land, principally in combating terrorism and preventing serious crime.  It is an unhappy fact of the times in which we live that members of the Defence Forces, and of the Garda Síochána, are placed in situations where their lives are at risk in upholding the law of the land.  In discharging their role of rendering aid to the civil power of the Defence Forces work in very close liaison with Garda and security arrangements are kept under constant review jointly by the Garda Síochána and the Army so as to ensure the optimum use of available resources in manpower and equipment. The Government are committed to giving the Garda and the Defence Forces every support in combating criminal and subversive activities.  All steps necessary will continue to be taken to strengthen the hand of our security forces in dealing with these problems.</P>
    <P>The preoccupation of the Defence Force with such matters has imposed a heavy burden on their personnel for some years past.  Some particulars of the scale of the security type duties in which the Defence Forces are currently involved have already been given to the House in relation to 1983, but it is well to repeat them in the context of the debate on the Estimate for Defence.</P>
    <P>Eighteen thousand military parties were supplied in Border areas for checkpoint duties and over 16,000 joint Garda/Army checkpoints were set up; more than 14,000 patrols were sent out into the road network along the Border or in other areas; escorts for explosives and blasting operations were provided on about 1,000 occasions; almost 3,000 escorts for the movement of cash were provided; about 100 requests for bomb disposal teams were handled.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces also provide guards for the movement of prisoners and assist in searches for arms, ammunition and explosives.  In addition certain vital non-military installations are protected either by permanent military guards or by military patrols.</P>
    <P>Particularly heavy demands were made on the Permanent Defence Force towards the end of 1983 arising from the participation of a very large number of <Col N="913" /> members in the joint Army/Garda search operation carried out in difficult and dangerous circumstances in the Ballinamore area.  Tragically an Army private and a recruit Garda were murdered during this operation.  It is appropriate here to pay tribute again to the memory of these young men.  I would also like to express my appreciation of the outstanding service rendered by members of the Defence Forces, and indeed by the Garda Síochána, in their efforts to combat the aggression which the community has had to face in recent times.</P>
    <P>Members of the Defence Forces are required to display courage and devotion to duty on a daily basis in carrying out their tasks.  The performance of the many facets of their duties and responsibilities demands a high level of dedication and integrity.  Such service is given willingly to the community by the Defence Forces and for the most part it is unspectacular and unsung.  Nevertheless the qualities I mention are vital to the wellbeing and morale of the Defence Forces and are deserving of our recognition, appreciation and encouragement.  At a time when credibility and confidence in our democratic institutions are under attack from all sides the men who, when the occasion demands it, put their lives on the line in the defence of our institutions and basic freedoms are surely fully entitled to our support and commendation.</P>
    <P>Following the murders of Private Kelly and Recruit Garda Sheehan a wave of anger and revulsion swept the country and loyal citizens expressed their antipathy to the Provisional I.R.A. and its front Provisional Sinn Féin in no uncertain terms.  Regrettably, however, those feelings quickly subsided and the old attitudes of, at best, complacency and, at worst, ambivalence began to manifest themselves.</P>
    <P>The most striking example of this was the selection by a leading white collar union of a Vice President of Provisional Sinn Féin as its Chief Executive shortly after the Sinn Féin congress which reaffirmed support for a policy of terror and murder, a policy which counts Private Kelly and Recruit Garda Sheehan among <Col N="914" /> its victims.  This selection by this union seems to me an inexplicable piece of moral blindness and even worse would have been unanimous but for the attitude of a Dublin branch of that union.</P>
    <P>Loyal citizens have a duty to show antipathy at all times and at every opportunity towards all who espouse the cause of murder and terror.  In contrast to antipathy there is complacency and the Provisionals interpret complacency as implied support for their evil cause.  I am constantly amazed by the complacent attitude of so many to such a great evil.</P>
    <P>General recruitment to the Permanent Defence Force was suspended early in 1982.  I am pleased to say, however, that, in addition to the usual recruitment of cadets and apprentices, there was an intake of 486 recruits &mdash; 330 for general service and 156 for the Naval Service in 1983.  Further intakes of recruits are expected to take place as necessary during 1984, the intention being to ensure that the strength of the Permanent Defence Force is kept at an adequate level.</P>
    <P>In 1983, as part of the Government's programme for achieving reductions in the level of public expenditure it was found necessary to suspend temporarily recruitment to the FCA and Slua Muirí and to reduce all annual training by seven days.  Having reviewed the matter, I am pleased to say that recruitment has resumed to the extent necessary to replace wastage during 1984.  Unfortunately, it has been found necessary to continue in 1984 the restriction imposed last year in regard to annual training. Notwithstanding the reduced period of annual training I have again decided that the gratuity payable to qualified members of the Reserve Defence Force who complete the maximum permissible period in 1984 will be at the full rates and not at the reduced rates which would normally apply in respect of attendance at training for the shorter period.</P>
    <P>The pay and conditions of the members of the Defence Forces continue to be maintained at a high standard.  All ranks received the increases due under the terms of the agreement on pay in the public service in 1983.  In addition, the <Col N="915" /> pay of all personnel, from private 2 Star up to and including the rank of commandant, have got the benefit of a 6 per cent arbitration award to some grades in the Civil Service.  The first phase of that increase &mdash; generally in the region of 2 per cent &mdash; was paid with effect from 1 October 1983; the second phase which provides for a further increase of about 2.5 per cent is due from 1 December next and the remaining balance will fall due for payment on 1 September 1985.</P>
    <P>The current rate of pay of a recruit is £110.96 a week rising after about 14 weeks' basic training to approximately £129.  On advancement to private 3 Star, which usually takes place during the first year of service, gross pay rises to £133.64, while after three year's service the gross pay of a private is over £145.  I am sure the House will agree that these rates of pay are reasonable by any standard.</P>
    <P>Allowances are payable to officers and men who perform duties of a security nature.  I am pleased to say that as a result of a recent review of these allowances, an increase of 21.5 per cent was granted with effect from 1 January 1984.  This increase brought the rates of allowance for service in the Border area to £18.55 a week for officers and £16.10 a week for men, while the allowances for other duties in aid of the civil power such as guard duties on vital installations, cash escorts, and prisoner escorts were increased to £7.90 for each week-day and £15.80 for each Sunday or Army holiday.</P>
    <P>I also had a review carried out of the rates of overseas allowances payable to personnel on service with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon and, arising from the review, an increase of 21.5 per cent with effect from 1 January 1983 was authorised.  The current rates of the allowance now range from £11.40 a day for single men to £18.55 a day for senior married officers.</P>
    <P>In addition, the rates of allowances payable to the relatively small number of personnel serving with the United Nations Peace-Keeping Force in Cyprus and the 20 or so military officers serving with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation in the Middle East <Col N="916" /> have been reviewed and increased.  The current rate of the UNTSO allowance is £8.50 per day and the UNFICYP allowance ranges from £4.40 per day for single men to £13.10 per day for senior married officers.</P>
    <P>This country has consistently supported the policy of the United Nations in regard to peace-keeping missions and we recognise fully the value of this policy. Our firm commitment to peace-keeping has been demonstrated by our participation in international peace-keeping missions for over a quarter of a century.  In undertaking peace-keeping missions it has always been our fundamental belief that the co-operation of the conflicting sides is essential to a satisfactory outcome to any such mission.  Any departure from this basic principle creates difficulties for peace-keeping forces and for the United Nations in reaching an equitable settlement to the particular dispute.</P>
    <P>It is important to recall that, before a contingent of Irish troops could be made available to serve with the United Nations Force in the Congo in 1960, new legislation was necessary to authorise, subject to the prior approval of the Dáil, the dispatch of contingents of the Permanent Defence Force for such service outside the country.  I think it should be emphasised that this legislation, under which contingents were subsequently made available for the United Nations Force in Cyprus and for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, provides for the dispatch of troops for the performance of duties of a police character only.  It will be readily understood that the role of our troops serving with United Nations Forces has been peace-keeping and not peace-enforcing.  That remains the position in the case of our troops currently serving with UNIFIL.</P>
    <P>At the present time an Irish contingent of 737 all ranks is serving with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon.  This force is commanded by an Irish Officer, Lieutenant-General William Callaghan, which in itself is an indication of the standing which our troops have with the United Nations.  An Irish contingent of eight personnel is serving in staff appointments with the United Nations Force in <Col N="917" /> Cyprus and 21 Irish officers are serving with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>Despite the unsettled situation in Lebanon, especially in the area around Beirut, I am glad to be able to report that the area of South Lebanon in which the Irish contingent is located is relatively calm.  The dedication and selfless efforts of our troops in the service of the UN are a credit to Ireland and to the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>This has been acknowledged on many occasions not alone by the Secretary-General but by the Lebanese people within the area of operations of the Force.  It is gratifying to be able to record that the presence of the Force has had a stabilising effect and that it has ensured to a great extent that the population within the area have been able to achieve a large degree of normality in their business dealings, schooling, agriculture and their life in general.</P>
    <P>During 1983 the Courts-Martial Appeals Act, 1983, was enacted.  This Act was a major reforming one in so far as the administration of military law is concerned.  The Act which established a new Courts-Martial Appeal Court to hear appeals against convictions and sentences of courts-martial became law on 29 June 1983.  Before that there was no provision in law for an appeal to a higher tribunal by persons convicted by courts-martial. In terms of status, constitution and powers, the new court is similar to the Court of Criminal Appeal.</P>
    <P>With a view to ensuring that the right of appeal being provided should be as meaningful as possible, provision was also included in the Courts-Martial Appeals Act for the introduction of a scheme of free legal aid at courts-martial and on appeal.  This scheme has been closely modelled on that already in operation for persons being tried by the civil courts on criminal charges.  Since the enactment of the Appeals Act, there has been a total of five cases appealed to the Courts-Martial Appeal Court.  Of these appeals, one was successful, three were dismissed and one was abandoned before hearing.</P>
    <P>The foregoing measures represent a <Col N="918" /> substantial reform of military law.  I should say also that proposals for further amendments of the Defence Act, 1954, are being actively pursued within my Department with the intention of introducing further legislation at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>As usual, competitions for the award of cadetships in the Army, Air Corps and Executive Branch of the Naval Service were held in 1983, and 40 cadetships were awarded.  A special competition for the award of cadetships in the Equitation School was held at the same time as the other competitions and four cadetships were awarded.</P>
    <P>Arrangements were made in 1981 to train deck cadets of the Naval Service in Ireland in future.  Prior to that, such cadets had to be assigned to courses abroad.  This training is undertaken initially at the Cadet School in the Curragh but mainly at the Naval Base and on board Naval Service vessels.  A number of instructors are provided by Cork Regional Technical College and UCC on a part-time basis.  Three cadets trained under this scheme were commissioned in 1983 and further nine are undergoing training at present.</P>
    <P>In 1978, a cadet scheme was introduced for the purpose of providing the Naval Service with qualified marine engineer officers.  Training under this scheme is undertaken for the first year at the Cadet School in the Curragh and at the Naval base.  The cadets are then assigned to a three-year Diploma Course in Marine Engineering at Cork Regional Technical College, followed later by a nine-month course of training in a British naval establishment. Fifteen officers have been commissioned under the scheme to date. Four of these completed the course of training in Britain in 1982.  It is expected that following necessary practical experience at sea and further study both in the Naval Service School and at the Regional Technical College in Cork these four officers will be fully qualified marine engineer officers by 1985, having secured their Watch-keeping and Naval Engineering Certificates.  A further five are undergoing their nine-month course in Britain at present, and the remaining six <Col N="919" /> officers will also be assigned to that course later.</P>
    <P>Following the 1983 competitions for the award of apprenticeships in the Army and Air Corps, a total of 103 apprenticeships were awarded.  The 1984 competition for the award of up to 107 apprenticeships attracted considerable interest following the advertisement in January last.  The findings of the interview boards should be available soon.  Arrangements to ensure that personnel of the Defence Forces can avail of the best possible educational and training facilities continued during the past year.  A total of 118 officers are undergoing various full-time courses at third level educational institutions.  A number of personnel attended courses in foreign military establishments to ensure that our Defence Forces keep up-to-date with modern developments elsewhere and to provide for the efficient maintenance and operation of the many sophisticated equipments in use in the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The scheme whereby personnel are registered with AnCO as apprentices in various trades and attend either full-time off-the-job training courses, day release courses or block release courses, continues to operate successfully.  These special educational and training arrangements are designed to supplement the constant day-to-day training that all personnel receive within their own corps or service or jointly with other corps or services.</P>
    <P>The non-pay provisions for this year total almost £68 million gross, and are required to maintain the capabilities of the Defence Forces and to meet commitments already entered into.</P>
    <P>Later this year will see the delivery to the Naval Service of the first new design helicopter carrying vessel &mdash; LE Eithne. Preliminary work on this project began in 1978 and the development of the new design commenced in 1979.  After the choice of hull design had been made, extensive tests using a model of the design were conducted to ensure that the design fulfilled all the specified criteria. My Department were assisted in this new development, not alone by a European design institute but also by the shipbuilders, <Col N="920" /> Verolme Cork Dockyard Ltd., and the Department's consultants, Irish Shipping Limited.  The contract for the ship was signed in April 1982.  This new addition to our fleet, which is a tribute to all concerned, will greatly enhance the surveillance capability of the Naval Service.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for stage payments for the five Dauphin helicopters ordered in December 1982 from the French aircraft manufacturer, Aerospatiale.  Two of these aircraft will be naval helicopters for use in conjunction with the new helicopter-carrying patrol vessel for the Naval Service.  The other three helicopters will enable a more effective search-and-rescue and air ambulance service to be provided.</P>
    <P>The Dauphin is a twin-engined helicopter with accommodation for up to ten persons, including the crew.  It has a fast cruise speed of over 150 knots and an endurance of about four and a half hours. The helicopter will have a rescue hoist and sophisticated radar and navigation equipment and will have the capability of flying at night and in periods of reduced visibility.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made for the balance of the cost of the new radar system on order for Casement aerodrome, Baldonnel, which is due for delivery later this year.  The new system will assist landings in conditions of reduced visibility and is part of a programme to modernise the aerodrome facilities at Baldonnel.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service has recently acquired a decompression chamber for use in connection with deep-sea diving. The service now trains its own diving unit, and the provision of a decompression chamber is an essential safety precaution where such training is being undertaken.  The use of the decompression chamber avoids the danger of an attack of the potentially fatal condition known as nitrogen narcosis, commonly called &ldquo;the bends&rdquo;.  The decompression chamber purchased for the Naval Service is of the portable type and can be fitted on board a naval vessel or transported by truck.</P>
    <P>Last year a new computerised marine training simulator was installed at the Naval Technical Training School, Haulbowline, <Col N="921" /> to meet the additional training demands on engineers and technicians for the modern patrol vessels.  The simulator makes it possible to simulate a wide variety of realistic fault situations and to monitor the trainee's reaction under pressure.  Exercises that would be hazardous for trainees on an operational ship can be undertaken safely using the simulator.</P>
    <P>As from 1 January last, my Department have been given responsibility for the purchase of clothing, transport, and certain communications and other items required by Government Departments. Prior to that date, this central purchasing function for Government Departments was discharged by the Stores Branch of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. Consequent on the abolition of that Department and the establishment of Bord Telecom Éireann and An Post, responsibility for these purchases has been transferred to my Department.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that in 1984 expenditure on these purchases will amount to more than £10 million.  Provision for this expenditure will be made in the Estimates of the various Departments for which the purchases are made.  However, a new provision of £550,000 has been made in Subhead GG of the Defence Estimate to provide working funds for the purchase of certain items which must be held as common stores in anticipation of Departments' requirements.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Estimate for buildings which includes new works, repairs, renewals and maintenance, is £5.3 million against an outturn last year of approximately £5 million.  Included in the provision is a sum of £3.2 million for new building works to improve accommodation and facilities for the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Improved accommodation for the single soldier continues to receive attention. New billets with central heating have been built in recent years at various locations and a programme for the improvement of older billets is continuing.  A contract was recently placed for a large new boiler at Collins Barracks, Dublin, to serve a central heating system already installed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="922" /> Work was recently completed on a major extension to the apprentices' hostel at Casement aerodrome.  A contract has been placed for major new works including a brigade headquarters and officers' mess at Gormanston Camp.  Further works at Casement aerodrome and at Gormanston Camp to meet the needs of the Air Corps are planned.</P>
    <P>The development of the Naval Service necessitates the provision of additional buildings and facilities.  The space required is not available on Haulbowline and, accordingly, it is planned to provide the buildings and facilities on Spike Island where a number of works are already in progress.</P>
    <P>Among the significant works recently completed is the new Army sports pavilion in the Phoenix Park.  This pavilion provides excellent facilities, including comfortable dressing rooms, showers and so on for games and sports.  New single officers' quarters are being built at Cathal Brugha Barracks.  The first phase of the project is nearing completion and tenders will shortly be invited for the next phase. Arrangements are being made for the provision of a new anti-tank range at the Glen of Imaal.  It is hoped to have work commenced later this year on the second stage of the construction of the new Ceannt Barracks at the Curragh Camp. This stage will comprise living accommodation for personnel of Command Headquarters Company, Curragh, and a new depot for the Signal Corps as well as office and storage accommodation.  It is proposed to arrange for the installation of aviation fuel tanks at a number of military posts to enable helicopters of the Air Corps to be refuelled at those posts. This will improve the operational effectiveness of the helicopters.</P>
    <P>The need has long been acknowledged to provide a new military post at Cavan to replace the present barracks, which is very old.  Considerable difficulties were experienced by the Department in acquiring a suitable site for the post but I am glad to say that such a site is now available.  A deed governing the transfer to the Department of the title to the site has been completed.  A certain amount of preliminary planning has already been <Col N="923" /> done, and now that the site is available, the necessary detailed plans, drawings, specifications and so on will be prepared.</P>
    <P>The building of married quarters for soldiers is a matter which is normally referred to in the debate on the Defence Estimate.  The provision of housing in this context is, as Deputies will be aware, primarily a matter for the local authorities and married soldiers have an equal claim on such housing with other members of the community in the same category.  It has, however, been the policy to supplement the efforts of local authorities where soldiers' housing needs are greatest.  In pursuance of that policy, some 346 new married quarters have been built at various locations over the years and planning has been carried out for the construction of new houses for married soldiers at the Curragh Camp, Collins Barracks, Cork and Stephen's Barracks, Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>With a view to the rehousing of families living in old married quarters at Arbour Hill, Dublin, my Department offered to make the site of these quarters available to Dublin Corporation for the building of additional houses, subject to conditions to be agreed.  This matter has been the subject of correspondence and discussion for some time and I am glad to say that agreement has now been reached with the corporation.  I propose to have consideration given to the question whether similar arrangements can be made in other areas where soldiers and their families are living in old married quarters.</P>
    <P>As I indicated when introducing the Estimate for my Department in 1983, I would question whether soldiers should be housed by the Department as a special group rather than be treated as citizens in the normal way and be provided with houses in the same fashion as other members of the community.  The system under which married quarters are allocated at present leads inevitably to the problem of the overholding of such quarters &mdash; a situation which arises when, on termination of military service, for example, the occupant of married quarters continues, with his family, in irregular <Col N="924" /> occupation of quarters.  At present well over 100 married quarters are overheld &mdash; many of them for several years past. The overholding problem has to be looked at in the context of whether the present system of providing houses specifically for soldiers should be ended in favour of some arrangement whereby their needs would be catered for other than in married quarters.  I would welcome any comments which Deputies have to offer on this matter.</P>
    <P>My Department have a long-standing involvement in equitation through the Army Equitation School.  The equitation school had another successful year in 1983.  The most encouraging aspect of the competitive performance of the riders and horses from the school has been the increase in the number of first prizes won in showjumping.  It means that there are hopeful signs that the task of finding replacements for horses such as &ldquo;Rockbarton&rdquo; will be successfully accomplished when these horses are no longer able to compete, which, hopefully, is still some way in the future.  Although &ldquo;Rockbarton&rdquo; is now 15 years old, he continues to be one of the world's great horses and was a winner at major competitions last year.  I am sure that riders and horses from the school will continue to enhance the reputation that they have already gained throughout the equestrian world. It is expected that Army riders and horses will participate in the Olympic Games in Los Angeles.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Asgard II&rdquo; completed her full programme of cruises planned for 1983, covering a total distance of over 10,500 miles.  About 600 people, including 361 boys and 192 girls, participated in the cruises.  A feature of the year was the increase in the number of young people from the inner city areas of Dublin and Limerick who availed of cruises.  This is a trend which Coiste An Asgard is taking steps to encourage.  Among the highlights of the 1983 season was the voyage of &ldquo;Asgard II&rdquo; right up to the heart of London which necessitated a rare opening of the Tower Bridge to allow the high masts of the vessel to pass through.  In June 1983 &ldquo;Asgard II&rdquo; made a visit to Copenhagen which coincided with the State visit <Col N="925" /> of the President to Denmark.  &ldquo;Asgard II&rdquo; was joined in Copenhagen by the Danish sail training vessel &ldquo;Georg Stage&rdquo; and the two vessels sailed in company for five days visiting a number of Danish ports and exchanging crew members.  The young people thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  Another highlight of 1983 was the Cutty Sark Race from Weymouth to St. Malo in August.  &ldquo;Asgard II&rdquo; acquitted herself well in finishing second in the square rigger class.</P>
    <P>A full programme of cruises on &ldquo;Asgard II&rdquo; is being undertaken again this year.  As usual, some of the cruises include visits to ports abroad.  At the invitation of the town of St. Malo the vessel recently visited St. Malo for a gathering of tall ships which took place there in celebration of the 450th anniversary of the voyage of Jacques Cartier from the port to Canada where he carried out the first exploration of the St. Lawrence.  The vessel will also be visiting Fécamp in Northern France for a sea festival to be held there on 30 June and 1 July 1984.</P>
    <P>In commenting on the provision for Civil Defence (Subhead G of the Estimate), I am conscious of the fact that Civil Defence and its main area of concern, the threat of nuclear warfare, have been very much in the news in recent months.  The terrifying power of these weapons, the technological advances which appear to threaten rather than support the delicate power balance and the failure of the superpowers to make any significant progress towards the prospect of a lasting peace have reawakened public fears about the nuclear threat.  Public concern as reflected in the press and on radio and television has raised two main issues &mdash; the need for a new initiative directed towards nuclear disarmament and the effectiveness of Civil Defence in the face of a threat of the magnitude of global nuclear warfare.  Let me reiterate that there is no conflict of interest between the objective of Civil Defence and the objective of nuclear disarmament. Indeed, these are complementary aims and successive Governments have recognised their obligation to maintain both a reasonable state of Civil Defence preparedness and a policy of useful intervention <Col N="926" /> towards the achievement of nuclear disarmament.</P>
    <P>The former is my particular responsibility as Minister for Defence.  To those who allege that in the event of nuclear war there is nothing Civil Defence can do I would say, first, that we are very well aware of the limitations which apply to Civil Defence response against the effects of nuclear weapons.  At or close to the point of a nuclear strike Civil Defence is almost meaningless.  We make no claim that our Civil Defence measures are designed to cope, or could cope, with such an eventuality.  We do claim that that eventuality is by no means a likely threat for this country and that civil defence policy is rightly directed towards preparing against the hazard of radioactive fallout.</P>
    <P>Against that hazard, there is a vital role to be played by Civil Defence &mdash; a role for which the State has no other agency in a position to respond.  How good the Civil Defence response might be would depend on a number of factors and one not to be overlooked is public perception of Civil Defence measures and the preparedness of the public to take the advised protective steps.  A certain amount of comment in the media has shown that there is cause for some disquiet in this regard; I would like to see a better dialogue towards establishing greater acceptance of relevant feasible Civil Defence measures.  Obviously, Deputies and representatives of other public bodies can play a very useful role in this direction and any such co-operation will be very much appreciated.</P>
    <P>We have never set out in this country to create an elaborate comprehensive Civil Defence structure.  I do not think it appropriate that we should do so or that our situation demands it.  The measures introduced have been influenced to some extent by our resources; more so, they have been influenced by what is feasible and relevant to the type of situation most likely to prevail.  Periodically, plans are reviewed and, if the current examination shows that areas which merit special attention could be strengthened by realistic improvement measures, every effort <Col N="927" /> will be made to initiate the required action without delay.</P>
    <P>The planning process of itself is not financially demanding and, if there are financial effects of any consequence resulting from the current examination of civil defence arrangements, they are unlikely to be felt within the present financial year.  This year's financial allocation of £1.5 million for Civil Defence is mainly required to provide for the customary grant-aiding of local authorities in respect of Civil Defence activities and the purchase and maintenance of training equipment and stores.  Provided for within the sum for equipment are the new radiation dose rate meters which are being manufactured at present in this country and the initial issue of the new style Civil Defence uniforms, distribution of which is in progress.  We are fortunate to have in Civil Defence such a fine expression of voluntary service to the community.  Preparedness against the risks of war is indeed their primary purpose but Civil Defence volunteers continually serve the community well in a wide variety of peacetime situations.  On behalf of the Government, I convey our appreciation and thanks and I include in this expression of gratitude the Irish Red Cross Society, the Order of Malta and the St. John Ambulance Brigade for their continuing co-operation with Civil Defence.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the Army Pensions Estimate for the year ending 31 December, 1984, which is for a net sum of £37,839,000.  The net provisional outturn for the year ended 31 December 1983 was £33,504,800.  The 1984 Estimate represents an increase of £4,334,200 or 13 per cent, on the 1983 outturn.</P>
    <P>The Estimate provides for the general increase in public service pensions effective from 1 July 1983 and the further increase in these pensions effective from 1 September 1983 by reference to the amount of the first phase increase in the public service pay agreement.  These increases, which applied during the latter part of 1983, apply, of course, to the full year 1984.  I am pleased to say, also, that in accordance with the decision of the <Col N="928" /> Government announced in this year's budget statement, pensions and allowances have been increased with effect from 1 February 1984 by reference to the amount of the second phase increase in the public service pay agreement.  Provision for this increase will be provided for in the Vote for Remuneration as required.</P>
    <P>The main increases in the Estimate in terms of overall cost are: £314,000 in subhead C &mdash; allowances and gratuities to dependants, and so on; £2,996,000 in subhead E1 &mdash; Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes and £610,000 in subhead K &mdash; grants in respect of the provision of free travel, electricity, bottled gas, television licences and telephone rental for veterans of the War of Independence.</P>
    <P>A token sum of £10 is provided in subhead J for compensation payable by way of lump sum to or in respect of members of the Defence Forces who served with the United Nations Force and who were killed or wounded or who died or were disabled as a result of disease contracted during such service.  It is customary to make provision for a token sum only as it is not possible to estimate the demand on the subhead.  Amounts paid are recoverable from the United Nations.</P>
    <P>As regards military service pensions, subhead D, and special allowances, subhead G, the numbers involved continue to decrease.  There are now less than 1,600 military service pensioners and about 3,500 special allowance holders on pay representing reductions of approximately 350 and 500, respectively, in the past year.  There is, however, a big increase in the number of widows of veterans of the War of Independence for whom provision is made under subhead C and an increase in the number of ex-members of the Defence Forces on retired pay and on pension for whom provision is made under subhead E.1. The total number of pensioners and allowance holders, accordingly, remains at approximately 20,000.</P>
    <P>I commend both Estimates to the favourable consideration of the House. I look forward to the debate and I will be <Col N="929" /> happy to supply any further information that Deputies may request in the course of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with the Minister in paying tribute to the Defence Forces and the Civil Defence.  I am sure that is an annual affair when the House is dealing with the Estimate.  It is often a case that it is only when members of the Defence Forces are in the front line and facing major difficulties we write and talk about them.  It is only right that we should express our gratitude to the Defence Forces for the job they are doing.  For many years the Defence Forces have been playing a major role in our security arrangements supportive of the civil power and on a daily basis.  The task is carried out quietly and efficiently and is a tribute to all those involved.  As the Minister pointed out it is a sad reflection on our society that because of the times in which we live and the overspill of the Northern Ireland problems the Army are involved in more daily duties. The Minister has outlined the massive patrols the Army are involved in, the many check-points they man along the Border, the dangerous work involved in escorting explosives and the escorts provided for the transport of large sums of money.  Those services are an indication of how the Army is used as a back up for the civil power.  In the last ten years the Army has been called upon to carry out such duties, and we are all aware that one member, Private Patrick Kelly, paid the supreme sacrifice in Ballinamore last December.  His death and that of Garda recruit Garry Sheehan, shocked the House and the country and brought home to us how the problems of vandalism, lawlessness and subversive activities have gripped the country.  I agree with the comments of the Minister as to how quickly such events are forgotten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Air Corps is identified in a special way for its humanitarian work whether it is on dangerous rescue missions, providing an air ambulance service or other activities.  Those activities are only a portion of the work of the Air Corps, who are also involved in a support role in the security field.  The acquisition of the new <Col N="930" /> French built helicopters will add greatly to the capabilities of the Air Corps.  They are long overdue.  These twin-engined helicopters capable of flying at night and in periods of reduced visibility will greatly enhance the Air Corps.  In search and rescue missions and the air ambulance service we should not forget that the machines, sophisticated and modern though they may be, are only as good as the men who fly them.  Time and again the Air Corps have achieved rescue successes in very hazardous conditions but always in a low profile manner which is characteristic of the Defence Forces in general.</P>
    <P>With the expansion of our exclusive sea fisheries area the Naval Service have to assume a wider range of responsibility. Those involved in that service, like our fishermen, often carried out their duties in weather conditions that would shock ordinary people.  An unpleasant feature of their work in recent years has been the task of dealing with the salmon fishing problem.  Anything the Minister, in consultation with the Minister for Fisheries, can do to sort out this dangerous problem would be more than welcome.  The arrival later this year of the new helicopter carrying vessel is eagerly awaited by the Naval Service.  In his reply the Minister should indicate if there are any more ships in prospect and how he sees the future.  The original intention was to acquire two ships of this type.</P>
    <P>In the region of 75 per cent of the Defence Estimate goes on pay and allowances. The total Estimate is for £230 million, which is not a large sum when one considers the number of people involved in the Defence Forces and the fact that tomorrow in a short period we will be voting through £90 million to pay off the debts of a semi-State company.  It often amazes me how little effort is put into examining public expenditure in certain areas.  It is amazing to think that a Department of State is being run for a sum which is double the amount a semi-State company has run up in debts.</P>
    <P>It is well to remember that there is no trade union involvement or representative bodies in the Defence Forces.  I accept that that is as it should be because <Col N="931" /> of the role the Defence Forces play, but it places a responsibility on the Minister to ensure that with regard to pay and related matters the Defence Forces are properly and adequately provided for.  I assume that the increases granted to the public service are passed on as a matter of course to the Defence Forces and that all allowances are up to date.  In the present economic climate it is not the best thing to suggest that substantial increases be granted, but I am sure the Minister will agree privately that the take home pay, bearing in mind the hours of duty of members of the Defence Forces, when compared to other public servants and those in the private sector is abysmal.  We must take into consideration the dedication and loyalty of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Minister dealt with the question of accommodation.  In my constituency a number of barracks are located and while architecturally those 17th and 18th century buildings are very interesting, they are not the type of accommodation for a modern Army.  It is nice to visit them and watch the soldiers carry out their drill but they are totally unsuitable as living quarters.</P>
    <P>An aspect which the Minister mentioned and which I deal with daily as a public representative is that of married quarters.  I have several times been involved with deputations to Dublin Corporation and directly to the Minister about the Arbour Hill married quarters. The arrangement which the Minister has worked out is very satisfactory and I would ask him to give some of the details when replying.  This arrangement could possibly be extended, with the co-operation of the corporation.  I agree with the Minister's point that it should not, perhaps, be the function of the Department of Defence to deal with people who should be on a housing list and it would be helpful if an alternative arrangement could be worked out with the local authorities.  For a number of years soldiers felt that they had to leave the Defence Forces in order to get local authority accommodation.  In that way they got some degree of priority but the arrangement ceased some years ago.  It is <Col N="932" /> an unfortunate problem which does not enhance the otherwise stable relationships in the Army.  It can be an embarrassing subject and it should be dealt with in other ways.  Perhaps the Arbour Hill development will be a headline for solving the problem in other areas.</P>
    <P>For almost three years regular recruitment to the Defence Forces and annual training for reservists have been almost eliminated, with the exceptions which the Minister mentioned.  The reasons are financial but in comparison with other Departments the Department of Defence cannot be accused of being an abuser of public money.  They are one of the Departments who try at all times to stay within the financial guidelines laid down. They may suffer for this.  The normal answer of other Departments when asked to cut some percentage points from their Estimates would be to think up one or two hair-raising things which would bring the nation to a standstill.  The Department of Defence look at it in a different way because of their training.  Successive Governments have reduced the overall numbers by several hundreds.  This is an easy way to save money in a Department which is disciplined, whereas in a Department which is not in control of its own finances because of inefficiency it would not be done.  It is wrong that a Department like Defence which has a relatively small Estimate should suffer as against abusers of public money or those who do not make an effort to stay within the guidelines laid down.</P>
    <P>During a time of limited recruitment priority should be given to people directly involved in the FCA or other elements of the Defence Forces.  This is only fair to people who give up their spare time to participate in the activities of the Defence Forces.  Those who spend a number of years becoming familiar with Army training and discipline should be rewarded and those who wish to take it up as a late vocation should be told that the positions are held.  I do not think it would breach any regulations of the public service because the screening of people joining the Defence Forces is far more important than an open competition.  People who have obtained knowledge and expertise <Col N="933" /> should get any positions which are available. I would ask the Minister to consider that point.</P>
    <P>I wish to associate myself with the great work being done by our Defence Forces under Lieutenant-General William Callaghan in the Lebanon and our other forces in the Middle East.  They have been excellent ambassadors over the past 25 years and the high reputation which they enjoy is richly deserved, based as it on the performance of officers and men in a number of locations throughout the world.  The fact that the area in which the Irish battalion in the Lebanon is located is an area of peace and stability in an otherwise strife-torn land is evidence of the worthwhile contribution which the Irish troops and other UN contingents are making.</P>
    <P>There were some signs over the weekend of a political breakthrough in the Lebanon.  A new agreement was announced by the Prime Minister designed to restructure the army and restore peace in Beirut.  There have been many initiatives designed to achieve peace but most of them have been all too transient.  Perhaps this one will be more successful.  Meantime our troops are engaged in the difficult task of peacekeepers, a task requiring skill, patience and diplomacy of a high order.  These are qualities our troops have shown in difficult circumstances at home and, more importantly, abroad where they have been given extremely difficult tasks.</P>
    <P>The Civil Defence is an area for which I had responsibility for a short time.  In the event of the unthinkable occurring, that is, a nuclear war, the ability of the Civil Defence to help will depend on how this country is affected.  In the event of nuclear fall-out the Civil Defence organisation could mean the difference between life and death for many thousands. While people generally have a major interest in nuclear disarmament, one of the criticisms levelled at Civil Defence relates to nuclear fall-out rather than other matters.  I commend the major overnight operation undertaken early this year by Civil Defence to show how effective they can be.  They have a tiny budget of £1.5 million.  Civil Defence <Col N="934" /> have proved over the years to be an extremely dedicated volunteer organisation.</P>
    <P>At times when people were unable to do things for themselves, because of laziness or otherwise, the Civil Defence people were able to help out.  We need only remember the dreadful weather of January 1982 when the Civil Defence, along with other voluntary groups, saved the country in a somewhat ludicrous situation. In the more dangerous, isolated locations the Civil Defence provided an excellent service, bringing their usefulness to the forefront of many people's minds, not least the Department of Defence who had advocated a saving of £1 million through the abolition of the Civil Defence.  Perhaps they were not then up the mountains, as were the Civil Defence people, or in any other isolated area; probably they were living in centrally-heated homes in nice areas. Had they been then in any of those isolated areas, they would not have brought forward such a silly suggestion.  I know the Minister will do the same as I did when I had the opportunity, tell the people in his Department to be somewhat more sensible and more logical.  The saving of £1 million through the proposed abolition of the Civil Defence was one such silly suggestion and evidently the best they could offer.  Certainly it demonstrates the mentality of some people.</P>
    <P>I presume the pension figures mentioned reflect the pension increases granted elsewhere in the public service, keeping pace with the pensions paid to public servants in general.  Presumably also any disability pensions attributable to the United Nations peacekeeping service are recoverable from that organisation and will not be a burden on our taxpayers.  It should be remembered that people in receipt of old IRA pensions have decreased in numbers over the years.  Bearing in mind the very small number now involved I would ask the Minister to continue to do everything possible to help that small band of people who continue to decline rapidly because of age.  It is at this late stage of their lives that such people deserve consideration and appreciation of the tremendous <Col N="935" /> service they rendered this State.  The figures involved are miniscule compared with those involved in the public service generally.  I do not think anybody would object to their being assisted.  It is perhaps primarily a matter for the Minister for Finance but they are not now a vociferous group; they cannot fight their own battle any longer but it should be remembered that they fought this nation's battle long enough.  In view of their very small number, they and their widows should be excluded from the general pattern of what is given to the public service because they constitute a case apart and are worthy of any assistance we can give them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the continued improvements at various barracks, a number of which the Minister mentioned in the course of his remarks.  I would underline also the importance of the Asgard II cruises because it is extremely difficult nowadays to find anything to occupy people in the inner city areas.  This week we have had the debate on the Misuse of Drugs Bill and before that a long debate on the Criminal Justice Bill.  While we realise that some people in the inner city are involved in crimes of one kind or another I, for one, would not condemn them because large numbers of them are deprived, suffer real poverty, are in need of assistance which is hard to come by. Any effort put in by anybody, whether in the public or private sector which helps to brighten their lives, making them feel they are part of society and not just a neglected and rejected lot &mdash; which they genuinely feel with some degree of justification &mdash; is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The House need only imagine somebody living in a small flat in the parish of Seán McDermott Street where there is 84 per cent unemployment, very few community facilities, a lack of interest being shown in the area by many authorities, somebody perhaps whose parents or older brothers or sisters are unemployed. The children in those areas do not look to this House with any great degree of hope.  In a small way the participation of individuals from the inner city in the Asgard II cruises helps brighten their lives in a way that would <Col N="936" /> not be necessary for people in more affluent areas who can well afford to provide such facilities for themselves.  Every Department, every area in the public and private sectors must do something to help these deprived people.  I congratulate the Minister in this regard and on the fact that he has said that he will endeavour to extend these services which will be of major importance.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been in public life sufficiently long to know that Bills such as the Criminal Justice Bill and others would not be necessary to the extent they are today were more such facilities provided. For example, children in those inner city areas would much prefer to be out on Asgard II cruises rather than joyriding in BMWs had they all the opportunity to avail of such amenities.  They are not all thugs and delinquents.  I am proud to know a large proportion of them.  Indeed the activities of this House would be rendered all the more realistic to them if they saw more action emanating therefrom rather than the many Bills passed which are not of much benefit to them except, perhaps, putting them out of circulation.</P>
    <P>I should like to place on the record my appreciation of the great work of the officials of the Minister's Department. They do a tremendous job in a somewhat difficult Department, not staffed in the way other Departments are.  They work in a conscientious way with a dedicated section of our community, the Defence Forces.  They do not spend much of their time on major disputes and, perhaps because of that, are not in the public eye as often as are other Departments.  But over the years they have shown their strength in a number of ways whether it was in the course of a petrol strike, refuse strike, incidents like the Ballinamore and other kidnapping cases and so on.  It must be said that the officials of the Department and the Defence Forces in a very quiet way have continued to uphold law and order here to an extent that might otherwise not have occurred.  In saying this I am not being critical of other sections of the security forces but it must be said with justification that the discipline <Col N="937" /> and organisation and dedication of the people who form part of our Defence Forces is beyond question.</P>
    <P>This always strikes one when one visits an army barracks or goes to a meeting involving people in the Department of Defence and sees how they conduct their business.  I do not suggest that the remainder of the country should start marching around but, even if we took three-quarters of a leaf from their book, this country might be a far better place in which to live, when there would be far less squabbling, more work done, far more done in the interests of the country and the community as a whole rather than as dictated by sectional misguided interests which so often happens.  Anybody who has worked in the Department of Defence and with the Defence Forces will know exactly what I mean.  Perhaps it would be a good exercise if the Minister were to organise guided tours for certain sections of the community to Army barracks, when perhaps such people would try somewhat harder when they returned to their own desks the following day.</P>
    <P>On behalf of my party I am glad to approve these two Estimates.  I wish the Minister and his officials continued success in the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. Barrett, Dún Laoghaire) Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. Barrett, Dún Laoghaire)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Dún Laoghaire</i>): My special concern in relation to the Department of Defence, namely Civil Defence, has already been commented on.  In particular the Minister for Defence has concentrated on the fundamental purpose for which Civil Defence was established.  He has adequately put into perspective the position of Civil Defence in the face of a remote but real threat of nuclear warfare and has outlined the thinking which underlies Government policy in this regard.  There is no need for me to amplify what the Minister has said about the primary role of the Civil Defence organisation, but I would like to give some additional attention to their very valuable secondary role which was adverted to by him in his concluding remarks regarding the current Civil Defence provisions.  I shall, therefore, <Col N="938" /> speak on the peacetime role of Civil Defence.</P>
      <P>A very noteworthy aspect of Civil Defence which is often overlooked is that they are a voluntary organisation.  The Civil Defence volunteer is a public-spirited citizen who devotes time and effort without any payment other than the service of his and her community.  In this important respect the Civil Defence volunteer is the same as anyone who serves without payment in charitable organisations or who engages in unpaid social work.  As a voluntary organisation Civil Defence give great value to the State.  I think the estimated cost is in the region of 50p per head of population.</P>
      <P>While the volunteer is imbued with the spirit of community service, good intentions, as we know, are of but little use unless accompanied by effective action. The volunteer is effective because he or she is well trained in a variety of useful skills.  As a member of any of the five Civil Defence services &mdash; warden, casualty, rescue, welfare and the auxiliary fire service &mdash; the trained volunteer would be capable of giving some assistance in almost all areas at peacetime accidents, natural disasters and emergencies. To ensure that he is not only trained but well trained and that his training keeps pace with the latest developments in techniques and technology, the volunteer has the backing of a very professional establishment in the Civil Defence School.  As we know, the Civil Defence School is located in the Phoenix Park and is a very practical complex combining a lecture theatre, classrooms, workshop, stores, offices, library and training ranges.  It is staffed by experienced and dedicated technical officers and instructors and has the back-up of up-to-date facilities for TV and video film production. I invite Deputies to visit the Civil Defence School, and if any arrangements need to be made for that I will be only too pleased to make them on behalf of the Deputies of this House.  I can guarantee that anybody who chooses to visit the Civil Defence School will be favourably impressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Civil Defence organisation is structured around the local authorities <Col N="939" /> with the county managers as county controllers. The great peacetime advantage of this is that the organisation can be brought into action quickly at the behest of the controller to meet local demands and emergencies.  Specially equipped county control centres are available from which relief work in disaster situations can be co-ordinated.  The organisation is held in high esteem by the local authorities, an esteem shared by all those who have had occasion to call on their services for whatever reason.  In referring to that point I would like to mention, as Deputy Ahern mentioned briefly, an attempt in the not too distant past of some journalist to imply that Civil Defence wardens in the event of fall-out or nuclear strike would get on their bicycles and cycle around the country.  That type of language, implying that Civil Defence were a backward group of individuals who had only bicycles at their disposal, does nothing to promote and encourage people to take part in voluntary organisations as the men and women in Civil Defence are doing.  I would like to put on record that I was unaware that such comments were being made on a programme of that nature.  Had I known that that was the type of programme we were about to face I would not have been agreeable to take part.  It is too easy for people to use the media on occasion to give the public the wrong impression of what a very dedicated group of people in Civil Defence are endeavouring to do.  It behoves all of us in public life who see attacks of this cynical nature on such voluntary organisations to speak out and say that we do not support this type of snide remark which is often made about many of our voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech made reference to the role that Civil Defence would have in the event of a terrible disaster occurring such as a nuclear war. The facilities in training we have given to the volunteers are designed to deal with fall-out.  None of us endeavoured at any time to pretend that if there was a direct strike in this country Civil Defence could solve all our problems.  It is highly unlikely that too many of us would be <Col N="940" /> around to find out.  We are preparing, as we must, our Civil Defence volunteers for, one would hope, the unlikely event of fall-out.  If it were to occur simple things can be done by the population, given proper direction and guidance by the trained personnel in Civil Defence, that could save numerous lives.  That is the type of organisation Civil Defence have been and will continue to be.</P>
    <P>In a society where it often seems that materialism increases daily while discipline and self-sacrifice decline the Civil Defence volunteer is a shining exception. Since their rebirth in the fifties the present organisation has trained perhaps 100,000 men and women.  It has offered no monetary reward and only hard work. It swallows up spare time and engages in activities which, though often exciting, are sometimes boring and occasionally dangerous.  Civil Defence confers no authoritative status as does Army or Garda service, yet with 40,000 members it equals both in strength.  All this is proof that Civil Defence in peacetime can tap a noble instinct to community service which is latent in mankind.  Many young people particularly feel dissatisfied and disillusioned in a materialistic world. They wish to help with society's problems but do not know how.  I urge these young people to join Civil Defence, who will train them well and give them a sense of belonging and an opportunity to help whenever disaster strikes their community. It will also instil a sense of discipline, as referred to by previous speakers.  Both the Army and Civil Defence instil into people a sense of discipline which in turn can only benefit the community at large.</P>
    <P>In the context of increasing youth involvement in Civil Defence, I hope shortly to arrange for the distribution to schools for inclusion in the civics curriculum for junior cycle pupils a new instructive package in Civil Defence.  With the support of the educational authorities, which I would like to acknowledge on behalf of the Department of Defence, I have no doubt that the package will receive a welcome reception and will be of mutual benefit to the Civil Defence organisation and the younger members of our society.  When one considers the <Col N="941" /> range of useful skills comprehended by Civil Defence training, the known commitment of Civil Defence volunteers and their willingness to help, one might ask if Civil Defence is being utilised in peacetime as much as it should.  There is greater scope for involvement of the service in peacetime.  Without greater involvement and expansion of the service the response that would be looked for from Civil Defence might not be quite adequate should we ever be unfortunate enough to experience an emergency beyond the historical level of peacetime disaster affecting this country.  Modern technology brings with it the risk of emergencies beyond the historic scale, and it would be imprudent not to give some thought to developing the peacetime back-up provided by Civil Defence in line with the changing situation.  I intend to initiate such consideration, and I will ensure that in the major review of the peacetime role of Civil Defence which I have in mind the views held by Civil Defence volunteers will be ascertained and borne in mind in any revision of policy.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I ask the Deputies to support and foster Civil Defence in their constituencies.  I am also very pleased indeed to add my thanks to the expressions of appreciation and gratitude in the Estimates statement of the Minister for Defence and of the Opposition spokesman, Deputy Ahern.  Tributes to those who have served Civil Defence have been frequently put on record.  From what I have seen since I came in closer contact with that great organisation I can confirm that the commendations are well deserved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Minister and with Deputy Ahern in paying tribute to our Defence Forces.  We have been very fortunate in that our Defence Forces have at all times supported the democratically-elected Government of the State.  That is something we seem to take for granted, but we do not pay sufficient tribute to these men who have served the State so loyally since its foundation. It behoves the Government of the day to give the best possible deal to the men and women of our Defence <Col N="942" /> Forces.  There are areas such as conditions of employment that I would be concerned about.  Also, as Deputy Ahern pointed out, the Defence Forces do not have trade unions to support them.  In those circumstances it falls to us as elected representatives to speak on behalf of these men and women.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to his remarks in 1983 when he questioned whether housing should be provided by the Department of Defence for members of the Defence Forces.  In the early days men were moved at short notice from post to post so there was a need to provide accommodation for them, but, I am concerned in particular about people who have served in the Army for 21 years and who find themselves at that stage without a home.  Those people are at a disadvantage in terms of local authority housing. There is a need for greater liaison between the Department of Defence and the Department of the Environment with a view to some preferential treatment being given to these people.  I am not suggesting that they be put ahead of families who have been on the list for three to four years but they should be given some consideration.  After living in married quarters for a number of years members sign on for local authority housing but are put at the end of the list. There are problems, too, in that families being housed by local authorities are housed in areas quite a distance removed from the area in which they had lived while in the Army.</P>
      <P>The witholding of grant payments until such time as the married quarters have been vacated is one that should be discontinued, because it imposes considerable hardship on the people concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there was limited recruitment during the year it involved recruitment to only one command.  I appreciate that there was a special case to be made in so far as the Eastern Command was concerned, but the problem is evident throughout the country.  This is resulting in commanding officers being put under strain and it is creating social problems for people in the Defence Forces.  There is a reluctance on the part of commanding officers to sanction transfers, because <Col N="943" /> once a command is depleted its strength may not be brought back up again.  I hope that there will be an even spread so far as any future recruitment is concerned and that recruitment will be on a quota basis to the various commands.</P>
    <P>There is reference, too, to consultancy fees.  The one area in which I would be critical of the Army, and it is in their best interest that I offer this criticism, is the area of public relations.  There is need for a much better public relations job to be undertaken on behalf of the Defence Forces.  To some people the Army seem remote and to children in particular the sight of soldiers on the street guarding banks and so on can be intimidating.  It is significant that at a recent careers exhibition in Cork the stand which proved the most popular was the one relating to the naval service.</P>
    <P>The recreation facilities that are available to the Defence Forces in the form of playing fields and so on should be made available to the public in cases where there is no possible danger to security. The Army have a lot of property which could be put at the disposal of youth clubs and organisations.</P>
    <P>The Minister refers to a token estimate of £10 under Subhead J.  This deals specifically with service with the UN.  In the event of a member contracting disease or being injured while serving with the UN he is paid a pension which in turn is recovered from the UN.  Consideration should be given also to any member who must terminate his service because of contracting some disease while in the service.  I know of one case where immense hardship was caused to a married man who was the father of a young family as a result of his having to leave the Defence Forces prematurely after contracting a disease that was not curable and from which therefore, he is likely to suffer for the remainder of his life.  In that sort of situation there should be an arrangement on the lines of that which applies to civil servants who have to leave the service before reaching the age of 60 because of ill health.  In such cases six years service are added for pension purposes. A person joining the Army signs <Col N="944" /> initially for a three-year period and then renews the contract for up to a 12-year period, but time served after the 12-year period should be allowable on a <i>pro rata</i> basis with full entitlement to pension. One case I have come across recently concerned a member who had served for 18 years but who by reason of dire family problems had to leave the force prematurely. He did not qualify for a pension. The Minister should give consideration to the aspect.</P>
    <P>I have received some complaints also regarding payment to members while they are serving with the UN.  There is the feeling that payment is not made in full in such cases, that what the UN pay to the Irish Government is not passed on to the serving officer.  I should like the Minister to clarify this point.</P>
    <P>There is the question, too, of the patrol vessel.  The helicopter ship will be coming into operation later in the year.  There is a need for a highly sophisticated vessel of that nature, but the cost involved seems to be outlandish.  People who are employed in the building of ships claim that two ships similar to the ones already in service could have been provided for the price of this one.  I appreciate that recent incidents off our coasts have made it necessary for us to improve our technology in this area.  These incidents involved our fishing fleets and lives were in danger.  There is need for greater surveillance. There is demand for a ship which will be capable of locating submarines which are intruding into our waters. However, the cost of the ship is way beyond what could be justified.</P>
    <P>In recent times we have become more aware of the role of the Defence Forces. It is regrettable that we cannot take on the number of people we require due to our financial position.  I do not advocate that we should use conscription as a means to solve our unemployment problem. The Defence Forces could become actively involved in the area of apprenticeship training.  There is a great demand for young people to enter the apprentice school in Naas.  Some of the money which has been allocated to other Departments for youth training should be transferred to the Department of Defence.  There <Col N="945" /> could be greater co-operation between AnCO and the Department of Defence. Once the recession is over there will be need for skilled people.  At present many young people are unable to complete their apprenticeships because so many companies are in liquidation.  The Army could play a useful role in this area and the Minister should consider this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a lot of money involved in this Estimate and 75 per cent of it is for pay and allowances.  The Estimate is for almost £230 million.  We have an excellent Army.  Their standard of discipline and contribution has been recognised worldwide.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could make a saving in the area of maintenance where a large number of civilians are employed. From my information it would seem that of all the people involved in the public service this group have the highest number of sick leave weeks each year.  There is need for a certain amount of maintenance in Army barracks but perhaps some saving could be made.</P>
      <P>It is vitally important that the Army is kept up to full strength and has the most modern equipment.  The House must provide the necessary finances to ensure that standards are maintained.  The turbulence and difficulties in our country, particularly in Northern Ireland, have contributed significantly to the large amount of money which is needed in this Estimate.  The cost of maintaining the Border and of keeping law and order is another factor.</P>
      <P>Our Army has a proud record of international contribution through the UN service.  Many members of our Defence Forces have given their lives in the cause of peace.  We must respect that.  We must ensure that the strength of the Defence Forces are kept up to give the type of service and security the nation requires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards unemployment there may be an opportunity for the Minister to consider some type of optional Army training for young people coming out of second level education.  They could perhaps do a year's training in the Army. Along with that they could do some kind of career training whether in the trades, <Col N="946" /> electronics and so on.  If there was consultation with AnCO there might be an opportunity for people to receive self-help which would help them to surmount the difficulties they would encounter in normal life.</P>
    <P>The Army has made a major contribution in the equestrian world.  We have always had outstanding Army show jumpers, horses and riders.  They have helped not only to display our traditions and culture but have focused world attention on the quality of our horses and horsemen.  The Army have done Ireland proud throughout the world in this area. I welcome the Estimate and would like the Minister to consider the points I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies who contributed to the debate for their constructive questions and helpful comments. A casual observer might say that because of the few Deputies who contributed there was not much thought of the Defence Forces.  That would be a mistaken impression.  The fact that the Defence Forces are non-controversial and have not provoked a large number of controversial speeches is a compliment to them and an indication that they are serving the nation satisfactorily.  That is the general public feeling about the Defence Forces.  It is one that they deserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Ahern and O'Sullivan made the point that there is no system of representation within the Defence Forces <i>á la</i> trade unions and representative bodies. There cannot be because it would be inconsistent with the nature of a disciplined force organised in a hierarchical fashion.  There are other forces which have such bodies.  The arguments for or against them in such forces is a matter for other people in other debates.  This debate concerns the permanent Defence Forces and I am satisfied there is no role for such representation within the Army. I am equally satisfied that because of that there is an unusual burden on the Minister for Defence of the day and on all Members of Parliament to be alert and sensitive to conditions in the Army and the grievances which Army personnel may have from time to time.  They must <Col N="947" /> be able to respond to this in a real way. If the Minister in question and Oireachtas Members are sensitive in that regard they will ensure that the demand for a representative body or the like will not emerge.  The members of the Defence Forces would not welcome any such development.  They had experience of it through their service with UNIFIL.  Some continental armies have trade unions within their ranks.  I spoke to our personnel when I visited Lebanon and asked them for their views on this subject.  They viewed the presence of trade unions among other UNIFIL contingents with amused amazement.  They had no sense of envy and did not want to see the like become part and parcel of the Irish Defence Forces.  I am satisfied that that was the genuine feeling.  As I say, a sense of amusement was the paramount feature of their reaction to this development. They, as good soldiers, thought it inconsistent with the military role and military experience.  Again, I take the point that because of that it is important that the Minister of the day and public representatives would be alert and in contact with members of the Defence Forces to ensure that all grievances are properly and legitimately aired and, more important, that they would be dealt with.</P>
    <P>One of the most important factors contributing towards a sense of wellbeing, satisfaction and good morale is to have good pay and conditions &mdash; especially good pay.  Deputy Ahern again mentioned this.  I should like to assure him and other Deputies that all the public service increases are, of course, automatically passed on to members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>I would draw the attention of the House to the fact that an extra £4½ million will be required from the Vote for remuneration in 1984, in addition to the £172,572,000 provided for pay in the main Estimate.  This is to cover extra increases in allowances which were not provided for in the Estimate.  These represent enhanced remuneration for officers and men of the Defence Forces. Over and above national pay agreements, certain special pay awards that <Col N="948" /> were granted to other categories have been applied to these forces.  I am glad that it was possible to do this.  It is an earnest of the Government's desire that the pay in the Defence Forces would be kept up to the best possible level.  We are also very concerned to ensure that allowances for extra duties in the security area would be kept under constant review.  As I indicated when opening the debate, significant increases have been made in those allowances during the year.</P>
    <P>I know that sometimes comparisons are made between the special allowances received by another uniformed force and the members of our Defence Forces and that it is felt that the balance is out of jig &mdash; that may well be.  There are historic reasons why the system has developed in that way.  The fact that it has so developed is not necessarily an argument for having both forces remunerated in exactly the same way.  That would just not be possible. What we must do is decide on a fair level and keep that level under constant review so far as the Defence Forces are concerned.  That is my continuing objective. I think we can safely say that the rate of pay and allowances is better than adequate.  I would consider it to be good.</P>
    <P>Certainly, the amount of interest shown by people who want to enter the Defence Forces would not be there if there were any public perception that the Defence Forces are underpaid or do not get proper allowances for the many duties which they have to perform.  As I say, pay is an important element in keeping up morale.  I am conscious of that and try to meet it in so far as possible within the general constraints of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Another matter that touches on conditions in the Army is the question of housing.  That has been adverted to by the Deputies who have spoken.  I am glad that Deputies share my view that housing is primarily a matter for local authorities and that it should not be felt necessary to house soldiers as an exceptional section of the community.  As Deputy O'Sullivan pointed out, the original need for married quarters &mdash; and these are all in existence since before the foundation of the State &mdash; arose due to the fact that in those days the military establishment then in this <Col N="949" /> country transferred regiments right around the world.  Of course, they had to have married quarters available for them whenever they were located in a new depot, barracks or station.  That was the original need for them.  Of course, in those days local authorities were not providing housing, in any event, on the same scale as they do nowadays.  That reason and need do not apply to our Defence Forces who, by and large, are stationed permanently for the duration of their service in the one location.  They can integrate and become part of the community and should be housed within the community by the local authority, or by themselves with the assistance of whatever State agencies are available for citizens generally.  That is the way it should be, and that would obviate this great problem of over-holding to which Deputy O'Sullivan referred.  It is a particular problem in that Deputy's area.</P>
    <P>We cannot twist the arm of the authorities to give us special preference.  I know that local authorities and their executive officers are sympathetic to the problems of soldiers finding themselves over-holding and do try to accommodate them. However, they are citizens competing with other citizens who have equally pressing housing needs.  It is a difficult situation, but I want to assure the House that it is one of which we are very conscious and we keep in close contact with the local authorities.</P>
    <P>With regard to the withholding of gratuities, this is done because people are over-holders and, as such, are in breach of contract.  When it is a question of a pension or a gratuity, both are not withheld. Generally, the pension is withheld and the gratuity paid.  People in that situation are not usually deprived of income because they would have their entitlements under other pension headings. Where the gratuity is withheld, in cases of hardship it has been my practice and that of my predecessors to release substantial amounts of the gratuity to enable any hardship to be met.  It is not a hard and fast rule but, on the other hand, the rule must be there because unless some pressure is put on over-holders they would be inclined to remain on in a house <Col N="950" /> which generally is available at a very low rent, indeed, and there is no incentive to move out.  We must be realistic about it and have to ensure that there is reasonable pressure on over-holders to move out.</P>
    <P>Behind the over-holder there is a serving soldier waiting to be accommodated. The serving man has to have preference since the houses were built for serving soldiers.  Again, a person may not move out because he might not like the accommodation that has been offered by the local authority.  As Deputy O'Sullivan pointed out, it may be in a wrong part of the city to suit his family obligations.  In other towns, it may be in a particular scheme which is not popular.  These are all difficulties which arise from the provision of married quarters.  They are all arguments in favour of ending the system, so that local authorities would provide soldiers' houses.  We are still engaged in building some married quarters because the need is so great and the resources of the local authorities are so limited that we have to supplement them. I envisage that as being an operation engaged in less and less frequently.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern asked with regard to Arbour Hill.  I do not know if I have all the information which he has in mind, but I understand that the agreement has now been made to transfer the site of the old quarters to the corporation.  It would be a nominal consideration which would be paid.  As part of the deal, the corporation are proceeding to rehouse the occupants of the old quarters and there are now only about 16 families left to be rehoused.  They will be rehoused by the corporation when that body take over the quarters and rebuild on that site.  There are two other old quarters at Arbour Hill which are separate from those being handed over.  They are occupied by two NCO's.  We have applied to the corporation to rehouse those two NCO's.  Perhaps Deputy Ahern could use his influence with the corporation to have that done, so as to make these two old quarters available, because they represent a security problem in relation to Arbour Hill Prison.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Naval Service and <Col N="951" /> its fisheries role, Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned that the vessel recently launched in Cork cost an amount which would have provided two vessels of a different design.  That is very possible.  Of course, one reason why it cost so much is that there were significant overruns due to technical advances in design.  I do not propose to go into the reasons for that now.  The type of vessel which was commissioned was deliberately designed of the size and sophistication eventually provided.  The requirements of the navy were to meet its enhanced role consequent on the new EEC fishing rules and the extension of the maritime jurisdiction with regard to fishing for the EEC countries. Having regard to the way the new fishing arrangements have settled down in the fishing areas within the 200-mile limit and the respect being shown to the limits by non-EEC countries we are satisfied that our present naval establishment, supplemented by this new offshore patrol vessel when it comes into commission, and with its helicopter carrying capacity, will be well able to fulfil our obligations under EEC regulations to patrol this fishery area.  We have agreement in that regard from Brussels.</P>
    <P>There is little controversy in regard to enforcing the fishery laws in the 200-mile zone generally where the people involved with our naval forces are non-citizens and non-EEC nationals.  Ironically and regrettably, the controversy arises through our own citizens being in serious breach of our fishing laws within the territorial waters.  Deputy Ahern suggested that I should sort out the problem with the Minister for Fisheries, but it is not a problem for me and the Minister for Fisheries to sort out.  The only problem is the failure of a certain small number of salmon fishermen to obey the law.  The law is quite clear as to how they can fish, when they should fish and with what type of equipment they should fish.  There is no difficulty about the law.  There is no problem in that regard.  It is their unwillingness to obey the law that has caused the problem.  I had hoped that, having seen the firm application and implementation of the law last year, the fishermen <Col N="952" /> would realise that the days of thumbing their nose at the fishing laws had come to an end and that this year we might have a more peaceful scene.</P>
    <P>I regret to say that as late as today off the south coast there were incidents where violence was used towards naval parties and the Garda involved.  I have to deprecate that in the strongest possible way.  I urge these fishermen to realise that the laws will have to be enforced and will be enforced, and that there is no profit for them or advantage in flouting the law. I appeal particularly to Deputies from maritime constituencies to use their influence to ensure that the incidents which occurred off the south coast will be isolated and will not be repeated.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to the men of the Naval Service for their dedication in assisting the civil power in this area, because it is not something they relish doing.  It is incidental to their duties but, when called on as members of the Defence Forces to come in aid of the civil power, they respond loyally.</P>
    <P>I welcome Deputy Ahern's remarks about the Asgard.  It was interesting to hear from a Deputy from the inner city about the value of having people from that part of the city availing of the facilities of the Asgard.  The committee who run the Asgard are anxious to expand.  I am glad to be able to say commercial firms are making sponsorship available so that more young people from that part of the city can be accommodated and spared the full cost of joining the ship. The Asgard is a most valuable experience.  I am happy that it will be available in an enhanced way for young people.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that I should thank those involved in running the Asgard and particularly the members of the committee who serve on a voluntary basis, and also thank the personnel from Irish Shipping who manage the vessel for us.  They give us a tremendous service, a service of a very high standard of efficiency.  Nothing is too much trouble for them.  Likewise the permanent crew deserve our thanks for making the cruises so successful and so popular.  That should be said.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Ahern <Col N="953" /> spoke of the need to bring the Army more to the people and suggested that the general public should be more aware of the high standards one finds in the Army.  On visits to Army installations, the neat and tidy appearance, the general air of calm discipline would be good therapy for many citizens in this troubled and untidy world.  Deputy O'Sullivan thought we should do more in public relations to enhance the image of the Army.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that there is a very good public perception of the Army and that people are proud of it.  Where they come in contact with soldiers, their perception of the Army is always enhanced.  In many ways the Army is engaged in coming out to the public.  For example, during the year, and particularly during the summer season, teams of gymnasts very often attend at summer fetes and shows.  The Army band is available as much as possible for recitals and for charity occasions, very often on a non-fee basis.  I must emphasise to Deputies that that is a limited service and for very special charities only.  For general shows a fee has to be charged to cover the cost.</P>
    <P>Within the operational demands on their time, the Air Corps try to make themselves available as well, with the helicopter and the fixed wing planes.  In various other ways Army personnel in their own areas can help by providing tentage and small things like that.  They are only too glad to help and they do help.  Of course the Army horses move around the country at various horse shows.  Our Army is small and it is not possible for it to be visible to the extent I or they would like in many places during the course of the year.  People who live as I do in a garrison town would have a higher appreciation and perception of the value of the Army.  The general public have a good appreciation of the value of the Army and its disciplined nature.</P>
    <P>In addition I should say for Deputy Ahern's information that the Army hold open days in some barracks around the country.  They are very popular.  For example, they had one in Mullingar and Kilkenny.  Open day in a barracks is probably particularly suitable where the barracks is situated in a town and the local <Col N="954" /> community can identify with the Army, and the numbers are controllable.  It is a good idea and I would like to see it expanded wherever possible, subject to security and being able to have the matter dealt with in an orderly way.</P>
    <P>Another matter mentioned was the question of numbers in the Army.  I and the Army authorities would like to see extra numbers recruited.  Deputy Treacy mentioned this in the context of an enhanced or expanded apprenticeship scheme.  He mentioned a year but a year would not really be long enough.  It would pose immense problems if it were to be expanded to the size Deputy Treacy and Deputy Barrett last year had in mind.  It would pose immense problems in terms of accommodation and equipment to train and the provision of instructors.</P>
    <P>If the Army apprenticeship training scheme were to be expanded, it would have to be phased and gradual.  I do not think it could be expanded on a sufficiently wide and dramatic scale to make an immediate impact on the level of unemployment or any such thing.  I should like to see it expanded and it is something I am giving thought to at the moment.  Possibly it would complement the question of civilian employees in Army barracks.  There was a traditional need for them in that they relieved soldiers from doing certain duties so that they could be available for operational military duties.  It is a matter that is being considered all the time.  There has been a reduction in the number of civilian employees.  Many of them have been there for many years and now we are looking at the balance between them and the military capacity to provide the services they are providing at the moment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the numbers in the Army, it is a balance between what the Exchequer can afford and the operational needs of the Army.  The Army authorities might feel the balance is a little tight against them in favour of the Exchequer but I am in between having to hold the ring.  I should like to see a little easing but the Exchequer position is very tight.  This year we are recruiting only to replace wastage as we did last year. <Col N="955" /> Deputy O'Sullivan pointed out that last year recruitment was confined to the Eastern and Curragh Commands.  The reason for that was there had been most serious wastage in units in those Commands and they were under-strength. This year recruitment is being spread equally between all Commands but it will be of a very limited kind.  It is a scene I am watching carefully and one on which I shall be advising the Government in the course of discussions on the Estimates for 1985.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern raised the question of pensioners and he asked that we might improve the pension entitlements of that dwindling number who fought in the War of Independence.  He asked that we be as generous as possible to them.  I sympathise with that point of view in respect of all pensioners who have served their country in some form.  They are entitled to the most generous approach possible. Again, we must pay attention to the straitened position of the Exchequer although for this year a practical improvement was made for all State pensioners when it was arranged that their pensions would be paid from the date of the National Pay Agreement rather than postpone them to the following July which had been the procedure.  That has meant an improvement in cash terms and it has removed a legitimate grievance because pensioners felt they were being discriminated against.  That should not happen because they are entitled to our thanks, having served their country in whatever capacity. It was a small earnest of the Government's concern and it is something that will be kept under review.</P>
    <P>Civil Defence was dealt with in considerable detail: I spoke about it, as did Deputy Ahern and Deputy Barrett, Minister of State, who has primary responsibility for that matter.  The common theme in all our speeches was that we were disappointed at the lack of public perception of the value and importance of Civil Defence.  People think about Civil Defence and they get a mental picture of nuclear holocaust, of the end, where nothing can be done.  As I pointed out in my speech, our Civil Defence arrangements <Col N="956" /> are not geared towards dealing with a direct strike because I doubt if any defence arrangements could deal with the consequences of a direct strike.  What they are geared to deal with is what is most likely to affect this country, namely, radioactive fall-out and an immense amount can be done to protect the population against the adverse consequences of radioactive fall-out.</P>
    <P>We will have to embark on a campaign of alterting the public to the advantages of Civil Defence and the protective measures that can be taken at comparatively little cost by citizens in their own homes. Certain elementary precautions can be taken so that in the event of a catastrophe happening and radioactive fall-out affecting this country we would be able to take simple protective steps that would save many lives.  That is possible in practical terms but we have to convince the public and get their support.  Deputies could do a valuable job in that regard by availing of any opportunity to spread that message. Even more so, they could do good work in identifying with Civil Defence in their own areas.  They could attend Civil Defence functions and exercises, thus letting the 40,000 Civil Defence members know that they are appreciated and that their work is valuable.  That is important and it is work that could be done by Deputies.</P>
    <P>The main emphasis during the debate in so far as the Defence Forces are concerned has been on their role as an aid to the civil power.  I mentioned their function of assisting in salmon protection and Deputy Ahern drew attention to their duties on the Border.  Generally speaking, the public perception of the Defence Forces is that their main operational role is in aid of the civil power.  However, the basic role is to defend our neutrality and to defend the country against external aggression of an armed kind.</P>
    <P>The capacity of our Defence Forces to do that compared, for example, with other traditionally neutral countries such as Sweden and Switzerland is limited. Our spending per head of population on defence is the lowest in western Europe. In 1982, the latest year for which I have figures, our spending on defence was $82 <Col N="957" /> per head of the population, whereas Sweden spends in excess of $300 per head of the population and the same applies to Switzerland.  Those countries are traditionally neutral.  There is no inconsistency between a neutral policy and substantial spending on defence.  In fact, there is a consistency because if one is to maintain one's neutrality one must be prepared to defend it and to mount such a bite in military terms that a would-be aggressor would be deterred from infringing on that neutrality.  It would cost thousands of millions of pounds if we were to try to enhance our defence capacity to put ourselves in that position.  While we are neutral and while our policy is one of neutrality, we must be brutally frank about it: we are hardly in a position to defend our neutrality as we stand now. That is not to diminish the value of our Army.  Our Army are extremely professional and have shown that in their duties abroad with the United Nations.  We have a small, professional Army capable of being expanded quickly and of providing the nucleus for quick expansion should the need arise.  Because of the size of the Army, their capacity is necessarily limited but they are an extremely valuable part of our national structures.</P>
    <P>I welcome the general theme of the contributions to the debate which was to pay tribute to the men and women of our Defence Forces.  I should like to echo those tributes and to say, as Minister for Defence, that those tributes are well deserved.  We are very well served by the men and women of our permanent and reserve Defence Forces.  They deserve all the praise we can given them and as Minister for Defence it is my ambition to ensure that their conditions of service and the general provisions for the Army will never fall behind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank you, Sir, for giving us time to bring this matter to the notice of the House. The Minister will be aware that many people from the west found it necessary to emigrate in the fifties and now, having retired to Ireland, are in receipt of British contributory pensions because they were able to secure employment in England over a period. As a result of a strike in the British Ministry of Pensions headquarters in Newcastle-upon-Tyne over the last ten weeks they have not been paid any pensions. There are also some pensioners who did not have a full contributory pension from England and who are in receipt of old age pensions from the Department of Social Welfare here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a practice whereby their books are recalled from time to time because of the fact that old age pensioners are means tested.  At present many of these books have been recalled by the Department of Social Welfare because of changes in the rates of payment from England due to budgetary regulations.  It means that these pensioners have been without payment of any kind for the last ten weeks. This also applies to people who are in receipt of invalidity pensions from England and who have not received any payment.  We maintain that the Department of Social Welfare and the Minister should be able to do something to provide assistance for these pensioners to help them with their present problems <Col N="959" /> because of non-payment.  When we had a Post Office strike here the Department of Social Welfare, through the good offices of sub-postmasters and local business people, were able to provide a service for these people at a time when they could not get their contributions in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>I should also like to point out that the people about whom we are speaking never sought assistance of any kind from the State.  When they could not get employment at home they emigrated to England, worked there and were never a burden on the State.  Their contributions towards the maintenance of their families at home and towards the education of their children was greatly admired by people in the west who knew what they had to endure.  We are asking the Department of Social Welfare and the Minister to look at the possibility of providing assistance to alleviate the problems these people have.  It should be possible, through the health boards or the Department, to set up machinery whereby their needs could be looked after.  It could be done in such a way that when they again get their benefits from England the contributions made by the Department of Social Welfare or the health boards could be claimed and repaid to the British Ministry.  Because the strike has gone on for such a long time some of these people are in dire straits and we have a duty to ensure that they will be looked after.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Deputy Dennis Gallagher for giving me a few moments of his time to relate the many experiences which I have heard in relation to retirement and invalidity pensions from Newcastle-Upon-Tyne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people in my constituency, like Mayo and other parts of the country, have had to emigrate over the past few decades, but fortunately most of them were able to retire to their native soil. Many of these people are on contributory pensions and are in a very difficult situation as they have received no payment over the past ten weeks.  They could make representations through their health <Col N="960" /> boards for welfare assistance but there is a serious difficulty in that regard, because if they claim this assistance the Department of Health and Social Security in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne will be in communication with the Department of Social Welfare before they make any payments available.  If the people of whom I speak have claimed welfare assistance and are fortunate enough to receive it, they must wait until these repayments are met and until such time as the Ministry in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, the Department in Dublin and the various health boards are satisfied that the money is repaid.  This is deterring people from approaching the health boards and they are leaving it week after week hoping that the payments will come through.</P>
    <P>I have been in communication with the officials in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne on many occasions and they have been very helpful.  If they could help they would, but all the payments are computerised and it is that section which is on strike. In addition, those who are in receipt of a part pension from the UK and a supplementary pension from Dublin are fortunate enough to be in receipt of a free telephone rental and free electricity allowances, but unfortunately the people in receipt of a pension from the UK only do not have these allowances.  I appreciate that this debate is not about that matter but I ask the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare to take into consideration these two factors.  Perhaps over the next couple of weeks he might be able to ensure that electricity and free telephone allowances would be made available to them.  Before the end of this week, the Minister and the Department should ensure the payment of the corresponding amount of the old age pension to those people as they have many bills to pay to people who cannot wait for their money.  There should also be retrospective payments to ensure that they will not be left in their present terrible circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my support to the Deputies who have spoken. The position is critical in my area with quite a number of people affected. <Col N="961" /> Through no fault of their own they are now without the basic necessities of life. I accept that community welfare officers in some areas have been exceptionally generous but, as the Deputies pointed out, there will be a delay in the final payment because the department concerned in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne when the dispute ends will have to contact the Department of Helath who in turn must get in touch with the health boards to ascertain the amount of money that has been paid out.  I understand there is an arrangement whereby people can claim their pensions but from my inquiries few people are aware of those arrangements. I only became aware of them when listening to a radio programme.  It is the duty of the Department of Social Welfare to make people aware through television advertisements and so on what they have to do pending a settlement of the strike.</P>
      <P>I met a mother of seven children at one of my clinics who has not received any money for eight or nine weeks.  Those people who are in receipt of an invalidity pension have not any savings to help them over this trying period.  They are fortunate that the local shopkeepers have been very helpful.  Those business people deserve our congratulations for aiding those pensioners.  The Department should help pensioners who are suffering as a result of this strike.  The emergency provisions should be advertised widely. We have all seen the television advertisements by the Department of the Public Service in recent weeks, and there is no reason why some of that time could not be given over to highlighting the emergency arrangements for pensioners.  The situation is critical in my constituency and, in fact, along the western seaboard. Many of the people on pension through no fault of their own had to leave home to work in England for many years.  It is regrettable that because of a strike by a number of people in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne they do not receive the pensions to which they are justly entitled.  They are appealing to the Government for help.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Pattison)</NameTxt>
      <P>Industrial action in the computer section of the <Col N="962" /> Department of Health and Social Security, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, is currently affecting the payment of British retirement and widows pensions to approximately 300,000 overseas pensioners.  The last payable orders were dispatched from Newcastle on Friday, 11 May 1984.</P>
      <P>Alternative arrangements for payment during the currency of the industrial action have been made by the British authorities.  To avail themselves of these alternative arrangements, however, it is necessary for the pensioners concerned to write to Overseas Group, Department of Health and Social Security, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne giving full identifying particulars and enclosing the counterfoil of the last payment received.</P>
      <P>As soon as my Department became aware of the situation it got in contact with the British Department to try to ensure that the effects of the industrial action in individual pensioners is minimised. I do not have information as to the number of people who are affected.  A number of those concerned would be in receipt of pension from my Department in addition to the British pension but a number would not be entitled to pension here where they did not have a sufficient record of Irish insurance and where the level of their British pension was such as to put them over the means limit for entitlement to a non-contributory pension.</P>
      <P>In all cases, however, it is open to those concerned to apply to the local community welfare officer for assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  The community welfare officers have been informed of the industrial action and are aware that they may be called on to provide temporary financial assistance in this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people may be reluctant to seek assistance from the community welfare officer in cases like this and may feel that as pensioners they should not have to seek assistance in this way.  There are others, mentioned by the Deputies, who feel that their British entitlement will be withheld when the dispute is settled pending a refund of the allowance.  I should like to point out that no arrangements have been made either between the <Col N="963" /> health boards and the British Department or between our Department and its British counterpart to withhold payments or refunds of this type.  People in this position of course will have to give an undertaking that when they receive their arrears from the British authorities they will repay the amount out of the arrears.</P>
    <P>In practice, however, there is no other option open to me to provide such financial assistance.  Furthermore, the supplementary welfare allowance scheme was specifically designed to cater for emergencies. The basic reason for the reform of the old home assistance system and the introduction of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme was to have a uniform scheme across the board which would provide standard basic rates of assistance but which would also be flexible enough to deal with the short-term emergencies which can arise.  People should be aware that the service is available to deal with situations of the sort which has arisen in this case, and I would hope that nobody who is in need of immediate financial assistance would refuse to seek such assistance or would feel that the service is not for them.</P>
    <P>I do not have any information as to the likely duration of the present action.  My Department are, however, keeping in touch with the British Department on the matter and will be aware of any developments. An announcement will be made whenever arrangements to resume normal payments have been agreed.  In the meantime, however, pensioners can arrange for payment to be made to them under the special arrangements introduced by the British authorities.  As those arrangements have been made by the British authorities it is not appropriate for the Irish authorities to advertise them, but I hope that one of the results of the Deputies raising this matter tonight will be that it will get sufficient press coverage to make people aware of the arrangements.  I expect that Members will also bring those arrangements to the notice of those concerned.  I would stress the necessity when writing to the UK Department to give as much detail as possible in order to enable the pension to <Col N="964" /> be identified on the manual system &mdash; name and address, pension number, type and amount of pension, frequency of payment, date of last payment and counterfoil of that payment.  In this way the case can be quickly identified and the alternative arrangements put in train without delay.  Where a husband and wife are receiving separate pensions individual application should be made.  That is the best system for those who can afford to wait a few weeks, but those who cannot should not delay in seeking assistance from community welfare officers.  Those officers have been notified of the position and are prepared to deal with cases.</P>
    <P>The other matter raised by Deputy Gallagher was the taking up of pension books for readjustment following increases in the UK rates.  This is normally done following the increase in November.  I am not aware of any widespread taking up of books for that purpose. There may be individual cases where books would be taken up for specific purposes.  If there are cases where the Irish non-contributory pension book is in the Department of Social Welfare for any appreciable time the details should be brought to my notice and I will see that they are re-issued.  I am assured that there could not be a large number of these books held in the Department, because the adjustments following the increase in the UK rates have been made and the books were re-issued some time ago.</P>

      <P>I assume that when the Deputy uses the word &ldquo;disclosure&rdquo; he means disclosure of the fact that a certain person had made an affidavit in which he said that he was satisfied that he had identified a particular member of the Garda Síochána as one of three people who had been at the house in question at the relevant time.  The Garda authorities had already conducted an inquiry into what amounted to a similar allegation affecting the member concerned and three others but, on receipt of the affidavit, they reexamined the matter and collected additional information.  The result was to confirm their earlier findings.  They are satisfied beyond doubt that the member could not have been the person seen at the house because they have proof that he was elsewhere at the relevant time.  It is well recognised not only in the Garda Síochána but in police forces in other countries that identifications, especially where the person who is the subject of the identification was not previously known to the other, are at times found to be incorrect.</P>

      <P>The works to be undertaken this year on the Corrib-Mask-Robe catchment drainage scheme include the continuation of those scheduled for the Cong Canal and the Robe, Aille, and Lough Carra sub-catchments.</P>
      <P>The proposed works in the Cong Canal, which involve the deepening of the channel bed through some 1,200 yards of solid limestone rock, are required to achieve a reduction of high water levels in Lough Mask by increasing the flood discharge capacity of the canal. The most effective way of carrying out these works is by drilling and blasting. The works will not adversely affect the environment except to the extent that it may be necessary to deposit rock spoil on the banks of the canal.</P>
      <P>Since the high amenity value of the Lough Mask area has always been fully recognised the Commissioners of Public Works commissioned a leading hydrogeologist to carry out a detailed study of the implications of the works proposed under the scheme on groundwater.  His report re-affirmed the commissioners' view that the proposed works in the canal would not affect either lake or groundwater to any significant degree other than in the manner intended under the scheme.</P>

The board have informed me that they do not intend <Col N="811" /> to close public wards in Roscommon Hospital during the summer months.

      <P>Following confirmation of the accident injury benefit was allowed from 19 December and was paid in respect of the period to 7 January 1984, after which he was certified fit to resume work.

      <P>In relation to the programme of special educational measures for disadvantaged areas which has been initiated this year my approach has been to concentrate on areas of educational disadvantage rather than on geographical areas where varying degrees of educational provision are available.  Two schools in the Ballymun district are benefiting under this programme. Staffing levels in certain educationally disadvantaged schools are being considered at present with a view to seeing what additional measures can be taken within available resources.</P>

      <P>In November 1983 my Department was informed that the number of eligible pupils availing themselves of the primary school transport service in question had fallen below the minimum number normally required to maintain a service.  In accordance with normal procedure the management authorities of the schools to which the service operates were asked to inform the parents concerned of the possible termination of the service.</P>
      <P>However on further examination of the case it has been decided because of the particular circumstances obtaining to maintain the service in question subject to periodic review.</P>

      <P>The number of cases submitted to my Department with a view to possible institution of proceedings under section 10 (1) of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, is 242.  However, a number of these would have been settled by direct approaches to employers without recourse to legal proceedings. The precise number and details of cases in which proceedings were instituted could only be ascertained by a protracted investigation of records of individual cases in my Department and in the offices of the Chief State Solicitor and Local State Solicitors.  The cost and time involved in such investigation would not be warranted.  Likewise, in regard to the Circuit Court, decisions in individual cases would necessitate extensive examination of court records.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he is aware that the Employment Appeals Tribunal in a decision dated 21 May 1984 imposed the onus of application to the court on an unemployed and redundant worker without first ascertaining if the liquidator would refuse to apply for leave of the court; and if, in view of the specific enactment in section 32 (1) of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, that an employee has only to take &ldquo;all reasonable steps (other than legal proceedings&rdquo;), to claim a redundancy lump sum, it is his intention to make an application to the tribunal to have this important matter further examined and clarified as unemployed redundant workers have neither the means nor the resources to undertake the cost of legal proceedings in the High Court in order to obtain access to the tribunal, especially when the statutory requirements <Col N="836" /> of the Acts in respect of which the tribunal functions have been complied with by unemployed claimants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the necessity for the worker in the case concerned to apply for leave of the High Court arose from a decision of the tribunal that it was a matter for the parties concerned to remove any obstacles to the hearing of the appeal.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the tribunal decision and there is no basis on which I could request the tribunal to reconsider the matter.</P>
      <P>However, as I indicated in a reply to Question No. 443 by the Deputy of 21 June 1984, I am consulting with the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, as the Minister responsible for the Companies Acts, as regard the implications of the reliance by the liquidator in the case on the provisions of section 222 of the Companies Act, 1963.</P>
