      <P>On behalf of The Workers' Party I would like to register our objection to this adjournment.  I believe it is downgrading the importance of this House against the Forum.  The parties to the Forum should have taken this into consideration and issued their report either on Tuesday or on Friday, when the Dáil was not in session.  I would like to say that I hope the adjournment will not mean using the guillotine on the Finance Bill as it was used very severely on the Social Welfare Bill and that this adjournment will not lead to any cut in the discussion on the Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>There is one little point on that.  I would like to reassure Deputy <Col N="2" /> Mac Giolla that for our part, as the main Opposition party, we are prepared to give three hours of Private Members' Time to discussion of the Finance Bill to make up for any loss caused by today's adjournment.</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>

      <P>Before building regulations <Col N="3" /> can be made, it is necessary to enact amending legislation to broaden the scope of the regulations to deal with matters not covered by the existing legislation. A new Bill for this purpose was presented to the Dáil on 9 February. Building regulations will be made as soon as possible after the Bill is enacted.</P>

Any proposal to develop the Market House as a craft centre would have to be considered having regard to the views of the Regional Tourism Organisation and such factors as the cost of the <Col N="4" /> project, its viability and its contribution to the development of craft industries in the area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The ESB's Strategic Plan was drawn up by the board and management of the ESB on their own initiative and responsibility to bring about major changes in the organisation to achieve substantial price improvement.  The plan sets out the measures proposed by the ESB to achieve this objective.  These proposals include closure of certain generating stations, including the station at Arigna, to reduce the board's existing excess generating capacity.  The plan also includes measures relating to such areas as administration, accounting procedures, consultancy services, general overheads, office development, trading practices and reorganisation of structures within the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plan is being examined in detail in my Department and until this examination <Col N="5" /> is complete I do not propose to comment on any particular element of the plan &mdash; including the proposed decommissioning of Arigna generating station.</P>
    <P>I can, however, assure the Deputy that no decisions will be taken on the board's plan without the fullest consideration being given to the social, economic, strategic and regional implications of the proposals. In relation to the second part of the Deputy's question, only native coal is used in the station.</P>

      <P>A Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 521 and 522 together.</P>
      <P>I understand from the ESB that they have deferred the construction of a second coal fired electricity generating station at Arigna, County Roscommon. This is as a result of the board's existing excess generating capacity, the high cost of the project and the poor demand for electricity.  In the course of a meeting with a delegation from the area last February, this information was conveyed to the delegation.  In these circumstances I do not think that any useful purpose would be served by another such meeting. I have underway a study of the impact of his deferral with a view to proposing possible measures to lessen any adverse effects.</P>

If the Deputy has, however, information about any Irish citizen imprisoned in Iraq I would of course look into the matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if he will give a detailed list of <Col N="9" /> the number of industries which the IDA find to be ineligible for grant assistance because their products are sensitive in the view of the IDA; and if he will give a detailed breakdown of the products now on the IDA's sensitive list, giving the reasons for the sensitivity in each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The general grant-giving powers of the Industrial Development Authority as contained in section 33 of the Industrial Development Act, 1969, require the Authority to be satisfied than an undertaking to which it proposes to make grant assistance available meet certain criteria as follows&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  it would be likely to provide or maintain employment in the State,</P>
      <P>(b)  financial assistance is necessary to ensure its establishment, maintenance or development, and</P>
      <P>(c)  it is of a reasonably permanent nature and will be carried on efficiently. </P>
      <P>Certain sensitive product categories have been identified by the IDA for the purpose of ensuring that State resources are not used to enable firms to compete against each other in the home market when sufficient production capacity for the needs of that market already exists. This is an issue which arises, for the most part, in connection with the small industry programme.  The following is a list of the categories currently regarded as sensitive with the reasons attributed by the IDA for sensitivity in each case:</P>
      <P> 1.  Bread Baking &amp; Flour Confectionery: The bread baking industry has excess production capacity supplying a static market.  In the flour confectionery sector, there is sufficient capacity for the production of fresh cakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.  Broiler Processing: This industry has sufficient production capacity to meet existing and likely future demands, and is unlikely to achieve success in export markets.  Present grant policies permit grant aid only for <Col N="10" /> companies producing more than one million birds per annum.</P>
    <P>3.  Concrete Products: No grant aid is provided principally because the industry is not, in general, subject to international competition.  However, projects involving concrete products which are new to the market and/or replacing imports can be considered on their merits.</P>
    <P>4.  General Printing: There is excess capacity and little competition from imports.</P>
    <P>5.  Joinery: A recent IDA study confirmed that there is over-capacity in this sector.</P>
    <P>6.  Furniture: No new companies are being grant assisted for home market sales, because of over-capacity in the industry.  Grant aid will be considered for existing firms where plans involve upgrading the level of design, marketing and production techniques with a view to increasing export sales and for specific evidence of import displacement.</P>
    <P>7.  Plastics: There is adequate capacity for film extrusion-conversion and pipe extrusion.  Adequate capacity also exists for trade moulding in the area of medium to low quality mouldings. Grant assistance may, however, be provided towards developments aimed at servicing the high quality sector of the market.</P>
    <P>8.  Soft Drinks-Bottling: Grant assistance may be provided towards expansion proposals on the basis of a grant of £4,000 per new job created.</P>
    <P>9.  Structural Steel: Market opportunities are limited.</P>
    <P>10.  Tyre Remoulds: This industry had adequate production capacity except in the area of remoulding for heavy duty or contractors' vehicles.  </P>
    <P>Even if an undertaking or a project is in a sensitive product category its ability to demonstrate clearly the potential of its product for export or for import substitution may allow for its being grantaided. <Col N="11" /> Furthermore, within a broad category regarded as sensitive a particular sub-category may be eligible for assistance.</P>
    <P>The list of sensitive product categories as set out above is kept under continuing review and may be revised from time to time if changed market conditions so require.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism the number of foreign delegations that were taken to the Galway regional office of the IDA during 1983; the number of industrial projects under consideration as a result of such negotiations; the number of industrialists who visited Galway and have decided to locate elsewhere in the country; and the number of projects which are now being actively negotiated with a view to their location in County Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of overseas delegations visiting a particular town or county is not a complete measure of the IDA's promotion of the area.  During 1983, the IDA's promotional activities were directed at several thousand overseas companies, virtually all of whom would have had the industrial development facilities and incentives available for County Galway, as well as other parts of the country, brought to their notice.</P>
      <P>During 1983 the IDA endeavoured to ensure that as many as possible of the overseas industrialists who visited Ireland included Galway on their itineraries. While no definite proposals for County Galway have emerged as yet from the companies which visited the county last year, it is possible that some promoters of projects which are currently being actively negotiated with the IDA may decide to locate in County Galway.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that it is not the policy of the IDA to publish information in regard to projects based on feasibility studies which have been refused grant-aid.</P>
      <P>It is, however, the practice of the IDA to discuss in detail proposals for feasibility study grants with each promoter concerned. Every effort is made to ensure that entrepreneurs do not undertake research in an area which has already been examined and found to lack potential.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances I do not consider that the publication of the type of list sought by the Deputy is warranted.</P>

      <P>The water supply serving the greater Dublin area amounts to approximately 85 million gallons per day and comes from four sources:&mdash; Ballymore Eustace, 43 million gallons; Ballyboden, 4 million gallons; Leixlip, 21 million gallons; Roundwood, 17 million gallons.</P>
      <P>The treatment of water at all four sources is different.  At the first three sources the water receives full chemical treatment and rapid gravity filtration.  At Roundwood the supply is treated by slow sand filtration.</P>
      <P>The chemicals used generally in the treatment of water at the first three water works are:</P>
      <P>Before Filtration</P>
      <P>(a)Aluminium Sulphate of Alum &mdash; this is used for coagulation and clarification of the raw water and the amounts employed vary from 80 to 30 milligrams per litre.</P>
      <P>(b)Polyelectrolyte &mdash; this is used as an aid to improve coagulation and subsequent sedimentation.  The amounts employed vary from 0.05 to 0.35 milligrams per litre with an average dosage rate of 0.2 milligrams per litre.</P>
      <P>Post Filtration</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)Lime &mdash; this chemical is added to the water to correct P.H. i.e. to chemically stabilise the water so that it is neither corrosive nor scale depositing.  The amounts used do <Col N="20" /> not exceed 15 milligrams per litre with an average dosage rate of 9 milligrams per litre.</P>
    <P>(d)Chlorine &mdash; gaseous chlorine is used to disinfect the water and to render it bacteriologically pure. The amounts used vary from 1.5 to 0.5 milligrams per litre.</P>
    <P>(e)Fluorine &mdash; this chemical is added to the water supply as hydrofluosilicic acid in accordance with the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act 1960 for the prevention of dental caries and the amount used is approximately 1 milligram per litre.  </P>
    <P>At Leixlip Treatment Works activated carbon has been used for the removal of phenolic taste and the dosage rate is 5.5 milligrams per litre for the duration of the phenol presence in the raw water.</P>
    <P>At Roundwood where the raw water quality is of a very high standard there is no chemical treatment prior to slow sand filtration.  After filtration the water is chlorinated and fluoridated in accordance with public health practice.</P>

      <P>There is no record of the receipt in my Department of an application for a tax rebate from the person referred to in the question.  The question of tax rebates is a matter for the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and it has been ascertained that there is no record in that office of an application for a tax rebate in this case.  If the person referred to considers that he is entitled to a tax rebate, he should apply direct to the Inspector of Taxes for Public Departments, Hawkins House, Hawkins Street, Dublin 2, quoting his revenue and social insurance number.</P>

      <P>There are no arrears of pension under the Army Pensions Acts due to the person referred to in the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person referred to was awarded a disability pension under the Army Pensions Acts in respect of disablement due to injury.  He also received a lump sum payment for the same injury in settlement of a civil claim.  The Army Pensions Acts provide that where such compensation is received, it may be taken into consideration in fixing the amount of any pension which may be awarded under the Acts. As the annual value of the compensation in this case, assessed on an actuarial basis, exceeded the appropriate rate of pension under the Army Pension Acts, payment of pension has been withheld. The question of resumption of payment will be considered if and when the annual rate of pension, appropriate to the degree <Col N="27" /> of disablement, exceeds the annual value of the compensation awarded.</P>

    <P>In June 1983 the Department of Transport (now the Department of Communications) sought the views of my Department on an application from Galway County Council for permission to lay a sewage outfall pipe on the foreshore at Rinville West in connection with the proposed Oranmore sewerage scheme.  My Department were concerned about the adverse effect of this proposal on local oyster beds and have had a number of discussions with Galway County Council with a view to their designing a revised scheme which would be mutually acceptable. <Col N="28" /> The county council agreed to reexamine the proposed scheme in the light of the Department's concern.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy in regard to the foreign debt of Government and of semi-State bodies is given in the tabular statements below.  The latest available information for semi-State bodies relates to the position at 31 December 1983.  The figures for Government foreign <Col N="34" /> debt are those at 31 March 1984.</P>
      <P>At end-February 1984 Ireland's official external reserves amounted to £2,094.9 million, including gold valued at £90.6 million and foreign currencies valued at £1,707.1 million.  The net external liabilities of licensed banks at 15 February 1984 amounted to £2,771.2 million.  I am informed by the Central Bank of Ireland, which is responsible for publishing statistics on these matters, that data on the official external reserves at 31 March 1984 will be published in the Central Bank's annual report in late May.  Data on the net external liabilities of licensed banks at 31 March 1984 will be published at a later date in a statistical supplement to the Central Bank's annual report.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the reason a person (details supplied) in County Galway had his tax-free allowance reduced from £71.16 to £16.85 per week; and if he will request a full breakdown of the present allowances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that at the commencement of the year 1983-84 a certificate of tax-free allowances for £3,700 (£71.16 per week) was issued to the taxpayer in respect of that year.  A return of income was completed by him on 14 May 1983.  This revealed that, in addition to a retirement pension, the taxpayer was in receipt of a social welfare invalidity pension.  Both pensions are chargeable to income tax.  In accordance with standard practice the taxpayer's tax-free allowances were restricted to take account of the invalidity pension thereby enabling it to be paid in full without deduction of income tax.  The balance of the tax-free allowances for 1983-84 amounting to £176 (£3.39 per week) was set off against the retirement pension.  An amended certificate of tax-free allowances on that basis was issued to the taxpayer on 20 June 1983.</P>
      <P>The tax-free allowances in respect of the year 1984-85 amounting to £876 (£16.85 per week) were arrived at on the basis of a provisional deduction in respect of the invalidity pension estimated to be payable in that year.  The amount referred to now requires to be reduced to £613 (£11.79 per week) in the light of later information now available as to the amount of the invalidity pension likely to be payable in 1984-85.  An amended certificate of tax-free allowances will, therefore, be issued to the taxpayer in the near future.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer ceased employment on 28 September 1983 and that four claims to repayment of tax on the grounds of unemployment were received from him and dealt with by the inspector of taxes since the date of cessation of employment.  The taxpayer again commenced employment on 22 March 1984, and the inspector wrote to him on 19 April for the details required to carry out a review of his liability for the year 1983/84.  When the necessary information is supplied, any further refund found due for that year will be made.</P>
      <P>As the tax year 1983/84 has ended, the question of issuing a form P.45 (cessation certificate) for that year does not arise. A certificate of tax-free allowances for the current year, 1984/85, was issued to the taxpayer on 16 April 1984.</P>

      <P>The manager of Killavullen National School, County Cork provided a prefabricated classroom at the school in 1982 without the prior authority of the Department of Education.  On 14 March 1984 the Department advised the Office of Public Works that it would be prepared to grant aid the cost of the prefab, as an exceptional matter.  The Office of Public Works made a recommendation to the Department of Education as to the sanction of a grant on 21 March 1984 and the sanction of a grant by the Department is awaited. When the grant is sanctioned payment will be made promptly subject to submission of planning permission by the manager of the school.</P>

    <P>I am aware that conditions in the Irish schools at Marlborough Street are unsatisfactory due to a number of structural defects in the building.  A contract has now been placed for a major scheme of remedial works which will comprise <Col N="45" /> mainly: works to roof trusses, walls and ceilings, replacement of windows, eradication of dry rot and replastering and redecoration.  The duration of the contract will be about three months.  During that period temporary accommodation will be provided in the former kitchen and music room.  The contractor has resumed work on these rooms and it should be completed in about two weeks time.</P>
    <P>As positive action has been taken to remedy the problems at the schools the Minister for Education considers that a meeting with the parents is unnecessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>It was decided by the local pension committee on 27 July 1983 that the person concerned is not entitled to an old age pension as he does not fulfil the statutory condition as to means.  His means, consisting of half the weekly value of a shop, capital and a holding are in excess of the statutory limit of £42.00 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An appeal against this decision was made on 15 November 1983 and the case was referred to an appeals officer, who required further information before giving his decision.  This information is being sought and when it is received the matter will be referred back to the appeals officer <Col N="56" /> for his determination and the person concerned will be notified of the outcome in due course.</P>

      <P>Departmental records indicate that the person concerned claimed a free electricity allowance in 1982 but he did not satisfy the living alone conditions of the scheme.  The conditions for receipt of a free television licence are similar and if his domestic circumstances remain the same he would not qualify for a free television licence.</P>

      <P>The person concerned does not satisfy the contribution conditions for unemployment benefit.  He claimed unemployment assistance from 6 October 1983 but his claim was disallowed for six weeks from that date on the grounds that he was not genuinely seeking employment and accordingly he did not fulfil the condition of being available for work.  He was disallowed for a further six weeks from 17 November 1983 and he was advised accordingly on 21 November 1983.  He appealed on 2 February 1984 against the disallowance of his unemployment <Col N="57" /> assistance claims and arrangements were made to hold an oral hearing of his case on 1 May 1984.

He was accordingly paid unemployment assistance at £8.65 being the maximum rate payable to him, £29.40 less £20.75.  However his case was recently reviewed and in the light of further details about the case a deciding officer reduced the assessment of his means to nil from the commencement of his unemployment assistance claim.

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The social insurance and assistance schemes for deserted wives are framed to provide generally the same benefit and allowance payments for qualified deserted wives in respect of themselves and their children, if any, as apply to the schemes for widows.  The conditions for entitlement include a provision that in order to qualify for payment the claimant must not be cohabiting with any person as man and wife.</P>
      <P>In the case of the social assistance allowance for unmarried mothers, the means test is the same as that for receipt of the social assistance scheme for deserted wives.  An unmarried mother must have a qualified child dependent on her in order to be eligible for payment; this condition applies to a deserted wife only until she reaches 40 years of age. Allowances under the general scheme of children's allowances are also payable in respect of all qualified children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>An application for widow's pension was received from the person concerned.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for widow's contributory pension there must be, on either the late husband's or the widow's own insurance, a yearly average of at least 39 contributions in either the last three or five contribution years prior to the husband's death or a yearly average of at least 24 contributions over the period from entry into insurance up to the end of the contribution year prior to his death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The late husband in this case was self-employed and had no insurance under the social welfare system.  The widow herself had an insurance record prior to her marriage but, according to the records of the Department, has not had any insurable employment since the date of her marriage in July 1964.  According to the records she has a total of 783 reckonable <Col N="59" /> contributions in respect of the period from 1948-49, the year she entered insurance, up to July 1964.  This gives an average of 22 contributions over the period from the 1948-49 contribution year to 5 April 1983, the end of the contribution year before her husband's death.  She does not, therefore, satisfy either of the three average tests and is accordingly not qualified for receipt of the contributory pension.</P>
    <P>One of the conditions for the receipt of a widow's non-contributory pension is that the claimant's means must not exceed the applicable statutory limit.  She is under 66 years of age with one qualified child and in these circumstances the limit is £50.00 per week.  The means of the person concerned were assessed at £123.35 per week derived from her two thirds intestacy interest in a petrol station and her claim to widow's non-contributory pension was accordingly refused.</P>
    <P>She appealed against the refusal of both the contributory and non-contributory pensions and her case has been referred to an appeals officer for determination. She will be notified of the outcome as soon as the appeals officer gives his decision.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed injury benefit from 25 June 1983 in respect of an incapacity resulting from an alleged occupational accident on 24 June 1983.  Inquiries made from the employers failed to confirm any record of the alleged occupational accident.  Investigations made by the social welfare officer revealed that the foreman concerned received no report of the alleged accident nor was confirmation available from the persons named by claimant as witnesses to the accident.  On the evidence it was not accepted that the alleged accident had occurred and the claim to injury benefit was disallowed accordingly on 5 March 1984.  The claimant's appeal against the decision has been referred to an appeals officer who has decided to hold an oral hearing of the case.  The claimant will be advised of the arrangements for the hearing in due course.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed children's allowance on 22 March 1984 in respect of two foster children who have been residing with her since June 1983.  There is no trace of any earlier claim having been received in respect of these children.  Children's allowance was awarded in respect of the children from April 1984 and allowance books totalling £22.50 per month have been issued to the claimant.  This was the earliest date from which payment could be made having regard to the date on which the claim was submitted.  However, in view of the circumstances outlined by the Deputy, the matter has been <Col N="64" /> referred to a social welfare officer for investigation.

The relevant income tax year in his case was the period 6 April 1982 to 5 April 1983. He was unemployed during that period and had therefore no reckonable earnings. Accordingly, the person concerned is not entitled to receive pay-related benefit. Flat-rate unemployment benefit at the rate of £103.90 weekly has been paid to him since the commencement of this claim.</P>

She was subsequently assessed with means at £0.15 weekly derived from capital and her unemployment assistance claim was allowed at the weekly rate of £28.75 being the maximum rate payable to her £28.90 less means £0.15.

      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowances scheme the amount of any payment of supplementary welfare allowance in respect of rent or mortgage interest is a matter to be decided by the health board having regard to the circumstances of each particular case.  It is understood from the Eastern Health Board that the person concerned was paid supplementary welfare allowance together with a weekly supplement of £5 towards her mortgage interest while she was awaiting a decision on her claim to deserted wife's benefit.  Payment of the allowance ceased on 1 October 1983 when she was awarded deserted wife's benefit and it was considered that payment of a supplement towards mortgage interest was no longer warranted having regard to the level of the mortgage repayments and her income as a deserted wife.</P>
      <P>It is also understood that the person concerned received assistance towards payment of gas and electricity bills on a number of occasions in 1983 under a provision which enables the health board, in any case where it considers it reasonable, to make a single payment to meet an exceptional need.  Payments under this heading are made on a once-off basis and there is no provision for continuing payments. It is understood, however, that from October 1983 the person concerned was granted an allowance of £4 weekly under the national fuel scheme.</P>

      <P>Following reinvestigation of <Col N="92" /> his unemployment assistance application the means of the person concerned were assessed at £40.00 per week derived from the value of board and lodgings on his mother's holding.  As this amount exceeded the maximum rate of unemployment assistance payable in his case the claim was disallowed.  If he is dissatisfied with the amount of means assessed against him it is open to him to appeal and to have his means determined by an appeals officer.  A form for this purpose may be obtained at his local office.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of the maximum rate of flat-rate unemployment benefit to 6 September 1983 when he exhausted 156 days of benefit. He did not fulfil the contribution condition for continuous payment of unemployment benefit at the maximum rate and accordingly his weekly rate of unemployment benefit was reduced from £103.90 weekly to £89.45 weekly from 7 September 1983 and he is at present in receipt of payment at this rate.</P>
      <P>He is not entitled to pay-related benefit with his flat-rate unemployment benefit as the amount of flat-rate unemployment benefit which he is paid exceeds the 85 per cent limit of £63.88 weekly, applicable in his case.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has ben in receipt of a contributory widow's pension since December 1982.  She is currently getting £41.40 per week which is the maximum personal rate payable to a widow over 66 years of age with no qualified children.  The pension was awarded on the basis of her late husband's insurance contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>She has in addition recently been awarded a living alone allowance at the rate of £3 per week from 25 February 1984, her 66th birthday.  An allowance order book with orders payable from 6 April 1984 has been sent to the designated post office for collection by her and she has been notified accordingly. <Col N="94" /> Arrears for the period from 25 February 1984 to 5 April 1984 amounting to £15.00 will be paid direct to her shortly by payable order.</P>
    <P>There is no trace of a claim ever having been made by the person concerned for a contributory or non-contributory old age pension.</P>
    <P>To be eligible for the award of a contributory old age pension she would herself need to have been insurably employed and to satisfy the insurance contribution conditions.  She indicated in her claim to widow's pension that she was employed from 1934 to 1946.  However, the condition requiring a yearly average of at least 20 contributions paid or credited, could not be satisfied by her as it is only contributions from and subsequent to 1953 that are reckonable for this purpose.</P>
    <P>It would not be in her interest to change to non-contributory old age pension because the maximum rate of that pension is less than the contributory widow's pension at present in payment to her.</P>

Pension at the weekly rate of £10.60 has been recommended with effect from 20 February 1984.  This is the rate of pension to which she is entitled having regard to the assessment of her means, consisting of half the weekly value of her husband's British invalidity pension.</P>
      <P>The appropriate pension book payable from 6 April 1984 has been issued on a provisional basis pending the committee's decision and a payable order covering the arrears due in respect of the period 20 February 1984 to 5 April 1984 issued separately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The precise arrangements for policing particular areas are a matter for the Garda authorities.  As a general rule there is no question of allocating to the neighbourhood watch scheme a specific proportion of the total resources that are available in the district. In the context of the scheme, the Garda take account of the circumstances obtaining at any particular time, and those circumstances may vary substantially from time to time.  As I stated in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 17 of 14 March 1984, there has been a substantial increase in Garda strength in the Finglas area over the past few years and the Garda authorities are of the view that the increased strength should be sufficient to cater for the introduction of neighbourhood watch in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arrangements have been made for the patrolling of particular areas by the same members on a regular basis with a view to promoting better relations between the force and the public.  One telephone line has been set aside specifically for neighbourhood watch calls and members of the public who have given their support to the scheme have been notified of it.  Calls may, of course, be made on other lines as well.  The question of providing special telephone posts in public areas to give direct access to local stations will be <Col N="108" /> considered as part of the new communications system in the Dublin Metropolitan area.</P>
    <P>The neighbourhood watch scheme is designed to be run by the general public in close liaison with the Garda.  As I also stated in the House on 14 March 1984, the scheme will be monitored locally in every area where it is introduced and the police needs of those areas will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>Under the Redundancy Payments Acts payment of a redundancy lump sum is a matter for the employer concerned, who is also obliged to notify my Department of any proposed redundancies.  No notice of dismissal or redundancy certificate has been received by my Department in respect of the person named by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>If the employee concerned considers that she is entitled to a redundancy lump sum payment but has not received it, she should in the first instance apply for the lump sum in writing to her employer; she should also ask her employer for a redundancy certificate.  If the employer contests liability for redundancy payment, or fails to respond within a reasonable time, the employee should submit an appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal in order to establish her entitlement.  If, however, the employer acknowledges liability by the issue of a redundancy certificate but fails or refuses to pay the redundancy lump sum, the employee concerned should apply to my Department for payment from the Redundancy Fund.  The employee may also apply for payment from the Fund if the employer does not pay a lump sum awarded on appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a claim for payment of a redundancy lump sum from the Fund is received from the employee in question, supported either by a redundancy certificate from <Col N="119" /> the employer or a decision of the Tribunal, it will be dealt with expeditiously.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy wishes, I can send him or the employee concerned copies of the appropriate forms for pursuit of this claim.</P>

      <P>I am fully aware of Gort community association's efforts in collecting finance for the proposed community centre in Gort.</P>
      <P>Under my Department's Youth Employment Scheme, a grant of £45,000 was sanctioned towards the provision of a community centre in Gort in January 1983.  This grant was intended to provide employment for 12 young workers and a supervisor for 40 weeks and included a sum of £5,400 towards the cost of materials and £3,600 towards craftwork.  Sanction for the grant was given over 15 months ago and the Deputy will appreciate that it cannot be held indefinitely.</P>
      <P>There are no funds at my Department's disposal which would enable me to make a capital grant available in this case.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the number of young persons who availed themselves of youth employment funding in 1983 under (a) the ACOT certificate in farming programme; (b) the farm apprenticeship scheme and, (c) the community and youth enterprise programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The following is the information requested by the Deputy: (a) At the end of 1983, a total of 1,549 young persons were participating in the ACOT Certificate in Farming programme.  (b) At the end of 1983, a total of 300 young persons were participating in the Farm Apprenticeship Scheme.  (c) The Community and Youth Enterprise Programme was launched in June 1983 with the aim of providing advice, assistance and support to community organisations seeking to establish sustainable community-based businesses at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the period June to December 1983 the programme approved support <Col N="122" /> to 25 community groups.  In the main, this support consisted of payment of business planning grants to community groups at an early stage of development and the employment by community groups of full-time enterprise workers (14 in all) to enable development of business ideas to the point of commercial start-up.</P>
    <P>In addition to the 25 community groups mentioned, a further 11 community and co-operative groups which applied to the agency prior to the start up of the Community and Youth Enterprise Programme have commenced business with support from the agency and currently employ approximately 110 young people.</P>
    <P>I might finally add that the programme is still at a formative stage of development. The number of community groups and projects involved is expected to expand significantly as the programme develops.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 2.33 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 3 May 1984.</P>
