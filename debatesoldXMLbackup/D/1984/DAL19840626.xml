    <Col N="418" />
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £109,986,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1984, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Labour, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>I should like to start by attempting to review the activities which the Department of Labour engage upon.  The key issue is employment.  No one can be under any illusion about the scale and complexity of the problems which we must tackle to bring about an improved labour market situation.</P>
      <P>Much has been achieved over the past 18 months to correct the imbalances in our national finances and to bring about a return to growth in our economy.  It is a matter of record that the economy and the employment situation, however unhappy we are with it, has been performing somewhat better than official forecasts predicted even a few months ago.  In the first five months of this year, unemployment has remained stable and has fallen in two months.</P>
      <P>The substantial rise in unemployment in 1984 which was forecast earlier this year, and used in the planning board's report is overly pessimistic.  It now seems that the increase in unemployment during this year will not be of the magnitude predicted by these forecasts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, our data on industrial output may have been interpreted more pessimistically than the situation warrants. When industrial output expanded rapidly last year several commentators observed, correctly, that the increase was made possible by a good performance in two sectors, electronics and chemicals.  The figures for March, 1984, however which show an increase in output of 15 per cent over March, 1983, also indicate that there <Col N="419" /> is stronger performance over a wider range of sectors.</P>
    <P>The point which I want to emphasise from these facts is that the substantial difficulties which we face will not be overcome by heightening a sense of crisis, however natural may be the impatience of those who feel that progress is so slow as to be imperceptible or the caution of those who feel that great principles and vital interests are at stake.  Last year's economic forecasts should not and will not be the basis for measures hastily conceived, inadequately thought out and improperly co-ordinated.  There is no magic panacea which will eliminate our unemployment problem overnight. There is scope, however, for the development of strategies and initiatives in the manpower policy area for which I have responsibility: to review present strategies, build on existing initiatives and develop new programmes to complement mainstream job creation policies in manufacturing and services.</P>
    <P>It was with this in mind that I initiated a review of manpower policy in my Department at the beginning of this year. That initiative has been broadly welcomed by the various manpower agencies operating under my aegis.  It is clear that a comprehensive statement on manpower policy is long overdue.  A White Paper on Manpower Policy was last published in 1965.  The White Paper which I intend to publish later this year will chart the course of manpower policy for the remainder of the eighties and into the nineties.</P>
    <P>I anticipate that the White Paper, will first of all address the objectives which we should set for ourselves in the coming years distinguishing between activities designed to contribute to the overall objective of economic and social development and those geared towards the objective of catering for less advantaged groups among the labour force.  The paper also will explore the need to integrate the policy instruments available to the Department of Labour with those required for the broader treatment of manpower policy.</P>
    <P>In preliminary discussions with the <Col N="420" /> Manpower Consultative Committee which are representative of all the interests involved, including trade unions and employers' organisations, other issues such as training, management development, employment services, transition from school to work and existing schemes have also been identified as warranting treatment.</P>
    <P>A second area which needs to be addressed is the relationship between the manpower agencies and other public bodies, or speaking more generally, the relationship between manpower policy and other policies.  There is a need for a more integrated approach to the adoption of various policies.  Manpower issues should be taken into account in the formulation of other policies.  While this is obvious in relation to the development of industrial strategies it is equally valid in regard to education.  With increasing emphasis on the transition from school to work a considerable debate has arisen as to where formal academic education ends and where specific preparation for entry to the labour market begins.  Concern has been expressed about the duplication and overlap of activities in this area.  The outcome of the examination of these concerns by the Minister of State at the Departments of Labour and Education, which will be available shortly, should effectively clarify the situation and lead to a greater measure of understanding between the manpower and education authorities.</P>
    <P>The administrative arrangements covering the relationship between the Department of Labour and their agencies are of crucial importance in the context of a coherent manpower policy.  The Department must, and will, be the central policy-making body responsible for overall policy formulation and for the setting of objectives for the various agencies. The co-ordination issue will, I am sure, figure largely in the forthcoming debate on the report of the Oireachtas Public Expenditure Committee's proposals to establish a centralised recruitment and training agency.  There is one point, however, which I feel it is important to highlight in this context &mdash; that the degree of commonality of purpose, of co-operation <Col N="421" /> with one another and of achievement between the various agencies is far greater than the frictions and divisions of opinion so often erroneously portrayed as existing between them.</P>
    <P>Manpower policy programmes generally must aim to equitably meet the needs and requirements of all groups in the labour market.  There are groups however among the unemployed who are increasingly experiencing grave difficulties in securing initial entry to the labour force, or who have never gained a proper foothold in the market or, as in the case of older experienced workers, are enduring structural unemployment because of the displacement of skills and the general effects of the recession on traditional established industries.</P>
    <P>Regardless of what upturn in the economy or expansion of employment opportunities takes place, the problems of these groups in the labour market will not be easily resolved.  This is particularly true of the longer-term unemployed in all age groups, but is especially pointed in relation to the needs of older unemployed workers.  This forms a third area of major concern in the development of manpower policy.</P>
    <P>An increased and more dynamic effort to bring training and manpower services to the over-25's and to those who have not benefited from existing programmes will be required in the future.  The extent to which existing programmes should be modified and new programmes developed to assist the long-term unemployed and the structurally unemployed is also being considered and will form the basis of radical new initiatives over the coming months.</P>
    <P>In 1984 a very conscious effort is being made to provide a more balanced range of training services to employers and job-seekers. Increased funding available to AnCO is being directed at major expansion of a number of programmes targeted at priority clients.</P>
    <P>AnCO's Exchequer provision in 1984 of £46,889,000, including youth levy funding, is estimated to accommodate a significant increased throughput of trainees.</P>
    <P>AnCO courses are open to all persons <Col N="422" /> aged 16 years and over who have left school and are unemployed.  Courses vary in duration and aim to equip participants with specific skills which will help to improve their job prospects.  Most courses are provided at AnCO training centres and mobile training units.  Almost 15,000 people will be trained on adult training courses in AnCO centres, in 1984, an 11 per cent increase on 1983 training levels.  The training centres are also responsible for running the Community Youth Training Programme (CYTP) involving young unemployed people acquiring training and work experience on local community type projects. In 1984, over 5,000 persons will be trained under CYTP, 10 per cent more than last year.</P>
    <P>This year almost 3,000 trainees will pursue AnCO's Workshop Training Programme &mdash; an increase of 50 per cent over the numbers catered for in 1983. This programme is targeted at the needs of young unemployed from particular disadvantaged backgrounds.  This programme operates mainly in the Dublin inner city and elsewhere in the country for various groups of travelling people.</P>
    <P>In responding to the training needs of the unemployed AnCO is fortunate in being able to broaden the range of its courses by using up spare training capacity available in the public and private sectors and by engaging external training agents to conduct certain courses under contract.  External training courses are aimed at unemployed adults to meet current and future skill shortages, to enhance the employment prospects of participants, to encourage equal opportunities and to facilitate job creation. External training programmes are expected to train about 13,000 people in 1984.</P>
    <P>The existence of such a flexible training capacity has enabled AnCO to develop a variety of special training programmes. For example, the needs of communities remote from AnCO's training centre facilities are also being addressed by the further development of the LINC Programme launched in 1983 to enhance employment creation potential in target areas through training.  This programme's <Col N="423" /> emphasis on effective linking of local State services and community interests is a particularly welcome development providing evidence of greater co-ordination efforts by manpower, education and industrial agencies.</P>
    <P>Other special programmes for the unemployed are targeted at development of job creation and entrepreneurial skills and at promotion of equality of opportunities. AnCO is also looking into the area of training for co-operative development. AnCO is of course continuing to provide for and oversee apprenticeship training.  In particular, AnCO along with industry seeks to ensure that adequate numbers are being trained to meet projected future skilled manpower needs.  In recent years AnCO have also had to cater for the needs of young apprentices being made redundant.  Nearly 2,600 of these were helped by AnCO in 1983 and this policy of helping unemployed apprentices to continue their training is being maintained.</P>
    <P>AnCO's continued exposure to new technology developments in Irish industry is also enhancing its capacity to provide the unemployed with new skills on demand and indeed has put it in a position to adopt new approaches to training by use of this technology.  The training needs of entrepreneurs and managers of small businesses have also benefited from AnCO initiatives in this area in the past year and these developments will be built upon in the coming months in response to growing demands.</P>
    <P>Job creation is increasingly attracting the interest and involvement of communities and of voluntary and youth organisations.  The Youth Employment Agency regards the development of such community-based employment initiatives as a key objective both in creating economically sustainable employment and in raising the general level of enterprise among young people.  The agency has adopted a policy of promoting the development of local community responses to employment creation; this means pursuing additional creativity and resources at local level where unemployment and its consequences are most visible <Col N="424" /> and the commitment to action is often highest.  This policy seeks to provide a means by which people can explore new areas of work whether in the production of goods or services, and to provide practical advice, support and assistance to community groups investigating or undertaking employment initiatives.</P>
    <P>The agency's Community and Youth Enterprise Programme introduced in July 1983 represents an approach through which practical support can be given to community groups involved in developing job-creation projects.  The underlying feature of this programme is to help communities to help themselves by providing assistance by way of advice, planning grants, funding of enterprise workers and linkages into the programmes and grant-aid schemes of other State and commercial agencies.  The programme is complementary to the enterprise development programmes available from other bodies, such as the IDA, SFADCo, Údarás na Gaeltachta and county development teams.  In addition the programme provides for direct financial aid for groups at the point of &ldquo;start up&rdquo; specifically to contribute towards capital requirements and project management costs for up to 12 months.  The agency is giving priority in the current year to the development and expansion of this programme so as to further encourage and support community employment initiatives.</P>
    <P>Experience to date has shown that the nurturing of community enterprise is even more complex than had been originally envisaged.  Apart from the obvious problems of practical business expertise which such community groups need, the programme has raised the broader question of the need for support of basic community development.  As a result, the agency is currently assessing the extent to which it should become involved in basic community development activity which is not necessarily linked to employment-related activities.  The community and youth enterprise programme is to be warmly welcomed, not only as a major and positive initiative in employment creation, but also as a significant recognition of the dynamic and rightful <Col N="425" /> place of the community in influencing and responding to local conditions.</P>
    <P>Community initiatives receive further direct support through training and temporary employment schemes such as AnCO's community youth training programme, community training workshops and the grant scheme for youth employment. Each scheme is community-orientated with participants gaining training or temporary employment on specific community projects put forward by community organisations, church bodies, noncommercial groups etc.</P>
    <P>Another agency initiative which is motivated as much by the development of community-based employment initiatives as it is by the co-ordination of State programmes at the local level is also worth describing.  The problem facing large organisations in relation to their environments has been identified as centering on the difficult process of gathering and disseminating `outside' information. Clearly, access to accurate and detailed information is essential to the development of good policy.  Yet, large organisations such as centralised Government agencies, do not always have easy access to information from diverse local sources; nor indeed is this altogether feasible in the development of national policies.  However, proposals by the Youth Employment Agency for the creation of local intermediary agencies to be known as Community Training and Employment Consortia (COMTECs) represent a dynamic yet balanced response to this problem; while these new local agencies will operate within national policy guidelines they will allow for youth training and employment programmes to be fully developed and guided by informed local knowledge and expertise.  Broadly covering local authority administrative areas the function of COMTECs will be to identify the specific needs and opportunities of their own local areas and to translate these into coherent training and employment programmes for young people.  A COMTEC will seek to ensure that the programme funded from the youth employment levy directly address the needs of young people in the local labour market.  A basic <Col N="426" /> objective of each COMTEC will also be to pursue co-ordination of the youth training and employment programmes at local level.</P>
    <P>Typically a COMTEC will comprise representatives of major local community interests, manpower agencies, such as NMS, AnCO, CERT Ltd., educational interests and other relevant public agencies.  I intend to submit proposals for the launching of COMTECs on a pilot basis for Government approval in the near future.</P>
    <P>Before concluding this section of my review of manpower and employment matters I want to mention briefly a number of points relating to the main schemes operated by the Department of Labour.</P>
    <P>A number of specific initiatives which will stimulate increases in employment creation and economic activity at community level are being considered by the Government at the present time.  The highly successful enterprise allowance scheme which involves a relaxation of social welfare restrictions and provides unemployed people who wish to set up their own business with the possibility of securing initial capital and a weekly allowance was relaunched from its pilot basis by the Government in January this year.  In each of the last few weeks the scheme has assisted about 140 recipients of unemployment benefit or assistance to go into business for themselves.  There are 2,000 participants in the scheme already and three-quarters of them are over 25 years of age.  Therefore, the imbalance which many people felt existed in favour of young people is, to a certain extent, being redressed.</P>
    <P>Another innovation built into this scheme is the capitalisation of pay-related benefit which will for the first time provide access to the Social Insurance Fund for lump sums to be used as venture capital.  Regulations are being prepared to give effect to this aspect of the scheme and they will come into force in a short time.  I would add for the information of the House that 60 per cent of the persons who have been assisted under the scheme did not progress beyond intermediate or group certificate standard of education and 68 per cent had been unemployed for <Col N="427" /> six months or more.  Sixty-three per cent of participants had been getting more than £50 per week in unemployment payments which is more than they would qualify for under the EAS.  Estimates of the net effect of Exchequer costs range from a small saving to about break-even depending on the eventual mix of married to single participants and the amount of benefit to which they are still entitled when they join the scheme.  In view of the success of this scheme, it will be necessary for me to move a Supplementary Estimate later.</P>
    <P>I have also looked at the employment incentive scheme, which since 1977 has assisted 32,000 unemployed people to secure employment. I have decided to extend the scheme to all activities with the exception of those of the public sector, banking, insurance, building societies and similar financial activities. The conditions that an employer had to be 12 months in business before applying has been revoked.</P>
    <P>The premium structure has been simplified and improved.  A standard premium of £30 per week for 24 weeks will apply.  This represents an improvement of £5 per week for those under 20.  More important, I have provided a very attractive incentive for the recruitment of the older, long-term unemployed.  I have increased the premium to £60 per week for persons over 25 who have been 12 months on the live register in the period immediately preceding recruitment.</P>
    <P>The stability of jobs assisted by the scheme has also been examined and I have considered it necessary to emphasise this in the conditions attaching to the new scheme.  There was some evidence to suggest that the scheme was benefiting employers who were recruiting on a temporary basis only.  Accordingly, the new scheme provides that payments will not be made where jobs do not survive for 24 weeks.  As a corollary to this condition I have introduced, instead of four-weekly payments as before, a once-off payment under the scheme after it has been demonstrated that the job has survived for 24 weeks.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="428" /> I should, perhaps, mention that this once off payment has the effect of deferring payments under the scheme.  The £3 million provided for the scheme will not be utilised in full in 1984 and the saving will be a contribution towards the cost of the Supplementary Estimate for my Department.</P>
    <P>Finally, I have confined recruitments under the scheme to two per employer. The research undertaken on the scheme suggested that windfall gains were being received by the larger employers in respect of recruitments which would have taken place irrespective of the incentives of the scheme.  These recruitments were mainly in the manufacturing and construction sectors where additional jobs were largely dictated by contracts on-stream. In effect, the employment incentive scheme is now being targeted at the smaller employers where there is a greater prospect at the present time of creating jobs.  The scheme, for example, can be availed of by those persons starting off enterprises under the enterprise allowance scheme.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to one aspect of the work experience programme, the concerns which have been expressed about the displacement effects and the possible exploitation of the young persons who participate.  In order to deal with both points, I have arranged for the introduction of a number of safeguards. In particular, I am arranging for the introduction of a participants' &ldquo;charter&rdquo; under which each young person will be given, before starting a programme, a clear statement of the status of a work experience participant, what conditions apply and details of the actual programme of activities which has been agreed by the placement officer with the sponsoring employer.  I am also arranging that there will be access by trade unions to information regarding the distribution of placements under the programme.</P>

      <P>Employers will have nothing to worry about.  Many of the measures which I have described are for the benefit <Col N="429" /> of young persons.  I would like at this stage to refer briefly to one EEC initiative which has a particular relevance for this category.  An EEC Council resolution of 11 July 1983, on vocational training which incorporates a commitment by member states to provide a &ldquo;social guarantee&rdquo; of vocational preparation and training for young people represents a further significant development in manpower policy for young people.  While it applies to young people generally, the guarantee is directed especially at young people leaving compulsory education and emphasises the need for a period of vocational training on leaving the educational system and subsequently for continued training to enable the development of skills and the improvement of qualifications.</P>
      <P>In March 1984, I assigned responsibility for the co-ordination of measures to meet the guarantee commitment to the Youth Employment Agency.  In adopting the social guarantee into their policy objectives, I asked the agency to apply the guarantee policy at two levels&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  to school leavers at or before inter/group certificate level as a matter of priority</P>
      <P>(ii)  to other young people unemployed and in need of qualifications to secure employment.</P>
      <P>A draft plan for the implementation of the guarantee has now been prepared and the agency propose to have consultations on this draft with relevant State agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On their establishment nearly 20 years ago, the Department of Labour were assigned responsibility for the administration of the worker protection legislation existing at the time.  Much of this legislation dated back to the thirties and it certainly could not be represented as a comprehensive programme aimed at protecting workers in their places of employment. There were some measures governing the conditions of employment of industrial workers and those employed in shops and hotels but, by and large, workers depended for their conditions of employment on their contracts of <Col N="430" /> employment with employers and the outcome of collective bargaining conducted by their unions.  They ploughed their own furrow and fended as best they could for themselves with minimal support from the State in relation to their terms and conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>The late sixties and the seventies saw a surge of worker protection legislation which was sponsored and piloted through the Oireachtas by successive Ministers for Labour, commencing with the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967.  This legislation was soon followed by legislation governing such disparate areas as holidays, minimum notice, the employment of young persons, equal pay, equal opportunity, unfair dismissal and the protection of employment.  We now have an extensive body of worker protection legislation, but one which can still be further developed.  To this end a wide ranging review of the entire body of worker protection legislation is under way.  The purpose of this review is to identify areas where further action is required.</P>
    <P>As the first priority of this review I hope to see enacted, shortly, two further pieces of legislation dealing with hours of work and the protection of workers in insolvency situations.  The Insolvency Bill, which I circulated to this House on 21 May, is designed to protect workers' entitlements in regard to wages and other matters and to ensure that these are paid in situations where employers become insolvent.  The Second Stage of this Bill is due to be taken later today.  My approach, in preparing this Bill, has been directed towards protecting workers to the greatest extent practicable in insolvency situations.  The Bill guarantees the payment, subject to certain limits, of workers' outstanding claims against insolvent employers and, as such, it represents a major advance in the area of worker protection legislation.</P>
    <P>The code of worker protection legislation has been the subject of attack in certain quarters in recent times.  It is often alleged that this legislation is a disincentive to the creation of employment.  I do not accept this line of argument.  What it amounts to is an assertion that our present unemployment problems would be <Col N="431" /> solved &mdash; or even partly solved &mdash; by reverting to earlier <i>laissez-faire</i> attitudes to workers rights, with all the discriminatory and unfair practices which such attitudes involved.</P>
    <P>The Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977 is the target for much of this criticism.  It is maintained that its provisions unduly restrict employers' freedom to dismiss employees who are unsatisfactory or incompetent and that this, in turn, is an inhibiting factor for management in taking on new workers.  Yet, independent reviews and the views of a number of employer organisations have clearly indicated that the Act has encouraged the reform of procedures leading to disciplinary action and dismissal and that agreed disciplinary procedures are undoubtedly having a beneficial effect on industrial relations.  The Act has also had the effect of reducing considerably the number of impulse or personality motivated dismissals and of causing employers to exercise greater care in selecting new employees and in monitoring the performances of existing ones.</P>
    <P>I am reviewing the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, and it will be my aim to ensure that while workers are given full protection in their employment the Act will not operate in such a way as to discourage recruitment.</P>
    <P>There is one other area where the fear of further erosion of living and working conditions prompts policies and actions which would turn back the clock and undermine solid achievement by trade unions and socially progressive Governments, reverting to the law of the jungle. This is the area of employment equality and women's rights generally.</P>
    <P>The enactment of the Equal Pay and Employment Equality Acts marked the culmination of many years of campaigning on the part of women for comprehensive legislation to deal with discrimination against them in employment.  Basic principles such as equal pay for equal work and equality of opportunity are now firmly established, but I am satisfied that there is scope for improving the effectiveness of the equality legislation by removing areas where inequalities, subtle <Col N="432" /> and indirect, but quite significant, continue to exist.  It is my intention to amend both Acts.</P>
    <P>Legislation as an instrument of change has, of course, its limitations and must be supplemented by policies and mechanisms at the national level and more particularly at the level of the workplace to translate legal prescriptions into practical action.  I have, accordingly, decided to seek Government approval for the introduction and implementation of a special programme of action in State bodies which would involve a statement of commitment to equality of opportunity between men and women in the workplace. It is my hope that such a framework would lead to the adoption of similar affirmative action plans, on a voluntary basis, by employers in the private sector.</P>
    <P>Since becoming Minister for Labour, I have adopted a policy where all other things are equal, of appointing women to what have traditionally been male preserves &mdash; in the Labour Court, in appointments to State bodies for which I am responsible and indeed within the Department of Labour.</P>
    <P>I turn next to another aspect of working conditions which, despite the recession, has drawn positive and constructive comment from all sides of the House on those far too rare occasions when it is debated, that is the issue of safety and health of people at work.</P>
    <P>While many improvements have taken place in relation to safety and health at work over the past 20 years we have a long way to go before the position can be described as satisfactory.  Industrial development has been accompanied by increased mechanisation, new technologies, new work methods and processes and a greater range of potentially hazardous substances and agents.  We now have, at this stage of our development, two powerful stimuli for change.</P>
    <P>Firstly, occupational safety and health policies at EEC level have proceeded rapidly in recent years.  We are faced therefore with having to implement Council directives relating to the protection of workers from risks related to chemical, physical and biological agents <Col N="433" /> at work from ionising radiation lead and asbestos.</P>
    <P>These directives have a much wider application than the traditional scope of our domestic safety legislation, and they place strong emphasis on the provision of information to workers on the hazards involved with dangerous agents and medical surveillance during exposure to the agent.  Consequently they will significantly alter our approach to the subject.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Safety Health and Welfare at Work &mdash; the Barrington Report as it is known &mdash; points the way for radical changes at all levels, national, workplace and others, with regard to the whole system relating to safety and health at work.</P>
    <P>Three central proposals underpin the general thrust of the Commission's recommendations. The first is a new framework Act which would contain the basic general principles relating to the safety and health of all workers including the self-employed.  The second concerns the establishment of a new national authority which would have a clear, identifiable and undisputed responsibility for occupational safety and health issues and with which employers, workers and their organisations would be associated as closely as possible.  The third is a massive and sustained exercise of training, education and information at every level.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Commission's analysis of the problem and with the report's general orientation.  It will be no easy task to give effect to all the many recommendations. However, I intend to bring forward proposals, based on the Commission's recommendations, for decision by the Government as early as possible.  I propose to involve the social partners closely with the development of my plans in this area.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn now to the broader question of the EEC.  As the House will be aware Ireland takes over the Presidency of the EEC on 1 July.  I wish to outline briefly what I regard as priority items at the Social Affairs Council of which I shall have the honour of being President from 1 July to end 1984.  My priority items will be &mdash; and this is to place emphasis on various items currently <Col N="434" /> being discussed and considered by the Community are ones we want to initiate ourselves: (1)  Proposed communication on the long-term unemployed; (2)  Draft recommendation on the promotion of positive action for women; (3)  Draft Decision establishing a third joint programme to encourage the exchange of young workers within the Community; (4)  Draft Directive on the protection of workers from the effects of noise; (5) Technical progress on the `Vredeling' draft directive; (6)  Proposed European Poverty Programme.  While this item is the responsibility of the Minister for Social Welfare, it falls within the Social Affairs area at EEC level.</P>
    <P>My priority, in the social affairs area, during the forthcoming Irish Presidency will be the need for a Community-wide initiative throughout the entire ten member states on employment and, specifically, on the difficulties facing the long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>In the social affairs area at community level, over the past few years, the approach has been to give special attention to particular aspects of concern in the employment field, such as youth and women's employment.</P>
    <P>I intend to ensure that continued and strengthened emphasis is placed in areas deserving of this kind of attention during the Irish Presidency.  The most appropriate way in which progress on a major employment initiative may be achieved at European level is currently being examined by my Department.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the EEC with which my Department are concerned is the European Social Fund.  The importance of the fund to Ireland since our accession to the Community has been immense. Social Fund assistance has enabled us to expand dramatically our facilities for training, including the training of the handicapped and to develop other employment-related schemes to a degree that would have been impossible if we had had to rely on our own resources.</P>
    <P>The amount of Social Fund aid approved for Ireland has increased from £4.1 million in 1973 to £124 million for 1983.  A total of over £153 million has now been recommended for approval by <Col N="435" /> the European Social Fund Committee in respect of operations to be carried out in 1984.  I expect that recommendation to be adopted by the European Commission very shortly.  Because of the general Community budgetary difficulties and a very substantial increase in the volume of applications for fund assistance from member states generally, a reduction amounting to about £13.7 million has had to be effected in applications relating to persons over 25.</P>
    <P>To put the matter in perspective, I should point out that, even after the application of the reduction to some of our applications, the total of our expected approvals from the fund in 1984 at about £153 million will be easily the highest amount we have ever secured, representing an increase of £30 million on the total for 1984.  In addition, Ireland's estimated share of the total fund at 11.48 per cent will be the biggest ever percentage, several times in excess of what we would be entitled to receive on the basis of our size and population.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn now to the question of industrial relations.  Many people see industrial relations as an activity based on conflict, a world where confrontation is rife and settlements are reached at the last possible moment, if at all. People holding these views may also be prone to see the answer to our industrial relations problems in much the same light as the problems themselves are seen. That is, as difficulties which may yield to one concerted effort or a single, prolonged negotiating session.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, that is far from being the reality.  Industrial relations is about the behaviour of men and women at work, day-in and day-out.  If these relations are to be positive and amicable, the patient effort and sustained commitment of the parties must be forthcoming. Even then, there will be no idyllic outcomes.  Conflicts of interest will still occur and recur between employer and employee.  These conflicts can be constructively handled, however, where relations of trust have been created and maintained and where structures and <Col N="436" /> procedures are adequate to the tasks at hand.</P>
    <P>The long and involved job of overhauling our system of industrial relations at national level has commenced within my Department.  Discussions are now taking place between my Department, the ICTU and the FUE.  It would be easy to promise a quick and positive conclusion to these discussions.  I know, as do the parties, that these discussions will be prolonged, complex and exacting.  It is my aim to put proposals for reform to the Government in the early part of 1985 based on the outcome of the discussions.</P>
    <P>It has long been apparent that trade union rationalisation would be a major contribution to industrial relations reform.  The representation of a relatively small workforce by a large number of unions has had consequences that have been bad for the trade union movement and for industrial relations at both plant and national level.</P>
    <P>To date, however, the progress achieved has fallen far short of the progress needed.  This is despite the enactment of the Trade Union Act, 1975 which was introduced in order to encourage amalgamations and transfer of engagements among unions.</P>
    <P>I believe that the prospects of progress in this area are more favourable now than they have been for some considerable time.  The difficult operating environment with which unions must now contend, emphasise the defects of existing structures and the advantages of rationalisation.</P>
    <P>While the initiative here must rest largely with trade unions themselves, the Minister for Labour can play an important supportive role.  I am actively considering, therefore, the introduction of legislation to amend the Trade Union Act, 1975.  My aim in doing so would be to strengthen the provisions of the Act thereby improving the incentives available to unions considering or effecting amalgamations or transfers of engagements.</P>
    <P>The Worker Participation (State Enterprise) Act, 1977, marked a significant initiative in the matter of worker participation.  The Act provided for the <Col N="437" /> election of employees to the boards of directors of seven designated State enterprises in order to give employees the opportunity of voicing their views on company business discussed at board meetings and therefore a real say in determining company policy.  It is fair to say that our limited experience with this form of employee participation has been encouraging.  This has been borne out by the chairmen of the designated enterprises and by initial research carried out.</P>
    <P>For this reason and bearing in mind the undertaking in the Programme for Government to examine means of encouraging an extension of industrial democracy, the Government have decided to improve and extend the Act to a further six State enterprises initially &mdash; Aer Rianta, Bord Gáis Éireann, An Foras Forbartha, the National Rehabilitation Board, Irish Steel Limited and the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.</P>
    <P>The Government have also decided that the amending legislation will have provisions requiring State enterprises to establish sub-board structures on a request of a majority of their employees. This will help to achieve the objective of improving and developing communications and involvement at all levels in the enterprise.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of information disclosure a draft code of practice which was prepared in my Department was circulated in June 1981 to the union and employer bodies for their views.  The aim of the code was to improve trade union and employee knowledge of company affairs and to facilitate responsible collective bargaining.  I hope to revive interest in this code and to have discussions with the social partners on its contents.</P>
    <P>I also intent to establish a national advisory committee on worker participation to advise me generally in this area. The terms of reference will include a review of the development of employee participation, encouragement of practical projects and co-ordination of the results of experimentation and the identification of research needs.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the revised draft EEC document on information disclosure <Col N="438" /> known as the Vredeling draft directive.  The proposals have had a very difficult history in the Community since the first draft was presented to the Council in October 1980.  Progress has been unspectacular and there has been a considerable amount of unease and fear among employer organisations and potential investing countries, for example the USA and Japan, at the prospect of a mandatory instrument in the area of information and consultation.</P>
    <P>I am anxious during my Presidency to advance this particular proposal and have given a lot of thought to how best to achieve it.  The major task is to bring the proposals to the stage at which political decisions can be taken.  My first step is to identify the technical problems which have precluded progress being made. Once identified, it is my intention to have them discussed at a working party within the Council which will also be asked to come up with solutions to the problems identified in time to be considered at the formal meeting of the Council in December of this year.  In this way, I intend to pave the way for early decisions on this urgent, important but long drawn out matter.</P>
    <P>I hope in this brief review, in which I have not covered everything, that I have covered at least the main issues of interest to Deputies.  If they want additional information on any of the matters I have discussed or anything else I will be happy to supply it.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that other Deputies are anxious to contribute and as we are on limited time I do not want to hog all of the time available to me. Obviously, the introduction of the Estimate by the Minister has stimulated discussion and a number of ideas.  First of all, I should say that this is the first Estimate introduced by the present Minister in this House and I wish him well in his office there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed at some of the content of his introduction of this Estimate, at some of the omissions and the lack of concrete proposals in the whole area of <Col N="439" /> unemployment.  We are discussing this Estimate in a week in which the Intermediate and Leaving Certificate examinations are concluding and this will bring our unemployment numbers higher than they would have been at the beginning of this month.  I will not put a figure on it because to do that would be to raise emotions, but it is substantially greater than the official figures.  Early in his speech the Minister referred to the climate and prospects being better than the official estimates of recent months indicate. I hope that his optimism is justified. I am not sure on what grounds or criteria he is basing those optimistic forecasts. He does not back them up.  I hope he is not depending on emigration as a solution to the problem.  It is significant that he did not mention that when introducing his Estimate.</P>
    <P>As the months have gone by I have been thinking more and more that the unemployment situation here calls for the establishment of a department of employment with special responsibility assigned to a Minister.  I have no doubts that the Minister and the House will agree with me because in difficult situations such as this the Minister for Labour often has not the clout, power, strength or control to do the many things he would like to do to help the employment situation. Some things he can do, yes.  I am speaking as a member of a Government at a time when prospects were far better and brighter than they are now.  In a situation such as the present one the Minister for Labour needs more control over industrial development and the job creation programme in his bridge-building between industrial development, job creation and, of course, training and placement. Employment must have top priority in this decade and for many decades to come.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed to hear the Minister say in the course of his speech that arrangements were in hand for preparing a major initiative on the employment front for our Presidency of the EEC.  I am surprised that this has been allowed to run so late.  We assume the Presidency of the EEC on 1 July.  July and August <Col N="440" /> traditionally in European terms have been months of little or no progress, so we are left with four months of the year. If this Government were serious or had the dynamism the Minister asserts they have, whatever programme is intended in the employment area would have been well prepared and researched by now and ready to go on next week when we assume the Presidency.  I said during the recent election campaign that the whole future of the EEC depends on how we face up to the unemployment problem at Community level.  It is a major problem for our country and for the Community. If at this late stage we are told by the Minister for Labour that preparations are in hand for announcing a major initiative by the Community, then I say that that should have been prepared and ready and surely could have had a first airing at this week's meeting of the Summit in France.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I believe that a department of employment under the specific control of one Minister is called for.  It must extend even further.  It must go beyond the employed into the area of unemployment.  If there is anything in the Minister's speech that is welcome, it is that he has a concern for the long-term unemployed. However, when he talks about more surveys and investigations, I tell him that the Manpower Consultative Committee, which I established some years back, has issued a report laying heavy emphasis on the problems of long-term unemployment and highlighting the fact that unemployment cushioning, so to speak, by way of money payments is heavily loaded in the earlier months but, unfortunately, as the unemployment period lengthens it becomes very lightly loaded and is causing poverty. The urgency of tackling this adult unemployment situation is increasing month by month.</P>
    <P>About 70 per cent of the live register figure represents the adult unemployed yet only 25 per cent of those taking part in AnCO training programmes are adults.  However, the theme of redressing that situation has been evident through the Minister's speech.  I support him in his efforts in that direction.  We are talking <Col N="441" /> about a matter of great urgency and while it involves other Ministers too I would hope that my words would lend support to the Minister in his efforts to deal with the situation.  A new poverty grouping is being introduced in our cities and towns and we must do something to redress the balance.</P>
    <P>I regret that the placement surveys of the Department have not been allocated what I would consider to be adequate financial resources this year.  I refer to the NMS.  The inadequacy of the funding to that service is stifling the effect and efficient functioning of what is one of our most important agencies, an agency who are striving to place young and adult people alike in employment.  Consequently, there should be no shortage of funds in that area.  I offer that as a criticism. I welcome the appointment recently of the director of the Manpower Services but unfortunately industrial relations difficulties are having some impact.  The responsibility for resolving those difficulties rest with the Minister just as such responsibility rested with me when I had responsibility for the Department. I do not intend going into the question of who is right or who is wrong but it is a situation that must be resolved by the Minister in the interest of those who are seeking work.  The inadequacy of funding for the NMS is of particular concern when one hears the allegation made from time to time that other State agenceis are funded more than adequately.</P>
    <P>I support and welcome the enterprise agency scheme but while I welcome the fact that the scheme has been responsible for the placing of 2,000 people I should not like the Minister to be over-optimistic because this figure represents only a minute percentage of the total unemployed. However, the scheme is a good one and it should be supported but there is a long way to go.</P>
    <P>I understand that there will be debate later in the week on the Report of the Committee on Public Expenditure.  That committee have given some attention to the matter of centralised expenditure. There can be no substitute for the Minister's Department being the central agency because it is an area in which the <Col N="442" /> Minister can have the greatest impact. He can decide whether information is satisfactory and if there is a need for change he can make that change more quickly than would be the case of another centralised agency.  I would support any effort on his part to ensure there is a co-ordinating role played by the Department in this matter.  I do not wish to be critical of any of the agencies.  It has been said that I was over-critical in this House of the Youth Employment Agency but I shall not criticise any agency who are trying to do a job in extremely difficult times.  However, there must be room for improvement in each of the various agencies. There are some who say, for example, that there are aspects of AnCO that could be improved but that agency have been doing an excellent job in the whole area of training.  We must be careful however, that they do not begin training for the sake of training.  We all appreciate that there must be training where training is needed, especially in the area of high technology.  We must all direct our efforts towards continuing to attract the high-technology industries.  Fianna Fáil in office in the second half of the seventies set their sights on procuring those hightechnology industries which today are contributing so much to our exports.  It is very important that that policy be continued.</P>
    <P>I am putting industrial relations on a higher scale of priority than the Minister has done.  Perhaps I erred in the past, too, but this area is not one that should be discussed last when we are dealing with an Estimate for the Department of Labour.  We do not have sufficient time in the House for discussing industrial relations.  It is well known that at times of high unemployment industrial relations are a little more happy than is the case at other times but that does not take from the fact that good and happy industrial relation should be an essential part of our lifestyle.  The community working together is a more important factor now than it ever was before and it is in that context that I am disappointed to hear the Minister say that talks in this area will be slow and that he expects the matter to be brought before the Government in <Col N="443" /> 1985.  I am not blaming the Minister for the delay.  We are very reluctant to make changes in this area.  I am sure the Minister would wish to be able to bring about the changes within a short time but there are two sides &mdash; trade unions and management &mdash; and each can be fearful of change where no such fear should exist. What we are talking about is finding a better way forward.  There is no point in saying we have good industrial relations when they are not good.</P>
    <P>I did not have the time during the recent European elections campaign to be critical of the Minister but he would appear to be standing back from the long drawn out gas dispute in my city.  I considered the Minister to have stood much further back from the problem than I or any of my predecessors would have done. Another very difficult dispute affecting the southern capital is the one at Campbell Catering.  I shall not say any more about that other than that it is a dispute which, when it has concluded, may merit special investigation.  I am not apportioning blame but that dispute should be ended quickly.  I have heard, too, of a strike at Leo Laboratories and there is the situation at Hanleys in Rooskey which is affecting employment in the west.  The Minister has a responsibility to ensure that disputes do not occur.  There is a bus dispute in Dublin and I am concerned and disappointed that a dispute should be taking place in one agency of the Department, the National Manpower Service.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed, too, that the Minister omitted to refer to the situation regarding the 3 per cent employment quota in the public service in respect of handicapped persons.  While I appreciate that there is an embargo on recruitment, I hardly think that the handicapped or the disabled should be mistreated.  Special attention should be paid to these people.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us what proportion of the 3 per cent quota has been achieved.  The deadline in that respect was reached some time ago.</P>
    <P>I regard the Department of Labour as being very human in their approach to such groups and bearing that in mind I <Col N="444" /> would encourage the Minister to take steps in respect of a matter that was brought to my attention more forcibly than ever before during the recent elections campaign.  Access to voting is important.  One of the facts which came to my notice was the lack of attention paid to polling stations by the powers that be.  In some areas polling stations do not have easy access.  I know it is not the responsibility of the Minister but he should ask the Minister responsible to take an urgent look at access to polling stations.  We do not know when the Government will be going to the country. It could be months or weeks.  The direction should be given now to returning officers to provide polling stations with easy access particularly for disabled persons.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to conditions of employment.  There has been very little progress in that area.  Safety in industry is a vitally important area but again there is little progress there.  The Minister made a passing reference to the Barrington Commission which recommended worth-while positive proposals.  The Minister referred to the necessity for the co-operation of both sides of industry in introducing safety regulations and legislation. I accept the need for that is urgent. We cannot be happy until there are no injuries or deaths at work places.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced changes in the employment schemes operated by his Department.  I welcome the decision to extend the employment incentives scheme to most activities.  I appreciate the reason for not paying until the end of the 24 week period but that may be counter-productive.  Could the Minister not have adopted a measure which would be half-way between the two: achieve what he wants to do and ensure that jobs are created?  I hope the Minister does not adopt the right wing Fine Gael attitude when he said that part of the reason for doing it was to save money for the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he confined recruitment under this scheme to two people per employer.  Is this right?  The needs of an employer may vary.  The Minister should explain why he did this.  No matter <Col N="445" /> what number of employees there are, is it still two?  In other words, is it two per 1,000 employees and still two if there are only five employees?</P>
    <P>The EEC Council resolution on vocational training which incorporated a commitment by member states to provide a social guarantee of vocational preparation and training of young people was passed in July.  I urge the YEA to come up with something positive.  Young people are asking what the Government are prepared to do for them.  To date they have done damn little.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave his priorities as regards legislation and Ireland's Presidency of the Council.  It is proposed to have a communication on the long-term unemployed.  That is fine, but we all know the problem.  I urge action rather than communications.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the delicacy and difficulties attached to the draft directive.  I had a document prepared when I was Minister. There is need for greater co-operation with workers and for a greater flow of information.  We must be careful that we do not prohibit or prevent industries from coming here.  Their fears are more often than not the fear of the unknown. However, in this time of high unemployment it will be extremely serious if we hold up any company that might be inclined to come here.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the most appropriate way in which progress on a major employment initiative may be achieved at European level is currently being examined.  That is something for the Irish Presidency, but if it is being currently examined it has not been given the priority it should have been given.  I am amazed that there is no reference to CERT or the hotel deal in which the Minister was deeply involved.  Some questions were asked in the House about it because CIE were under the aegis of the Department of Transport.</P>
    <P>Why is there no reference to CERT who provide excellent training?  When they were under threat from the Department of Finance some years ago, for the wrong reasons, I am proud to say they were rescued and saved by a former now deceased chairman of the body.  Since <Col N="446" /> then CERT have performed efficiently and effectively.  They provide excellent opportunities for young people in the services industry and in hotel and catering areas.  There is still great potential in that area which has not been fully realised. I was proud to be the Minister who presided over the giving of funds for their new centre in Roebuck.  I am disappointed that a successor of mine did not see fit to refer to a body which contributed so much and who handled the whole deal regarding the CIE group of hotels.  CERT were replaced by a new body when there was a change of Ministers. I am not sure whether the Minister owns the hotels, if the Department own them, if the new body owns them or who owns them.  The House is entitled to know the position with regard to them. It is only fair that this new Minister, whose first decision was in relation to these hotels, should spell out clearly what has happened.  Obviously there was some confusion between the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Finance because some of their public announcements did not agree.  I am surprised no reference was made to the transfer of the CERT hotels.  The public at large and the employees in particular are entitled to know what is happening, because the jobs involved are most important.  I am asking the Minister to clear up this point. What moneys were paid over and by whom?  I am talking about the debts which had been incurred by CIE hotels and what financial arrangements had been made.  I am surprised that no reference was made to these matters in the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House because there are many speakers who wish to contribute but I appreciate the reasons for allocating such a short time to the discussion of this Estimate.  I wish the Minister well but, as a public relations exercise, presentation is no excuse for performance.  We want employment but I believe the Government must consider setting up a Department of employment with a Minister for employment presiding over all aspects of jobs, job creation, development, training, placement and unemployment.  There is a greater need <Col N="447" /> for such a Department now than ever before.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few brief comments on this Estimate.  It is unfortunate that the time allocated for such an important Estimate is limited because I am sure many Members wish to comment on what is a fundamental and extremely serious problem confronting the Government and the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Labour in his long address has got his priorities right by identifying the importance of unemployment and the concern people have expressed in regard to dealing with this problem.  The presentation of the various schemes and Government agencies which deal with unemployment and its solutions have to be co-ordinated and a presentation which is not confusing must be got across to the public.  There seems to be total confusion in the minds of the public as to which agency is responsible for what kind of employment, what scheme relates to particular areas and where the money comes from to fund these operations.</P>
      <P>We have had discussions and media reports about young people being unemployed, people being made redundant and the necessity to provide the structures which will give hope to future generations. As technology advances there is a great difficulty facing the person who for many years worked in a factory or any other employment, but who, without any other qualifications, will find it very difficult to be placed in alternative employment. Young people from the ages of 18 to 25 years are willing to give every kind of employment a chance.  They are willing to try different kinds of employment if necessary.  The old idea of leaving school with a qualification which would give one a job for life has gone.  Nowadays people are prepared to take breaks from their chosen careers and move to different types of employment.  If a middle-aged person is made redundant this can create very serious problems because more than likely he will have family responsibilities with financial constraints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Youth Employment Agency recently circulated facts about young <Col N="448" /> people.  The numbers placed belie the conventional wisdom that is abroad, because between 1980 and 1982 75 per cent of young people entering the labour market were employed by the following May.  In the same years, 50 per cent of those who left school without any qualification were still out of work by the following May.  The importance of staying in education until one has acquired a qualification has been brought to light by that report.</P>
    <P>The Government face some very fundamental decisions, and one relates principally to taxation.  Various reports on taxation have been produced over the last few years.  There is a certain amount of capital available in this country for investment, but people are afraid to produce this money because they may have to pay tax on one source or another. When one speaks to people who have money in building societies, where amounts are not disclosed, one realises there is a certain amount of capital available and if people were given an incentive to use this money to create employment it would benefit the country.  Under the present system some people are able to write off vast amounts of assessed profit against new machinery or property.  This leads to further personal benefit rather than being to the benefit of the country. If this capital could be made available without fear of having to pay tax on it, it would help to solve the national problem.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent appointment of the director of the National Manpower Service.  Young people coming to public representatives say they are not as pleased as they might be with this service. The placement officers do the best they can but with over 2,000 or 3,000 people on the lists in some offices, young people say they have never been contacted subsequent to an interview or calling into a National Manpower Service office.  Many employers do not contact the service for a variety of reasons.  They may choose to find an employee from the &ldquo;grapevine&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The controversy between AnCO and the National Manpower Service needs to be sorted out.  I welcome the Government's decision to appoint a Minister of State with direct responsibility for this <Col N="449" /> area.  I am sure clearly defined lines as to the responsibility of these bodies will be drawn.  The Dáil committee recently commented on this matter.  The AnCO LINC Programme leaves certain questions to be asked.  The statutory responsibility of the apprenticeship scheme and the AnCO residential courses are first-class and the people who acquire these qualifications are a credit to the organisation. But when one examines the promotion of the AnCO programme, one assumes that in a six weeks or 12 weeks course a similar qualification can be achieved through the training of unemployed people in various crafts and in different types of work.</P>
    <P>If it is possible to train a young person to produce a certain quantity of saleable goods in 12 weeks or 14 weeks one begins to question the quality of training courses, particularly residential if such a person does not succeed.  It is fair to say that the end result of AnCO-linked courses must also be questioned.  Many people have started businesses as a result of such courses but they have fallen down on the administrative end afterwards: they have not been trained in the knowhow to avail of the various marketing opportunities available to help them to sell their goods in competition.  Many people who have completed such AnCO-linked courses have very limited incomes from what they produce and in many cases they have had to fall back on social welfare assistance.</P>
    <P>In February the managing director of the IDA stated that we face a jobless society because of automation.  That is a myth that must be exploded.  A whole new vocabulary is available to the younger generation.  With the introduction of the microchip there is a whole new wisdom abroad.  We have been told that automation will mean massive new unemployment.  That is not true.  Indeed the opposite has been the effect in the US and in Japan, for instance.  The Government should consider seriously the figures given in the IDA report in the spring which stated that between 1973 and 1981 in the US, with a population of 280 million, 15 million new jobs were <Col N="450" /> created and that in the same years in Japan, with a population of 115 million, 3.2 million jobs were created.  In the same years, in the nine member states of the EEC, which has a population of 260 million, only 600,000 net new jobs were created.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Government must have a fundamental new look at how jobs can be created here, looking particularly at professional services, business, banks, insurance companies, health and leisure services, and education.  In such services there is an important avenue towards more employment for any Government who have the initiative and the drive that are necessary.  If we look at the international figures we will realise that we can do much better than we are doing.</P>
    <P>I suppose the staff in the Department of Labour would number about 500 or 600 and AnCO employ several thousand. Therefore, the relationship between the Department and the various State agencies run by the Department needs to be reviewed.  I agree with Deputy Gene Fitzgerald that the Minister for Labour should assume greater management in the employment creation field.  His Department hold the key to the creation of a better society.  Many young people are castigated for what they are supposed to be today, but when they are given the lead and opportunities to develop their talents we find they are much better than preceding generations of young people.  The gap in their education and training is apparent and needs to be examined.  They need encouragement from the Government to ensure that they will not drift away but that their energies and talents will be employed for the benefit of the nation.  The Government must also ensure that they will not be taxed out of existence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister and wish him well in the formidable task in front of him.  Like Deputies Fitzgerald and Kenny, I suggest that the numerous agencies throughout the country should be concentrated in a central body for which the Department of Labour will be responsible.  I have spoken to young people who have to plough <Col N="451" /> through the information gathered from the various training agencies and I have learned that there is a need for such a central co-ordinating agency to enable young people to benefit from the various training programmes.</P>
      <P>I am sorry to say that I do not sense any urgency in the Minister's statement. It is only a summary of the information available in the Department of Labour. Indeed, I am frightened at the prospects the Minister holds out for young people, and for democracy in Ireland.  It is all very well to criticise young people.  They have expectations and we in the Dáil have a duty to show them that something will be available for them.  The Minister's speech does not suggest a coherent plan to help our young people at a time when there is urgency about producing a radical plan to create employment for them. Thousands of young people have been doing examinations, and accepting that many of them will be going on to third level education many thousands will be coming on the labour market, but this Estimate offers them very little hope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had great interest in a work experience programme because I had great hope for a programme AnCO had been carrying on.  As an engineer and architect I became interested in a number of young people coming out of the regional colleges.  I do not have to tell the Minister about the bad state of the building industry and how many people associated with it are suffering, but one feels bitter when one sees the number of young technicians coming out of the regional colleges without work experience.  With the Mayo county manager, I organised a work experience course for a number of such technicians. They were interviewed, but unfortunately they were told that money was not available to continue with the programme. That programme would have done much good for the young people concerned.  They complain that when they go for such interviews they are asked about their work experience, and they are in the dilemma that they are unable to get such experience unless they can avail of work experience programmes <Col N="452" /> like that about which I have been speaking. It is an indictment of AnCO that for a programme like this, which was one of the first, there were no funds available. It is incumbent on me not to let this opportunity pass without congratulating AnCO on the tremendous job which they have done, particularly in youth training. In Mayo most of this work is carried out in the construction industry.  I congratulate those in charge of this programme in Mayo and Sligo for their very fine work over the last couple of years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny spoke very briefly about the LINC Programme.  This was started in west Cork, Wicklow and south Mayo.  There were certain criticisms of the methods used for recruiting and of some of the people recruited.  In general, as Deputy Kenny said, the programme was very satisfactory.  It is unfortunate that it is rumoured to have ceased in west Cork and to be about to stop in Mayo.  I should like that programme extended, particularly to north Mayo.  A number of community bodies have been looking for this extension for a long time, but there is no sign of it for north Mayo.  Could the Minister consider the possibility of meeting this request?</P>
    <P>In company with the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, last night I attended a meeting of Ballina Trades Council. While a certain amount of optimism is expressed in the Minister's opening remarks here, around the table last night the mood was nothing short of pessimistic. A survey on unemployment has been carried out by them over the last number of months and the figures are absolutely startling.  This is an area which, according to the national media, has done well but the facts are that the percentage of unemployed in the north Mayo region is now considerably higher than the national average and is approaching crisis point. Trade unionists last night expressed a despair for the future of the young people, particularly in the Ballina area.</P>
    <P>With regard to the employment incentive scheme, I support the remarks of Deputy Fitzgerald and ask the Minister to reconsider the number to be admitted. I accept the thinking behind the Minister's decision that only two extra be taken <Col N="453" /> on per employer but while I agree that some employers abuse the scheme there is no doubt that it has helped considerably to boost employment, particularly in the smaller businesses.  I ask for, perhaps, a phased number of employees.  The smaller the number, the more could be taken on and that would help.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister thinks with only half the year gone, that, he will have £3 million unexpended on the scheme.  This is defeatist and I would ask him to have his officials pursue the scheme.  The Minister has received me very sympathatically in relation to some of the conditions which apply to that scheme.  I have referred to an individual, his own managing director and sales director, who asked me if it was better for him to fill up the forms or to be out selling.  Could the Minister examine some of the provisions attached to the premium and relax, if possible, some of these conditions which are tying down the small employer?  In many cases these people cannot afford to employ bookkeepers and extra staff.  They are their own bookkeepers, managing directors and sales staff.  It is more important for them to be out on the job of selling, keeping more in employment, than to be filling up forms.  I do not see this programme as giving any hope to many thousands of young people.  An Estimate such as this should be allotted much more time, because there are many Members who would like to contribute.  When the business of the House is being ordered later, the idea of a proper discussion on an Estimate which is so important particularly in present times, should be considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the House, first, for the co-operative and constructive manner in which this Estimate has been discussed. I appreciate the concern of the Deputies about the time constraints which confine them as well as myself.  In this connection, I refer to CERT and OIE.  Constraints of time prevented my referring to these bodies and there was no other reason for their omission.  A Supplementary Estimate is due to come <Col N="454" /> in in that regard and I intend then to discuss the entire matter.  I can assure Deputy Fitzgerald, whom I should congratulate on his recent election, that the position is quite clear.  The Government decided not to sell off the hotels to private enterprise on the advice of many people. That decision is welcomed by the people in the industry in general and in particular by the workers.  I suspect it is also welcomed by the majority of Opposition Deputies.  Having made this decision, they opted to transfer ownership of the hotels to CERT.  Following detailed discussions with that body, it was considered that, in order to maintain CERT's separate and independent relationship with the entire hotel industry, it would be incongruous for CERT to be operating on a day-to-day basis a particular hotel chain and at the same time providing neutral professional services to other hotels.</P>
      <P>For that reason, our formula was evolved with the full co-operation of the CERT council, their chief executive and chairman &mdash; people well known to Deputy Fitzgerald and, indeed, to Deputy Calleary.  The day-to-day running of the company would be the responsibility of the new board which would be appointed by me in consultation with CERT and their two members from the council of CERT on the board of OIE. This would provide a satisfactory triangular relationship.  That is merely to clarify the point which Deputy Fitzgerald raised.  There will be an opportunity for the House to discuss this matter in full at a later stage and it would be better to wait until then.</P>
      <P>Equally, it goes without saying that the work of CERT is recognised by me as of such value and importance that I was particularly anxious that it should maintain its independence <i>vis-à-vis</i> the OIE hotels in order to be in a position to continue the good work which Deputy Fitzgerald rightly praised.  I should like to be associated with his comments in that latter regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of points have been made which I shall take very quickly and briefly and respond to as succinctly as possible. Both Deputy Fitzgerald and Deputy <Col N="455" /> Kenny referred to the question of co-ordination. When I was appointed Minister for Labour, simultaneously the Minister of State at the Department of Labour was appointed also as Minister of State at the Department of Education, with the specific task of attempting to co-ordinate these areas.  As I have said, the report is completed.  I did not give it much time, again for reasons of constraints of time and because the House will be discussing, on next Thursday afternoon, a report of its own public expenditure committee on this matter. The Minister of State will be taking the debate as far as this Department are concerned. He has chaired the working party on the report and has had extensive consultation with the various groups involved and it is amazing to see the wide range of groups who feel that they have a role to play in this area.</P>
    <P>I invite the House to be fully frank and highly constructive in their criticism in this area.  As Deputy Fitzgerald will recognise, there is a territorial conflict, so to speak, between different bureaucrats in different organisations.  That conflict was present before this administration took over and if we as politicians do not resolve it, it will continue.  I invite the House to give a clear indication to the bureaucrats and the incumbent office holders of the day, in this instance myself, as legislators responsible and accountable to the public, having to answer for the taxpayers' money, of what it wants. Proposals will be put forward in the expenditure committee's own document. Armed with those proposals, we can finalise and knock into shape aspects of centralisation and co-ordination.</P>
    <P>There should be a clear transition from school to work.  The interface of training is the responsibility of the manpower agencies in general terms.  The National Manpower Service should have a direct link with every school.  Every child leaving school should be contacted in advance by the National Manpower Service.  The options open to them should be pointed out to them either directly by the NMS, or a career guidance teacher within the school, or some designated body.  This <Col N="456" /> should all be done in a co-ordinated manner so that parents will know there is an orderly progression from school to training with the prospect of work.  I strongly support the comments made by Deputy Kenny and Deputy Fitzgerald.</P>
    <P>I am quite confident that within the next month or so we will have clarification in relation to co-ordination.  All Members of the House will recognise what I am asking for, clear political guidance as to what Members of the Oireachtas would like.  There are other views which are bureaucratic in their nature.  I want to turn to the overall optimism I was attempting to generate in the debate. We face horrendous problems, but we are running a real risk of making bad problems worse by over-dramatising them and by exaggerating them and not taking comfort from some of the signs, small as they may be, that things are not getting worse but possibly beginning to improve.  We have enough problems without inventing ones which do not exist.</P>
    <P>There is a perception that none of the young people who are now relaxing having finished their leaving or intermediate certificates will get jobs.  As Deputy Kenny pointed out, the vast majority of them will get jobs.  All these surveys and research show that the more qualifications and the higher the level of education they have, the better their percentage chance is of getting a job.  It is up to us to make the resources available in the most efficient manner and to ensure that their educational and training requirements are met.  For that we need the co-operation of the schools.  Schools must recognise that they have a greater responsibility to orientate children towards opportunities for work than perhaps was the tradition in the past.  This is a matter for the co-ordination exercise which will be undertaken and completed by my colleague, Deputy Birmingham, the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>We still have unsatisfactory industrial relations.  Deputy Fitzgerald was correct when he said that difficult economic times tend to improve the margins, but the level of man days lost or person days lost &mdash; because women lose work as well as a <Col N="457" /> result of strikes &mdash; is far too high.  The statistics do not give the full picture in relation to loss of productivity in ongoing disputes, or where there are bad relations and the productivity potential of an enterprise is not properly harnessed.</P>
    <P>It is not the job of the Minister for Labour to become an industrial relations negotiator.  The former Minister for Labour will recognise that all too often both sides to a dispute and the public in particular think it is the job of the Minister for Labour to solve every strike which goes beyond a certain point.  That is not our job.  We are not trained to do that job and, if we are forced into doing it, we may be getting in the way and perhaps making difficult if not impossible the task of those whose job it is to resolve industrial disputes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the job of the Minister for Labour to ensure that the machinery to resolve industrial disputes operates smoothly, effectively and efficiently.  I refer to the Labour Court and the related agencies and the conciliation officers. During the course of the discussions now taking place with both the social partners &mdash; the deadline is 1984 &mdash; I will come forward with a package of proposals to update and improve the industrial relations machinery.  There is a clear distinction between the responsibility of the Minister for Labour, whoever that person may be, to provide an efficient framework to resolve specific conflicts.  We cannot afford to continue with bad industrial relations or, worse still, a perception of bad industrial relations on the part of prospective customers for products we sell abroad or prospective investors.  This may be preventing us from getting a share of the international market which would go a long way towards solving the problem of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the area of worker protection legislation there is a need to co-ordinate the legislation which has grown up over the years.  I referred to that in my speech and I will not repeat it.  Deputy Fitzgerald raised the question of the employment incentive scheme.  He made a reasonable <Col N="458" /> point about payments.  A series of recommendations by the Department was announced previously and communicated to both sides.  I take Deputy Fitzgerald's point.  If they are administrative arrangements, they can be altered. The purpose of the scheme is to provide extra employment.  If the attempted revision and improvement, with less bureaucracy on both sides and the money coming in a lump sum, is counter-productive, we will change it.  As soon as Deputies have direct experience that this is what is happening on the ground, I invite them to give me their views and we will respond accordingly.  There is nothing magical about the regulations.  They are designed to be as streamlined and as supportive as possible.  I have no doubt that we have not got it 100 per cent right.  Probably some aspects of it will not work out as we intended.  If it emerges that that is the case, I invite Deputies to inform me of it, because they are out in the field, so to speak.  I will welcome that information and I will respond accordingly.</P>
    <P>The whole question of the EEC was raised.  Deputy Fitzgerald talked about our incoming Presidency.  He was correct in recognising that I have a particular concern for the long-term unemployed. If we get a major upturn in economic activity in western Europe many of the 13 million people who are currently unemployed will not get work.  That is the reality.  We will not put 13 million people back to work within the next two or three years no matter how we try. People who have been unemployed for a long time will have additional difficulties. During our term in the Presidency we will concentrate in part on the question of developing measures at EEC level to assist people who are in a particularly acute situation.</P>
    <P>We have not gone half far enough in our attitude to equality between men and women.  For some time to come men will have to discriminate positively in favour of women in certain key areas to redress the historical balance, for which this generation of men are not responsible but which undoubtedly colours their attitude. I make no apology for the fact that I have consciously pursued a policy within my <Col N="459" /> Department in areas where I have discretion to appoint people.  In appointing suitably qualified people I give preference to women because there must be a programme of affirmative action in that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Dún Laoghaire</i>): The available monthly indicators of the trends in unemployment are the live register statistics.  These statistics are based on the result of a count of all persons who, on the last Friday of the month, were claimants for unemployment <Col N="460" /> benefit or applicants for unemployment assistance and of other persons who were signing the register on that day, mainly those signing to obtain credited social insurance contributions.  The live register figure used is the total count excluding (a)  small-holders (b)  persons 65 years of age and over and (c)  persons on systematic short-time.  A separate count of the latter category is also published.</P>
      <P>The statistics are an accurate measurement of the numbers of persons on the live register on the reference Friday.  The content and classification follows the recommendation of the Interdepartmental Study Group on Unemployment Statistics published in 1979.  Following that report, a number of additional analyses have been introduced to utilise more fully the statistical information available from the live register.</P>

Secondly, will the Minister of State tell us the present position in relation to the new council which the Taoiseach, in what appeared to me to be a panic measure, set up following the discovery of the missing £500 million in our balance of payments?

I favour more comprehensive information with regard to statistics and any suggestions or statistics that can be given in producing better figures would be welcome.  The Taoiseach and the Department are anxious to update figures and to get them out more quickly so that we might have a better idea as to the exact numbers involved.

Is the Minister aware that at a meeting three weeks later, on 22 November, the Public Services Committee dissociated themselves from the remarks of the Minister for the Public Service and issued a public statement to this effect in regard to discussions here regarding the 19 per cent payments to Oireachtas Members, judges and Ministers.</P>

They were concerned lest the public should think they were in receipt of this increase and they pointed out that the increase applicable to public servants was 5 per cent under the last agreement and 4.75 per cent under the current agreement.

However, the average cost to the Exchequer of the pay of a public service employee, including basic pay, overtime, allowances and employer's PRSI contributions, is estimated at £11,000 in 1983 and £11,900 in 1984.  These estimates are based on the provisional budget outturn for 1983 and amounts included for pay in the 1984 Estimates for Public Services exclusive of the contingency provision for certain pay increases in Vote 50.  The figures given relate to the non-industrial civil service, teachers, Defence Forces, Garda and health employees.  In order to ensure comparability, pay costs of staff transferred to An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann have been excluded.  I would emphasise that the figure for 1984 is necessarily very provisional.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The essential feature of the new procedures are as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  All appointments to posts at the <Col N="466" /> level of secretary, deputy secretary and assistant secretary (including non-general service posts) will be made by the Government (in the case of secretaries), or by the appropriate Minister, with the sanction of the Minister for the Public Service (in the case of other grades), following consideration of a recommendation by an Appointments Committee made on the basis of the fitness of the person for the post.</P>
    <P>(b)  the Appointments Committee consists of the Secretary (for the time being) to the Government who acts as chairman.  Mr. Dermot Nally is currently Secretary to the Government; the Secretary (for the time being) of the Department of the Public Service. Mr. Kevin Murphy, is currently Secretary of the Department of the Public Service; the Chairman (for the time being) of the Public Service Advisory Council.  The current Chairman is Dr. Liam St. J. Devlin; two secretaries of Departments chosen by the Taoiseach, after consultation with the Minister for the Public Service, for such period as the Taoiseach may determine.  (The two secretaries at present serving are the Secretary, Department of Agriculture &mdash; Mr. James O'Mahony &mdash; and the Secretary, Department of Energy &mdash; Mr. Joseph Holloway &mdash; and they will serve on the Committee for three years); and on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, the outgoing secretary of a Department, for the appointment of his successor. The Department of the Public Service provides the secretariat to the Appointments Committee.</P>
    <P>(c)  The committee will review, on a regular basis, information on, and assessments of, staff at the appropriate levels in Departments generally and will, as vacancies occur, recommend, with the assistance of specialists, if it so requires, the manner in which they should be filled and the persons to be appointed.</P>
    <P>The committee will, of course, be free to recommend that any particular posts be filled by open competition.  Likewise the committee, in picking the best person for the post, will do so irrespective of <Col N="467" /> Department, background or speciality, thereby bringing to an end the dual structure &mdash; a system under which professionals and non-professionals have their own career structures.</P>
    <P>The Appointments Committee have a purely advisory role.  The power of decision remains with the Government, or the Minister concerned, with the approval of the Minister for the Public Service, as appropriate.</P>
    <P>(d)  Secretaries appointed under the new system (including the Chairman of the Office of Public Works) will serve for a period of not more than seven years.</P>
    <P>Secretaries of Departments appointed in future must retire from the Civil Service at the age of 60.  However, officers aged 55 or over on the date the new scheme starts will continue to be eligible for appointment as Secretary but, if appointed, will have to retire after five years and, in any event, on reaching the age of 65.</P>
    <P>The Government consider this new scheme to be of major importance in the commitment to public service reform. Likewise, the new scheme is a first step towards improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the Civil Service in which senior management plays a key role.</P>

      <P>I want to confine my questions to the major appointments of senior civil servants because the latter half of the Minister's reply related to promotional aspects, which I presume are matters to be negotiated by the trade unions.  Do the Appointments Committee make recommendations to the Government or the Minister or do they submit a list from which the Government or the Minister may select somebody?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This proposal now being implemented for senior appointments to anybody looking at it dispassionately must represent a major step forward in restructuring the Civil Service at that level.  Its object is to terminate the dual structure which was there from the beginning in relation to professionals and non-professionals and to ensure that the most suitable candidate gets the job.  For that reason the whole area has been opened up to allow people who up to now would not have been in the running for these senior posts to be considered.  The logic of the argument is that at the end of the day the committee will be in a position to recommend to the Government the person most suited to fill a vacant post.</P>

      <P>The Minister must agree that this method of appointment does not have anything whatever to do with opening it up to everyone.  The Minister could open it up to everyone and have the appointments in the hands of the Civil Service Commission system or some other independent system.  Surely the Minister cannot expect the House to believe that he, or the Government, will not be politically prejudiced in making appointments of senior civil servants? What will be the position of senior civil servants if a new Government take office?  If another Government made that decision how would the Minister feel <Col N="469" /> when he took office?  Surely this changes the whole purpose of the Civil Service? Will the Minister agree that we should go back to the system of an independent commission to make senior appointments?</P>

      <P>I suggest to the Deputy that Governments do not make changes for the sake of making changes.  In making that statement I am speaking of successive Governments in respect of this issue.  They endeavour to introduce schemes which will serve the public.  In this case we are concerned about appointments at the highest level of the public service.  Those people play a very important role in the life of our people.  The system now in operation is for the time being reckoned to be the best system that can be introduced to ensure what the Government are setting out to do, to provide the best service possible in the public service.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the need to contain public service numbers, the number of vacancies to be filled in the Civil Service in 1984 would normally be small. I would expect that the schemes which I recently announced, for job sharing and career breaks for serving civil servants, will increase the number of vacancies by an amount which cannot as yet be foreseen.</P>
      <P>However, the position at present is that there are more than sufficient qualified candidates available from competitions held in 1983 to fill vacancies in 1984 for clerical assistants on clerical and shorthand typing duties and for adult executive officers.  In view of the stress laid by the Dáil Committee on Public Expenditure &mdash; in their recent interim report on recruitment by the Civil Service Commission &mdash; on the importance of avoiding unnecessary examinations and achieving maximum cost-effectiveness, the holding of these competitions in 1984 could not be justified.  Accordingly, I announced on 6 April that the Government had decided not to hold them this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will, of course, be several other <Col N="471" /> Civil Service competitions, including those for executive officer (school-leaver), clerical officer and clerical assistant (typing).  Further competitions will be held also, as the need arises.</P>

      <P>The question refers to &ldquo;recent storms&rdquo; but the question was tabled last January and has only reached the top of the pile now for answer.  The difficulties that arose in January have been dealt with since.  Following two weeks of very bad weather in January a lot of damage was done to cages, moorings and nets.  There was also considerable stock loss by those running fish farms in Connemara.  Has the Minister estimated the amount of the damage on that occasion?  Can the Minister take any steps to assist the various fish farms that suffered such heavy losses during the past winter?</P>

The major damage was caused to Beirtreach Teo. and to the mussel farm in Killary including structural damage to 20 rafts, moorings being dragged and the loss of the 1984 crop to the tune of about 100 tonnes. I can make this long list of damage caused available to the Deputy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="473" /> Insurance companies, as the Deputy is aware, provide cover for damage to stock, equipment and so on.  The BIM mariculture grant scheme does not provide assistance but seeks to ensure that recipients of grants under the scheme have insurance cover.

      <P>I am fully aware of the anxiety of fishermen about the risk of accidents arising from the activities of submarines within the exclusive fishery limits of the State, especially since the sinking of the trawler <i>Sharelga</i> by a British submarine in April 1982.  However, the freedom of the high seas has always been a fundamental principle of international maritime law.  I am not in a position to introduce legislation which would conflict with that principle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>

He will be further aware that, under the United Nations Law of the Sea Conference, he has authority to introduce certain controls here on such activities. Can the Minister indicate what action he proposes to take in regard to controlling the areas which we can under the International Law of the Sea Conference?

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

      <P>I should inform the House that, since the April 1982 incident, which resulted in the sinking of the <i>Sharelga</i>, my Department, the Taoiseach's Office and the Departments of Communications, Defence and Foreign Affairs have been made aware of this danger to fishing boats.  May I say that the rule in relation to the freedom of the seas, laid down by international law, applies also to territorial seas?  While a coastal State has sovereign rights these are subject to the freedom of all ships, including naval vessels, to traverse the territorial seas so long as they do not act in a manner which is prejudicial to the peace, good order and security of that coastal State.  In relation to naval vessels, including submarines, this would require that they be navigated so as to avoid coming in contact with underwater cables, pipelines, fishing gear and so on.  In relation to that all we are asking is that they use our waters bearing in mind the safety of the people using them also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must be aware that while there are certain freedoms, there are also certain restrictions and that he can introduce legislation or regulations here to control these activities, and to demand certain things of them under the existing Law of the Sea Conference.  Does the Minister propose to deal with this specific area and to take further action to deal with the other problems which arise outside our territorial waters?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must be aware that the Law of the Sea Conference defined very clearly what one can and cannot do, and one can introduce restrictions to control activities, to ensure that ships fly flags and other things by which they can be identified.

      <P>In relation to the flying of flags and other matters to which the Deputy referred, I should say that these are a normal day-to-day, accepted criteria for the good order of movement of traffic in our waters and around our coasts.  But when there is a situation in which some unknown vessel &mdash; like that of the submarine in the <i>Sharelga</i> incident &mdash; traverses our waters one can introduce as many laws as one likes and be in breach of as many international laws as one likes but it will not cure the problem, of which the Deputy is quite well aware.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a possibility that they may not cure it.  But certainly there are some restrictions that could be introduced and some action that can be taken under the Law of the Sea Conference.

The terms of reference of this group are: to examine <Col N="480" /> and identify available means to secure immediate increased sales of fish, both fresh and processed, on home and export markets and, in doing so, to secure higher returns to the primary producer and the processor.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the market potential in Japan for fish and fishery products. Exports of Irish fishery products to Japan have increased from £38,000 in 1981 to £844,000 in 1983.  I recently visited Japan with officials of BIM in order to carry out an examination of the market potential there.  I am satisfied that there are good prospects for an expansion of exports of Irish fish products to that market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot confirm that. However, I may say that it has been the subject of discussion and interest is now being shown in exporting whole mackerel to Japan.  To what extent it will be successful I am not in a position to state at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister optimistic that, when he meets Japanese businessmen who are due here in the very near future, this meeting may help toward a resolution of the serious problem we have in relation to mackerel at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope that it would meet with some success.  When I talked with these people in Japan I was glad to know that their experience in dealing with Irish exporters to date has been one of satisfaction, that they are very happy with the quality of the product, the continuity of supply and so on. Our exporters to Japan have created a very good impression for us.  Therefore I would hope we would be able to make some headway in relation to an expansion of that market.  As I have said, specifically this matter has been discussed and will continue to be so hopefully until we reach a satisfactory conclusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry the action he is taking to ensure that oysters and other shellfish are not contaminated by discharges from public sewage systems operated by local authorities in coastal areas; and if he will make a statement on the oyster beds in the inner Galway Bay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obviously concerned that commercial shellfish resources should not be subjected to sewage contamination which, though not harmful to shellfish, would render them unsuitable <Col N="482" /> for direct human consumption and so jeopardise their marketability.</P>
      <P>The Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, gives responsibility for the control of sewage discharges from land based sources to the local authority into whose functional area the discharge takes place.  However, local authorities engaged in the provision of new sewerage schemes involving a discharge of coastal waters are invariably obliged to obtain a foreshore licence from the Minister for Communications in respect of outfall facilities.  My Department are consulted regarding all foreshore licence applications and may object to any proposal which is considered to constitute a threat to fishery interests.  Such action is necessary only in a minority of cases.</P>
      <P>I am well aware of the importance of the commercial oyster beds in the inner part of Galway Bay, and of their potential for development.  My Department are currently engaged in investigations intended to ensure that this resource is not jeopardised by proposed sewage discharges in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me ask the Minister if he is confining his reply to Question No. 13 regarding the sewerage scheme for which his Department have given their approval for discharge, will that approval also apply to future extensions of that scheme or will it be necessary for the local authority to seek a new licence in the event of a second phase being added to a sewerage scheme which previously had a licence for a smaller discharge?  Is there any quantification?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would feel that the application for a licence would depend, first of all, on whether there was a change of location &mdash; for example, in relation to the outfall at the discharge point. Obviously, that would necessitate applying for a new licence.  In relation to increased volume of the sewage, it would depend on the conditions applying to the original licence.  If it was felt that the maximum had been exceeded that would be damaging to the prospects of development adjacent to the outfall point, it would depend on the conditions attaching to the licence.</P>

Is the Minister aware that about eight or nine months was spent designing this sewerage scheme to discharge at Sallins Point and that due to local objectors &mdash; the Department of Fisheries and Forestry may have come in later &mdash; the fact was brought to light that this scheme was at an advanced stage and proposed to discharge into an oyster bed which would have been destroyed by it, and that this was being supported by the Minister's Department and other State agencies?</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the distressing features of the present recession has been the number of companies which have been forced to cease trading because of insolvency and the consequent loss of employment involved.  To lose one's job is a traumatic experience at any time.  It is more unacceptable still when one's employer simply goes out of business and is unable to pay even the most basic entitlements.  We have all heard of the sad cases where workers who suddenly found themselves out of a job went to collect their wages only to be told that there was no money in the kitty to pay them.  There have been cases too where workers were given cheques which could not be honoured.  I sometimes wonder about the degree of consideration which some employers give to the welfare of their workers when financial difficulties loom.  Most employers, I am sure, take all the steps necessary to protect their workforce in such situations. Equally I am sure that there are other employers who afford a low level of priority to the just claims on them by their employees.  When workers enter into a contract of employment with an employer and give of their labours to that employment we must accept that, by so doing, they build up rights and entitlements. <Col N="569" /> The Bill before the House gives further formal recognition to this fact.</P>
    <P>This Bill is designed to protect workers' entitlements in regard to wages and other matters and to ensure that these are paid in situations where employers become insolvent.  My approach to this Bill has been directed towards protecting workers to the greatest extent practicable in insolvency situations. The existing redundancy payments legislation provides a degree of financial compensation for those losing their jobs and this Bill will ensure that this compensation is complemented by protection for the employee of his normal entitlements in regard to wages, minimum notice, holidays and similar payments.</P>
    <P>While workers already enjoy priority in respect of certain claims under the Companies and Bankruptcy Acts in winding up and bankruptcy situations, these priorities afford little or no protection in cases where there are no assets available for distribution or where assets are inadequate.  Even where adequate assets are available, people often have to endure long delays, sometimes as long as 18 months, while the liquidator or receiver is attempting to dispose of these assets and then they must take their place in the queue behind financial institutions and other secured creditors.  This Bill guarantees the payment, subject to certain limits, of workers' outstanding claims and, as such, it represents a major advance in the area of worker protection legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill will also give effect to the provisions of an EEC directive which contains measures to protect workers in insolvency situations.  Workers have been entitled to claim for the benefits set out in the directive as from 22 October 1983 and I am providing in the Bill for the payment of claims relating to pay in insolvency cases arising on or after that date. What I mean is that it is from the time a receiver or liquidator was appointed on 22 October or any date subsequent to that the entitlements and rights come into effect within this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains detailed provisions in section 1 to cover the various types of <Col N="570" /> insolvency situations which can arise.  It also outlines the criteria to be used to determine when an employer will be regarded as being insolvent.  As the date of the insolvency will be of vital importance for the calculation of amounts due, the Bill specifies, in section 4, the date on which an employer will be regarded as having become insolvent.  Section 4 will also enable me to specify by regulations the circumstances in which employers who are of a class or description specified in the regulations are to be taken to have become insolvent.  This provision will enable me to cover situations which might arise where no formal winding up or bankruptcy proceedings are initiated. Tragically in many cases that is what happens. Companies literally disappear and employers do not turn up.</P>
    <P>The EEC directive to which I have referred requires the setting up of a fund &mdash; referred to in the directive as a guarantee institution &mdash; which will guarantee the payment of employees' outstanding claims relating to pay and I propose to extend the existing redundancy fund to meet this requirement.  In my view this is the simplest and most satisfactory way of doing so.  The extended fund will be known as the Redundancy and Employers' Insolvency Fund and this retitling is provided for in section 2 of the Bill.  The redundancy fund is financed by way of contributions from employers, including the Government in its role as an employer and this will continue to be the case with the extended fund.  The increase of .49 per cent in the employers' PRSI contribution rate, announced in the budget includes provision to cover the anticipated expenditure in insolvency cases.  It is difficult to predict what the expenditure from the fund in respect of the claims covered by this Bill will be, but the income of the combined fund should be adequate to meet liabilities under the Redundancy Acts and this legislation for some time to come.  Given that workers are unlikely to be in a position to continue to work for long periods without remuneration, I consider that in the majority of cases, claims in respect of ordinary pay should not be substantial. The experience in the United Kingdom, <Col N="571" /> where a similar fund is in operation, has been that the major items of expenditure are in respect of minimum notice and holiday pay.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that the Bill will apply to those in employment which is insurable for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts.  The effect of this will be that the benefits provided for in the Bill will be available to those who are covered by the Redundancy Payments Acts.  At present these Acts apply only to persons who work 20 hours or more a week for the same employer, although employers pay contributions to the redundancy fund in respect of people who work 18 hours a week and over.  Eighteen hours is also the limit for eligibility under the Social Welfare Acts and this is the threshold I propose to adopt for the purposes of this Bill.  I have also provided in the Bill at sections 11 and 12 for the reduction of the thresholds operated in a number of other pieces of worker protection legislation to 18 hours.  These changes involve a reduction from 20 hours in the case of the Redundancy Payments Acts and from 21 hours in the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973 and the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977.  These changes will secure the harmonisation of the eligibility thresholds for protection under the various Acts.  The changes are also in line with present trends in European Community labour practice.</P>
    <P>Since the circulation of the Bill there has been some criticism of the fact that it will apply only to those who work for 18 hours or more per week and it has been suggested that, as a result, the Bill might not meet with the requirements of the EEC directive.  During the negotiations on the directive in Brussels most member states took the line that they should be in a position to exclude certain categories of workers from its scope where the protection proposed would be unnecessary, impractical or impossible to administer.  The basic approach adopted by this country was to exclude workers not covered by the Redundancy Payments Acts.  Because of difficulties in agreeing on exclusions it was decided to provide for these in an annex to the directive <Col N="572" /> rather than in the body of the directive. Among the categories whose exclusion is provided for in the case of this country are persons who normally work for less than 18 hours a week for one or more employers and who do not derive their basic means of subsistence from this work.  As I mentioned already, 18 hours is the eligibility threshold under the Social Welfare Acts and I feel that it would be impractical to operate a lower threshold for the purposes of the directive. In my view payments should be made from the fund only to workers whose employers pay contributions to the fund on their behalf, that is those who are fully insurable under the Social Welfare Acts.  I am taking power in the Bill, however, to enable me to extend the protection being provided to cover other categories of employees should I consider this to be desirable at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 and 6 outline the payments which will be made from the fund.  While the EEC directive refers specifically to outstanding claims relating to pay, it allows member states freedom to adopt their own definition of this term.  I am providing in the Bill for the payment of claims in respect of the following: wages, arrears of statutory minimum wages, holiday pay, payments on foot of company sick pay schemes, entitlements under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, the Employment Equality Act, 1977, the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, and outstanding contributions to company pension schemes.  A limit of eight weeks will operate in the case of wages, holiday pay and amounts due under company sick pay schemes.  This is fully in line with the terms of the EEC directive.  The directive also allows member states the option of setting a ceiling on the weekly amounts which will be paid.  As the measures provided for in the Bill are tied in, in many ways, with the Redundancy Payments Acts, I propose to limit the amount of payments, where these are related to wages, to the amount provided for in the Redundancy Payments Acts.  At present this limit is £211.54 a week.  I will of course be keeping the limit under review &mdash; the Bill <Col N="573" /> gives me power to revise it and also to vary the period of weeks in respect of which payments will be made.  A limit of 12 months contributions will operate in respect of unpaid contributions to company pension schemes.  The payments which I am providing for in the Bill go further than the requirements of the EEC directive in a number of areas &mdash; for example, payments relating to company sick pay schemes, unfair dismissals and pension contributions.  I regard this extension of the basic requirements of the directive as essential in the context of the needs of the Irish working people.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure the smooth operation of the provisions of the Bill I am providing that the officer appointed in connection with an employer's insolvency &mdash; for example, a liquidator or receiver &mdash; will be required to supply certain information and perform certain duties in relation to the amounts being claimed by employees or by those competent to act on behalf of a pension scheme.  These duties will mainly involve certification that amounts claimed are due and arranging for the completion of various forms.  These forms are referred to in the Bill as prescribed forms and will be set out in regulations which I will be making when the Bill has been passed.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides in section 8 that persons who have applied for payments in respect of wages, sick pay, holiday pay or arrears of pension contributions may, within a period of six weeks beginning on the day on which the decision on the application was communicated to them, or if that is not reasonably practicable, within such further period as the Employment Appeals Tribunal considers reasonable, present a complaint to the tribunal that no payment has been made or that any payment made was less than the amount which should have been paid. This appeals procedure will not extend to entitlements under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, the Unfair Dismissals Act, the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, the Employment Equality Act or in respect of arrears of statutory minimum wages under the Industrial Relations Acts, as disagreement in relation to the amounts involved <Col N="574" /> is unlikely to arise in such cases.  The question of providing for appeals by employers or their representatives was raised in the consultations with employer interests when the Bill was being prepared. While I agree that an argument can be made for providing for appeals by employers or their representatives in order to protect the interests of other creditors, I have decided not to provide for such appeals.  A major consideration in arriving at this decision was that to allow for such appeals would cause undue delay in the making of payments to employees and the purpose of the legislation is to protect the interests of working people.  If such appeals were provided for, it would be necessary to defer making payments until appeals had been determined or the time for lodging appeals had expired, and the whole purpose of the legislation would have been undermined.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, workers enjoy priority in regard to certain payments when winding-up proceedings are taking place in accordance with the Companies Acts or in bankruptcy situations under the Bankruptcy Acts.  I am providing in the Bill in section 9, for the transfer to me of any priorities which exist in respect of amounts paid to the employee from the fund, so that the fund can be reimbursed in cases where money is available on the distribution of the employer's assets.  This could take place as late as 18 months after the declaration of insolvency.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections of the Bill provide for the production of records and information, offences and penalties for offences, the making of regulations and other standard provisions.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing for the protection of workers' claims relating to pay, the EEC directive also imposes an obligation on member states to protect workers' interests in the matter of company pension schemes.  I am very concerned that the entitlements of employees under company pension schemes should be protected.  As I mentioned earlier, I am providing in the Bill for the payment from the fund of unpaid contributions to such schemes.</P>
    <P>I have given very detailed consideration <Col N="575" /> to the question of how workers' rights under company pension schemes could best be safeguarded and have come to the conclusion that it would be unwise to take further action in relation to pension schemes in this Bill, in advance of proposals for a national income-related pension scheme which are at present under consideration by my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare.  As Deputies will be aware, that Minister told the House in December last that it was part of the Programme for Government to initiate a national income-related pension scheme and that proposals in this regard would be published in the form of a White Paper.  He said it was the intention that the proposals would include the establishment of a pensions board representative of all the interests involved, including trade union organisations.  This board would advise on the standards and conditions which should apply in occupational pension schemes and have the subsequent task of overseeing the development of these schemes in line with whatever standards might be adopted. The Minister also said that it was envisaged that the overall question of security of occupational pension schemes and the protection of benefits against inflation would be among the matters to be examined.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that this is a very complex area and that it is essential that all aspects of company pension arrangements be thoroughly and carefully examined.  It is only prudent to have the position researched in full rather than making some hasty provision which might not afford full protection to workers' rights.  I consider that the statement by my colleague in regard to a national income-related pension scheme taken together with the conditions and requirements which must be met at present in order that employers and employees can obtain the benefits of the various tax concessions operated by the Revenue Commissioners in respect of contributions to pension schemes, will meet the requirements of the EEC directive in this regard.  I will, however, maintain the closest possible liaison with my colleague, <Col N="576" /> the Minister for Social Welfare, in this matter.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents a very significant and worthwhile addition to existing worker protection legislation and comes at a time when tragically far too many workers and employers have experienced the traumatic impact of insolvency.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>To lose one's job at any time is a traumatic and serious blow not only for the individual but for his family but this can also have repercussions on the social fabric of our society and how people who lose their jobs contend with this new situation.  No compensation is ever adequate, but where some financial compensation is available it helps to soften the blow and helps a person to face the new situation.</P>
      <P>The principle of this Bill helps to alleviate the problem which has arisen for so many workers in recent times.  We will not prevent the passage of this Bill.  We will support this measure but will question a number of sections and perhaps seek to make some amendments.  The main purpose of this Bill is to provide payment of employees' rights on insolvency, liquidation and so on.  I am assuming that the section concerned covers all eventualities and that the relevant dates will meet the situations as they occur. The Minister outlined the compensation that will be available for the various losses that can be incurred by the employees but I am not happy with his approach to the pension situation.  I suggest that it is further window-dressing when the Minister says that no action will be taken in this respect until the national income-related pension scheme is introduced by this Government.  At the present rate of progress that will not be introduced for some time yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can only cite a very sad case of former employees of Murphy's Brewery in Cork. Many of the employees had been in receipt of company pensions when the company went into receivership.  The receiver refused to accept any responsibility for payment of pensions which morally were due to the employees.  Although a purchaser <Col N="577" /> was found and most of the jobs were saved, accommodation was not made for the pensioners.  The provisions of the Bill will not meet such a situation and it is rather surprising that a Labour Minister should say we must await a national pensions scheme.  One might expect an improvement in the position following Labour's abysmal failure at the recent elections, but I would not be optimistic.</P>
    <P>The Redundancy Fund is now being retitled.  That is understandable.  It is to be combined with a new fund and I understand we are talking about a 0.49 per cent employers' contribution.  Can the Minister tell us the present state of the Redundancy Fund, how much is in it, and whether a substantial additional sum from employers will be needed?  Can the Minister tell us if the fund is at adequate financial strength and if, when the time comes, the Government will make up any shortfall?  It seems unfortunate that employers would appear to be asked to finance the shortcomings of ailing or cowboy companies.</P>
    <P>The Bill became necessary because of an October 1983 EEC directive and the Minister should consider whether that directive is appropriate or suitable for conditions here.  In view of the many known cases of job losses through insolvencies in Ireland, the Minister, I suggest, should make implementation of the directive date from January instead of October 1983.  I do not think there is anything in the directive to prevent that. Earlier implementation would be an added bonus for workers affected by insolvencies and I hope the Minister will consider that, between now and Committee Stage.  I am sure there have been instances of employers disappearing, in which case there would not be receivership. I hope the Bill covers such situations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure comes late after the closure through liquidation of many companies, leaving many employees in a very bad state.  It is unfortunate that company law has not been altered though we were promised drastic changes last autumn.  There does not <Col N="578" /> appear to be any advance towards introduction of such legislation.  This Bill implements an EEC directive and is only a minimum provision pending major changes in company law to give protection to workers who should have the first priority from liquidators for the remuneration they deserve for their contributions to production.  This Bill does not provide such adequate protection for workers.  We are all aware of the need to protect workers against insolvencies and liquidations and from the operations of fly-by-night employers who can go insolvent deliberately to deprive workers of their rights.  This has been typical of some of the smaller companies, but workers and the public have had very little protection from them.</P>
      <P>It should not devolve on employers generally and on the Government to make up for the losses of criminal activities of many companies.  The limit of the amount which can be paid per week under this Bill is too restricted.  It covers only eight weeks and imposes a maximum limit of £1,688 for a worker.  Under the old, bad, inept 1963 Companies Act the limit was £300 in 1963 values.  That limit excluded statutory entitlements to redundancy. That was approximately 25 times the average industrial wage in 1963. Twenty-five times the present average industrial wage would be in the region of £4,000, so this Bill is giving about half the total entitlement of workers under the 1963 Act.  Confined to eight weeks, it makes the amount £211.54p which results in a total entitlement of £1,688 &mdash; half the total sum under the old Act.  The Minister should examine those figures again because, with continuing inflation, what will the situation be in three to four years' time?  It is already way behind what should be given.  There are many other EEC directives which have not been implemented.  Presumably the Government will be proceeding to implement these, also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that the economy is booming or lifting and everything is going great but, nevertheless, that unemployment will continue to increase considerably.  In other words, the new form of boom will mean more unemployment.  There will be <Col N="579" /> more small company closures, more redundancies, insolvencies and so forth which will require the protection of the law.</P>
    <P>As far as I understand it, this Bill goes back only to autumn of 1983.  The directive dates from about three years previous to that and I ask the Minister to backdate the Bill to 1981.  Very many workers have suffered very severely and are still suffering because of the total loss of all possible assets during that time and some compensation is due to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is one which I welcome.  It is required because the increasing number of insolvencies over the last number of years have cut short people's basic entitlements.  There are technical and detailed aspects of the Bill which require further refining on Committee Stage.  It is important that we deal with the question of insolvency in general and of preferential creditors.  Money payable out of this fund will go to the employees who have been short-changed.  The Minister for Labour will then step in as the preferential creditor in this instance. We must examine the current situation in relation to unsecured creditors and others who are in difficulties in the event of insolvencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I should like to put some points on insolvency generally on the record. Many small companies here, especially in the manufacturing area as we have seen in our work on the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Small Businesses, are the unsecured creditors of today.  In the event of receiverships, insolvencies, liquidations, or even voluntary winding up of companies, they are the very last to get money which they are owed.  Their money is put into whatever they supply and there is no recoupment.  Therefore, we should talk not just about the needs of former employees but about the whole area of insolvency.  As was the case with the PMPA, small unsecured creditors and trading companies should have the right to appoint an administrator to recoup their losses.  The whole question of preferential status should be reviewed.  In many cases the winners of that status are <Col N="580" /> the banks who in many instances have circumvented preferential status by looking for personal guarantees from small firms and other creditors.  The importance of preferential status should be downgraded.  All who are owed should be paid so much in the pound, as opposed to strong people like the banks getting all.  There would be no need for this legislation, perhaps, if every creditor got his fair share.</P>
    <P>Second, application for an administrator in the event of insolvency should be available to small companies who are creditors.  My principal concern is in relation to employers' PRSI payments. At the moment, they stand at 12.5 per cent, which is excessively high.  In Nigel Lawson's budget in the UK this year, the employers' contribution to social insurance is being abolished.  I totally endorse the view that employers' PRSI is a tax on employment.  There is nothing that the employer gets from this contribution. The employee, rightly, is covered in the event of becoming sick or unemployed, for unemployment, disability, occupational injuries benefit and also for pension purposes.  The employers' PRSI bring about the black economy.  If employers take on staff for in excess of 18 hours, they must pay 12.5 per cent for nothing.  This amounts to £11.50 on an average wage.  No wonder the employers look for every trick of the loop to avoid paying this.</P>
    <P>In this year's budget the employers PRSI contribution was increased by .49 per cent.  I understand that .02 per cent of the employers' PRSI contribution will be used for this fund.  These contributions are going in the wrong direction and are out of line with our EURO competitors. We are not in isolation in a free trading situation.  This fund presents employers with a further burden.</P>
    <P>I have some specific concern about the Bill and the way this fund could be open-ended.  I am subject to correction because I did not have the time to study this in the manner I would like to have studied it, but from an early perusal of the Bill, and from discussions I have had with certain people, it seems to me that some matters are as yet unclarified.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="581" /> What is meant by insolvency?  Does it mean a receivership?  Does it mean a voluntary liquidation?  Does it mean a liquidation in the form of stripping all the assets and appointing a liquidator?  Could it be a judgment registered against a particular company by a creditor, and a petition to the court, not necessarily meaning that the company would not survive?</P>
    <P>The broader the definition of insolvency the more demands there will be on the fund.  There is no solid, watertight definition of insolvency in the 1963 Companies Act, or in the various amending Acts.  This Bill is based on quicksand.  We are extending a weak definition and this could create major difficulties.  While particular terms of insolvency are defined, if we look at sections 2 and 3 of the 1963 Companies Act we see that insolvency is a loose term.</P>
    <P>If we take the widest possible view or interpretation of insolvency, we could very quickly have a run of demands on the fund set up under this Bill.  This would mean that the .02 per cent contribution out of the employer's PRSI was totally inaccurate to cater for the needs.  This bring me back to my original fear that if .02 per cent is inadequate, the PRSI contributions will have to rise.  When the Minister is replying to Second Stage, I hope he will answer my question about the definition of insolvency.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with a whole series of debts which are applicable under the Bill and covers holiday pay, redundancy, unfair dismissal payments and so on, and ordinary pay awards.  I have a slight fear about the wording of section 5.  I understand that the contractual terms of employment, that is, the contractual arrangement between the employer and the employee, are in line with the EEC directive.  In relation to holiday pay, the definition is far too wide and needs to be tightened up so that only statutory holiday pay is covered.  The Bill should specify that it is only statutory holiday pay.</P>
    <P>There could be collusion between the employer and the employee to maximise the benefit from this fund on a shared basis.  I know there are penalties for collusion, but some very convincing stories <Col N="582" /> could be told which, morally speaking, would not stand up.  There should be no possibility of arguments or differences of interpretation.  Statutory holiday pay as laid down in the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1977 should be the norm and the standard under section 5.</P>
    <P>I have a slight concern that, under the procedure whereby the Minister recoups the money paid out from this fund to employees because of the liquidation or the insolvency, there might be areas where the Minister would fall short in his collection and therefore the fund would be at a loss.  The Minister pays out £X to the claimants upon the fund and when he acts as a preferential creditor to recoup that money he may find that there is a shortfall.  My concern about the Minister falling short is that that can be financed only in two ways: by a general loss to the Exchequer, or an increase in the PRSI contributions.  Both of those are undesirable.</P>
    <P>The area where this may happen is in relation to the anti-discrimination and employment equality legislation.  I do not believe section 285 of the Companies Act has been amended sufficiently to cover this point.  It has been amended sufficiently to cover unfair dismissals and redundancy legislation.  It should be specified in this Bill that there will be an amendment to the Companies Act whereby amounts which have to be paid for damages, pay awards, and whatever, under the anti-discrimination legislation can be made good.  There is a weakness in section 9 dealing with rights and remedies and I would like to see it tightened up.  It is only in the area of employment equality legislation that I see this problem.</P>
    <P>I will give two examples where the Minister may fall short when he comes to recoup the money as a preferential creditor. The first is that the upper limit which can be claimed by the Minister on behalf of any single employee on the fund is £2,500 per employee.  Even given the redundancy ceiling of £211.54 per week, it is technically possible that the amount owed to the employee may be in excess of that.  There is no upper limit on the fund itself.  In other words, company X <Col N="583" /> goes bust and Mr. Murphy is owed £2,800 by his former employer who has not got it.  He goes to the fund under this Bill and gets £2,800.  In recouping that in the insolvency situation, the Minister can recoup only £2,500.  That should be amended because we get back to the same problem of a drain on the fund and an increase in PRSI.  The upper limit should apply equally in both situations so that whatever maximum the claimant can get from the fund, the Minister can get the same maximum as the preferential creditor.</P>
    <P>The second example is that if, as often happens in a liquidation &mdash; and this is a most important point &mdash; a person is owed £25,000 as a preferential creditor and, on settlement of all creditors, having stripped the assets or sold the company as a growing concern, the settlement is only so much in the £.  If it is anything less than 100p in the £ there is an obvious loss to the Exchequer.  The claim from the worker is £2,000 for holiday pay, or redundancy, or whatever, and the fund pays out £2,000.  The Minister's total claim on behalf of all the employees may be £20,000.  The bank is owed money and the Revenue Commissioners are owed money.  At the end of the day every creditor gets 33p in the £, and the Minister will get only one-third of the money he is looking for.  In this instance the upper limit which the Minister can claim is £2,500 and in a creditor situation one has to settle for so many pence in the pound. The effect of this measure will be that the employers' PRSI contribution will have to increase to 14 per cent.  This is anomalous and discriminatory and it should be considered again.  Everything should be <i>pro rata.</i> Whatever an employee or group of employees can claim from the fund, the Minister should be able to claim no more or no less.  I should like to see the Bill amended.</P>
    <P>I have a general reservation about the Bill, namely, in relation to the speculator, the cowboy and the fly-by-night who will see this Bill as another opportunity to run a horse and cart through the Act dealing with limited liability.  Underlying all of this is the problem of limited liability. <Col N="584" /> It is quite outrageous the way delinquent directors can make such an abuse of employees and creditors simply by flouting the weakness in the law dealing with companies and limited liability. The speculators and the rogues will look at this Bill for its potential for abuse.  In many instances Irish subsidiaries of American, British or continental parent companies are surviving on a day-to-day basis of injections of capital and subventions from their parent company.  This type of legislation could make such companies think about pulling out the plug in the knowledge that they could run away from their responsibilities.  A weakness of the Bill is that there are no sections to cover the more subtle form of abuse that is possible.  As we have seen with other Acts dealing with insolvency, people are very adept at finding loopholes.  There should be a major reform of the Act dealing with companies and the whole matter of collusion between employers and employees will have to be tightened up.</P>
    <P>In section 6 occupational pensions schemes are covered as part of the debts owing.  I should like to hear the Minister justify this.  I understand there have been submissions to the Minister that this should be deleted.  I have an open mind on the matter but I consider that pension schemes are different from current payments immediately owing by an employer.  They are separate in terms of their form and type of payment and they should be reviewed separately.</P>
    <P>With regard to this Bill, my major fear is that we have missed the point.  We must ask ourselves why so many people who become insolvent can start up operations within a week.  Europe and the western world is suffering from a grave recession but the question must be asked by so many people who were registered in the ITB magazine, who were in <i>Stubbs Gazette,</i> very quickly find themselves in new companies.  Frequently people do this several times without getting caught. In the United States in the small firms area the success rate of two out of ten is acceptable.  There are people who honestly fail because of some marketing error or for some other reason.  I am not talking <Col N="585" /> about them.  I am talking about the vultures of the commercial world, about people who deliberately shift assets and capital out of one company into another, leaving a debt-ridden company in their wake.  All the other legitimate concerns are left holding the baby while the culprit is trading again in a new company and making a sizeable living.</P>
    <P>The legislation we are proposing, if taken in isolation, will be weak unless we have a new Companies Act.  The Act dealing with limited liability needs to be tightened up.  Delinquent directors should be made personally liable for debts and they should be barred from managing any company for ten years as determined by the courts.  There would not be the need for this type of legislation if there were stringent measures that could be taken against delinquent directors.</P>
    <P>There is nothing wrong with protecting employees and giving them their honest due but it is unfair if the Minister should step in and act as a preferential creditor on their behalf.  The genuine traders who give credit should not get less money in the pound simply because legislation is brought in to protect employees but not to protect unsecured creditors.  It is very unfair that the banks, and now the employees, should be treated as preferential creditors.  We must also take account of the major domino effect here. If a large company goes bankrupt owing sums of £20,000 or £30,000, a series of smaller companies who are creditors of that firm will also go bankrupt.  I welcome the Bill and support it but there should be a tightening up of the Act dealing with limited liability to deal with delinquent directors and there should also be the appointment of an administrator to deal with small firms and unsecured creditors. Thus, as in the instance of the PMPA, they could have some chance of getting their money.</P>
    <P>Another reason for this Bill is due to the operations of the banks and the question of personal guarantees.  In my opinion personal guarantees are outdated. Company law was introduced to set up the corporate body where personal guarantees were obsolete.  The banks are so <Col N="586" /> powerful they are circumventing that and insisting on personal guarantees and this is why employees and unsecured creditors are left high and dry.  I should like personal guarantees to be dropped.</P>
    <P>My overriding concern is that the employers' share of PRSI contributions standing at 12½ per cent are a tax on employment.  If the Minister looks at trends in other countries he will see that there is a move away from a disincentive form of tax on employment.  I fear that the fund will run short very quickly, that what he recoups will be less than he pays out and that, very quickly, the 0.2 per cent share which was part of the 49 per cent increase in the employer's share of PRSI in this year's budget will be well short.  The net effect will be that next year and the year after, because of this legislation, employers' PRSI will be increased.  I believe it is still possible to have a good Bill passed through this House and also to overcome that problem. I hope the Minister in his reply and on Committee Stage will be able to meet the specific points I made to tighten up the Bill to make it self-financing so that everybody gets their entitlements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is overdue.  My grievance is in relation to the date on which the legislation applies &mdash; in other words, when the company becomes insolvent or on 22 October 1983.  I fully appreciate the difficulty the Minister has in fixing any date going back as far as 1983 since there will always be arguments about the date on which it should apply.  Deputy Fitzgerald suggested that any time in 1983 should suffice and Deputy Mac Giolla suggested it should go back as far as 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that in the last year or so there have been a number of closures causing severe hardship in many cases to employees who for one reason or another have lost out substantially in relation to payments which are morally, if not legally, due to them. I wish to make the case very briefly regarding Kilrush Pottery, to emphasise the importance of that industry and the hardship which many people suffered as a result of its closure.  The plant had been <Col N="587" /> in operation for 20 years and there were highly skilled people employed there. Eighty-seven former employees of the plant took their case for payment to the Employment Appeals Tribunal and were awarded £25,941.  Because of the fact that this legislation applies to companies which closed in October 1983 they will lose out by a few weeks in relation to the amount awarded.  It is not clear at this stage whether that will arise, because until such time as their assets are realised and preferential creditors are paid they may have at least some prospect of getting that money.  However, it is recognised by everybody involved that there is a distinct possibility that they will not get a substantial amount of the money due to them.</P>
    <P>The reasons have already been pointed out in an Adjournment debate why Kilrush Pottery are a special case.  In relation to the date which the Minister has fixed, 22 October 1983, it would be more suitable if he had decided that the effective date should be when the company is finally wound up.  This may lead to delays in some cases but in the case of Kilrush Pottery it is likely that there may be some money available to pay the employees the money that is due to them.  However, it may not all be available when the company is wound up and it would be desirable if, in the event of £10,000, £15,000 or £20,000 still being due to those employees at the final winding up date by the receiver, it would be at that stage possible to lodge a claim on the fund for whatever amounts by way of minimum notice, holiday pay or whatever statutory payments may be due and that that could be claimed from that fund.  When everything is concluded and completed, there should be something in the legislation to allow for outstanding payments to be made by way of the fund.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the other points in the Bill can be dealt with on Committee Stage although I am not sure that the Minister has given a very satisfactory explanation in relation to his reasons for not having an appeals procedure.  Many people feel that the Minister's argument is weak when he says that lodgment of <Col N="588" /> appeals could delay payments which are due.  Perhaps he would look at this area again to satisfy people who may have a genuine grievance in this regard.  It may well be possible to speed up an appeals procedure so that there would not be too long a delay.  Overall the Bill is desirable and brings us into line with the EEC directive, even though there have been complaints that it will not fully meet those terms.  However, I would be completely satisfied with the Bill if we could get an assurance from the Minister that he will look at the situation in regard to the company I have mentioned &mdash; and I am sure there are others &mdash; and realise that there are cases which have almost been concluded.  Their employees have suffered hardship and distress as there is no prospect of reopening the firms involved. We should make provision to cover employees who have a genuine grievance, who are expecting something from this Bill and who will now be disappointed. I hope the Minister can devise an amendment on Committee Stage which will cover this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation is welcome from the point of view of employers and employees.  A terrible situation in the life of any employee is recognised and also the point of view of the employer.  Unfortunately, it is the employee who has been at the wrong end of the stick and his losses have to be taken into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the comment by the Minister that he wondered about the degree of consideration some employers gave to the welfare of their workers when financial difficulties loom, it is fair to say that employers are so engrossed in trying to make a success of their business that they do not consider it in that light.  That is one of the reasons I welcome the Bill. The Minister is taking that position into consideration and is introducing an easy payment method for a fund which will not hurt businesses, provided of course that there are not too many drains on it. In this case because employees are part of the business and their future is so much tied in with the employer, it is only just <Col N="589" /> and equitable that they should be protected.</P>
    <P>I believe these provisions will be welcomed by both sides.  Genuinely, I do not think businesses consider that they are likely to become insolvent.  They do not know it will take place at a certain time. Inevitably, there will be a period when things are not going too well, when there is a financial strain on the company and orders are not too healthy.  At that point it is too late to sit down and consider how the employees are to be paid if the business has to close down within a few weeks or months.  Seldom is a company in a position to decide when it should close down and pay off everybody.</P>
    <P>The criticism by Deputy Yates in regard to foreign companies generally is not true in the case of multi-nationals and others.  When they close down subsidiaries it is usual that they pay employees and clear all debts in full.  They post notices of that intent.  It is not good for any concern to remain in business having had close downs in other countries with people suffering as a result.  I can imagine the position of employers when it comes to the question of a shut-down.  It has happened all too frequently here in recent years.  The pressure is acute from all angles, particularly from the banks, if a small business is involved.  In the case of a limited company if most of the shares are owned by one or two people there will be personal guarantees involved and a threat on the property of the owners. There is the prospect of the transition from owning a business to becoming an employee.  There is a great analogy between the owner and the employee who can suddenly be thrown out of work. Today I was approached by a person who has been on strike for a few days.  That person indicated to me that he would not be able to last much longer than a week before he would feel the effect of the strike.  In a recession things are tight and people are not able to save money for such occurrences.  They spend all of their earnings weekly.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that an employer is in the driving seat in such a situation and could, if neglectful, make the position very serious for the employee, who would not <Col N="590" /> know the condition of the business.  An employee may not know that things are not going too well.  He may be working under an illusion and it is hard for him to make decisions in his private life if he decides to buy a new house, buy new furniture, invest money, go on a holiday or try to improve his lot.  It does not matter what position an employee is in, everything is relative.  It does not matter if he is working on the shop floor or is an executive in the company.  He may have his children at school or a big mortgage. We also have unemployed managers and executives as well as unemployed general operatives and tradesmen.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister will make regulations in regard to a company becoming insolvent.  That is fine, because I can understand the complexity of that situation.  However I hope it does not become bureaucratic in the decision-making process in that area like some other arms of State, particularly in regard to VAT decisions or arrears of tax.  I hope that we will have an all-embracing understanding of difficulties that can arise on both sides and that there will not be any disputes about this area.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention the inequitable position that can arise in regard to non-contributory pension funds.  An employee after working ten or 20 years with a company may be told, when he or she decides to leave the company that the company has the option of deciding to allow that person take the pension. Although it is non-contributory, it is to the disadvantage of the employee that an employer has such a hold over him or her.  I would like to see that regulated for.  I was involved with a person who had worked for 20 or 25 years with a company and on leaving was not given the benefit of the accumulated pension fund because it was non-contributory.  A time limit should be introduced so that in the case of non-contributory pension funds an employee who serves a reasonable number of years will have the right to take that fund with him or her if a decision is made to leave.  Some years ago it was explained to me that this was an advantage for an employer to have over an employee.  It was also described as a <Col N="591" /> method of saving for an employer and that the one who suffered most was the employee.  If that happened on a big scale in a large company employees would suffer a great deal.</P>
    <P>The attractive feature of the Bill is that is provides an easy payment schedule.  It is so small as not to affect the running of a business.  It takes a worry away from employers.  I was going to suggest that it should be done in that way and then I was told that it was so provided in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Given a company of a certain size who are paying into a fund such as this, does there not come a time when they will have paid enough money to cover the costs of a shut down and the eventualities specified in the Bill and would therefore not need to continue paying this amount? The money would seem to be going into a general fund.  The Minister referred to an increase of 0.49 per cent in the employers' PRSI contribution rate announced in the budget.  That included provision to cover anticipated expenditure in insolvency cases.  It may be that the continued payment will be put to other uses.  If a fund is accumulated in which there is enough money available in the unfortunate event of a shut down, I do not see the absolute necessity of paying further into it.  We do not want to increase the tax squeeze but to reduce it. I will raise the matter again on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Bill is generally welcome.  I know the employee will be the one to benefit most.  He is in the disadvantageous position of not knowing when his company will close down, especially in recessionary times.  It is a balanced form of legislation in that it helps the employer in the way it has been worked out.  I congratulate the Department and the draftsman since it causes the smallest ripple in the financial make-up of any business.  It gives reassurance to employees.  Perhaps some day we will be able to bridge the gap between this position and the time when other employment is available.  At present there is little likelihood of getting another position for any employee, from the chief executive down.  I welcome the <Col N="592" /> Bill as a first step along the road to greater security and equity.  It recognises the injury which has been inflicted in the past, although in recent years it has not been as brutal as decades ago when these things happened at the whim of companies and individuals.  This is a progression and I hope the Minister and his Department will keep it under review so that the transition from one employment to another can be eased to the maximum possible extent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave an unqualified welcome to this Bill.  I do so in the spirit of the Minister's own words that his approach to the Bill has been directed towards protecting workers to the greatest extent practicable in insolvency situations.</P>
      <P>I listened very attentively to Deputy Yates.  He talked about the tremendous burden of 12.5 per cent on employers but forgot that he voted for it in the budget. All of us, including Deputy Yates, welcome the Bill because we have come across situations where people have been left without protection for weeks and months.  There is nothing as degrading as having to go to public representatives or community welfare officers looking for a pittance to keep body and soul together while cases like these are being resolved.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister in wondering about the degree of commitment on the part of some employers.  There are a number of categories.  There are those who, through no fault of their own, become insolvent, perhaps as a result of bad luck or bad judgment.  Then there is the person to whom Deputy Yates referred to as a &ldquo;cowboy&rdquo; and there are some women also who might be referred to as &ldquo;cowgirls&rdquo;.  The Bill is designed for this type of person.  The vast bulk of employers are considerate and place a high priority on the just claims of their employees.  It is unfortunate that the sins of the few are visited on the many and that all employers will now have to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Closer co-operation between the Department of Labour and the Department of Social Welfare could help to prevent some insolvencies.  For many years there has been an early warning <Col N="593" /> system in the Department of Labour.  The Department of Social Welfare must know the position in relation to the non-payment by employers of PRSI contributions. That should be taken as a warning that things are not as they should be.</P>
    <P>If I have any other fault to find with the Bill it is the period of eight weeks specified in section 5, but section 10 probably gives the Minister the opportunity of amending that if he so desires.  Eight weeks is a short period of time when a person finds himself without a job and I would ask the Minister to look at it to see whether it could be extended.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister's argument in relation to sections 11 and 12.  I question the relevancy of section 14 in that I feel there is very little use in instituting proceedings against people who are insolvent. The fine mentioned is a figure not exceeding £500 but it should be remembered that some genuine people will not have any money at that point.  There should be other legislation for those who walk away from the situation.  I wonder what is meant by the use of the phrase &ldquo;knowingly or recklessly makes any false statement he shall be guilty of an offence.&rdquo; in section 14(3).</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Gene Fitzgerald I wonder what is the situation in relation to the fund.  In his introductory remarks the Minister said:</P>
    <P>It is difficult to predict what the expenditure from the Fund in respect of the claims covered by this Bill will be, but the income of the combined Fund should be adequate to meet liabilities under the Redundancy Acts and this legislation for some time to come.</P>
    <P>It would be important that the fund should not be allowed to be dissipated.  I disagree with the Minister when he says:</P>
    <P>Given that workers are unlikely to be in a position to continue to work for long periods without remuneration, I consider that in the majority of cases, claims in respect of ordinary pay should not be substantial.</P>
    <P>In a number of closures in my constituency the biggest problem was that of pay <Col N="594" /> rather than the actual holiday; that was my experience in four or five closures in the Ballina area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has seen fit to go beyond the terms of the EEC directive in that he is taking into account wages and arrears of statutory minimum wages, holiday pay and payments on foot of company sick pay schemes.</P>
    <P>I would add my voice to that of other Deputies who asked the Minister to consider the operational date of the provisions of this Bill.  The cases mentioned by Deputy Daly could be covered by an amendment which would adopt an operative date or the date on which a company winds up.  I understood the Deputy to say that the company concerned had not yet been fully wound up and that their employees might possibly be covered under the terms of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Apart from the need for one or two minor amendments this is a much welcome Bill which will give some solace to people who, in these difficult times &mdash; in many cases after a lifetime in one job &mdash; find themselves suddenly without work and, worse still, without money and wages over a long number of weeks.  The Minister can be assured of our full co-operation in ensuring its speedy passage through both Houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and, along with my colleague, Deputy Calleary, wish it a speedy passage through both Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When workers and employers enter a mutual contract to work together, at that stage neither party thinks that, at some later stage, problems might develop within the company through no fault of theirs, and it is in this situation that the Minister is endeavouring to protect workers' rights.  It is only right that any workers entering any employment should feel that, if the worst comes to pass and the company has to cease trading for one <Col N="595" /> reason or another, and goes into liquidation, they will have some rights.  We must award full marks to the EEC Commission for having proposed this legislation which should meet full co-operation in its passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The obtaining Redundancy Payments Act is a fine Act which has worked well but it needs to be and is being complemented by the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    <P>In my constituency recently there was a situation in which workers suddenly found, on a given afternoon, that a company was going into liquidation and workers there &mdash; who had spent a lifetime giving good honest work &mdash; because they had worked a week in hand and would not be paid for the week in which they were working, were left without wages for two weeks.  These honourable employees were put out on the street having to beg assistance of the social welfare officer to tide them over the worst period.  I do not believe any employee should be placed in that position.  With the introduction of this Bill I would hope that employees in all industries will feel a little more secure.</P>
    <P>I must question one aspect of the Bill, that is the proposal to increase the employers' PRSI contribution.  While I accept that this fund must be financed from some quarter, it is regrettable that its funding is being thrown back on the employer.  I presume that the Government as an employer, will pay their contribution and, bearing in mind the 4.9 per cent increase authorised under the last budget, I find myself wondering will it be another 1 per cent next year.</P>
    <P>In the course of his introductory remarks the Minister said:</P>
    <P>It is difficult to predict what the expenditure from the Fund in respect of the claims covered by this Bill will be, but the income of the combined Fund should be adequate to meet liabilities under the Redundancy Acts and this legislation for some time to come.</P>
    <P>The part of that that needs to be underlined are the words &ldquo;should be adequate&rdquo;<Col N="596" /> because in the current economic climate I question that.  I would ask the Minister to seriously consider alternative methods of financing this fund.</P>
    <P>I should like to question also the position of employees who, during the course of their employment, contributed to group insurance schemes and the like, because I have heard recently that certain employees who contributed to group insurance schemes were treated very shabbily by the insurance companies concerned. It is not good enough for such financial institutions to deal with employees in that manner just because their group insurance scheme is then called into question.  Insurance companies should endeavour to be more helpful and ensure that employees who find themselves unemployed are properly treated and that claims for the winding-up of their group insurance schemes are at least treated with somewhat more sympathy and urgency than are some at present. There should be some monitoring by the unions involved of the early warning system operated by the Department of Labour.  It is a dangerous and sensitive area and unions involved in companies should be given some little warning, in whatever veiled terms are necessary, that problems may be ahead for the employees.</P>
    <P>Finally, I congratulate the Minister on bringing in this legislation and I hope it will not be too long before it is enacted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, compliment the Minister on bringing forward this Bill as part of worker protection and reform of legislation dealing with that.  The Bill covers all aspects required by the EEC Directive.  I am concerned about the date of the coming into force of the legislation, which the Minister indicates is 22 October 1983.  My colleague, Deputy Daly, has explained, as did Deputy Taylor-Quinn and I on the Adjournment some time ago, that companies in our constituency had employed people who have been left high and dry and who possibly come under the scope of this Bill.  Deputy Daly has suggested that the winding-up date be the effective date.  I do not know if that is possible in legal terms.  The date <Col N="597" /> 22 October 1983 was the last effective date from which the EEC required the law to apply.  I do not think the Minister is limited to this final date.  Therefore, I appeal to him when he is examining this Bill on Committee Stage to consider accepting amendments that might change that date.</P>
      <P>The fact that the Minister is providing funds for employees is to be commended highly.  Employees who find themselves with insolvent companies generally panic and the fact that they will be cushioned from this fund will be of great benefit to industry itself because it will bring a certain sense of protection to those employees. As Deputy Calleary said, perhaps the eight weeks could be extended to provide a greater cushion.  However, the Minister has done a good day's work in bringing in this Bill and I hope he will consider what I have asked him to examine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for its co-operative attitude and the way in which Deputies have handled this legislation.  We are taking Second Stage today and, therefore, many of the detailed points that were raised can be referred to when we go through the sections on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I would like to repeat what I said in my initial speech, picked up by Deputy Calleary, that this is work-oriented legislation. For that reason I make no apology for the fact that there is no appeals procedure in it for employers.  Evidence shows that in other aspects of labour legislation employers are using the appeals procedure with the possible intent &mdash; let me choose my words carefully &mdash; and certainly with the effect of delaying the payment of moneys that would otherwise be the entitlement of the workers.  Many public representatives will recognise that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the House did not take any insult from or umbrage at the fact that I had to leave the House for a time when Deputy Yates spoke.  The officials have given me a clear note of what he said.  I want to reiterate a fundamental principle that I will follow while I am Minister for Labour.  Yes, we are in a difficult time; yes, the western world is going through <Col N="598" /> a crisis; yes, western Europe in particular is suffering unemployment of unprecedented levels some of which perhaps is structural.  However I do not believe we should throw the baby out with the bath water.  The panic reaction of some people is to dismantle the entire package of labour legislation.  That was not given to working people gratuitously by some Santa Claus employer backed up by right-wing and centre politicians throughout the various assemblies.  Every gain on the Statute Book that protects workers' rights in the main has been hard fought for and was not given gratuitously.</P>
    <P>Therefore, because we are now in a crisis it is a mistake to think that you can blame worker protection legislation as the cause of it or, to use the phrase that Deputy Yates used, that it was somehow or other a tax on employment.  Many things are a tax on employment.  You could say that ESB charges and the cost of various other services are a tax on employment.  Therefore, the principle to be followed for the duration of the time I happen to be Minister for Labour and, I suspect, for the duration of time that the Labour Party participate in or support any Government is this.  By all means let us update, reform and revise the legislation so that any anti-employment content it may inadvertently contain is removed.  Let us remove those contradictions, for that is what they are. But in so doing let us keep our heads and not throw out the baby with the bath water and not undo the work that has been achieved over many years.</P>
    <P>The reference that Deputy Yates made to the extraordinary level of employment creation that took place in the US relates to areas of employment where there is absolutely no worker protection whatsoever. We have seen in the present administration in the US a President who has systematically dismantled worker protection and workers' rights in a whole range of areas.  If that is what Deputies of this House on either side &mdash; only one Deputy has said it &mdash; are suggesting, then they should state that view and face the consequences of it.  However, I agree with Deputy Yates that what is required is simultaneously a reform of company legislation. <Col N="599" /> I assure him that that difficult task has been initiated, a great deal of work has been done on it and the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy Bruton, is in the process of advancing that legislation.</P>
    <P>However, there are reasons why this insolvency legislation is required in the manner in which it has been offered. Some Deputies raised the question of the date of insolvency.  To get over the Kilrush Pottery problems and others an effective way would be to use the date from which the company is would up as that would relate to reality rather than tentative insolvency and also enable one to see what assets were left and what net additional moneys would be required from the fund.  That has a certain neatness and tidiness and commends itself as a general principle, and would undoubtly meet the requirements in Kilrush.  However, it does not meet the fundamental requirement that workers simply cannot afford to wait between 12 and 18 months, which on average is the time they must wait.  The Kilrush potteries have been closed for over 12 months and the workers may be waiting for a long time for their payment.  The purpose of the legislation is to ensure that workers whose employers have not provided for money to cover payments they are entitled to are not out of pocket for an undue time, as is the case in Kilrush.  That is why we are doing it in this manner.  There are many other points which we will take up on Committee Stage.  On the question of the date we could go back and back. It has been suggested that 1 January 1983 is the tidier date.  The cost provisions we have made provide an estimate and it can be no better than that, of about £1 million a year.  There is no perfect date to start with and I would sooner take an objective date.  I will examine the Kilrush Pottery situation to see if the rights of the workers could be protected in perhaps a parallel but separate manner.  It is not appropriate to do it in this legislation.</P>
    <P>Finally, I thank the House for the tributes that have been paid.  They shall be passed on to those officials in the Department who drafted the legislation and who <Col N="600" /> went through it so carefully.  Included in those tributes also must be some of my predecessors, notably the present Minister for the Environment and, to a certain extent also Deputy Fitzgerald, MEP, who must have been some kind of godfather in relation to all of this legislation.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>In my remarks last week I stated that while I welcomed anything that contributed to highlighting the very serious heroin problem, particularly as it relates to the Dublin inner city area, I was somewhat doubtful as to whether this Bill would play any significant role in dealing with that problem.  I accept the need for updating the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, but to consider this Bill as in some way contributing significantly to combating the heroin problem is another matter.  I do not think it is a legitimate view.</P>
      <P>It may be worth pointing out that we are now entering a new phase in the heroin problem, particularly in Dublin. As I have verified with the drug unit at Jervis Street Hospital, five people have died in the past ten days as a direct result of heroin addiction.  If one were to base that figure on a full year, one would be talking of the loss of hundreds of lives in this way.  However, this frightening situation was forecast more than a year ago when people researching the problem realised the level of the addiction among young people, though at that time the problem had not reached the very serious level of people dying as a result.  The statistic alone that I have quoted should shock us all and particularly the Minister into taking more constructive action than that outlined in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ministerial task force report on drug abuse was published on 18 April 1983.  This is the first opportunity we have <Col N="601" /> had in this House of talking about that report.  The background to the task force report is associated with the serious heroin problem that was developing in the inner city area of Dublin from the summer of 1981 onwards.  As a result of that problem being brought to the attention of the Medico-Social Research Board, the board surveyed the situation in the inner city and produced quite a comprehensive report.  It is stated in that report that Ireland is faced with a drug misuse problem that seems to be dangerously close to crisis point.  There followed some detailed statistics and the definitive statement that the 1982-83 prevalence of heroin abuse in that area among those aged 15 to 24 was found to be 10 per cent. That was based on a survey in one north inner city parish.  The report contained also the statistics that among those aged 15 to 19 the level of heroin abuse was 12 per cent while among females in the same age group it was 13 per cent.  The board went on to make the observation that these Irish prevalence figures are in some respects slightly better and in other respects a good deal worse than the equivalent 1970 figures for New York black ghettos and that in particular the figures in respect of females in the 15 to 19 and the 20 to 24 age groups were markedly worse in Dublin than they were in the black ghetto areas of New York. There were subsequent reports from the Medico-Social Research Board and these indicated that there were at least 1,500 heroin addicts in Dublin alone.  Many commentators in the media and elsewhere who researched the problem stated that the number could be twice that.  However, by any standards, whether we take the official statistics or those estimated by the commentators in the media, there was a heron epidemic demanding emergency measures to deal both with those pushing and supplying the drug and also to respond to the needs of the at least 1,500 addicts.</P>
    <P>If there were an epidemic on such a scale of any other killer disease would immediate steps not have been taken to provide emergency facilities at hospitals or special units?  We all know that there is no such response from the Minister or <Col N="602" /> from the Government.  Many people have asked whether this lack of response stems from the fact that the vast majority of these young addicts come from the most depressed and disadvantages areas of the State.  One might ask whether there would have been a different response if what has become known as the heroin bushfire was spreading through middle-class districts.  I am confident that in such circumstances there would have been a very different and much more immediate response.  Instead the response of the Minister and of the Government was enunciated in the form of the Ministerial task force report on 20 September 1983, one year after the Medico-Social Research Board began their survey in the north inner city area.  The huge heroin problem reflected in the statistics and other information contained in that survey were already well known to the health authorities, to Eastern Health Board officials, to local doctors, to Jervis Street Hospital staff and to all those working in that field.  Presumably all these people had reported on the problem to their superiors.  There was no response.  Why was there no response from higher levels?  The only answer is that it was simply part of the traditional neglect meted out to these disadvantaged areas.  So long as the problem was confined to the inner city areas and there was no real pressure to do anything about it nothing would be done about it.  The problem was permitted to fester and get out of control.</P>
    <P>Even when the Government acted and set up the ministerial task force and when the much talked about report was published, it proved to be simply a list of recommendations and not a programme of action to deal with the emergency situation referred to in the Medico-Social Research Board's report of a year previous and in the coverage given to the problem by the media.  There was no programme for immediate action.  There was a list of recommendations but no time scale for their implementation.  The recommendations did not reflect the scale of the problem but it would have helped if they had been implemented at the time. It is reasonable to suggest that the five <Col N="603" /> young people I referred to who died in the last ten days from heroin addiction might not have died if these facilities had been provided when requested.  They are still not available despite all the talk about what the Government are doing as regards the heroin problem and the talk generated by this Bill.</P>
    <P>My line of argument is to try to put the Bill into context and to suggest it is not an adequate response to the overall problem. In February 1984 the Minister for Health during Question Time was asked to report on the progress as regards the recommendations which had been published in the report of the task force on 21 September 1983.  The gist of the progress report was that &ldquo;all of these recommendations are being vigorously pursued&rdquo;. Out of all the recommendations what had been done?  A set of videos were provided and a diploma course was started in Trinity College.  Nearly three years after the height of the heroin epidemic in the city of Dublin, by February this year, nothing other than the provision of a set of videos and the commencement of a diploma course in Trinity College had been implemented.  Everything else was being &ldquo;vigorously pursued&rdquo;. I shall refer to the recommendations and say what the response was, if any.</P>
    <P>The first real recommendation referred to the customs and immigration controls and the need for resources to be made available to those involved in customs and excise.  This question was raised by other Members and there are a list of questions awaiting the Minister for Finance asking for his response to the demands of the customs union who have given up on the Minister and have decided to campaign as a trade union to highlight the Government's failure to supply them with the resources they need to stop heroin coming into this country. That has not been done.  Heavens knows when it will be done on the scale required.</P>
    <P>The Garda Drug Squad was to be kept under constant review.  I pay tribute to the members of the drug squad.  It is a small drug squad.  I am familiar with their <Col N="604" /> work and with a number of people involved in it.  I can definitely say that there is a commitment and dedication evident in the drug unit which I find absent in other sections of the Garda Síochána.  There is no question but that those who are in the unit are very dedicated and but for them we would have a much more serious situation.  They are dealing with a sophisticated criminal élite.</P>
    <P>I put down a question today for written answer to monitor the task force recommendations in relation to the size of the drug problem and the great work the Government will do.  Last September when the report was published the number in the drug squad in Dublin was 31. Today it is 35, an increase of four.  The most sophisticated criminal elements with huge networks across the city have invested whatever resources they have in heroin largely because that is where the money is to be made.  There are 35 men available to the drug squad who operate a 24-hour shift.  With members on leave, on sick leave and so on, there are only a handful out of the 35 men available on active service in Dublin.  From talking to members of the squad it is obvious that one of the main pressures on manpower is that they have to carry out a great deal of surveillance as part of their work in combating heroin suppliers.  This further restricts the numbers available to respond to problems that arise.  A Government who, despite the background I have tried to paint, restrict the drug squad in this city to 35 people, are not serious about dealing with the heroin problem.</P>
    <P>There was a recommendation in relation to court procedures.  It was recommended that a special judge should be appointed and that the Chief State Solicitor's Office should appoint one solicitor to specialise in drug offence case work.  I put down another question for written answer today on the appointment of the judge and was told by the Ceann Comhairle that it was not the responsibility of the Minister, so I could not get information on whether a judge had been appointed.  I do not know whose responsibility it is to implement that aspect of <Col N="605" /> the task force's report because I could not get that information.  In relation to the Chief State Solicitor's Office I am told, if I may quote from the reply, that &ldquo;arrangements have been made&rdquo; to do this.  It does not say whether it is being done, but it is evident that it has not yet been implemented but arrangements have been made.  Hopefully we can expect, in the words of the reply, &ldquo;to deploy solicitors in the Chief State Solicitor's Office so as to ensure, as far as practicable, the greatest possible specialisation in drug offence casework&rdquo;.  If that is the attitude of Government, is it any wonder that a certain judge released a heroin supplier and sent him to his homeland but sentenced a young chap involved in a cannabis offence to 14 years.  In my view, any judge who does not know the difference between cannabis and heroin is not competent to deal with cases involving drugs.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer now to the sentencing policy because it is crucial to the campaign against the heroin problem. which is the real problem in Dublin.  On 3 April 1984 I asked the Minister for Justice the number of convictions in the courts between March 1982 and March 1984 for the possession of heroin; the amount of heroin involved in each case; the sentence given in each case; and the name of the presiding judge.  The reply I got was:</P>
    <P>The statistics sought are not available in my Department or in Garda headquarters.  It would have to be specially compiled from records at local level and I do not consider that I would be justified in asking gardaí and court officials to undertake the task which could only be carried out at the expense of other duties.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows &mdash; the dogs in the street know &mdash; that some members of the most criminal family in this city are serving seven-year prison sentences for supplying heroin while others who supplied heroin were let go and that there are a variety of sentences ranging from 14 years for a cannabis offence to letting a heroin supplier go scot-free.  If the statistics I sought were made available they <Col N="606" /> would make a laughing stock of the Judiciary and show that their competence in this field was a disgrace.  I hope that this situation, which I see as the main contributory factor in the continuing heroin problem, is dealt with by somebody, although from a reply to one of my questions it appears nobody knows who is responsible for dealing with the Judiciary. Competent judges who know what is a dangerous drug and what is a soft drug, who know the difference between somebody supplying heroin and somebody experimenting with cannabis, and who know the extent of the problem in Dublin city, should be appointed quickly.</P>
    <P>I will deal now with a more important area, that is, the problem of the addicts and the many young people who are addicted to heroin.  The ministerial task force stated that it was of particular concern to the Government that there were young drug abusers in the 12 to 16 age group from deprived inner city areas particularly for whom no treatment accommodation was currently available in which they could be detained and rehabilitated.  One would have expected that that recommendation would have been implemented, but no such luck for those young people.  There are still no residential rehabilitation centres for the very many young people in that age group who have become addicted to heroin. Many more of them will end up like the five to whom I have already referred who died within the last ten days because of lack of facilities.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the Jervis Street facility, the only readily available treatment facility in this city.  It remains as it was in 1981 when the Medico-Social Research Board published their report; it remains as it was when the Government task force published their recommendations; it remains an over-crowded, overworked, undermanned pre-fab which, without reflecting on the staff who work very hard in a very difficult situation, must rank as a disgrace for the Minister because he did not act a long time ago &mdash; now it is far too late &mdash; in providing adequate facilities for the Jervis Street drug unit.</P>
    <P>The ministerial task force report <Col N="607" /> referred to the James's Street hospital bed facility, which is still not operational. When it does become operational only a handful of beds will be involved; I am not sure of the number the Minister mentioned last week but I think it was six or eight and the conservative estimate of the number of addicts in Dublin city is 1,500. We are expected to accept that the Misuse of Drugs Bill is a realistic and genuine response to the drug problem in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The ministerial task force report was quite good.  It referred to the key areas of the problem and pointed to answers to the problems.  If only they had been acted on and expanded we would not have the present situation.  The report stated that the people most vulnerable to drug abuse were living in deprived urban communities and that this was notably the case for young abusers, the people of particular concern to the Minister.  The report went on to say that youth work activities when community-based could provide recognition in a positive sense for young people.  This report is saying that what is needed in these disadvantaged areas is community-based youth work activities.  Months before publication of this report the Minister for Health was responsible for withdrawing funds from a community action project based and working in the north inner city area which the research board had shown to have 13 per cent of young people abusing heroin.  The people most concerned, the young people involved in training projects under the north centre city community action project were told, &ldquo;sorry, the Minister has no money and therefore no further funds will be available&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The task force report ends on an amazing note.  It says that having regard to current restrictions it was the Government's intention that the necessary resources would be made available from within existing estimates of expenditure. No special allocation was to be made for all the work that was going to be done, with the result that no work was done because there was no money available.  If the measures to which I have referred were implemented, they would have required substantial expenditure which <Col N="608" /> the Government or the Minister were not prepared to make available, and as a result the recommendations of the task force have not been implemented.</P>
    <P>I regret the Minister is not here today. Last week I challenged him to go through the various recommendations in the report.  If he intends to reply to the debate I hope he will deal with the various points I made then.  I have been referring to the overall picture of inactivity at Government and ministerial level which this Bill apparently will allow to be continued, because there is very little significance in it.  It will not change anything radically, and radical change is necessary quickly.  There is an urgent need to update our law in this respect.  The Bill will do that to some extent but it will not deal with this crisis situation.</P>
    <P>Despite the overall picture of neglect and inactivity, I am glad to say that the heroin problem has been contained in inner Dublin.  It may be spreading to other areas which I will not mention because they are well known.  Apparently the criminal element supplying heroin are aware of their vulnerability in the inner city and are probably changing their emphasis and redirecting their targets to other areas.  It was contained in the inner city but that has nothing to do with Government activity but with the parents' movement and the dedication of the small Drugs Squad who have been operating against difficult odds.</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Health has been so inactive on this problem that he blamed the drugs problem in Dublin on the Provisional IRA.  That is far from the truth.  Concerned parents' organisations and other spontaneous community responses have been responsible for an easing off of the problem in the inner city.  I represent the north inner city and I have seen the spontaneous response of local people who said they had had enough of seeing people injecting themselves on flat balconies, in playgrounds and in public parks.  Such spontaneous activity was triggered by the people's lack of understanding why the Government had not involved themselves.  These people have had an astounding victory <Col N="609" /> and that is why the heroin problem in the north inner city has diminished in the past six months.  Indeed there have been hardly any new cases, although that was one of the worst areas in the State.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Minister tried to divert attention from his own inactivity to the Provisional IRA.  Clearly, he has been out of touch with the nature of the problem and of the community response to it.  If he had been in touch it would not come as a surprise to him that the community were prepared to organise themselves against it.  Although I have said the problem is not as serious as earlier in the Dublin inner city area, I do not say that the entire drugs problem there is receding. The trouble is that though it may have been contained in the inner city it has the potential to reach the same crisis proportions in other Dublin areas. Therefore, if it is not treated with priority it will spread and that is why it is important that we recognise it and deal with it.</P>
    <P>In a search for methods to do this, it has always struck me that when members of one criminal family who are almost synonymous with the drug problem began to buy big houses in the Dublin mountains, obviously from the proceeds of their ill gotten gains, the Revenue Commissioners should have taken action.  That would have been a way to get at them.  One of the first parliamentary questions I put down on being elected was to the Minister for Finance. I named the person, who has left the country since but who still owns a house in the Dublin mountains.  I asked the Minister to ensure that the Revenue Commissioners would take action against such people.  The answer I got was that it was a matter for the Revenue Commissioners and that the Minister had no responsibility.</P>
    <P>I raise it again because many of the people involved in heroin pushing have been investing their gains from it in business and in property.  The Revenue Commissioners have a very important role to play in dealing with this and I suggest that they should draw up some programme of action in company with the Garda.  If that is not done those who gain from the drugs trade will grow more <Col N="610" /> powerful and it will become increasingly difficult to deal with them.</P>
    <P>If the supply of drugs is there it will mean many bad days for the poorer areas in Dublin, particularly.  I therefore urge the Minister to accept my criticism as constructive, aimed at highlighting the seriousness of the problem.  Many people who are now concerned cannot understand why the Minister does not respond in a more positive way.</P>
    <P>The most serious aspect is concerned with the under sixteens who are addicted and for whom there are still no residential centres, no rehabilitation and, worse, no comfort.  They are condemned to wait like the five who died in the last ten days. We will hear of many more similar deaths in the next few months, inevitably, because we are too inactive to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>Finally I come to the huge number of prisoners in Mountjoy Prison who have a heroin problem.  I am sure that the prison officers and the Minister are well aware of the fact that people, some of whom I know, went into Mountjoy Prison free from a drug problem and came out heroin addicts.  Their crimes were in response to their disadvantage but even their disadvantaged surroundings had not led them into this state.  They had succeeded in avoiding the heroin trap outside prison, but did not avoid it inside. Whatever hope of freedom they had outside, they did not find any in Mountjoy. There is no doubt that that has been the case in very many instances.  The prison officers have made statements again and again about the heroin problem in that prison.  I ask the Minister and the Government to direct themselves to dealing with the very many addicts in Mountjoy Prison for whom there are at present no facilities whatsoever.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very depressed by Deputy Gregory's account of the horrific problem in this city and the responsibilities which this Legislature and the Government, through the Minister have in this area.  I listened on the monitor on the last occasion to Deputy McCarthy's frightening and alarming description of the effects of drugs.  The Bill is a help, <Col N="611" /> but how helpful it will be we do not really know.  It is a measure to show that we are doing something, and certain powers needed by the Garda to combat the drugs problem are included.  It would seem that we are not putting enough manpower, effort, expenditure, facilities, education, treatment into and emphasis on the area of drug abuse, particularly when one considers the small numbers in the Drug Squad &mdash; Deputy Gregory mentioned 30 or 34.  The problem is massive.  The published figure is 1,500 but that is a drop in the ocean of the number of addicts.</P>
      <P>This should be declared an emergency area, just as disaster areas are declared in the United States, and money should be provided.  This is no slight, but a reminder that last week we were talking about the expenditure of up to £1 million by way of funds of suitors.  The area of drug addiction begs attention and, although we are aware of the problem, like many other things we are inclined to ignore it to a large extent when it does not directly affect us.  It is only when one knows somebody actually affected by it or whose friends or family are, that it comes home to one in a very big way.  I get a daily reminder because the Coolmine Centre is in my own constituency, within a mile of my home.  I try to keep in touch with the problem by keeping in touch with that centre.  The people there have not asked for very much, but the facilities are very little, even though those people are making an enormous contribution relative to the problem which exists in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not care how bad the economic situation or how good or bad the books are, there are certain things which need immediate attention, regardless of the financial situation.  If one is not well off, certain things happen during one's lifetime for which one must get money and this money is found.  Apart from economic measures which need to be taken and which would help in this area, in the area of youth employment, our massive resources must be tapped.  These massive resources have been referred to many times in this House by people on both sides and by the present and former Taoiseachs. <Col N="612" /> We have the resources to tackle this problem.  We certainly have no shortage of people who could be trained to specialise in the care and attention, especially of the under 16 year olds and in breaking up the city into very small cells, nurturing the sick beast that it is and giving it the individual attention which it needs.  A large amount of money must be got to provide for this in an imaginative, expansive way.  There was no intended derogatory criticism in the last Deputy's remarks about the task force.  It was set up to try to do something about this problem. It is working and the Minister briefly referred to it in saying that the proposals put forward have been incorporated in the Bill, together with desirable changes recommended by other parties concerned with controlling the drug problem.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient to set up a committee or a force to report back.  That is a do-nothing situation.  I am not saying that is the case with the task force, but the terrible problems about which we are speaking need more than that.  Special attention needs to be paid immediately.  No matter what part of the city we live in, we do not know whether our children will be offered drugs in school that day or whether we will be told that our own child is on drugs or is a drug addict.  The head of the Coolmine Centre said recently that it takes at least three years for parents to find out if a child is an addict.</P>
    <P>There are other areas which can help to reduce drug-taking and these will have to be tackled seriously.  They are smoking and drinking habits, especially among the young.  These are the breeding grounds for later drug-taking.  It is not necessary to go back over the old ground and complain about what was not done a few years ago or last year.  With respect to what Deputy Gregory said &mdash; and I know that he is immensely involved and very sincere in his approach to this problem &mdash; we are at a stage now when we have legislation which will be a help in the investigation of the crime of drug peddling and drug pushing.  It will help them to track down the godfathers.  It will give them greater powers to search different <Col N="613" /> premises, vehicles, aircraft, camps, tents, and so forth.  That is all it will do.</P>
    <P>The increased sentences will not be a deterrent to drug pushers.  Every drug taker is a drug pusher, I understand. They buy one joint at a time, split it up and keep one part for themselves and sell the other to buy more.  The medical people in the House can tell us a great deal about this problem, as Deputy McCarthy did in his contribution.  I do not think the increased sentences will be a deterrent because the godfathers are so far removed from it all.  I do not think a tax attack by Revenue will have much of an affect because of the enormous amount of money involved.  Deputy Gregory talked about big houses, but they are only the tip of the iceberg.  They are bought with the loose change.  These people could not spend all the money they earn from this racket.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister and the House to consider this as a special task.  Some Deputies do not come across the problem as often as Deputies in areas where it is very prevalent.  I appeal to those Deputies to give their attention to the problem. The Minister for Finance and the Government should be asked to provide the resources to tackle it.  It has to be tackled on three fronts.  Here we are giving the Garda some extra help to tackle the drug crime problem and the criminals in this area.  We also have to look at education.  I do not think a very good job is being done at the moment.  Expert opinion is that children should be taught about drugs and the dangers of drugs at about eight years of age.  The time to start treating children is not at 16 years of age. Given the number of people affected by this problem, the facilities available are embarrassingly pathetic.  It is not sufficient to throw people a few pounds now and again and tell them to tackle the problem.</P>
    <P>This legislation is related to the Criminal Justice Bill.  It is not sufficient to bring in a small measure and leave the picking up of the pieces to the voluntary groups operating in this area.  When voluntary groups and people who are trying to rescue the victims of drugs make submissions, will this House listen to them? <Col N="614" /> We had submissions from these bodies on another Bill.  They pleaded with us not to insert certain measures because they would worsen the problem.  They were totally ignored.  I want to remind the Minister that the first people to attempt to tackle this problem were the same people who advised us recently on the Criminal Justice Bill.  Very small numbers of people are looking after victims of drugs and trying to prevent or detect drug related crimes.  Their resources are pathetic.  Their numbers are so small as to be almost insignificant and they have a mammoth task.  Are we to wait around &mdash; as seems to be the norm in this country &mdash; until the problem becomes so bad that we have to do something about it?</P>
    <P>I am getting tired of coming into this House and talking about areas which are never tackled until they fall down.  This is an area where we can do something.  It will not cost a fortune.  It would not matter if it did cost a large amount of money. We have enormous numbers of young people unemployed.  We are reminded daily of the tremendous job our educational institutions are doing.  We are now looking for means to keep young people longer in educational institutions so that they will not be looking for a job too soon.  There is plenty of expertise throughout the country.  Large numbers of teachers are unemployed.  Large numbers of our youth are unemployed.  All that talent can be harnessed.</P>
    <P>Let us stop this codology of talking about half our population being under 25 years of age.  We have been talking about that for the past five years.  Each time we spoke about it the challenge became greater.  The fabric of our society is under threat.  If we cannot find answers to the unemployment problem, we are likely to be in an emergency situation.  Few people seem to have the imagination to try to harness some of that talent before they start to sneak off to the boat.  Recently in this House figures were not produced when asked for the numbers who have started on the emigration trail.  Emigration was the policy in the fifties and sixties. I hope that policy will not come back.</P>
    <P>Let us use that huge body of untapped <Col N="615" /> talent in the area of drug abuse.  Let us saturate the worst areas in the cities and towns where there is a problem so that we will know every single thing that moves inside certain areas.  That information can be fed into the passport office or to the police who will be dealing with these matters.  Let us give the Garda authorities the resources they want.  Out of 11,000, they have a very small number dealing with the drug problem.  They have the most sophisticated equipment in Europe in the forensic science laboratory in the Depot in the Phoenix Park.  They have about 25 specialist personnel. Because of a section in this Bill they will not have to attend at court in person when certifying a type of drug.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence Mr. Cooney (for the Minister for the Public Service)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £7,158,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December 1984, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for the Public Service for payment of a grant-in-aid.</P>
      <P>I propose to discuss Vote 19 &mdash; Civil Service Commission &mdash; Vote 21 &mdash; Superannuation and Retired Allowances &mdash; and Vote 49 &mdash; Increases in Remuneration and Pensions &mdash; with this Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to discuss Vote 20 &mdash; Office of the Ombudsman.  This Vote has already been agreed by the House. Deputies will recall that, as the office was <Col N="616" /> a new service and could not come into operation until the money had been voted, it was necessary to vote the money before the end of 1983.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the financial details, I would like to refer to a number of the most important developments in the management and modernisation of the public service.  I have on previous occasions underlined to this House the great importance which the Government attach to the modernisation of the public service.  In this concern, the Government are, I believe, responding to a widespread felt need in the community at large.  This need springs from a number of sources.  There is a recognition that, if the increasingly complex business of government is to be effectively handled, and if the national plan which the Government will bring forward shortly is to become effective in action, the quality and effectiveness of the public service will be a key factor.  There is also a widespread feeling that the transparency and accountability which ought to characterise all public service activities need to be restored to what, in the opinion of many, has become a rather opaque and complex network of decision-making.  This will require the development of clearer systems of accountability for public servants, and, of course, there is the feeling on the part of all of us who are taxpayers that the cost and size of the public service must be kept to the minimum.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons, the Government consider that one of the most important measures it will take in the near future will be the publication of a White Paper on a better public service later this year. The White Paper will spell out the public service reforms which the Government have decided upon.  Earlier this year, submissions were sought through the public press from any individuals or organisations who wished to put forward ideas on the modernisaiton of the public service. These have been taken into account in the work done within the Department of the Public Service on the preparation of the White Paper.</P>
    <P>Already, in advance of the publication of the total package in the White Paper, many significant changes have been <Col N="617" /> made.  Perhaps the most prominent change has been the introduction of a new system for making appointments to top levels in the Civil Service.  From the beginning of this year, all appointments to Civil Service posts from assistant secretary level upwards, including professional, technical and departmental grades, are made &mdash; by the Government or by the responsible Minister, as before &mdash; on the recommendation of the newly constituted Top Level Appointments Committee. This committee consists of four secretaries of Departments and the Chariman of the Public Service Advisory Council, who by definition comes from the private sector and who at present is Dr. Liam St. John Devlin.  The objective of this new arrangement is to ensure that the best people are appointed to senior posts irrespective of the Department or class of grade in which they have been serving previously.  This new system has been described in some of the media as representing a switch from a system of Buggins's turn.  This is a misleading description.  Promotions at this level in the Civil Service have not, in fact, been on the basis of seniority.  However, the previous system did contain too many rigidities.  For example, it was difficult for an outstanding officer to be picked out for the highest posts because top-level promotions were normally made within each Department and opportunities did not always match talent.</P>
    <P>The new system is supported by a service-wide system of assessment or appraisal of all officers from the level of principal upwards.  This is an important feature of the new arrangements.  It is an indication that the selection of people for promotion is now intended to be based on job performance and not on any other criteria.  At the same time as this new promotion system was introduced, the Government made a change in the tenure of secretaries of Departments.  Secretaries appointed under the new arrangements will hold office for not more than seven years and will retire from the Civil Service at the age of 60.  There are special provisions to cover the position of officers who were already over 55 at the time of introduction of the new arrangements. <Col N="618" /> The purpose behind this change is to increase mobility at the very top of Departments and thus to give more able officers the opportunity of operating at this level.</P>
    <P>Naturally, these new arrangements will prove upsetting for some.  The general reaction to them, however, from outside as well as inside the public service has been favourable.  There seems to be a general acceptance that the most able people will come to the top under the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>The principle of competitive promotion supported by systematic appraisal is being applied further down the Civil Service hierarchy as well.  An appraisal scheme for officials at principal and assistant principal level has recently been agreed.  The arrangements for competitive interdepartmental promotion to the assistant principal grade are being extended, and agreement is, I understand, near on arrangements to apply the same type of system to the principal grade.</P>
    <P>In speaking generally about the need for modernisation and reform, I made reference to the importance of greater accountability on the part of officials. This is a thorny and complex issue.  It is Ministers who are statutorily responsible to this House for all the business of their Departments.  It is right that Ministers should be responsible for the development and review of policy and that they should be answerable in this House for that.  It is less clear that they ought to be so heavily immersed in the day-to-day executive tasks arising from the implementation of these policies but at the moment they must also answer to the Dáil for this.  The Minister for the Public Service has said on a number of occasions that he envisages changes in this situation.</P>
    <P>Even under present arrangements, however, it is intended to focus more clearly on the specific responsibilities of officials within the system.  At the moment, the secretary of a Department, usually, is statutorily the accounting officer who is answerable to the Committee of Public Accounts for all expenditures from the vote for his Department.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="619" /> The Minister is at present developing a management system within his own Department which builds on a carefully worked out and agreed statement of the aims and objectives of the Department as a whole.  Flowing from these, the objectives of each manager down to certain levels are formulated and the criteria by which his or her performance will be judged are spelled out.  This system is in the process of development in the Department.  It is the intention in the new system to make each manager responsible for the efficient use of the budget over which he has control.  This will lead not only to a keener sense of personal responsibility on the part of each manager but also to a more cost-conscious approach to management.</P>
    <P>One of the most important programmes of improvement in the Civil Service at present is the drive to improve the service at the point of contact with the public.  This is an area which has too often been neglected in the past.  In common with most OECD countries, Ireland is beginning to take steps to improve the situation.  The forbidding, uncomfortable public reception area with its daunting hatches is being replaced by, to borrow the computer terminology, user-friendly spaces which are pleasant and which give a modicum of privacy.  Staff dealing with the public either face-to-face, or by telephone or letter, are now required to identify themselves.  This means that they will wear name badges, they will sign their names legibly and have their name and designation typed underneath the signature on letters and they will give their section, title and name on the telephone.  This move does away with the all too common practice in the past where civil servants dealing with the public remained anonymous and aloof, so that the citizen doing business with a Government Department found it almost impossible to follow up a query arising from an earlier contact.  As part of the same programme, forms are being systematically improved so that they will prove a help rather than an obstacle to the citizen using them.</P>
    <P>All these references to reforms and <Col N="620" /> changes should not be allowed to obscure the fact that the Civil Service gives a highly competent and dedicated service to the public day in day out.  This ought to be well known and understood by the public.  The changes now in train are designed to improve this service further. Again, it is important that these improvements are known and recognised by the citizens who are the beneficiaries.  For this reason, the Minister has launched a campaign to inform the public of the improving service now available from Government Departments.  The importance of improving communication between those providing a service and those served is clear.</P>
    <P>It is abundantly clear that computers will be a conspicuous factor in all aspects of management and administration in the future and that this will have vast implications for the organisation and deployment of people.  Furthermore, the technology of the future will not, unlike the computers of bygone days, be capable of being bound into particular corners of an organisation, to deal only with the mass processing of clerical data.  In that situation, it was always possible for top management to say that they did not have to become familiar with or understand the new methods or equipment.  This is no longer possible.  The new technology will pervade all areas of the Department or business and everybody, right up to the top, will need to understand what it can do for them and how it can do it.</P>
    <P>That is why the Department of the Public Service have been organising appreciation courses in information technology for top management levels including secretaries of Departments.  The response to these courses has been most encouraging and the feed-back very positive.</P>
    <P>The containment of the numbers and cost of the public service has, of course, been a prime concern of the Government. Since 23 December 1981, only every third vacancy arising in the Civil Service may be filled.  The effect of this policy has been that, despite a need to create new posts, the numbers serving in the Civil Service &mdash; excluding what are now An Post and Telecom Eireann &mdash;<Col N="621" /> fell from 32,600 in July 1981 to 30,800 at the beginning of June this year.</P>
    <P>This policy remains in force (though vacancies arising from the &ldquo;career breaks&rdquo; scheme are exempt from this embargo).  Departments will continue to be allowed to create a certain number of new posts where they can find compensating savings to pay for them.  There will be a widespread and systematic review of all Departments to identify the opportunities for such savings.</P>
    <P>Arising from the decisions of the Government Task Force on Employment, two schemes were introduced, aimed at providing new job opportunities for young people in the Civil Service and, at the same time, facilitating staff with domestic and other interests who wish to avail of the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>The first of these is job-sharing.  This scheme, which was introduced at the end of February, will enable serving officers to share the duties of a particular post in return for half pay and other benefits. The resultant vacancies, including those occurring at recruitment level, will be filled.  In addition, some Civil Service posts will be advertised on a job-sharing basis.  Job-sharing recruits will be offered full-time employment after a minimum of two years.</P>
    <P>The second scheme referred to is that of career breaks.  Under it, most civil servants will be eligible to apply for a career break which will consist of special leave without pay of a period of one to three years.  Career breaks may be availed of for a wide variety of reasons, including domestic responsibilities, further education, setting up a business, etc. Consequential vacancies will be filled. Again this will increase job opportunities in the Civil Service for young people.</P>
    <P>The initial response to both schemes has been reasonable.  It is intended to extend them to the health, education and local authority areas and to State-sponsored bodies.  Ministers have been written to in this regard.  The Minister for Health has already introduced a career breaks scheme in the health area.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned that I did not propose to discuss the Vote for the Office of the Ombudsman.  Deputies will be aware <Col N="622" /> that the Ombudsman took office on 3 January last.  Since then he has been inundated with representations of all kinds.  While many of these do not come within the Ombudsman's writ, they are a clear indication of the need for the office in the first place.</P>
    <P>It is the Minister's intention to review the extent of the Ombudsman's writ with the objective of ensuring that he has the widest possible powers which are desirable.</P>
    <P>The Government have agreed on a scheme of staff exchanges not only within the public service and the wider public sector but also between the public service and the private sector.  While the response to date has not been as good as had been hoped for, the scheme is being continued.  In particular, it is the aim to have many more exchanges between the public and private sector.  A small working party comprised of both the public and private sectors has been set up to encourage greater exchange between the two sectors.</P>
    <P>I turn now to some of the financial details relating to this group of Estimates. The Estimate for Vote 18 &mdash; the Office of the Minister for the Public Service &mdash; is £7.158 million, which is an increase of £516,000 on the 1983 outturn.  The Vote covers the day-to-day running expenses of the Department and comes in the main under four broad heads, three of expenditure and one (appropriations-in-aid) of income.</P>
    <P>Pay for staff amounts to £5.371 million which is 75 per cent of the total Estimate.</P>
    <P>The second item of major expenditure is £1 million for the purchase, leasing, renting and maintenance of computer equipment used by the Department's central data processing services.</P>
    <P>There is a provision of £999,000 as a grant-in-aid for the Institute of Public Administration.  This grant-in-aid is a contribution towards the general expenses of the institute and includes the corporate subscriptions on behalf of Government Departments.  The institute are heavily involved in the training and educating of public servants, in promoting and undertaking administrative research and in publishing valuable <Col N="623" /> sources of material on public administration.</P>
    <P>Receipts on the Vote are expected to come to £1.3 million in 1984.  These derive mainly from the charges made by the central data processing services in respect of computer work carried out for bodies other than Government Departments.</P>
    <P>The second Vote is Vote 19 &mdash; the Civil Service Commission.  The cost of running the Civil Service Commission and Local Appointments Commission in 1984 is estimated at a net amount of £1.115.  This amount is required to cover the cost of salaries, wages and allowances of the staffs of the two commissions, the cost of the competitions run by them and various other expenses.  The gross cost comes to £2.357 million but revenue received will reduce this by £1.242 million to £1.115 million.  Estimated receipts in 1984 are considerably less than those for 1983.  The decrease is due largely to the fact that, as indicated in the debate on the Estimates for this group of Votes last year, it has been possible this year to discontinue the charging of fees for competitions.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided that a number of Civil Service Commission competitions, i.e., the adult executive officer, clerical assistant (clerical duties) and clerical assistant (shorthand typing) will not be held in 1984.  It has been the practice to hold these competitions annually but, at present, there are large numbers of candidates available from existing panels who are sufficient to fill several times over the vacancies likely to arise for those jobs this year.</P>
    <P>In April, at the request of the Minister, the Civil Service Commissioners made a regulation under the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956, which strengthened their long-standing prohibition against canvassing, or the use of influence, on behalf of candidates at Civil Service competitions.  The effect of the regulation is to ensure that attempts, direct or indirect, by a candidate to influence the commissioners in the selection of persons for employment in the Civil Service will automatically disqualify the candidate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="624" /> Vote 21 &mdash; Superannuation and Retired Allowances &mdash; requires a net amount of £43.244 million.  The Estimate covers payments of pensions and retirement lump sums to established and non-established civil servants, to their widows and widows of the Judiciary.  Inevitably, the cost of superannuation increases each year because of the increase in the number of pensioners and the annual revision of pensions in line with pay increases.  In addition the Government decided, in the context of the 1984 budget, that in the case of general pay increases, pensions would be increased as from the same date as salaries for serving officers.  Previously, pension increases were payable only from the first of July following.  This has added somewhat to the cost in 1984.</P>
    <P>As regards Vote 49 &mdash; Increases in Remuneration and Pensions &mdash; full provision has already been included in departmental estimates for general increases under the 1983 Public Service Pay Agreement.  That agreement also provides for the implementation of certian other special pay increases on a phased basis.  Vote 49 contains a special contingency provision of £54 million to meet the additional costs of these special increases to the extent to which they cannot be met from existing departmental pay allocations.  These amounts will be allocated and paid to the Departments concerned later in the year when the full extent of their additional liabilities is known.</P>
    <P>On the general question of public service pay policy, last year the cost to the Exchequer of pay and pensions increased by 10 per cent to £2,181 million. The provision for 1984 has been increased by a further 9 per cent to £2,376 million to meet the carryover costs of general pay increases under the 1983 Public Service Pay Agreement &mdash; including parity in such cases for public service pensioners &mdash; and the continuing commitment under that agreement to process and implement on a phased basis certain other cost-increasing claims in the period to 1986.  This increase of £195 million is the limit of what can be afforded in 1984. In these circumstances the Government have made no provision for any further <Col N="625" /> general pay increases under the 24th pay round in 1984.</P>
    <P>The Government have issued guidelines for pay in the context of the needs of the economy as a whole and the foregoing outline of public service pay policy falls within the scope of these guidelines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that today is the day when Deputy Calleary and I are to reply from this side of the House to the various matters being discussed. The Civil Service, the administration of the affairs of Government, is extremely important.  It is important that the Department of the Public Service, which is charged with the responsibility of providing an efficient and up to date service, should be discussed in the House.  The Minister put some thoughts before us and gave us an opportunity to highlight any defects.  We are entitled to charge the Government with making a presentation of activity that is less real than it is projected to be.  That can be said more of the Department under discussion than of any other Department. There was little new in the Minister's speech other than a few items which I shall deal with later and the appointment of the Ombudsman.  I am glad that the latter service is being availed of.  Earlier I expressed support for the appointment of the Ombudsman and wished the person appointed well.  I expressed the hope that he and his officials would not suffer from that cruel instrument, the embargo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The embargo has been in operation for three years.  It is a crude instrument which successive Governments have found necessary to introduce to reduce the numbers in the public service.  I was disappointed that the Minister did not announce his intention to lift the embargo in a selective manner.  I appreciate the need to reduce the numbers in the Civil Service in an effort to cut administration costs.  There is a great need for tax reform although the Government cannot be persuaded to embark on such a course.  There is an acceptance that some servces will have to be curtailed but that should not occur at the expense of productive investment or in such vital areas as health or education.  The <Col N="626" /> embargo, and its crude implementation, is of major concern to us all.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Minister said that the Minister had introduced a career break scheme in the health area. I do not think it would be possible to get a truer statement than that.  All regional health boards will agree that the Minister for Health has done everything possible to introduce a career break scheme in his area of responsibility.  The health services are breaking down in many areas.  Wards are being closed in hospitals and consultants do not have adequate staff to carry out their essential specialities.  It is in that area that the embargo is doing most damage. In the Southern Health Board the cardiologist on the staff of the regional hospital has indicated his intention to resign because of the impact of the embargo on staff numbers.  I understand that he may have reversed his decision. I hope that his threat motivated somebody somewhere to apply commonsense in this area.  Many people in the area with heart complaints were very concerned about this.  The responsibility for this rests with the Department of the Public Service.</P>
    <P>I could give many illustrations of problems in the health services that have arisen because of the embargo.  I live beside the 600 bed Cork Regional Hospital which has been in operation for a few years and I am aware that there have been serious cutbacks there because of the embargo.  The cleanliness of the hospital is not as it should be because there are not enough people to carry out the ordinary daily chores.  That must be considered in conjunction with the decision to close wards in July and August.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the Revenue Commissioners. I am given to understand that about 640 posts remained unfilled in the area of taxes, customs and excise and so on.  This is alarming at a time when we hear so much about the non-payment and non-collection of taxes.  Is that figure correct? If not, what is the correct figure?  Is the large number of vacancies one of the reasons the collection of taxation is not on target?  Is it one of the reasons one finds so much discontent and frustration <Col N="627" /> with the tax system?  VAT is not being refunded in some cases, despite all the procedures having been followed.</P>
    <P>Is the embargo being applied too rigidly in sensative areas such as this?  The embargo is a crude instrument which has been in operation for three years and I suggest that the time has come for a selective lifting of it.  There is a backlog of work in the courts.  Has this anything to do with frustration on the part of the Department of Justice due to posts being left unfilled?  I was long enough in Government to know that many Departments can put a gun to the head of their incumbent Ministers to try to get additional posts filled.  There must be a limit to the application of the embargo and the position may be getting very serious.  One could ask what impact the embargo is having on some essential semi-State bodies. I appreciate that the Minister has no responsibility for the brevity of the time allocated for this discussion but we must know where cuts are being made.</P>
    <P>We need an extremely efficient, informed and courteous Civil Service. For the most part we have it, but I support the Minister in his efforts to bring about continued improvement because it is very important that service should become more personalised.  Those of us who represent areas far removed from Dublin often find ourselves performing an information function at our clinics in regard to the entitlements of people.  We must try to ensure that service is available and that people are properly informed as to their rights and entitlements.  It is a tribute to politicians on all sides that people have confidence in approaching them for information, although it should be made known to them through a different system.</P>
    <P>In regard to the new promotions system for secretaries of Departments, I support any changes which work towards improvement.  In my experience secretaries of Departments were in almost all cases very competent, committed and dedicated people who had come through a system which was very critical of itself. No Government ever sought to appoint as secretary of a Department anybody <Col N="628" /> but the best.  However, I accept that if we can improve the system we should do so. I am prepared to wait and see how this system works.  The Minister has made an effort to take some kudos for himself by defending the system in the Civil Service and criticising the media for representing the new system as being a switch from &ldquo;Buggins's turn&rdquo;.  Nobody could accept that this was the approach in the former system.  There is a continuing programme to improve the image of the public sector and service at the point of contact with the public.  I was deeply committed to this during my time in the Department, as was my colleague, Deputy Calleary. We spent a lot of time and effort on it and towards the end of my period in office we produced a very effective film for members of staff to inform them what the public expect of them.  As public representatives we often find it difficult to communicate with the public sector and get our point of view across.  The ordinary man in the street finds it even more difficult and we must improve the situation. No Minister can say that this task is being undertaken for the first time.  It has been an on-going process.</P>
    <P>There are schemes whereby staff are exchanged, not only within the public service but between the public and private sectors.  When I was Minister for the Public Service I had a private secretary who was involved in one of those staff exchange schemes.  He was a credit to that scheme and he was the kind of person who would be an ornament in any sector, public or private.  He was probably able to avail of the scheme to his own advancement.  The scheme has been very successful but it is not an innovation.  I support the Minister in his view that is has not been availed of to the greatest possible extent.</P>
    <P>This Government Task Force on Employment came up with some rare suggestions on how we should advance as a people, two of which have been mentioned in the Minister's introductory remarks.  For example, he had this to say:</P>
    <P>Arising from the decisions of the Government Task Force on Employment, two schemes were introduced, <Col N="629" /> aimed at providing new job opportunities for young people in the Civil Service and, at the same time, facilitating staff with domestic and other interests who wish to avail of the new arrangements.  The first of these is job-sharing.</P>
    <P>I ask the House: what is all this job-sharing about?  We are told that young people may be recruited to the Civil Service on a job-sharing basis and that after a minimum of two years' service &mdash; there is no guarantee &mdash; they will be offered fulltime employment.  In this respect I want the Minister to answer a few questions for me.  For example, in the case of an executive officer recruited on a job-sharing basis, does that mean that his or her salary would be in the region of £57 per week and that such a person would be expected to pay for their accommodation, if they are from the country, in this city out of that money? Again, in the case of a clerical assistant, does it mean that they would earn about £40 a week and would they have to make the same provisions for accommodation, food and so on?  If it does mean that they must so provide then I wonder is this Government Task Force on Employment moving in the right direction or have they made recommendations that could be regarded as progressive ones or otherwise? In this respect I should like as much information as it is possible to give.  I should like to know also if the staff associations were consulted and, if so, what was their response to this innovation.</P>
    <P>I should also like to know if any people have already been recruited as a result of the recent job-sharing advertisements.  If so, what is the level of their salaries and, if they emanate from, say, Cork, Kerry, Donegal or Mayo, are they expected to pay for their accommodation out of their gross earnings?</P>
    <P>The second scheme referred to is that of career breaks.  I referred earlier to the Minister for Health causing career breaks; certainly he has broken many a career in the general health services.  I understand that a number of people have availed of career breaks in the public service.  I should like to know also if what <Col N="630" /> I am told is correct, that their return to the Civil Service after a maximum of three years is guaranteed but that the date of such return is not guaranteed as near as possible to the date of application. I should like the Minister to clarify that point for the House and to say specifically how one returns to the Civil Service after, say, one, two or three years' absence under this career breaks scheme.  I should like to know also how many people have availed of the provisions of the scheme, how many consequential vacancies have occurred, how many have been filled and whether or not promotions have arisen as a result of such consequential vacancies.  In other words, how bright an idea is this of the famous Government Task Force on Employment and how many jobs has it or will it create?</P>
    <P>One of the most important areas of the public service today is the pay scene.  No doubt it is of tremendous concern to the Government, the Minister for Finance, this House and indeed the community as a whole.  Here I refer to the size of our annual pay bill.  As a Minister who successively renegotiated a previous public service wage agreement under very difficult circumstances, it appears to me that there is a new <i>laissez faire</i> approach on the part of this Government to the whole question of discussions, consultations and negotiations.  In fact what appears to be a new docile approach on the part of many of the trade unions and associations concerned with the public service surprises me.  There seems to be a total absence of discussion, consultation and negotiation.  I support entirely the need for pay restraint at a time when what this country needs more than anything else are jobs.  It also needs tax reform and a cutback in real tax being paid by people. Considering that the 23rd round ended the last day of May, I am not aware of any meetings having been held yet with the Minister or of what happens henceforth. I presume the Minister will be seeking a pay freeze.  I read recently that the Minister for Finance would be seeking a pay freeze for the entire year but, to my knowledge, no discussions have taken place nor is it intended that such should take place, constituting a new <Col N="631" /> approach by the Government, taking their decisions in their own way without consultation with anybody.</P>
    <P>I do not want to hog the time of the House because I know other members are anxious to contribute in an area in which I believe contribution from this House is very important.  I believe the role of a Member of this House in the administration of the public service is extremely important.  At our ordinary clinics we Members can detect, perhaps more easily than any Minister, some troublesome areas.  Any Member can alert a Minister to an area of Government where something appears to have gone wrong because of an excessive number of representations having been made to him or her in any one week.  I believe also we have a duty to ensure that bureaucracy is not allowed to bog down democracy.  If I were to offer the Minister a constructive suggestion &mdash; one I have made in this House before &mdash; it would be in the whole area of physical planning which is the responsibility of a different Minister.  I am speaking here, through the Minister present, to the Minister for the Public Service who has responsibility for the whole of the operations of the public service.  I fear we have a much too bureaucratic approach to physical planning which is stultifying development, slowing down job creation and rendering development generally more costly.  I shall not go further than that except to suggest that the Minister might, along with his colleague, or in consultation with him, examine this area.  I believe it warrants urgent examination and that a lot could be done by way of job creation.</P>
    <P>Through the Minister present I want to support the Minister for the Public Service in any positive, progressive steps he may take in his Department to improve the efficiency of the public service generally in order to render it what is most needed and best suited to the community to whom we are all responsible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Gene Fitzgerald I welcome the progressive policies outlined in the Minister's introductory <Col N="632" /> remarks, look forward to their implementation and indeed to others also.</P>
      <P>Obviously the fact that we live in an infinitely more complex world, with the more leisurely, straightforward type of life and administration being gone forever, has been grasped by the Minister, presumably also by the public servants in his Department and hopefully those in other Departments also.  If the administration is to keep pace with the work and improve on it, this progression, not alone in the field of computerisation but also in the selection and promotion of people within the public service, is to be welcomed. It must fit within the national plan of Government.  We all know the challenges facing us in the eighties and nineties in all areas, particularly in administrations and new administrative aids are necessary.  Much will be achieved with the publication of the White Paper which, as the Minister, Deputy Cooney, said here tonight, will react and respond to much of what the public has said over the years which now, it is to be hoped, will be translated into action in that White Paper.  It will also help the Civil Service to feel that they are part of a community.  At times they seem to be ghetto-ised or a people apart.  We will be reflecting and acting out the response of the public.  We are a small country, a small community, and civil servants should not be made to feel that they are alienated or a separate part of the public.</P>
      <P>Within the Civil Service itself the changes that have come about since the beginning of this year in appointment to Civil Service posts from assistant secretary level upwards are to be welcomed. Professional and technical grades will be opened up.  There has been a public perception and also an experience within certain areas of the Civil Service itself that really there was no acknowledgement of initiative or further training because promotion would come only with seniority and it might be dangerous to be seen as in any way radical or innovative within one's own Department because that might be counter-productive to one's promotion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get rid of that notion, <Col N="633" /> perceived or real, is essential.  Up to now civil servants received no real acknowledgement of a lifetime of work of public service because their names could not be acknowledged.  Therefore, incentive was absent and perhaps even promotional opportunities were not there or at least were not based on what they would have been based on in the outside world, an acknowledgement of the very real resources and potential that people brought to their jobs.  Now there is a real incentive for young civil servants to seek further training and promotion and to respond to the challenges within their Departments and their efforts in so doing will be not alone acknowledged but rewarded.</P>
    <P>I note also that secretaries of Departments appointed under the new arrangements will hold office for not more than seven years and will retire from the Civil Service at the age of 60.  It could be argued that after seven or perhaps ten years people have used up all their ideas and initiatives.  Maybe politicians also should look at their tenure of office and consider whether a time scale of ten or 12 years might not burn up their initiative also.  Perhaps we will consider some large transfer of politicians with new ideas and initiatives.  That is just a thought and perhaps the electorate will sort that out for us.</P>
    <P>Greater accountability is very necessary, not alone on the part of the officials &mdash; we are already experiencing evidence of this &mdash; but in what the Minister has referred to already as the base for further democracy, the responsibility of our elected representatives as executives or administrators <i>vis-à-vis</i> legislators.  As legislation becomes more necessary, complex and difficult and more and more research into it is needed, it will be impossible for a Minister of a Department to meet all the needs or take responsibility for everything that happens in his Department. One topic that might be welcome on a debate on this would be the responsibility of the Minister <i>vis-à-vis</i> his Department, not taking away from the authority of a ministerial position, but recognising that physically and mentally a Minister could not possibly cope with <Col N="634" /> the incredible complexity of the day-to-day running of his Department.  This matter needs discussion in depth which should produce a signal of the kind of perception that politicians will have of their role in future.  It has become increasingly evident that politicians, even backbenchers, certainly Ministers, cannot continue to carry the incredible workload that they have been asked to carry in all areas and to bear the whole responsibility for it also.  I look forward to further discussion on this which I take will be a large part of the contents of the White Paper.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister is developing a management system which will allow the manager of a Department to be responsible for the budget within that Department, with consequently a more cost-conscious approach to management. A great amount of our budgeting and the funding that we give to outside agencies through different Government Departments is based strictly on an annual budget and the arrangements are so rigid that if any of that budget is left over &mdash; for instance as in the year 1983-1984 &mdash; for whatever good and honest reason, that cannot be brought over into 1985. We are talking about cost-conscious approaches and the managers within such Departments having the resources and authority to project budgets on a three-year or five-year basis, certainly on a programmed plan.  We are all aware of a certain amount of wastage and a mad dash at the end of the year to spend money on what may not necessarily be the most effective or even necessary part of an agency's needs, but rather than return the money this is done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald has referred to the tremendous workload of politicians.  It would seem that the point of contact with the public by civil servants has not been efficient or effective enough to allow that public to believe that they were getting the right information or that they had the right or authority to demand such information or the resources and the right to complain.  Therefore, much of politicians' time is taken up with people coming to them who either do not understand the system or feel that their queries or <Col N="635" /> complaints will not be dealt with within the ambience of the Civil Service itself, particularly at the point of contact with the public.  There are two ways of doing this.  One would be to make sure that information is disseminated much more widely than at present.  The Minister has talked about reforming the forms etc. Sometimes forms are printed in official jargon and none of us can be sure of what they mean.</P>
    <P>Next &mdash; I know that the Minister for the Public Service is thinking along this line &mdash; rather than having the most junior people placed at the hatches and the information desks throughout our public information and social welfare sections, for instance, we should change around dramatically and have middle or even senior level people who have not alone the information but the experience of working within the legislation, some of which is very complex.  The situation of having the member of the public on the one side embarrassed and the young person on the other side embarrassed and with a queue of people being detained leads to frustration on both sides.  It is endemic throughout our public employment exchanges and social welfare agencies. However, rather than taking up the time of even more senior and better-informed personnel at the ordinary hatch and in order to preserve some degree of privacy where that is required, we should strive to have information-cum-complaints desks where people would be treated with privacy and with courtesy, where they would not be treated as if they were a nuisance but as having the right to such information.</P>
    <P>This must be one of the areas that has been emphasised most in the response to the views sought by the Minister.  Unfortunately, a great number of people at the receiving end of what they consider to be frustrating and humiliating experiences are the ones who do not have the competence or the confidence to write and tell us about it.  As Deputy Fitzgerald has said, we as public representatives have been made very much aware of this problem by people who experience a total sense of powerlessness and who believe <Col N="636" /> that through the intervention of a politician or someone else their problems can be solved when all that is at stake are their rights.  We cannot over-emphasise how damaging that situation is from the point of view of both sides because if this is the perception people on the informing side have towards applicants, a sense of contempt could creep in.  On the other hand, if people are led to believe that their entitlement to information is sometimes privileged there will continue to be a psychological dependency within our society which is damaging in the area of reform not only in the public service but outside it.  I hope that when the White Paper is produced we will have the opportunity of a longer debate on that.</P>
    <P>Regarding the situation of only every third vacancy in the Civil Service being filled, while we all realise that there must not be an overmanned public service and that the more balance we get as between the public and private sectors the greater will be the level of income distribution, I am concerned that if we adhere rigidly and inflexibly to the regulation of filling only every third vacancy in each Department there might be areas in which there would be real need for a vacancy to be filled but that the vacancy would be left unfilled.  We are not talking about the filling of every third vacancy in certain areas but there should be interchangibility so that people could be changed from one Department to another in accordance with the requirements of any Department.  There is no point in having a formula based on numbers but which is not contributing towards what we want to achieve.</P>
    <P>I have some questions to put to the Minister in relation to two schemes that have been introduced with a view to providing job opportunities for young people.  I refer first to job sharing.  My concept of job sharing is that it would not be confined to the lower paid.  There is reference here to job sharing leading to full-time employment after two years but that is referring to people who are new to the work force.  I submit that we should examine the concept of job sharing at the higher as well as at the lower levels.  A couple, for instance, at the higher level <Col N="637" /> though not necessarily at that level, might like to work on a job-sharing basis and thereby share all the responsibilities within the home as well as outside it.  If we are talking seriously about full employment we must be prepared in the future to give everyone the opportunity of working outside the home in gainful employment.  What concerns me about this question of job sharing is that there seems to be creeping in the notion that it is some kind of deal for women and that this would mean that women once again would be channelled into <i>cul-de-sac</i> situations in which pressure would be brought to bear on two or three women to share one job without the same situation applying to men.  This would mean that once again women would be denied the same promotion, training and even pension opportunities that apply to men. There is no point in talking about the idea of job sharing if we do not think of its equal applicability to both men and women.</P>
    <P>On the question of career breaks, we are told that they be available for a wide variety of reasons including domestic responsibility.  I enter the caveat that, as in the case of job sharing, we think traditionally of domestic responsibility in terms of women.  Let us hope we are talking about men taking career breaks also, including breaks to cater for domestic responsibilities.  We will need to put a good deal of publicity and debate into ensuring that both men and women will be part of this concept.  The Minister may be able to tell us what the figures are for men and women respectively in terms of those who have availed so far of those breaks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us here welcomed the appointment of the Ombudsman but the evidence emerging from that Office <Col N="638" /> so far is that both the Ombudsman and his staff are constantly frustrated by the fact that many of the cases being brought to their attention cannot be coped with because of the absence of appropriate legislation.  There is an inbuilt injustice in many instances because of that situation. One area in which there is a great number of complaints and a great deal of distress is the whole area of social welfare.  On many occasions they are powerless because we have not reformed the legislation. The Ombudsman is powerless to resolve these cases with justice.  Reform of the legislation must go hand in hand with reform of the public service.</P>
      <P>The Civil Service Commission's regulation on the prohibition of canvassing has taken a tremendous burden off of politicians.  There was pressure on politicians. When they did not want to act in an unjust way they found themselves in the invidious position that, if they did not canvass for a person, another politician would do so.  People should get jobs on their own merits and on the basis of interviews and so on.  The most insulting thing we can suggest to people who get jobs is that they did not get them themselves but through someone else's influence.</P>
      <P>Reference was made by the Minister to the payment of pensions, retirement lump sums and so on.  I wish to make a plea on behalf of pre-1968 Civil Service widows.  Such widows have courageously fought to get full pension rights.  They have now reached a stage where they get four-fifths.  As they are a dwindling group and as some of them are living in certain need, perhaps in the next budget they would be given the other fifth and so receive a full pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Labour said he was fully committed to bringing about a programme of equality for women even to the extent of discriminating in favour of women, which is what affirmative action is about.  I should like to believe that the Minister for the Public Service is imbued with the same spirit of commitment. Without such a programme it will not be achieved with any sense of urgency. There are many models we can offer the Minister if he needs them.  One area which has been defined in the courts as <Col N="639" /> being an indirect discrimination against women is where an age limit is imposed. There are times when women have to leave their jobs and then wish to come back.  I know a commitment has been given by the Minister for Labour that unless it is absolutely necessary to the job the age limit will be removed.  I should like to think that is one of the first areas the Minister for the Public Service will look at also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Barnes in making a plea for the pre-1968 widows.  There is a very small number of people involved and it would hardly make any difference to an Estimate of £49,747,000.</P>
      <P>Mention was made of the embargo by Deputies Fitzgerald and Barnes.  I accept the need to cut back on the number of civil servants, but we must have a sense of reality and a commonsense approach to the way the embargo is managed.  We are getting a tremendous amount of money from the European Social Fund this year.  It is about £30 million over and above what we got last year.  Most of this money is to go for vocational training.  A lot of it will be spent by AnCO on training schemes.  However, some schemes are held up because there is no available manpower to carry them out.  The payment of grants is delayed to such an extent that their value is halved by the time they are paid out.  There should be people available to carry out inspections for the various grants, particularly in the agricultural sector.  We have all been inundated by representations from people who are desperate to have their grants paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can envisage a situation somewhat similar to that pointed out by Deputy Fitzgerald.  I know of one Department where a vacancy for chief engineer cannot be filled until two more people retire. This is due to the embargo.  It is ludicrous in the extreme and it takes the embargo to the stage where it is farcical.  Thousands of pounds worth of jobs are held up because it is necessary to get the <i>imprimatur</i> of the engineer in charge. Everyone has to wait for two people to <Col N="640" /> resign before the vacancy is filled.  The Minister should ask his colleague to look again at the embargo particularly as it relates to areas where there is only one person in a particular grade.</P>
    <P>There are delays in the Land Registry because they are completely understaffed. I do not have to tell the Minister what that could lead to as regards the payment of loans, land transfers and so on.  The mapping section is completely understaffed.  In the Vote for the Civil Service Commissioners examiners fees are up.  It is ironic that their fees are up when the Minister said that competition would not be held for three sections this year.  In his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The Government have decided that a number of Civil Service Commission competitions, that is, the adult executive officer, clerical assistant (clerical duties) and clerical assistant (shorthand typing) will not be held in 1984.</P>
    <P>As the last two examinations normally get a very large number of applicants one wonders why examiners' fees are up.</P>
    <P>I am very glad the post of Ombudsman's is working well and I hope the commitments I gave on behalf of Fianna Fáil to extend the Ombudsman's writ will be honoured quickly and within the time limit set out in the Bill.  It is important that commitments to look at the areas of the public service which up to now have not been included would be met as quickly as possible by this Government.</P>
    <P>I am sad that there was no mention of decentralisation in the Minister's speech. I know that this scheme has been cancelled because we had the Minister for Finance's views on this many times.  He is on record as stating that it would not create a single job at a time when the numbers in the Civil Service are diminishing and therefore there was no need for decentralisation.  I hate to appeal to the Chair, but Nenagh was one of the areas which was to get one of these offices.  I am positive that there would have been extra jobs created in Nenagh as well as in Ballina if this programme had gone ahead.  The spin-off alone of having £50,000 wages per week in the town of Ballina would be enormous.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="641" /> Fianna Fáil were blamed for not providing various sums of money in the 1982 Estimates, but the £6 million which was provided in the 1983 Estimates was not spent in the areas for which it had been provided.  This is because the programme was cancelled.  I ask the Minister to have another look at this because accommodation is still needed and is still being acquired.  I presume that the allocation of £750,000 is for alterations to office accommodation in Dublin and that the money will be spent not so much on the actual building but on renovations of existing offices which are not suitable. The offices designed by the Office of Public Works suited the particular needs of the relevant Departments.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister mentioned computers.  I welcome the greater computerisation of the public service.  I agree with the sentiments expressed in the Minister's speech, but when I look at the Estimate I find that the amount provided for the Central Data Processing Service this year is less than last year.  I wonder how the Minister can reconcile these two facts when one reads of the importance he places on computers.</P>
    <P>I will deal now with representations.  I want to ask the Minister one specific question: what is the position of the hundreds of young men and women who sat the last Garda recruiting examination? A number of these people are in limbo.  They do not know where they are going, when or if they will be called, or if they should try to get alternative work. The Minister should ask the Government to set a limit.  If they decide to recruit 900 or 1,000 young men and women, at least these people will know what the situation is.  It is not fair to keep them in suspended animation for 18 months.  If people were given this type of information there would not be a need for any candidate to come to me or any other public representative to find out if he or she is going to be called in X number of months or if he or she will ever be called.</P>
    <P>The twenty-fourth pay round was mentioned. When I was in the Department of the Public Service and the Department of Finance I remember sitting in this House listening to the then Opposition <Col N="642" /> Deputies lambaste Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, then Minister for Finance, because he had not included in the budget a sum for special pay awards.  Those people who are now in Government sat here with their calculators and said that the Minister was cooking the books because he did not provide about £70 million which would be needed to meet special claims.  We all know the twenty-fourth pay round for the public service finished at the end of May and it is unrealistic to present a budget to the Dáil without providing some small amount for this pay round, unless the object is to provide the money needed in next year's budget.</P>
    <P>I notice consultancy services have increased by 74 per cent.  I presume the advertisements in the newspapers and on television have led to this increase.  I do not know who is behind those advertisements, but to say that Mr. A. or Mr. B. answered ten telephone calls and has in the case of one individual given a grant to a farmer in Mayo, Meath, Roscommonor Westmeath, and has signed 19 letters in a day is the height of foolishness. I do not believe anybody in the public service does so little work.  I know the Department of the Public Service.  I was in that Department for about 18 months and it is foolish for an advertisement to say that a civil servant can only do that amount of work in a day.  If that is all he can do, it is no wonder we have so many civil servants.  That advertisement should be changed immediately because it does not give a true picture.  It is said that a civil servant has an easy job but it is not so easy that a person can only sign 19 letters in one day and answer ten telephone calls.  I wish that was all I had to do in a day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>The majority of the civil servants I have met are conscientious, hard-working and very civil people.  The few who have besmirched the good name of the majority and unfortunately soiled the name of the Civil Service are the people the Minister should be after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Easy contact with Departments is very <Col N="643" /> important.  Sometimes the media criticise Deputies for making too many representations, and they in turn cannot be criticised for doing so.  Representations by Deputies at their present volume would not be necessary if full information could be elicited in response to inquiries. One of the great bones of contention at my clinics is delay in getting answers.  For that reason it would be very handy if the Department had the type of information desk Deputies have asked for.  It is frustrating for people who need information to be put from one section to another and to another, and to have their telephone bills mounting, sometimes up to £4 a call. Such an information desk would mean that Deputies would not have to make so many inquiries.  Ordinary people would be able to get the information they seek. There is still the possibility that one must go to the Minister's office to get a reply, or Deputies may have to seek the information by way of parliamentary question.</P>
    <P>There has been reference to the system of promotion and recruitment.  There have been changes, which I welcome, but I do not think they will make any great difference. Civil servants in the Departments whom I have dealt with are very intelligent and capable, particularly in the upper strata.  They work very hard. However, I question the new system by which secretaries of Departments can hold that position for seven years only. Most of them will be in their mid-forties or younger.  At the end of seven years, apparently, they will be demoted.  Will there be somewhere like &ldquo;a retired secretaries' corner&rdquo; into which they will be put?  I am afraid this change is not to the best advantage.  Many such people in their early fifties will have their talents wasted.</P>
    <P>I am very cynical about job-sharing. Perhaps I am under a misapprehension, so I will quote what the Minister said:</P>
    <P>This scheme, which was introduced at the end of February, will enable serving officers to share the duties of a particular post in return for half pay and other benefits.  The resultant <Col N="644" /> vacancies, including those occurring at recruitment level, will be filled.  In addition some civil service posts will be advertised on a job-sharing basis. Job-sharing recruits will be offered full-time employment after a minimum of two years.</P>
    <P>Does that mean that half a job will become a full job after two years?  How will it affect subsequent recruitment? Will those people who have retired have to do another examination, although they did one for recruitment in the first place?</P>
    <P>This scheme has been causing considerable anxiety and people have been asking what their position will be when they make a clear break with the Department and then come back.  It appears that they must make fresh applications, but they may have to wait for God knows how long to be reinstated.  Does this new system mean that after two years away from a job a person will have to wait until a vacancy arises?</P>
    <P>Still on the question of employment, I should like to deal with the waiting list. Why have people to wait for interminable periods to be called for appointment after competitive examinations?  I think it would be much better if successful applicants could be told immediately that they were, say, placed 40th rather than to have them waiting up to 18 months before they know were they are.  I hope the Minister will reply to these points.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be too long.  First, I should like to compliment the Minister for the Public Service on his radical approach.  In his brief period in office, Deputy Boland has shown his capacity for making radical changes.  Consequently, a breath of fresh air has blown through that Department.  He has got the Civil Service asking themselves questions, and in his reform programme in regard to promotions in the Civil Service he has brought new radical thinking to the Department and the lot of civil servants throughout the Government service has been improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>PAYE workers have to contribute £5,370 million annually to the bill for the public service and the taxpayers have <Col N="645" /> begun to ask if they are getting value for that money.  Heretofore, the public have not examined properly how much value they are getting for what they pay towards public policy decisions.  Deputy Barnes spoke about budget control.  The whisper is going about that when it comes to October or November there is a rush to spend unspent money within the Department.</P>

      <P>There will be no rush this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Tell us the Departments that have that money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is a fact that money is spent on ungainful schemes, this should be corrected.  The public should be made aware of this.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on changing the face of the public service by asking people to acknowledge their names.  The public will respond to the public servant who answers and looks after a detail personally. I do not agree with Deputy Calleary that when the public from the country contact a Department at present they are being let down.  I know if one contacts the Department of Social Welfare and asks for the public servant's name that public servant will give the answer about the entitlement of the individual.</P>
      <P>The Minister has included other reforms and is asking about job breaks and job sharing.  In my constituency in Shannon, Aer Rianta have been operating a job break scheme for some years past.  Some semi-State employees are serving in Africa and the Middle East. Some, for instance, have set up duty-free shops for the Arabs and expect when they come back to get employment here. Some have been given a job break to work with Trocaire in South America.  If Aer Rianta can operate it in a small way, the Department of the Public Service are well able to make the headlines and use the job break system satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has at least started down the road towards changing the &ldquo;Yes, Minister&rdquo; relationship which has existed between the public service and the Oireachtas Members.  As far as those who <Col N="646" /> hold portfolios are concerned, his attitude in his proposed promotion scheme appears to be to give people their heads and to control the policy decisions properly.</P>
    <P>Criticism has been offered from the other side of the House to the seven year term which he proposes for Department Secretaries.  Yet, a few days ago we were honouring the greatest public servant of all in the free world, Ronald Reagan.</P>

If one is in the service, for instance, of the CIE when making up gratuities that company do not acknowledge those years in the Army or Naval Service.  I ask the Minister to get the semi-State sector to make this acknowledgement with regard to gratuities. When I make representations about this matter I am told that this cannot be included in the pension.  I can understand that, but in the calculation of a gratuity a number of years in the Defence Forces should be acknowledged.  I wish the Minister well and hope that he continues to be the successful, radical Minister he has been.</P>

      <P>The points made by Deputies fall under a number of headings. The general efficiency of the public service was touched on by Deputy Barnes.  With regard to the financial programme in advance, I can assure the Deputy that that exercise goes on in Departments in conjunction with the Department of Finance.  Also, I want to assure her that there is no rush to spend money at the end of the year.  If there were such procedures in the past, I can assure the Deputy that it is now frowned on and has been eliminated.</P>

      <P>The other matter to which Deputy Barnes referred was that of the Minister's responsibility <i>vis-à-vis</i> senior management in the Department and relieving the Minister of some day-to-day executive functions.  This subject has been skirted around by various administrations for a long time and has been the subject of reviews by expert outside bodies, but permission has never yet been granted.  I have every confidence that the present incumbent of this office will live up to Deputy Carey's expectations to introduce radical reforms and I am confident that he will achieve reform in that difficult area as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="648" /> Another subject which has got considerable airing and in which considerable misunderstanding has been shown is that of career breaks and job sharing. Indeed, I was quite surprised and disappointed to hear Deputy Fitzgerald say &mdash; and I quote: &ldquo;I ask you, what is all this job sharing bit?&rdquo; He now nods his head, repeating the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a novel concept. There have been applications for it in my Department.  The majority of the applicants have been female employees.  It has suited them.  The numbers so far are small.  I anticipate that, as the concept gets greater acceptance in the public service, there will be no sexist imbalance in it &mdash; not that there would be anything wrong about its being particularly suitable to one section of our community.  I do not see anything wrong about that.</P>
      <P>The career break is a new concept.  So far, there has been a fair amount of interest in it, and 69 applications were received for career breaks.  These people apply on the understanding that it will suit them to have a break in their career. They also know that, when they end the break and re-apply to the Civil Service to rejoin, they will synchronise the termination of one with the recommencement of the other.  This will be part of the mechanism of organising the career breaks.  As a matter of interest 186 people have applied for job sharing.  If it had the unfortunate consequences which Deputy Fitzgerald attributes to it due to the misunderstanding of the concept, it would be surprising that as many as 186 people would actually apply.  It is a new scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the embargo which was raised by all those who spoke, we all have to acknowledge that, when it was introduced initially, it was introduced in an emergency situation.  Due to the policy of the previous Administration between 1977 and 1981 the numbers in the public service had escalated out of all proportion to the previous growth of the public service.  From 1977 the figure went from 48,670 to 60,700 in 1981.  In fairness, I am not comparing like with like, because in 1981 there was a change in the staff <Col N="651" /> information system.  The order of magnitude is right because in 1980 the figure was 53,822.</P>
    <P>These were quite startling increases in the numbers in the public service.  Those figures were for the Civil Service proper. They all had to be paid for out of public funds.  This is one of the reasons why we are in such a financial bind at the moment.  The Administration of the day naively thought you could cure unemployment by expanding the Civil Service. We are now paying for that piece of political and economic naivete.  The embargo was a direct consequence of that policy.  The embargo was to try to halt and cut back on the growth of the public service so that the Exchequer would not find itself strangled in trying to pay for a top heavy public service.</P>
    <P>The embargo was applied because a quick remedy had to be found.  In its application since then the embargo had been refined all the time.  It is not as inflexible as Deputies tended to suggest. For example, the Department of Social Welfare have had extra staff allotted well over and above what they would be entitled to if the embargo had been strictly applied.  They were made available by staff savings in other Departments.  Officers of other Departments were assigned to the Department of Social Welfare.  The same happened in the Revenue Commission. I am puzzled at Deputy Fitzgerald's figure of 600 vacancies in the Revenue Commission.  I cannot see that, because that would represent&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Deputy said there were 600.  I have not got the figure.  Obviously 600 cannot be right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Because 600 would represent 9 or 10 per cent of the whole Department.  I know it would represent 8 or 9 per cent of the total establishment as being vacant.  That is not right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The embargo is being applied in as flexible a way as possible.  It needs more refining, and this is under consideration.  It is not the cause of delays in the courts, because the courts were in arrears during the massive growth of the Civil Service under the regime of which Deputy Fitzgerald was a member.  Likewise the Land Registry.  Unfortunately that is not new.  When I left the Department of Justice we had a new scheme of organisation arranged for the Land Registry which was implemented in 1977. Having been in practice thereafter, I know it produced quite significant changes in speeding up the work of the Land Registry.  A sheer volume of work has now come in on top of the Land Registry again and there are delays, but these may be due to matters of organisation as much as a question of personnel.</P>
      <P>The embargo is tied up with the whole question of pay.  I thought it a little naive of Deputy Calleary to ask could some little thing not have been provided in the Estimate and in this year's budget in connection with public service pay.  A 1 per cent increase in public service pay costs £24 million.</P>

      <P>Disagreement has been recorded.  Deputy Fitzgerald seems pleased which, again, is typical of the irresponsible naive approach which characterised the Administration of which he was a member, and which has led us into the awful predicament in which we now find ourselves.  Disagreement has been recorded in regard to some of the pay negotiations and in other areas claims have been made.  There are procedures and mechanisms for pursuing all these things.  The Government made their position clear in the budget statement of this year.</P>
      <P>Decentralisation was raised by Deputy Calleary.  It was a plea for decentralisation to be implemented.  That had to be shelved to save money.  It would have cost £45 million in this year to implement the proposed decentralisation programme. I quite agree decentralisation would bring some social benefits to certain areas.  The town of Ballina would have been one of them.  I am sorry the town of Ballina has had to be deprived of this social and some financial benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>To provide that benefit for the town of Ballina and the other selected areas would have meant asking the general taxpayer to find £45 million at a time when everyone is complaining about the undue high level of taxation.  If Deputy Calleary reflects a while, he will agree that he would not ask the hard-pressed taxpayer to provide £45 million to improve the social and financial position of a couple of areas.  It is a question of balance, and the balance came down in favour of shelving the decentralisation programme.</P>

In addition, some leases which were part of the cost have ended and the computers are now owned by the Departments.</P>
      <P>His query with regard to Garda recruits will have to be put to the Minister for Justice.  The Civil Service Commissioners merely act as agents for that Department. The names are given to them and the level and pace of recruitment are matters for them.  With regard to secretaries who may retire at a young age, I have every confidence that, if a person has the ability to achieve the secretaryship of a Department at an age which means that he will retire in his early fifties, or possibly in his late forties, he will have displayed a level of expertise and attainment which would make him a most desired person in industry, or semi-State or other areas.

      <P>The sum proposed for the Vote for Foreign Affairs is £20,243,000.  Most of this provision is required for the salaries of staff at headquarters and at 39 missions and offices abroad.  Provision is also included for travelling expenses and communications and Post Office services.  As is customary in this Vote, provisions are also included for repatriation and maintenance of Irish citizens who get into difficulties abroad, for cultural and information services and for North-South and Anglo-Irish Co-operation.</P>
      <P>The provision for Appropriations-in-Aid is considerably reduced this year as it has been decided to bring passport and other consular receipts, which are estimated in 1984 at £3.1 million to credit as Exchequer extra receipts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision in the Vote for Foreign Affairs for 1984 includes a sum of £638,000 arising from our Presidency of the European Community in the second half of this year.  This special provision is necessary to provide for additional staff <Col N="657" /> and also for increased travel and communications expenses.  Excluding the Presidency provision the gross Vote for Foreign Affairs for 1984 represents an increase of 11 per cent over last year.</P>
    <P>In the period immediately before us, our foreign policy will necessarily find its main expression through our Presidency of the European Community.  We shall have to deal with the internal problems of the Community and with Europe's relationship, both political and economic with the wider world of which it forms a part.  Before dealing with the internal and external economic problems and relationships of the Community, I should like to review briefly some of the main political problems in the wider world.  It will be our duty, in the next six months, in European Political Co-operation, to guide the efforts of the Ten member states to contribute to a solution of those problems.</P>
    <P>The most basic political reality throughout the second half of this century has been the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union.  The peace of our world depends on the stability and the basic health of that relationship. The enormous power of these countries makes it inevitable that the prime problem is always one of the management of rivalries and tensions between them.  It is only realistic to say that the present moment is one of particular uncertainty and perhaps even danger. Significant additional deployment in Europe of weapons of mass destruction is under way on both sides and the negotiations between the super powers on both intermediate range and strategic nuclear weapons have been suspended. At the same time, the advance of high technology has reached the point where a new generation of anti-ballistic missile and anti-satellite weaponry, and a new field of military rivalry in outer space, are coming within the range of the possible. We are faced, therefore, with major potential instability both in relation to existing military forces and to future possibilities. It is vital that dialogue between the super powers on all of these matters should be resumed at the earliest possible moment.  In this connection let me say <Col N="658" /> that I trust that the opening signalled in his speech in this Chamber by President Reagan, aimed at making progress in the Conference on Disarmament in Europe at Stockholm, will evoke a positive response on the part of the Soviet Union and its allies.  During our Presidency of European Political Co-operation, we shall do our utmost to help bring to bear the influence of the Ten to this end.</P>
    <P>It should not be necessary for me, on each occasion on which I speak about Irish foreign policy, to reiterate the Government's commitment to Irish neutrality: that commitment is set out in the Programme for Government adopted in December 1982 and has been repeated on numerous occasions by me and other members of the Government.  However, one continually hears suggestions that our membership of the European Community is eroding our neutrality, that in some way we are going to be duped or forced against our will into a military alliance, because of our association with countries who are themselves already members of an alliance.  Let me say plainly that this is a myth.</P>
    <P>It is equally unreal, if not indeed deliberately disingenuous, to insinuate that efforts are under way aimed at transforming the European Community and the Ten into an alliance.  On the contrary, the very fact that some of the European members of the NATO alliance, who are also members of the Community, are engaged in efforts to revitalise the Western European Union (WEU), a seven-member military alliance closely linked with NATO, is precisely because of the clear limitations and constraints on security and defence co-operation within the Ten and the Community.  Not only are binding defence commitments, which are the essence of an alliance, specifically excluded from the Community and European Political Co-operation, but so also is even the discussion of operational defence questions appropriate to an alliance. No change can be made in this state of affairs without the unanimous agreement of all Ten member states.  That consent will not be forthcoming from the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>There are two regional conflicts of particular <Col N="659" /> intensity in the world, on which I foresee that our attention and that of our partners in European Political Co-operation will be focused during the coming months: I refer to the Middle East and Central America.  The basic problem of achieving self-determination for the Palestinian people, as well as recognition and security for Israel within her own borders, remains unresolved.  I hope that it will not be too long before there is a practical recognition by all interested parties that true peace will never come to that area of the world until these problems are dealt with.  On a national basis, our practical commitment to peace and stability in the area is most clearly expressed through the continued involvement of our Army with the United Nations Force in Lebanon.  I hope that the Lebanese people will in the near future find it possible finally to reconcile their internal differences, and, free from the pressure of external forces, rebuild with renewed energy their shattered country.</P>
    <P>The conflict of most immediate concern in the Middle East is the war between Iran and Iraq, which has lasted now for almost four years, with enormous loss of life and destruction of economic resources.  The ten Community countries have on a number of occasions called for a ceasefire, withdrawal to internationally recognised frontiers and a negotiated settlement, but these and other appeals of the international community have so far been without effect. Recent attacks on oil tankers in the Persian Gulf have given rise to fears of a possible widening of this terrible conflict. I hope that it is not too fanciful, on the other hand, to see in the recent agreement by the two belligerents to cease attacks on civilian targets in each other's territory the beginnings of a recognition on both sides that this war can do nothing for either the Iranian or the Iraqi people but increase their misery.  The Government have been glad, these past few days, to respond to the UN Secretary General's request for military observers to monitor the implementation of the new agreement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="660" /> The Taoiseach and his nine colleagues at the European Council in Stuttgart in June 1983 expressed their conviction &ldquo;that the problems of Central America cannot be solved by military means but only by a political solution springing from the region itself and respecting the principles of non-interference and inviolability of frontiers&rdquo;.  That quotation expresses well the essence of the Irish Government's attitude to the continuing conflict in that region.  The basic cause of the conflict is the abuse of human rights and economic and social injustice by forces indigenous to the region; the solution is therefore one of social and economic reform to be brought about also by indigenous forces.  Any attempted solution which relies primarily on military force can only worsen the situation: what is needed, above all else, is a strengthening of all those Central Americans who are prepared to work for a significant improvement in the conditions of life of their people.  Only through social and economic reforms brought about by patriotic and compassionate men and women acting in their own countries and for their own countrymen, can an end be brought to the conflicts which have for so long caused so much suffering in Central America.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that the recent elections in El Salvador and the forthcoming elections in Nicaragua will both, in their different ways, contribute to political progress. Deputies may be aware that President Monge of Costa Rica has recently issued an invitation on behalf of his country and the other nations of Central America to the ten Foreign Ministers of the European Community to meet them in Costa Rica in the autumn to discuss ways and means of strengthening the economic and political links between Europe and Central America.  The Ministers of the Ten have gladly accepted this invitation, and I look forward to the meeting as a particular opportunity for the Ten to re-affirm their commitment to the peaceful development of Central America.  It is my hope that the Foreign Ministers of the Contadora countries will also be present at the meeting as Ireland, and indeed other members of the Ten, <Col N="661" /> have for some time seen the sustained efforts of the Contadora group to promote peaceful evolution in the region as a particular cause for hope.</P>
    <P>Another essential element of global stability and peace is the maintenance of a relationship of mutual confidence between developed and developing countries based on a recognition of shared interests as well as considerations of international equity and fair play.</P>
    <P>The recent strong indications of economic recovery throughout the industrialised world give grounds for hope that Third World countries will now also begin to free themselves from the effects of the recession.  On the other hand, the problem of debt in these countries will remain critical for several years more.  In some regions, notably Latin America, the problem of debt has assumed very worrying proportions, with the crushing burden of debt servicing made unbearable by the strength of the dollar and continually rising interest rates.  The recent London Economic Summit has also acknowledged the seriousness of these problems by setting out a strategy to deal with debt.  Indeed more than half of its communique has been devoted to North-South issues, with economic interdependence as the central theme.  While I welcome the recognition at the Summit of the economic interdependence not only of countries, both developed and developing, but also of problems and issues, much more remains to be done if the world economic recovery is to be safeguarded and maintained.</P>
    <P>On 1 July Ireland assumes, for the third time, the Presidency of the Council of Ministers of the European Communities. During our six months in office it is our intention to exert the maximum endeavour to ensure the effective and smooth functioning of Community business.  A Presidency is generally judged on its ability to get things done, and we approach our third term with some confidence in that our record in 1975 and 1979 is good. These Presidencies were considered within the Community to have been well run and successful and could also have been said to have won respect and goodwill for Ireland as a responsible and committed <Col N="662" /> member of the Community.  In the effort which we propose to make on this occasion we hope to build upon that goodwill.</P>
    <P>While our approach to the forthcoming Presidency will, in large part, be based on our past experiences there will be responsibilities and tasks devolving upon the Presidency this time which have not been encountered in Ireland's previous Presidencies.  These responsibilities and tasks will be of considerable importance.</P>
    <P>We are taking over the Presidency at a time both of great challenge and of great opportunity for Europe.  After twelve months of difficult &mdash; indeed agonisingly difficult &mdash; negotiations, the Community achieved a decisive breakthrough this afternoon.  The Taoiseach will be reporting in detail on the substance of the European Council later in the week.  It is sufficient for me, therefore, to state today that in my view this historic breakthrough opens the way to what the Stuttgart declaration called 12 months ago the relaunching of Europe.  The Community is on the move again.  Our task as the incoming Presidency will be, over the coming six months, to build on today's agreement and, where necessary, to give it the appropriate legal form.  We must, at the same time, take advantage of the Fontainebleau agreement to move the Community into a higher, more relevant and more responsible gear.  The Community must once again become the motor of dynamic charge and development in Europe, especially in areas of primary economic and social priorities for our peoples.</P>
    <P>The Council also reiterated that 30 September next should be the target date for the conclusion of negotiation on the accession of Spain and Portugal to the Community.  We, as the incoming Presidency, fully accept that aim and are, at present, putting together a timetable of work to meet the deadline.  We do not underestimate the difficulties.  However, the conclusions of these negotiations during the Irish Presidency is one of the major goals we have set ourselves.  It will be no fault of ours if this is not achieved. We have, of course, our own difficulties in relation to enlargement particularly in <Col N="663" /> the fisheries sector.  During our Presidency our duty is to look to the interests of the Community as a whole, those Ministers and officials who will be representing Ireland as a national delegation will ensure that Irish interests are properly served over the coming six months.</P>
    <P>In the various preparatory meetings we have held to establish our objectives and priorities for the Presidency, we have impressed upon our partners the importance we attach to the Community responding effectively to the appalling problem of unemployment.  The Taoiseach and my colleagues in Government have made clear our view that it is time for the Community to realise its potential in terms of its economic strength and for member states to act in a more coherent fashion in facing the unemployment situation in Europe.  If the largest trading block in the world fails to demonstrate, through concerted action, its concern to tackle unemployment, there will be many who will question the relevance of its existence.  The European Economic Community set itself many laudable aims in the Treaty.  It must move to fulfil them.</P>
    <P>For this reason we will be putting the view to the other member states and the Commission that a review of economic policies may be necessary in order to assess their appropriateness in the context of the employment situation in the Community.  A better co-ordination of the economic policies of the member states could increase the margin of manoeuvre of the Community as a whole.  We, as Presidency, hope to explore with the Commission methods of harnessing more effectively the collective strengths of the individual economies in order to strengthen growth and employment.  We will be pursuing progress with the utmost vigour on all the proposals put to the Council by the Commission which have a bearing on the employment situation.</P>
    <P>With a view to finalising our work programme, I shall be discussing the objectives of our Presidency in detail with the Commission early next month.</P>
    <P>As regards the development of new Community policies &mdash; an area to which successive European Councils have given <Col N="664" /> the highest priority &mdash; we will be actively seeking to ensure that the existing momentum is not alone maintained but is considerably accelerated.  The areas in question &mdash; including telecommunication, bio-technology, data processing, the internal market, energy and the environment &mdash; are central to the Community's development as a cohesive economic force.  Concrete action is long overdue at the European level in all these areas.</P>
    <P>In the agricultural area, the major issues which will arise over the coming six months include the question of a new regime for agricultural structures, the surplus situation in the wine market and new measures under the olive oil regime. In this context, however, I believe it would be appropriate to refer briefly to the very fundamental and highly sensitive negotiations on the super-levy which took place earlier this year.  At the conclusion of those negotiations, as Deputies are aware, we had secured a basic entitlement of our 1983 level of deliveries plus 4.6 per cent, with a guarantee that this quantity could not be reduced.  Moreover, we were given priority in the division of any quantities which become available in future years.</P>
    <P>In accepting this final compromise, we were conscious of how far we had advanced from the original Commission proposal which would have resulted in a cutback of over 13 per cent on our 1983 level and prevented all possibility of improvement in the future.  We are also acutely aware of the impossibility of getting further concessions from our partners, most of whom were themselves having to settle for substantial cutbacks in production.  The strong reaction to these cutbacks in a number of our partner countries have recently been seen almost on a daily basis.  In these circumstances, I believe that any objective and fair analysis would accept that a settlement which gives us the right to expand this year at a rate similar to our average over the past decade, and which holds out the possibility of further increases in the future, was a very major achievement indeed.  May I say also that I am grateful to our partners for the understanding of, <Col N="665" /> and solidarity with, our case which they showed during our negotiations.</P>
    <P>Good relations with the newly-elected European Parliament will be of immense value in our conduct of the Presidency. Most recently we have witnessed an exercise in collective democracy in Europe, unique in the world, and while there may be some disappointment about the numbers participating in that exercise, the other institutions of the Community must take account of the views of those directly chosen by the people of Europe to represent them.  The Taoiseach will be speaking to the Parliament on 25 July when he will also report, in his capacity as President-in-Office of the European Council, on the Fontainebleau Summit.  The following day my colleague will have the honour of speaking to the Parliament on the Presidency work programme. All my colleagues who will be presiding over the Council are aware of the role of the Parliament.  They are prepared to devote all the time and effort necessary for ensuring a harmonious and fruitful relationship between all the institutions. In this regard, we look forward to the fullest discussion and consideration at Community level of the recent proposals of the European Parliament for fundamental institutional change in the Community.  This is a most important initiative.</P>
    <P>We shall be paying close attention, during the Presidency, to the Community's relations with our major trading partners.  We, in Ireland, with our small open economy and dependence on trade, are acutely aware of the necessity of avoiding the traps of protectionism and &ldquo;beggar-my-neighbour&rdquo; policies.  The Taoiseach assured the President of the United States, during his recent visit here, of our intention to give priority to the resolution of problems between the Community and the US.  The close relations and open channels of communication we enjoy with the US will be at the disposal of the Community during our term of office.</P>
    <P>The co-operation which the European Community maintains with developing countries constitutes an essential aspect of its external relations.  An important <Col N="666" /> task which is likely to fall to us during the Presidency will be to bring the negotiations for the next ACP-EEC Convention, which provides a contractual framework for the Community's links with 64 African, Caribbean and Pacific States, to a successful conclusion.  It is now almost ten years since the first Lomé convention was signed under the first Irish Presidency. In that time the economic recession has had a very serious effect on the economies of the developing countries, particularly the least developed among them.  These countries have witnessed a major deterioration in their terms of trade as a result of falling commodity prices and rising interest rates which in turn has seen the emergence of a scale of indebtedness among developing countries to whose alarming proportions I have already referred.  In such drastic circumstances, the wealthier nations of the world have a responsibility to provide what assistance they can to encourage developing countries to strive towards more realistic development goals.  That is what the Community is attempting to do in the context of the next ACP-EEC Convention. Both sides in the negotiations can agree that the aim of the convention should be on self-reliant, self-sufficient development, notably in the agricultural sector, where the emphasis has been placed on the need to achieve self-sufficiency in food.  The Convention, however, covers a broad range of measures in the areas of trade, industry, mining and energy and financial and technical co-operation.</P>
    <P>Ireland has had the honour of presiding over the signing ceremonies for the two Lomé Conventions and we shall strive hard to ensure that the negotiations are completed to allow the Convention to be formally signed before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>We look forward also to the UNIDO Conference in August, which will deal especially with the problems of industrialisation in developing countries.  We are also actively involved both nationally and as incoming President of the EEC in efforts to improve and streamline the functioning of UNCTAD, an exercise <Col N="667" /> likely to extend itself to other multinational organisations.</P>
    <P>In summary, the forthcoming Presidency is an invaluable opportunity to advance the development of the Community and to create an enhanced image for Ireland in Europe but also, and as importantly, to restore in Ireland a proper perception of the Community as an integral part of our future as a nation. The forthcoming Presidency will be a difficult job and as challenging a task as we faced since joining the Community.  But the potential for benefit and for respect and regard redounding to this country is considerable.</P>
    <P>Let me turn now from the outside world to the task of bringing peace and stability to our own island.  The primary focus of the Government's efforts on the Northern Ireland problem since I last introduced the Estimates of this Department has, of course, been on the work of the New Ireland Forum.  I would now like to pay tribute to all of those who contributed to the deliberations of that remarkable enterprise; to the Taoiseach and the other party leaders, to the delegations of the SDLP, Fianna Fáil, the Labour Party and my own colleagues in Fine Gael; to all of those who made submissions to the Forum and in particular to those brave and concerned people of the Unionist tradition who did so at risk to themselves but without whose contribution our work would have been immeasurably poorer; to the Secretariat of the Forum who performed an extraordinary service in monitoring our complex discussions and who contributed creatively in bringing the whole process forward from the blank page with which we started to the final product.</P>
    <P>For myself I would like to say that it was one of the most important experiences of my career to take part in the Forum.  I am glad that a process which was treated by outsiders and even by parts of our own public opinion with a degree of contempt when it began has led to a situation where the Forum Report has been publicised more widely and taken more seriously around the world <Col N="668" /> than any Irish public initiative in living memory.</P>
    <P>Following the publication of the Report, the Government, having decided that the findings and conclusions of the Report were in accordance with our policy, brought the report in all its aspects to the attention of the British Government. We have made it clear that we wish, in accordance with the findings of the report itself, to discuss the views outlined in the report and any other views which may contribute to political development with all others involved in the problem of Northern Ireland who oppose the use of violence.</P>
    <P>We have discussed the report with the governments of the other member states of the Community, the US Government and the governments of other countries with which Ireland has diplomatic relations.</P>
    <P>The Forum has identified eleven major realities in its analysis and the Forum has proposed ten requirements as necessary elements of a framework within which a New Ireland could emerge.  The Forum has invited the British Government to join in a process that will recognise these realities and give effect to these requirements and thus promote reconciliation between the two major traditions in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Government will play their part in such a process and will work to ensure that the objectives of the Forum are, as far as possible, realised.</P>
    <P>The British Government have given a very preliminary reaction in which they have welcomed some of the key elements of the report.  We expect a more considered British reaction in the debate which will take place on the report in the House of Commons early next month.</P>
    <P>The Official Unionist Party in Northern Ireland have published a policy document called &ldquo;The Way Forward&rdquo;. This document, while in no sense a formal response to the Forum report &mdash; indeed it was published before the Forum report itself &mdash; indicates that there is within that party a new and positive process of reflection on the problem of Northern Ireland.  In particular, I welcome the acknowledgment by the Official <Col N="669" /> Unionist Party that the conflict of Northern Ireland &ldquo;lies in the ultimate political aspirations of the two communities, in their sense of national and political identity and the allegiance that goes with it&rdquo;.  It is also encouraging that the Unionists recognise that it is necessary that there be, by the two sections of the community in Northern Ireland, &ldquo;a mutual recognition of each other's hopes and fears&rdquo;.  The party states that its objective is &ldquo;to find a level at which consensus may be obtained to effect a beginning in the reconciliation of the divided community&rdquo;. The document also calls for a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland and goes some distance in acknowledging the Irish national identity of the minority community in Northern Ireland in a number of ways and specifically in accepting the legitimacy of &ldquo;fostering distinctively Irish cultural activities&rdquo; through State funding.  Now, the specific proposals of the Unionists strike me as being inadequate, but we must welcome the fact that in their analysis of the problem itself their approach has much in common with the realities and the requirements of the situation as defined by the Forum.  We must also welcome the fact that in their call for reconciliation and for machinery to protect human rights and to foster Irish cultural activities, they have given evidence of very positive thinking.  I believe it is the duty of all of us on the nationalist side to build on the common ground which, for the first time for many years, now appears to be emerging.</P>
    <P>The immediate problem that has most preoccupied us in recent months has, of course, been the issue of alienation among the nationalists of Northern Ireland.  The Forum report has described the origins of alienation eloquently and in appropriately urgent terms.  The first of the major realities identified by the Forum is that &ldquo;the failure to recognise and accommodate the identity of Northern nationalists has resulted in deep and growing alienation.</P>
    <P>The co-operation which the European authority&rdquo;.  The Report of the New Ireland Forum and the commitment of this Government to pursuing with the <Col N="670" /> British Government each and every one of the major grievances of the nationalist community in Northern Ireland has helped to begin the process of restoring hope to nationalists in Northern Ireland. In the forefront of these efforts have stood the SDLP.  The first evidence of the fact that all these efforts are worth making is the remarkable degree of support given to constitutional nationalism in the recent European Parliament Election in Northern Ireland.  As nationalist politicians living in the relative security of our own sovereign State, we can only admire and applaud the resilience of a community which, although devoid of an effective say in their own government, deprived of any institutional expression of their identity and living in a situation of political, social and economic depression, have yet again rallied to the banner of hope and democracy.  No one can be complacent about this dangerous problem: it is essential that no one here should, for party political reasons, play games with this problem by, for example, giving legitimacy to the extremists, a legitimacy denied to them by the nationalist people of the North.  We must not betray democracy. We must not betray the constitutional democratic nationalists of the North.  Much less can the British Government be complacent about the revival of commitment to constitutional nationalism, a revival to which they have so far contributed very little indeed.  We, all of us in this State and in Britain, owe a huge debt to the nationalist people of Northern Ireland.  Our commitment to them must have priority over the selfish, political or ideological interests of any of us as individuals, as political parties or as governments. Our commitment must be that the nightmare of that people and of the entire community of Northern Ireland will end. The process of bringing real peace and stability into the lives of all the people of Northern Ireland must now begin.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to refer again briefly to Development Co-operation, an area for which I myself have special responsibility.  As I have just said, the wealthier nations of the world &mdash; and Ireland is numbered among them, despite our many pressing economic difficulties <Col N="671" />&mdash; have a responsibility to aid poorer countries.  Subheads B to H of the Vote for International Co-operation of my Department, which we are discussing here today, provide some of the funds for our programme of official development assistance.  I am happy to be able to say that our ODA programme has grown from £1.5 million in 1974 to over £30 million this year, and includes moneys paid from the Central Fund and other Votes, principally the Vote for Agriculture. Our ODA has risen as a percentage of GNP from .05 per cent in 1973 to over .23 per cent in 1984.</P>
    <P>Subheads B to H of the Vote for International Co-operation deal with our contributions to the European Development Fund, the funding mechanism for the ACP-EEC Convention, contributions to UN voluntary agencies and our programme of bilateral assistance to developing countries.  They total £16,908,000.</P>
    <P>The programme of direct bilateral assistance to the developing countries is ten years old this year, and has grown over that period to form over one-third of our total official development assistance or £11,693,000.  This aid is provided through two main channels: the bilateral aid programme administered by my Department, and the sponsorship of Irish personnel on development projects in the poorer countries through the Agency for Personal Service Overseas (APSO).</P>
    <P>Through our bilateral aid programme, which in 1984 will have at its disposal funds amounting to £9.437 million, an increase of 12 per cent over the allocation for 1983, we are able to utilise Irish skills and human resources, as well as finance, to assist a number of extremely poor countries who are critically lacking in resources of all kinds.  In Lesotho, Tanzania and the Sudan, all classified internationally as &ldquo;least-developed&rdquo; countries, severely disadvantaged in many respects (Lesotho, for example, is a land-locked country subject to economic and political intimidation by neighbouring South Africa) our programme has brought top-flight Irish engineers, architects, agriculturalists, co-operative specialists, farm managers, nutritionists, <Col N="672" /> para-medical personnel, accountants, university and polytechnic lecturers, economists and industrial specialists to help with projects for which Ireland also supplied the essential, though normally small-scale, capital inputs.  A number of these projects have now been in operation for a few years and it is possible to see the signs of real achievement.  It often takes several years before one can state with any degree of certainty whether a project is successful or not, and this may depend on many factors, not all of which are within our control.  But it is possible, I think, to state that our bilateral projects have been remarkably successful, on the whole, in their initial establishment and in their management to date, and this is largely due to the skill and dedication of our project personnel.</P>
    <P>Our bilateral aid programme also assists a number of other countries; Zambia (which is also one of our &ldquo;priority&rdquo; countries) and Zimbabwe, where we are assisting mainly in dairy development and higher education.  But Irish skills and experience are relevant in many countries, some of which are not well-known here at home, such as Rwanda and Burundi, both small, extremely poor countries, which we are assisting in the development of peat and biomass resources utilising the expertise of Bord na Móna.  In addition, through a special scheme of co-financing of projects with voluntary agencies such as Concern, Gorta or the missionary bodies, our programme also funds a large number of small village-level projects.  In 1983 we were able to assist 138 such projects in 28 different countries.  This year the amount available for co-financing is being increased substantially.</P>
    <P>It is important that the public here at home know what is being done in our programme and also get a better appreciation of the problems or underdevelopment and the reasons for our concern. For this reason, we have endeavoured to give greater emphasis to the flow of information on our aid programme and also to encourage development education programmes in conjunction with non-governmental organisations and with educational organisations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="673" /> The Agency for Personal Services Overseas (APSO) also celebrate ten years of existence this year.  In those ten years the annual grant-in-aid to the agency has risen from £75,000 to £1.8 million, which in 1984 will enable APSO to sponsor the assignments of over 400 volunteer, semi-professional and professional Irish personnel in the poor countries. The normal length of these assignments is two years, and the personnel sponsored include a large proportion of nurses and teachers but also a wide range of other professions and skills.</P>
    <P>While our objective in this policy area has always been to assist the poorer countries of the world in meeting disparate needs, the expansion of our programme, especially in the bilateral sector, has brought significant incidental beneficial side-effects to our own economy.  It is not a mere coincidence that the growth of our bilateral assistance has been paralleled by a substantial expansion in earnings from the provision of Irish expert services to developing countries.  An example of this was provided recently in the annual report of DEVCO (the state-agencies umbrella organisation) which stated that in 1983 the member agencies of DEVCO had earned approximately £45 million for services to developing countries and it was estimated that nearly 800 jobs in this country were sustained by these activities.</P>
    <P>The interface between our development co-operation programme, the needs of the developing countries in various sectors and our capacity to respond in various sectors &mdash; particularly health, agriculture and education &mdash; is the subject of study and discussion by the Advisory Council on Development Co-operation. The recommendations of the council emerging from these studies will be a useful aid in the determination of priorities in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimate introduced by the Minister can be broken down into four categories, the first dealing with international affairs, the second with the EEC, the third with the North and the fourth with development co-operation.  I propose to follow that format.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="674" /> Regarding international affairs, our stance as a country has been consistent over the years.  As a small country we can act in a positive way in terms of being an advocate, within the United Nations and associated agencies, for disarmament in its multifarious processes.  I will not go into detail on the various moves which have been made to secure disarmament, ranging from the limited reduction of nuclear missiles to the principles of total disarmament.  We have been consistent in seeking ways and means forward, whether through political and security co-operation in Europe or within the UN and its agencies.</P>
    <P>That is as it should be for a country like ours, with a place in international fora, to take precisely that stance.  It is a stance that cannot be taken easily by the super and other big powers, with their commitments, who may feel inhibited from time to time from giving effect to what their peoples would like in many cases, that is effective proposals toward a reduction of the various range of intermediate and strategic nuclear weapons and a reduction in armaments generally. In that whole area the major powers are circumscribed by their very power, of their very nature, from dealing with a problem.  Therefore it does lie with countries like ours that are too small to be in this business and yet at the same time carry a moral conviction, standing and status to come forward with positive and constructive proposals in these areas wherever we may be operating, within the United Nations, at the various security conferences organised in Europe to reduce East-West tensions and indeed, in the context of European political co-operation, within the EEC itself.</P>
    <P>That policy is consistent with our policy of positive neutrality which I would regard as a basic Finna Fáil policy and which I hope has now received general acceptance within our community here. I hope that the Government agree with us on the aspect of not just being neutral in a negative but in a positive sense, that when we say we are a neutral country we do not mean we are a disinterested country; we mean that we are practising neutrality as a positive policy and at the same <Col N="675" /> time recognising the problems of the bigger powers, demonstrating that we are willing to make our case in the various fora available to us.  We must emphasise the need at all times to maintain dialogue, to seek to achieve a reduction in the various missiles production and deployment and generally moving, however slowly, toward general disarmament on a multi-lateral basis.</P>
    <P>I am glad that President Reagan chose this forum to take a positive initiative in regard to the disarmament conference at present taking place in Stockholm.  We were honoured &mdash; and I do not think this received sufficient publicity at home &mdash; that he chose this forum to make a responsible, constructive declaration of positive American action in this respect.</P>
    <P>The other way in which we have made our neutrality a positive merit in regard to international affairs, within the ambit of the United Nations, has been that of the provision of peacekeeping personnel in various theatres of war, near war and troubled spots throughout the world.  I was rather surprised that the Minister did not make any great reference to this area of the peacekeeping aspect of our forces in his remarks.  I am sure he will deal with it when replying.  This has been a very positive response on the part of a small country like ours, one that does not have the offensive material and muscle.  This means that we can perform a role, in conjunction with other peacekeeping countries, and have done so in places like the Lebanon, Cyprus, Zaire, when it was the Congo, and so on.  Our role of aiding a peacekeeping operation, monitoring steps toward the achievement of peace, involving ourselves in the independent application of our personnel in areas where those of other countries may for one reason or another be suspect, is an area where a positive contribution can be made by us.  Indeed I would regard it as an example of positive neutrality.</P>
    <P>During my term in office as Minister for Foreign Affairs I always found there was no pressure exerted on us to abandon this policy of positive neutrality.  I want to emphasise that point.  Within the EEC, within the United Nations and the various <Col N="676" /> other security fora throughout the world in which we participate, a country like ours, with a policy of positive neutrality clearly understood by other countries, is a welcome addition to the councils of such fora.  I say this because usually they need a country to act as an honest broker, or to participate in peacekeeping developments such as those I have mentioned, when our role is welcomed. Certainly I found no pressure being exerted on us, nor was there any need to give in to any pressure in this respect.  Our role is a respected one, well established over the years, and there is no reason we should depart one iota from it.  That is why I foresaw some dangers in certain aspects or developments of European political co-operation, such as that moving toward a military involvement or entanglement.  I do agree with the Minister when he states that the reactivation of the Western European Union represents, if you like, a way out for the larger powers to organise their purely defensive and military matters through that agency while countries such as Greece, Denmark and ourselves &mdash; who do not particularly feel very strongly, and which are small countries in that whole area &mdash; are left, if you like, disengaged from that situation.  If European political co-operation develops along those lines that, in itself, will be a good development.</P>
    <P>Our role of positive neutrality can be of positive advantage, of positive good, to the free world and the world at large in acting as an honest broker in international and diplomatic affairs in the fora I have mentioned and also by our participation in various peacekeeping operations.</P>
    <P>The most serious problem of the world at large remains the whole Middle East and Iran-Iraq area.  It is remarkable how little attention that war &mdash; here I refer to the Iran-Iraq one &mdash; is receiving at present in the press of the western world.  It is a very serious, bitter war, involving a large number of people in a key area of the world which, if anarchy sets in, undoubtedly and immediately affects the whole of the western world.  It is a very serious reflection on all of us in the western <Col N="677" /> world, if you like in that part of the North Atlantic world &mdash; so dependent on oil as a basic energy material &mdash; that nothing of a positive kind in the way of a real practical, diplomatic initiative has emerged to deal either with the Iran-Iraq situation or with the general Middle East one.  It is one troublesome, serious area which in the morning could trigger off a serious world situation.  At the same time there appears to be a general atmosphere of political complacency in the diplomatic sense, in regard to paying attention to that area and the sense of urgency appears to have departed from the attitude towards it.  The Community itself and the western world generally, unless they want to wake up one day and find a very serious crisis on their hands, should move into this area in some positive and meaningful manner.  Irrational forces have been allowed to break loose and very little preparation appears to be made to deal with these irrational forces and in some way try to control a situation that could get out of hand.  The whole Arab-Moslem problem, stretching as it does across one-third of the globe from Tangier to Indonesia, is a powder keg of potential trouble in the world at present and the basic resource of oil is in greatest supply there and easily obtained.  The combination of oil, nationalism, religion and tribal and national differences, the whole mix that exists in that area of the world, is very serious and the nations of the western world, who are dependent to a large degree for their prosperity on stability in that part of the world, are paying less than enough attention to it.</P>
    <P>As regards the EEC, some progress has been made, according to the Minister's brief, towards a solution of the British budgetary problem.  I take it that that is primarily what he is referring to although he does not mention it specifically. Again I am disappointed at an omission.  The British budgetary problem is one that Britain has been fighting out herself to the detriment of and causing very serious damage to the Community. I am not going into the rights or wrongs of her case <i>vis-à-vis</i> her other Community partners.  That has been debated sufficiently. However, one very serious matter <Col N="678" /> which has not been referred to in the Minister's speech is the vital question of Community financing.  This is far more important than whether Britain gets or does not get £X rebate.  My only hope is that, once this problem is out of the way, following on that will be a British willingness to withdraw opposition to the limitation on own resources &mdash; I hope the Minister in his reply will give some indication about this &mdash; the 1 per cent ceiling that is circumscribing completely Community expenditure.  The British up to now have concentrated on their budgetary rebate.  I hope that the solution of that will open the way towards raising the own resources revenue to a reasonable level as far as the Community is concerned. Not just the British have been in favour of the 1 per cent level.  The Germans also have adopted a conservative, ultra-banking attitude towards this 1 per cent limitation, as have the Dutch to some degree.  If the British are satisfied for the time being &mdash; we can never be certain that they are fully satisfied &mdash; and if that chapter is closed, I hope that the energies of this Government and of all peoples within the Community who are concerned about the prospects and the future of the Community will now be directed towards raising the own resources limit to a reasonable target.  It should be doubled from 1 per cent to 2 per cent &mdash; and that is very conservative &mdash; if we are to have any reasonable transfer of resources through the Social and Regional Funds that will help to build up the less favoured regions of the Community. There must be a rise to at least 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely Alice in Wonderland language to talk about the accession of Portugal and Spain without talking about an increase in own resources.  The Minister referred to the accession of Portugal and Spain in the current year.  That may be on, and I am not going to say anything against their accession, but the Community cannot work within a 1 per cent revenue ceiling with Spain and Portugal in.  The whole apparatus of the institutions of the Community will break down. At its minimum, with Spain and Portugal coming in the ceiling must be raised.  Furthermore, <Col N="679" /> if the aspirations and objectives of the less favoured regions of the Community are to be met to any legitimate degree there must be an increase. I suggest that we should here and now declare ourselves in favour of at least doubling the own resources mechanism for the raising of finance for the purpose of (a) dealing with Spain and Portugal and (b) more important as far as we are concerned, financing a real Social Fund and a real Regional Fund that will in effect allow for a positive and definite transfer of moneys to us and to other countries like us who have an unanswerable case.</P>
    <P>One of the founding principles of the EEC is that there should be a transfer of resources to less favoured regions of the Community.  We have an unanswerable case on the merits, not because we are Ireland looking for a transfer of moneys but because we have an unanswerable case on the facts regarding our GNP, for such a transfer of resources for infrastructural purposes through the Social and Regional Funds or through other outlets such as European Investment Bank credits at subsidised interest rates.  I offer that to the Minister and I would like to hear his reply on it.  I am disappointed that no reference was made to either of those two basic funds in the Minister's speech on the EEC aspects, and also that no reference was made to the financial aspects both in regard to raising the own resources ceiling and the financing and means of financing once you increase the own resources ceiling.  One of the main purposes of the Community is to have equalisation of prosperity throughout all regions of the Community and this implies a real transfer of resources through the mechanisms that are there and are not properly financed and cannot be properly financed as long as the 1 per cent ceiling is maintained.  I would like the Minister to refer in his reply to the aspect of increasing transfer expenditure to countries like Ireland and the raising of the ceiling to ensure that that is done.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise also in that context that there is no point in talking about phraseology like, &ldquo;The Community <Col N="680" /> is on the move again&rdquo;.  That is all right for rhetorical purposes, but we must get down to the nitty-gritty of how we get the Community on the move again and the only nitty-gritty involved in that is to raise the money for expenditure and to ensure a transfer of a greater share of that expenditure through the financial mechanisms that exist for the benefit of countries such as ours.  That makes commonsense. In regard to unemployment, I share the Minister's concern that this is one area which, because of the lack of available resources, the Community has not tackled.  It is a problem which again can be tackled only by way of some of the financial mechanisms such as the Social and Regional Funds and the European Investment Bank.</P>
    <P>The unemployment problem requires a great deal of research and development and much greater investigation into the question of the sort of industries that should be established.  There must be a higher level of funding for the various financial mechanisms provided the Community is satisfied as to the importance of the projects involved.  There has not been sufficient investigation at Community level of the unemployment problem. Many stop-gap measures have been taken in regard to safeguarding existing employment or to propping up existing situations but there has been no real expenditure on research and development as to the type of industries that will be suitable for the future and the ones in which the brains and the talents of our young people can be utilised.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to ensure that Europe as a whole keeps pace reasonably with Japan and the US who are the forerunners in the computer and electronic fields but Europe has fallen behind both these countries in this field.  If it had not been for the farsightedness of the IDA who in advance of their time secured such industries for this country, based on Japanese and American back-up and knowledge, we would not have the level of industry that we have and which is surviving well in this area.  The IDA acted outside the Community as such but using our membership to have the industries located here.  The Community has done <Col N="681" /> very little for its members in this respect. To some extent we have benefitted from that situation but that was because of the IDA having the wisdom to go outside the Community, to go to the sources of research and development in the electronics and computer fields.</P>
    <P>Because of the self-imposed financial limitations and the situation brought about by the British budgetary row, the Community has not had the necessary finance to engage in the further research and development required within Europe if Europe as a whole is not to lag totally behind the US and Japan.  Perhaps the Community has done us a service in enabling us to deal directly with these two countries.  In other words, it is an ill wind that does not blow somebody some good.  This country can be very proud to be at least level with, if not ahead of, other European countries in the area of electronics and computers in so far as the sophistication of our industrial manufacturing plants is concerned.  We must maintain our position because technology in those areas changes rapidly.</P>
    <P>The third area to which the Minister referred was Northern Ireland and rightly, he referred to the success of the New Ireland Forum.  The forum report got a tremendous reception outside the country.  That is something that may not be realised here.  The main purpose of the forum was to ensure that we presented a consensus view of the Nationalist parties, both North and South, that would be responsible, constructive and couched in such terms as to be accepted in that light.  It has been accepted across the board outside Ireland.  It is important that that stance is maintained.  The main thrust of the whole forum development is to ensure an environment of political thought and action which would induce the British Government particularly and other responsible authorities also to arrive, by way of discussion, at a conference situation.  That is written into the final report.  There is no point in having this excellent document as a monument to people such as myself who were involved in drafting it unless it is followed through.  Consequently, what is needed now is some action arising from the <Col N="682" /> report.  It is of tremendous importance that every diplomatic skill available to the Government is adopted and utilised to ensure that we arrive at a conference situation in which all interested parties start talking.  That is the only outcome that will be satisfactory and meaningful.</P>
    <P>Nationalist Ireland has spoken through the medium of that report in a rational and constructive manner.  The next step must be that the country which carries the major share of the responsibility for the Northern Ireland situation takes an initiative with other countries or in some other way and with parties and bodies in Northern Ireland and in this part of the island.  The aim must be that however we devise it or structure it we finish up with a conference in which there will be meaningful discussions and negotiations. Unless that is achieved, the report will remain merely an interesting document and a very helpful one but nothing more. I hope the Minister will refer to this aspect in his reply and give us some indication as to the efforts being made to induce progress along the lines I have mentioned and towards an eventual conference. Such a conference will have to take place if we are to work out some sort of way forward in this highly intractable problem which has bedevilled life on this island and also relations between us and the neighbouring island for so many centuries.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred also to the question of development co-operation.  I was very glad to hear of the progress made in this area.  One aspect which was highlighted in the remarks made in relation to DEVCO, the organisation of the State-sponsored bodies, is that the number of practical projects and the level of practical involvement that follows on the various multi-lateral and bi-lateral programmes involved is tremendously important, that this is an area which is not merely right and good in itself but which also has a very practical connotation.</P>
    <P>There is nothing more sensible for a small country to engage in than that kind of development.  We are doing the right thing and following the tradition of helping the less-developed regions.  Practical <Col N="683" /> benefits flow to this country from that, particularly in relation to the employment of technical and professional people.  The Minister mentioned various professions including engineers, architects, agriculturalists, co-operative specialists, farm managers, para-medical personnel, accountants, university and poly-technic lecturers, industrial specialists, economists and so on.  From that list we can see the spin-off benefit that accrues.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been in various parts of Africa.  I have also seen the work done on the ground there.  Having the right professional people on the ground is far better than all the grants and loans in the world.  We all know money is needed but in such countries one cannot buy good personnel.  It is tremendously important to have good personnel who will give more than the call of duty demands.  A small country whose training and education is well advanced as is ours can give of its best and bring practical expertise and professional help to less well-off areas.</P>
    <P>The DEVCO report stated that their member agencies earned approximately £45 million in 1983.  It was estimated that nearly 500 jobs in this country were sustained by their activities.  That is a worthwhile development.  We cannot afford to give the kind of money wealthier nations can afford to give but we can give of our wealth in personnel.  That is where we make an important contribution.</P>
    <P>We do not propose to oppose this Estimate.  However, I have raised some points which I would like the Minister to answer.  I pay tribute to the Department for the work they have done in spreading the image of this country abroad as a constructive one.  Wherever we take a hand in international matters or make a contribution it is always regarded as constructive and responsible.  It is a reputation the Department have earned for our country and one which we should cherish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Compared to the Estimate for many other Government Departments the Estimate of £20 million for this Department is an insignificant <Col N="684" /> sum.  From my experience, it represents value for money because of the work done not just in the EEC and the UN but in other capitals of the world in promoting our interests, industry and tourism. Over £1,000 million was allocated to the Department of Health and the Department of Social Welfare and almost a £1,000 million to the Department of Education.  The Department of Foreign Affairs is an efficient one which does its job well and the sum of £20 million is not excessive.</P>
      <P>I remember being told by a New Zealander in Paris that he had to go to the British Embassy to get information about Ireland.  The Irish Embassy did not have sufficient information and library services.  He could get all the information he wanted in the British Embassy.  Perhaps the Minister will look at that aspect of services abroad.  It was somewhat embarrassing.</P>
      <P>In passing, Deputy Lenihan mentioned Fianna Fáil's attitude to positive neutrality. I do not want to raise any contentious matters.  My predisposition is towards a neutral Ireland although like many people I like to reason out why we should hold a particular view.  There has not been any proper debate on this.  I understand CND are undertaking a door-to-door canvass.  I welcome that.  It is a good democratic service.  There seems to be a fear of one party outdoing the other on neutrality.  Fianna Fáil's contribution to positive neutrality in recent times has been issuing advertisements with mushroom clouds.  These were issued on the eve of the recent election and can only have been an attempt to frighten the public. It is a pity we cannot get away from a fear that one party might score over the other and have a proper debate on neutrality so that we will know why it is that we are neutral.  I should like such a debate to be held.  It would be a useful exercise for us to engage in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent weeks a survey was carried out which showed the vast majority of people were in favour of our not having an outside alignment.  I find it hard to believe people hold that view since nobody has ever argued the case for them.  They hear the major parties trying to get in ahead <Col N="685" /> of each other to reaffirm their stance on neutrality.  Yet 70 per cent of the people have a view on it.  I should like a debate on it so that those views will be soundly formed and soundly based.  If they are not, they could be easily changed.  We owe it to the country to use this Parliament to debate the issue.  Perhaps at an early stage in the future we will have a non-contentious debate so that all can say why they want us to remain neutral.  There would be an official record of our position.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Fianna Fáil position, in 1962 when it seemed possible that it might be an issue on EEC entry negotiations, Seán Lemass said the existence of Partition was no longer in itself a reason for refusing to join NATO and that neutrality might have outlived its usefulness.  That was said in 1962 and he implied the same thing in June 1961 in the Official Report at Volume 190, column 179.  There are very good grounds to believe that the seán Lemass led Fianna Fáil Government, more than any other Government since the foundation of the State, and certainly more than any other Fianna Fáil Government, had been preparing the ground for a departure from a neutral Ireland.  I wonder at what stage Fianna Fáil have swung back towards neutrality.  Surely we should all put our views on the record so that we can benefit from the debate.  Some Members of this Parliament are starved of avenues of information on neutrality and foreign affairs generally.</P>
    <P>In 1956 Mr. Liam Cosgrave, then Minister for External Affairs, outlined three broad principles on which Ireland's participation in the United Nations would depend: first, the support of the United Nations Charter, second, the independence of blocs in the United Nations, and third, a commitment to preserve the Charistian civilisation of which we are a part, and with that end in view to support wherever possible those powers principally responsible for the defence of the free world in the resistance to the spread of Communist power and influence.  To some extent those three principles have survived the test of time albeit in differing degrees and emphasis and at different <Col N="686" /> times.  There can be little doubt that despite our avowed position on neutrality, there is a very strong anti-Communist pro-free world opinion in this country and, in the final analysis we have to ask ourselves if we can be completely neutral. Given the way we practice our foreign policy compared with the way we preach it &mdash; when I say our I mean not only this Government but successive Irish Governments &mdash; I think it is time we had a full scale debate on foreign policy to see where everybody stands.</P>
    <P>There is a need for more regular debates on foreign affairs.  I will quote from Patrick Keatinge's book, the Formulation of Irish Foreign Policy.  On page 205, he says:</P>
    <P>When Mr. MacBride complained in 1953 that it was &ldquo;...a pity that, once a year at least, we could not have a debate or discussion in the House on foreign policy...&rdquo;, he was thinking of the estimate debate, where the &ldquo;Minister...should give at least a broad outline of the Government's policy...&rdquo; Possibly, a more satisfactory arrangement would be to have separate debates on policy and administration, for, although the two are closely related and may cover the same issues, they deserve to be examined separately.</P>
    <P>That is a very worthy viewpoint.  We tend to think of the administration of foreign affairs and Government policy as the same thing and to debate them in this House in a general, local and uninformed way.  One of the best debates on foreign affairs in this House was held in 1957 on a motion on the disapproval of the Government's foreign policy.  We do not seem to take debates on foreign affairs policy very seriously.  It is left to one or two people to speak very generally on these issues.  I would welcome the opportunity to hear the views of experienced Members on foreign affairs, but there seems to be a shyness on the part of Deputies on all sides to get involved in a serious debate in this area.  In my view it would help us if we had a Dáil Committee on Foreign Affairs.  I hope the Minister will give consideration to this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="687" /> As an island we tend to be somewhat isolationist and to feel that we do not need to take an interest in foreign affairs. Mr. Keatinge also said he thought there was no Parliament in the world in which matters of foreign affairs were dealt with so casually as in this parliament.  Mr. Keatinge was commenting on a speech made by John Costello in the Dáil in 1957.  In 1957 Mr. Costello said that there should be some sort of machinery created by the Government which would not affect the precious constitutional right of having the last word in policy but which would at least have the advantage of telling us what is going on.  I do not think things have changed very much since John Costello made those points.</P>
    <P>Legislation affords the House the main opportunity to comment on various Government Departments, but it is very rare that we deal with legislation for the Department of Foreign Affairs.  We get an opportunity when we discuss the annual Estimates, the occasional EEC instrument and at Question Time but we do not debate foreign affairs as much as other Departments.  As I said, I think we should have a Dáil Committee on Foreign Affairs, since other Departments have been afforded such an opportunity.</P>
    <P>In 1944 in the Official Report, volume 94, column 1338, James Dillon said: &ldquo;All that we do, or can hope to do, in this country is materially conditioned by the state of the world in which we live.&rdquo; That is a statement of fact.  It is extraordinary that this Parliament leaves the whole area of foreign affairs to our very able officials in that Department, to the junior and senior Ministers and to an occasional interruption from the Opposition spokesman. We do not take an interest in foreign affairs.  Given our role in the United Nations and the European Economic Community and given the pressures that may be on us to join other bodies, such as WEU, and given the role we are abstaining from playing in NATO, we should have a committee of this House to determine and to supervise Government policies.</P>
    <P>I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister of State for the <Col N="688" /> interest he has taken in overseas aid, which is his specific responsibility.  The greatest economic pressure which will be exerted on this country will come from countries in Asia, such as Japan, South Korea and so on, countries where there are low labour costs and high output. People in other regions of the world could learn from those countries.  People must realise that Europe will not always be the strong economic unit it is today and it is in our interest to ensure that developing countries, perhaps towards the end of the century, will be competing against Europe for world trade.  It is in our interest to help to create balanced development of those countries, not just from pity or sympathy but mainly from self-interest.</P>
    <P>It is in our interest that those countries will develop economically and that we will have a mutual understanding with them.  At some time in the future we may be depending on their goodwill.  It is a silly attitude for us to consider overseas aid now as a bit of charity to black babies or whatever.  The developing countries must be helped from our own self-interest so that they will develop as democratic states with whom we can work for a better economic order.</P>
    <P>Through this relatively small Estimate I hope the Minister will find it possible, particularly with the advent of our EEC presidency, to go beyond the EEC commitment for overseas aid.  Even if it were only one half per cent more, we should give the lead and put pressure on the other nine members to do the same out of their national budgets, which in proportionate terms would be much more than we could manage.  We must try to interest our EEC partners more in giving aid for overseas development.</P>
    <P>There is a great need for more information from independent sources.  Deputies need research so that they can contribute towards the formulation of policies and so that they can question the Government intelligently on foreign policy. With that end in mind, I hope the Minister will accede to the request to the UN for assistance to set up a UN office in Dublin.  There is one in London which <Col N="689" /> provides much needed information in regard to international matters and helps people to get a better grasp of these matters, leading ultimately to hopes for a better world order.  I understand the cost would be about £40,000 and I urge the Minister to get this off the ground.</P>
    <P>On the Western European Union, it seems clear that there is a fear that the US are losing their firmness of commitment to European defence.  We take many things for granted, for instance, that the Warsaw Pact countries will protect what they think are their interests in the eastern bloc and that the European super powers, with the Americans and Canadians, will defend our interests in Europe.  It seems the Americans are changing their priorities, that they are concentrating more on South and Central America.  The US may feel that if the Europeans are serious about their own defence they will participate in the Western European Union.  Because of our neutral status we would have difficulty in joining any such-organisation, but let us be clear that at some time our policy on this matter may be put to the test if the Americans weaken in their attitude to European defence.  In such an eventuality the WEU would become increasingly involved in defence policies, separate from the NATO arrangement.  Consequently, we may not be able to depend on other European countries automatically accepting our neutral status.</P>
    <P>It is clear from discussions I have had that in the event of any threat to European security Ireland's neutrality simply would not be recognised, particularly by those who are friendly to us rather than our stated enemies.  Therefore, we will have to review our position so that this Government and Parliament will know and that our European partners will know where we stand and why.  I wish the Minister and the Minister of State well during the period of our EEC presidency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will appreciate that it is virtually impossible to deal adequately with such an important Estimate in the short time at our disposal.  It would be impossible to deal with one aspect of Irish foreign policy <Col N="690" /> in ten minutes, and once again this year I wish to record my protest at the inadequate time allowed.  We were allowed two hours last year for this Estimate and we have been given the same period this year.  Last year the Minister promised that he would arrange for a more detailed and longer debate to enable more Deputies to contribute.  We still have not had a detailed debate on foreign affairs.  I appeal to the Minister of State to arrange as soon as possible for such a debate when the Dáil resumes in the autumn.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Mitchell, I feel that the issue of neutrality should be debated at length here, particularly precisely what we mean by neutrality.  It is quite easy for all of us to throw around fancy terms like neutrality, non-alignment, military alliances, positive neutrality, allegiance to the free world, as stated by Deputy Mitchell.  What do we mean by such terms?  Does Deputy Mitchell include in the term &ldquo;the free world&rdquo; countries like Chile, Turkey, Turkish-occupied Cyprus?  There are dozens of countries in the so-called free world which are ruled by dictatorships, and the so-called &ldquo;unfree free world&rdquo; has been relegated to second place because they pursue social assessments different from the West.  That would be an important debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What does our neutrality mean?  Are we neutral simply on the side of the US, the side of Great Britain, the side of the EEC?  Are we non-aligned?  Do we take our policy issue by issue?  Do we adopt an independent stance internationally and criticise when criticism is necessary regardless of whom it may offend, or do we simply adopt the mantle of neutrality as protection in time of war?  The position today is total nonsense.  There is no such thing as a protective nuclear umbrella for us from NATO.  Indeed, as Deputy Mitchell said, in the event of an invasion from the Warsaw Pact countries we are far more likely to be invaded by the NATO countries because of the value they place on certain of our ports, airfields and so forth.  These areas need clarification and debate.  For far too long the various Ministers for Foreign Affairs <Col N="691" /> more or less have been given a free hand by this House and have not been criticised to the extent to which they should. I am talking of criticism in relation to the attitudes and policies which they have adopted.</P>
    <P>We have time now only to deal very briefly with a number of issues.  I am concerned, for instance at the Minister's remarks about Central America and, in particular, El Salvador.  He seems to be giving a welcome to the result of the recent presidential election there.  It would be a fatal mistake if this country were to give recognition to the person successful in that election, if we may call it such.  That election some months ago is not to any extent similar to our recent election.  The Minister should think very carefully before he attempts to give recognition to President Duarte, who is certainly not a democratically elected President.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Another point in relation to Central America is the question of Nicaragua.  The fact is that the efforts to destabilise Nicaragua continue day by day.  Massive funds are being injected into the rebel groups who are trying to destabilise the country.  If this Government were to take an independent and positive step by diplomatically recognising the Nicaraguan Government, they would be placing on record their support for that small country in its efforts to create a decent livelihood for all its people who have suffered for generations under the Somozan dictatorship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also dealt with the question of Northern Ireland and was fairly fulsome in his praise of the Forum Report.  Clearly, in the time left to me I <Col N="692" /> shall not be in a position to deal with this report but I should like to put on record that The Workers' Party &mdash; the only party in this House who have organised themselves in Northern Ireland and have elected representatives there &mdash; have been working for years on the side of peace and democracy and for jobs in Northern Ireland.  It is on those lines the solution to the problems in the North will be found.</P>
    <P>There is reference in the Forum Report and in the Official Unionist document &ldquo;The Way Forward&rdquo; to a Bill of Rights. This is an issue on which The Workers' Party have been campaigning for the past 15 years and more &mdash; since the days of the Civil Rights Movement.  However, the British Government have still not produced a Bill of Rights.  Indeed, if one had been produced 15 years ago many of the problems now being experienced in Northern Ireland could have been avoided.</P>
    <P>I appeal again to the Minister of State and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to arrange a longer debate on foreign affairs, to enable Deputies to become involved in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I apologise to the House for not being here to move my Estimate at 8.30 p.m.  I think that the House will be aware of the reasons.  In particular, I should like to apologise to Deputy Collins, the Fianna Fáil spokesman on Foreign Affairs, for not being here when he spoke.  Deputy O'Keeffe issued my script for me and spoke himself on ODA. The House will realise the reason for my delay in Paris &mdash; a very important meeting of the European Council was taking place there.  The results were satisfactory on two counts, first &mdash; and there was an element of this in the European elections last week &mdash; the people were beginning to lose some faith in Europe as a vehicle for carrying the dreams of themselves and their children into the future.  That was an interpretation of their abstention right across Europe from the Aran <Col N="693" /> Islands to the borders of Germany and to the Greek Islands.  People could not see the relevance of Europe to their everyday life.  This lack of relevance to them was amply demonstrated by what must have appeared to the outside world as bickerings over relatively small sums of money &mdash; given the vastness of the budget which the European Council were administering &mdash; over three summit meetings now, their failure to come to terms and solve their problems, yet frequently issuing press statements at the end of European summit meetings telling other countries how to solve theirs.</P>
      <P>That phase of Europe has now come to an end.  The Stuttgart summit meeting which was held exactly this time last year put together an imaginative, ambitious and dynamic programme for what was termed by Chancellor Kohl at the time the relaunching of Europe.  It has taken us 12 months, in spite of the urgency spoken about by him at that time in engaging in this exercise, to agree amongst ourselves on all the details of that package.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One detail was, of course, the restructuring of the Common Agricultural Policy which was of such significance to this country.  As I said in my opening address, the outcome was very satisfactory, not just for the farmers or for the agricultural sector but for the country as a whole. Agriculture is our number one resource and industry and will be in the foreseeable future the main generator of exports and of jobs.  For that reason the Government were concerned, over the last winter and up to the Brussels Summit meeting three months ago, to ensure that our partners in the EEC appreciated that fact and understood the damage that would be done to the growth of our economy if the super-levy as proposed were inflicted on this country.  In the event in Brussels we managed to convince them of the justice of our case in that regard.  The agricultural package eventually agreed there, which is now part of the whole package, gives us the possibility of growth for this year while all the other EEC countries are having to cut back on their agricultural production.  This is quite significant and should be recognised <Col N="694" /> as a proof to anybody in Ireland who has some doubts as to the benefits to the economy or the concern of the richer and more powerful members of the EEC for those less well off.</P>
    <P>It is quite true to say that those who are paying most into the coffers of the EEC were also most ready to recognise that our plight was different and that agriculture in this country was quite unique in importance, in comparison even with North Sea oil to the British economy, or steel to Germany.  Those who were paying most, that is the Germans, recognised this fact and, with the other eight members, agreed that Ireland should be allowed growth in its dairy sector while the rest of Europe was being asked to cut back.  We are, of course, very grateful for this, but it was also a major negotiation achievement on the part of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture that we were able to bring this about.  I believe that point is understood and appreciated by the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>I want to say something about an event which occurred almost exactly a month ago, that is, the visit of President Reagan when he addressed the Dáil and made a speech which, in years to come, may be looked back on as one of the significant milestones on the road to world disarmament, an end which we all very much desire.  I suppose I should not have been so surprised at the numbers of people who engaged in protests against the head of a very friendly nation.  I was absolutely disgusted that Members of the Oireachtas &mdash; and I am not speaking about Deputy De Rossa or Deputy Mac Giolla &mdash; should attend a demonstration, while President Reagan was speaking in this House, at which the flag of the United States was burned outside the gates of this House.  I do not think any greater insult could be offered to the people of a nation, or their elected representative, than to burn the symbol of their freedom, their strength and their nationhood in another country.</P>
    <P>Before President Reagan came here I said on a number of occasions that people were entitled to protest.  We cannot all agree all the time.  People were entitled <Col N="695" /> to protest so long as the protest was peaceful.  I was ashamed that Irish people, particularly Members of the Oireachtas, should allow that to happen on the streets of Dublin, the capital city of Ireland.  There is no greater insult you can offer to a nation than to do that to their flag.  In this case on behalf of 99.9 per cent of the Irish people, including all Members of this House, and many of the people who were protesting in other ways, I should like to apologise to the President of the American people for that grievous insult which was offered to them here.</P>
    <P>The significance of President Reagan's visit has not yet been realised.  The visit and the way it was portrayed on American television can do nothing but good for this country.  The only black mark was that disgusting incident outside the gates of this House.  He is the President of the most powerful nation in the world. People insulted him before he came by saying he was coming to get votes and had no interest in Ireland, or in anything Irish.  It is their stock in trade to use that kind of exaggerated, unfounded and untrue allegation.</P>
    <P>President Reagan came here long before he went into politics.  He also came here when he was Governor of California. The polls suggest that he did not need to go anywhere this year to be reelected. That may prove to be wrong, but anybody who say him on television or was with him in Ballyporeen will have recognised the genuine affection and emotion with which he established where his roots were.  I have no doubt that his interest in Ireland was not rekindled, because that would imply that it had died, but was very much enhanced on that occasion.</P>
    <P>I said this also before he came here. Ireland is the only country in the world which the President of the United States picked out and recommended for investment. It is the only country in the world in which he asked businessmen in his own country to invest.  This was long before he decided to visit here.  That in itself says something for the man.</P>
    <P>As I came in I heard Deputy De Rossa <Col N="696" /> talking about the policies of Duarte in El Salvador.  I am open to correction, but I think he said it was hardly a democratic election.  It was certainly an improvement on the election there two years ago. Everybody on this side of the world who is interested in democracy should encourage the Government in El Salvador to be more open to its opponents and to follow the democratic path which they have so gingerly stepped onto in the past few months against appalling opposition in arms from the left and possibly from the right.  There was an incident over the weekend which tends to give credence to what I am saying.</P>
    <P>I am glad the European Community has accepted an invitation from the President of Costa Rica to engage in co-operation talks with the five central American countries, as well as the four Contadora countries.  Many of the countries in that region are poor and none of them knows democracy.  For hundreds of years many of them have been living under dictatorships and 99 per cent of the people lived in almost abject poverty.  A very small percentage of the people had untold and unnecessary wealth accumulated on the backs of those poor people.  We owe it to them to encourage them not to fall under the influence of any outside forces, but to develop their own system of democracy, social justice and civil rights for their people.  In many ways Europe can play an important role in that regard.</P>
    <P>I hope the initiative taken by President Monge of inviting Europe to meet them next September will bear fruit, not just for El Salvador but also for Nicaragua which in other ways needs as careful watching.  That is another country which feels under threat.  The people are facing into an election at the end of this year.  I hope the result of the election will be at least as democratic as the one in El Salvador. We will have to wait and see.  The cheers and the acclaim with which the Sandinista Government were welcomed in Nicaragua were somewhat diminished by something which happened since they took power.  Their chance will come next November to have an open and democratic election and to show the world that they are genuinely interested in democracy <Col N="697" /> and that they are taking heed of their opponents, who must be allowed to contest the election and must be allowed to operate with a free press and to enjoy all the other freedoms which we associate with democracy.  I am looking forward very much to taking part in those talks in two months time.  I am sure they will be successful.</P>
    <P>As I said in my opening remarks, for the third time since we joined the EEC we are assuming the Presidency on Monday next.  On neither of the other occasions on which we occupied this very important post were the times so challenging. I hope the organisation of that Presidency, which I am sure is in train, will be well recognised as being good.  I hope we will be able to build on what was started in Stuttgart, and added to today in Fontainebleau and that, during our six months in the Presidency between now and the end of the year, we will be able to show Europe that Ireland can live up to its reputation of being truly Community minded, as we did on the last two occasions, and that we can organise and lead the Community in the direction of giving hope for the future for young people and providing jobs for the 15 million people who have not got jobs at the moment, and can also play a leading role in world affairs.  If we give advice we will be giving it in the sure knowledge that we have managed to straighten out our own affairs.</P>
    <P>We also want to show the world outside that the Europe which they may have thought was faltering on its path towards the goals outlined for it over 25 years ago by the founders of the European movement has steadied on course now.  We can show the world that the hope which Europe offered to its own people and to the peoples of the world for 25 years is undimmed.  We can now work to achieve the growth and enlargement of the Community and fulfil all our hopes that it will grow to become a political union which was the dream of the founding fathers. With all its faults it can be said that one of the main goals has been achieved, because it is inconceivable now that we would ever again see blood shed in anger on the mainland of Europe.  It is totally <Col N="698" /> inconceivable that those countries which are so closely bound together in the Community could ever again go to war with one another.</P>
    <P>Again, I should like to apologise to the House for not being here to move the Estimate.  I should like to thank those Deputies who have contributed.  I shall read the Official Report with great interest to take up the points that have been made in the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  That is the note on which I propose to start. Members of this House must carry the odium of extracting from the people by direct and indirect taxes the colossal amount of money required to provide a public transport system.  We extract that money from the people on their behalf and we are supposed to be the guarantors of their having such a service.  On the other hand, when that service is withdrawn for any reason we do not seem to have any power in the matter.  We can be accused of letting down the people who charge us with the responsibility of having the service provided.  I do not know if I will be accused of advocating any new ideology, but I think the time has come when we must look seriously at the matter.</P>
      <P>I am not prepared to continue with the situation where the law-abiding, industrious people of Finglas and Glasnevin are deprived of a proper transport service.  It appears that literally at the drop of a hat, at the whim of some person, whether in management, on the general operative staff or in a trade union, the people of the areas concerned are deprived of their rights overnight and without notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to visualise the situation that exists at the moment.  It started off with an unofficial strike.  Men and women, in pursuit of their livelihoods and all of them contributing to the economic wellbeing of the community, arrive at their bus stops at 7 a.m. having overcome a very natural reluctance to get up at that hour and resisting the temptation to stay at home, especially when they see people getting money for not working. However, they are left standing at their bus stops with no excuse or explanation given.  Later in the day they discover the reason, namely, that in the <Col N="700" /> opinion of one person the buses were not roadworthy or some other flimsy excuse. Because the crews would not work on the buses the people were deprived of the service.  One wonders at the selectivity that operates in this matter, that it applies only to Glasnevin and Finglas.</P>
    <P>At this time many young boys and girls after years of industry and application to educational pursuits, are sitting their leaving certificate and intermediate certificate examinations and some are going to third level colleges.  Unlike other young people they are totally dependent on public transport to get to their examination centres, They have to wait for buses that do not come, and this in addition to all the anxieties they are experiencing in relation to their examinations.  In addition to all the inequalities that exist, they are now confronted with the appalling position where they are worried that they will not get to their examination centres. They know that even though the matter is totally outside their control, the people at the examination centres will not take account of that fact.</P>
    <P>Let us take the case of a young woman who may have an appointment at Holles Street Hospital or the Rotunda Hospital in connection with a pregnancy, or indeed the case of any person who may have an appointment in a hospital.  They depend on public transport to get to the hospital but the buses do not come and the appointment is broken.  The institution will be insensitive as to the reason these people have not arrived on time for their appointments.</P>
    <P>These are the human factors that cause me to become agitated.  Some 50 years ago labour was abused and my late father and others were forced to go on the streets because they did not have a living wage.  In those times people worked for ruthless employers who extracted the last ounce from them and people had to go on strike in order to reduce the profits of the owners.  However, that is not the situation now.  The employer here is the person who provides the money.  PAYE taxpayers in my constituency, in that of Deputy Flaherty and Deputy De Rossa, who have paid for a proper transport service are not getting that service.  This <Col N="701" /> is not because the people who are charged with providing the service are not getting a living wage but for some twopence halfpenny reason.  Where is the greater injustice?  People were subjected to slavery 50 years ago and we all know that fat profits were made by the employer, compared to the meagre wages paid to the worker.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was leading up to the fact that the least we should do for those people is to provide an emergency service forthwith, because the obligation is on the Government to do so and they should not tolerate selectivity.  If, as has been said, the crews refused to take out these buses because they were inferior does that mean that the garage which is obliged to provide buses for Finglas and Glasnevin houses inferior buses?  If that is the case, we must castigate management and everyone else concerned and call for an inquiry.  To whom is the injustice being done?  Is it to the person who, by direct or indirect taxation, is paying for the service, from whom it is being withheld and who has to suffer all the hardship of having no other transport, or is it to the person who feels that the bus being provided is not of the type or quality which he thinks suitable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people of Glasnevin and Finglas should not be asked to carry the can.  I am mindful of what the Minister of State said about sensitivity.  However, I am not concerned about sensitivity in this instance except in the case of my constituents who are being deprived of this service.  We are obliged, by law, to provide a service and, if the service is taken away as a result of a dispute, the obligation is on us to provide an emergency service.  That has been provided before and, if the people of Foxrock or Dun Laoghaire were involved, it would be provided again.  Is it because only the people of Finglas are involved, who perhaps are not as articulate as other people, that nothing is being done?  Those people might have the resolve to see justice done <Col N="702" /> in their own way, and reference has been made to the fact that they are contemplating having a service of their own.  I am in full sympathy with that aim.  If the Government are not upholding the law it is unfair to castigate people who feel they are entitled to depart from it.  They are already being denied normal service.  Bus services to the McKelvey, Plunkett, Finglas West and South areas stop at 9.30 p.m.  It does not stop at 9.30 p.m. in Foxrock, Killiney, Donnybrook or Clontarf but it stops at that hour in Finglas because the crews are not too happy.  If they are not, there is an obligation on the Minister for Justice to provide a service. That is in the legislation under which CIE act.  For over a year and a half now it has not been provided&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair will appreciate that you cannot just mention one matter. I am referring to what the people of Finglas are entitled to under the law and I am suggesting that there is an obligation on the Minister of State to provide, forthwith, emergency services which have been provided in the past.  If there has been selectivity in the operation of the strike, surely the Minister should not follow the same path in respect of withholding emergency services from those people which were granted on other occasions when strikes affected the whole city?  I am appealing to the Minister, irrespective of the so-called sensitivity which he may have, to do something now.  Strikes and withholding of labour were relevant some years ago but are no longer relevant today because the people of Finglas, who provide the money to run the service, are suffering unnecessary hardship.</P>
      <P>I promised my colleague, Deputy Mary Flaherty, that I would allow her five minutes of my time, with your permission, to speak on this most urgent problem.  I appeal to the Minister of State to provide an emergency service tomorrow or the day after for the people of Finglas and let them see that we have not let them down.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Tunney for giving me some of his time, as I had sought to raise this matter in a number of ways.  There are currently 36,000 angry, fed-up and footsore people whose working, leisure and ordinary activities of daily life are disrupted as a result of this dispute.  It has been going on now for five days and may very soon spread to the whole city.  Finglas people know where to lay the blame &mdash; at the Phibsboro depot which has been causing problems by offering a limited service to the area for a very long time.  It is because they have not had buses in the evenings for nearly two years now that the level of frustration is reaching breaking point when they are faced with total shutdown of services.  It affects not just the people directly involved but also the numbers 13, 11 and 36 which are coming under severe pressure because people who normally use the buses on strike are now turning to these services.  The Dublin north west area has been badly affected by this dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Labour Court have thrown out the case.  I agree with Deputy Tunney that this is a minor dispute, and the people should not have been used as pawns in the ongoing battle at Phibsboro depot between the management and the unions.  The people of Finglas have identified this over a long period as a situation in which they are being used in the battle.  It is strange that although the Phibsboro depot refused to provide a service after 7 p.m. in some place and 9 p.m. in other parts of Finglas, nevertheless the number 17A, which operates from another garage, runs until normal closing time.  There is a big question mark over the operation of that service when, seemingly, the Phibsboro crew feel they cannot come into the area.  It is because the problem has been going on for so long that the level of frustration is so high.  I support Deputy Tunney's plea. There is no question but that the people of the area are suffering most.  The dispute is a mild one and should have been dealt with in a different manner.  Given that the people have been without a service for almost a week the Minister should take the action suggested by <Col N="704" /> Deputy Tunney and introduce a support service as has been done in other locations. It should be remembered that examinations have been disrupted because of this dispute and that this is a particularly difficult time for many young people in the area who have other problems to contend with.</P>

      <P>I disagree to a large extent with what Deputy Tunney said in relation to the causes of the dispute.  My information is that the dispute arises from the refusal of management of pay CIE busmen their wages for the days when they refused to take out defective buses. The dispute is affecting the people of the north west of the city and they have every right to be angry about it, but the busmen also have a right to be angry with the management of CIE&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I can understand the annoyance expressed by Deputies Tunney and Flaherty now and earlier when we considered a Special Notice Question. This is a major inconvenience for their constituents and an impossible situation for many people who must sit examinations and so on.  My major concern is to <Col N="705" /> see a very early resumption of services in the areas affected.  I hope good sense will prevail, and I appeal for good sense amongst all parties so that the position will be righted speedily.  As Deputies are aware, the dispute was the subject of a conciliation conference yesterday.  The stage has now been reached when proposals for referring the dispute to a full hearing of the Labour Court are being considered by the parties involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I explained earlier I am keeping the matter under review, but at this stage a decision has not been taken in relation to the provision of emergency transport by the Army.  I emphatically reject the contention by Deputy Tunney that if this dispute existed in another part of the city, or another part of the country, the Army would be operating with their transport conveying citizens.  The use of the Army transport is always under review in such a situation, but as of now a decision has not been taken to provide emergency transport.  During my time as a journalist I have seen some disputes which were about to be settled prolonged because too much was said at a delicate period in negotiations.  For that reason I will be brief in my contribution.  I am confident that a reasonable approach all round will result in a solution to the problem.  There <Col N="706" /> is a desire for such a solution, and it is necessary that the buses should be back very soon.  I appreciate the frustration of the people of the area which was eloquently voiced by Deputies Flaherty and Tunney.  The matter is being kept under review, and we will take whatever action we consider fit at the right time.  I am hopeful that we will see a quick solution to the dispute and the buses back on the road as they should be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 326 and 327 together.</P>
      <P>As the first question refers to &ldquo;the then Deputy Commissioner&rdquo; I should perhaps make it clear that at the relevant time there were three Deputy Commissioners in the Force.</P>
      <P>As regards the first question, the facts are as follows.  In the course of an investigation that was being carried out at my request into the allegations of improper telephone tapping, the senior Deputy Commissioner, who was the officer conducting the investigation, had occasion to interview and take statements from a number of members of the staff of the relevant section in Garda headquarters. It then came to notice that at least some of those members were being separately questioned by another Deputy Commissioner, namely the officer in charge of security.  That questioning appeared to be designed to elicit whether any of the members concerned had been responsible for &ldquo;leaking&rdquo; information about the tapping to somebody outside the Force. The House will appreciate that those members were people whose full co-operation was being sought, in the public interest, in the main investigation.</P>
      <P>Apart from the fact that the carrying out of two overlapping investigations was understandably causing confusion and resentment, I was not prepared to accept that an investigation of any aspect of the matter should be carried out by an officer whose own role in relation to the tapping of those two telephones was the subject of inquiry.  I had a message conveyed to the Commissioner to that general effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the second question, the <Col N="493" /> answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  It was the Commissioner who made the appointment in question and accordingly the question of my acting without his prior agreement did not arise. It has however been on public record all along that I asked the Commissioner to make that appointment.  In the statement which I issued on 20 January 1983 concerning the tapping of the telephones of Mr. Bruce Arnold and Miss Geraldine Kennedy I said the following:</P>
    <P>I then asked for an investigation to be carried out within the relevant section of the Garda Síochána by the senior Deputy Commissioner who was the most senior officer who had no involvement with the matter.</P>

If corresponding unemployment rates are calculated from the provisional results for individual counties, those having the highest rates are: Donegal, 19.7; Kerry, 11.7; Louth, 11.4; Wexford, 11.2; Mayo, 9.9.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 471 and 472 together.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners publish information on the distribution of total income as well as taxable income, in their annual reports.  The relevant information for 1980-81 the latest year for which statistics have been published is contained in tables 84 to 88, inclusive, of the report for the year ended 31 December 1981 copies of which are in the Library.  The corresponding information for 1981-82 will be contained in the report for the year ended 31 December 1982 the compilation of which is almost completed. Statistics in relation to the distribution of total income are not available for any year prior to 1974-75.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Total income could for all practical purposes be regarded as gross income. The definition of gross income contained in the annual reports of the Revenue Commissioners is total income before adjustments are made in respect of such items as capital allowances, interest paid in full, losses brought forward, certain allowable expenses and superannuation contributions.  In the case of PAYE taxpayers total income is as closely equivalent to gross income as it is possible to achieve without a detailed examination of individual tax files which could only be carried out at a disproportionate cost.  In the case of businesses it is considered that a distribution by reference to gross income as defined in the annual reports of the Revenue Commissioners would be of little use for analytical purposes since such gross income does not correspond with any concept of commercial profits as normally understood.  To produce a distribution of gross income based on any of <Col N="524" /> the accepted commercial or economic definitions of such income would require an even more detailed and costly examination of tax files than would be required in the case of PAYE taxpayers.</P>

      <P>It is understood that due to an industrial dispute in the Department of Health and Social Security the normal arrangements for payment of pensions to persons living outside the United Kingdom have been interrupted.  Alternative arrangements for payment in these cases have however been made by the British authorities.  To avail of the alternative arrangements pensioners should write to Overseas Group, Department of Health and Social Security, Newcastle-upon-Tyne NE 98 1YX giving full identifying particulars and enclosing the counterfoil <Col N="532" /> of the last payment received.  Information about these arrangements was circulated to post offices and community welfare offices.</P>
      <P>In relation to entitlement to Irish non-contributory old age pension, a person in receipt of a United Kingdom pension would have that pension assessed as means where he applies for non-contributory pension in Ireland.  Entitlement is established on the basis of the yearly value of means and the temporary interruption of British pension payments would not affect the rate of non-contributory old age pension payable.  In such a situation however it is open to any person in need of assistance to apply for such assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  The local community welfare officers who administer that scheme are aware of the situation.</P>

      <Col N="534" /> The regulations provide that where a claimant fails to give notice of incapacity for work within 7 days he is disqualified from receiving payment of disability benefit in respect of any period more than seven days before the date on which notice was given.</P>
    <P>Where however good cause for late notification is shown it is possible under the regulations to accept a claim from an earlier date.  In such circumstances under the regulations payment is limited to a period of six months prior to the actual date of receipt of the medical evidence of incapacity.  However in the present instance the claimant had been in receipt of a disabled persons maintenance allowance from the Southern Health Board from October 1982 to December 1983. The allowance and disability benefit could not be paid in respect of the same period and retrospective payment of disability benefit was not therefore, appropriate in this case.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 16 May 1984 and was initially paid at the single rate pending the return of a claim form to enable him to claim an increase for dependants.  Following receipt of the claim form an adjustment cheque for the arrears of benefit payable in respect of his wife and two dependant children was issued on 20 June 1984.  All disability benefit payable to him to 15 June 1984, the date of the latest medical certificate received, has been issued.</P>
      <P>He is not entitled to pay-related benefit as regulations operative from 2 April 1984 provide that amounts payable by way of disability benefit and pay-related benefit may not exceed 75 per cent of a claimant's average reckonable weekly earnings in the relevant income tax year which in this case is the 1982-83 tax year. His rate of benefit, £74.85 a week, exceeds 75 per cent of his reckonable weekly earnings in that year.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid injury benefit from 10 March 1983 the date of his accident at work to 3 June when he was considered to be capable of work following an examination by a medical <Col N="555" /> referee.  He claimed injury benefit again from 11 July 1983 and was examined by a different medical referee who also expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  The later claim to injury benefit was disallowed on these grounds.</P>
      <P>The claimant's appeal against the decision has been allowed following an oral hearing and consideration of further submissions. As a result of this decision arrears of injury benefit were awarded for the period from 11 July 1983 to 7 September, the end of the injury benefit period.  In addition arrears of disability benefit were awarded for the period from 8 September 1983 to 23 June 1984 with the exception of the periods 7 November 1983 to 5 December 1983 and 4 January 1984 to 9 April 1984 in respect of which disability benefit had already been paid. The sums concerned however were withheld and refunded to the South-Eastern Health Board on account of supplementary welfare allowance advanced.</P>
      <P>Payment of further disability benefit will be made as medical evidence of continuing incapacity is received.  A sum of £5 per week will be deducted until such time as the balance of the refund due to the health board £473.50 has been made. The person concerned has also claimed disablement benefit in respect of the accident.  Arrangements have been made for a medical examination on 12 July to assess the extent of his disablement.  A decision on the claim will be made as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The maximum amount of the weekly addition for rent which may be paid under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is the amount by which the weekly rent exceeds £1.50.  The figure of £5 referred to is the maximum amount which may be paid without the consent of the Minister.  Sanction for the payment of amounts exceeding £5 is, however, readily given.  Neither the £1.50 minimum figure nor the £5 maximum allowance have been increased since 1977.  It is understood that the present value of the sum of £5 in 1977 is approximately £2.</P>

    <P>Persons accused of these offences could theoretically have been dealt with in the Circuit Court also but it is unlikely that any such sentences would have been imposed in the Circuit Court during the period in question.  It would not be possible to put the matter beyond doubt without the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of staff time.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): As I mentioned in my replies to previous questions on this subject, the various units of the Drug Squad are not the primary arm of the Garda Síochána in their dealings with drug offences. Over 1,600 members of the Force, representative of all Garda divisions and including almost 800 members from the Dublin metropolitan area, have to date completed an intensive training course in anti-drugs work provided as part of the Garda in-service training programme. This is quite apart from the fact that all members of the Force have a responsibility in the matter as part of their general duties.</P>
      <P>It will be seen, therefore, that comparative statistics of the kind sought in the question are not indicative of the increased involvement of the Garda Síochána in the prevention and detection of drug abuse.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the current operational strength of the Drug Squad is 47 of whom 35 are assigned to the Dublin unit.  The corresponding figures for 1 September 1983 are 43 and 31, respectively.</P>
