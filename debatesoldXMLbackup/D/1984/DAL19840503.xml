      <P>I agree the Order of Business but I might make a couple of points arising therefrom.  First of all it is proposed to take Financial Motions Nos. 3 to 19, inclusive.  We propose to agree to those without discussion on the understanding that we are not necessarily accepting the principles enshrined in them and that they will be dealt with by us on the different sections.</P>
      <P>Secondly, as we did last year &mdash; in order to expedite discussion of the Finance Bill as a whole &mdash; we should like to suggest, as an informal agreement at this stage, that today Chapters I and II of the Finance Bill be dealt with and disposed of.  It is just in order to set out a programme of work for the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">

Discussions will now take place in Government with a view to forming a plan.  It would be too early at this stage to give a date for bringing it before the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 9, line 19, to delete &ldquo;£5,000&rdquo;, and substitute &ldquo;£5,500&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this and other amendments we are proposing changes in the general exemption limits.  This year the take from income tax will again be considerably increased. Estimates of the increase over last year's <Col N="133" /> take range between 17 per cent and 20 per cent at a time when the general income of those at work is less.  The effect of the budget generally has been to increase once again the take from tax on income.  On the other hand, there is actually a reduction in taxes on capital.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the exemption limit to be raised from £4,800 to £5,000 but we propose that it be increased to £5,500.  Apart from the increase in inflation which has occurred during the past 18 months, there is a need for a larger increase in the general exemption limit due to the tremendous difficulties being experienced by people on lower incomes due to high prices and the level of mortgage repayments, as well as the fact that fewer members of families are working.</P>
    <P>We will also be proposing a higher take at the upper end of the scale as well as increases in the area of capital taxation.</P>
    <P>In relation to amendment No. 3, I would stress the need for higher exemption limits for widows.  They are included with single people but perhaps there should be a separate scale or exemption limit for them.  The inclusion of widows in the single persons' category would be one of the reasons for raising the exemption limit from £2,500 to £2,750.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in the level of income tax take can be very dramatically illustrated by indicating that in the past four years income tax has increased from £1,000 million to just short of £2,000 million.  We have all expressed concern for the lower paid and their burden of taxation.  Twenty years ago the industrial worker with average industrial earnings would have been outside the taxation bands, but he is now caught in the net at an income level of approximately £7,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each year the Minister for Finance announces in his budget that because of concessions he is making and the increase in the exemption limits a certain number of people will be removed from tax liability. It is important to compare what this Minister has done with what has been done by his predecessors in relation to the number of people to be exempted <Col N="134" /> from income tax.  In 1980 &mdash; a year beloved by me for a number of reasons since I was sitting where the Minister is now but also because we set up the Commission on Taxation, about which we have heard very little in the meantime &mdash; one saw the disincentive effect of increasing the burden of taxation and approximately 1,800 tax-payers, or almost two-thirds of those liable to pay tax at the higher rate, were reduced to the lower rate of tax.  That was a considerable move to diminish or cancel altogether the burden of taxation on the lower paid.  In 1981 as a consequence of the provisions for exemption 37,000 people were exempted from tax liability. In 1982 24,000 people were exempted from tax liability.  This year the Minister is telling us that he is making a generous provision for those on the lowest level of income by taking 15,000 people out of the tax net.  Significantly, those who are not removed from the tax net move into a higher tax band of 35 per cent.  Last year they would have been paying only 25 per cent.  Previously we have seen as many as 37,000 people taken out of the tax net and 180,000 paying at a lower rate.  The Minister's forecast of a total income taxation is £1,952 million and out of the generosity of his heart he is making provision to exempt 15,000 of the very low paid.</P>
    <P>I will have much to say during this debate about the impact of taxation on the economy and on social attitudes.  The Minister and the public must be reminded that people on the very lowest level of income will now be paying tax at the rate of 35 per cent where previously they would have been liable for 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>This Finance Bill proposes to raise at least an extra £300 million over the amount of money raised last year. Among those who will make a significant contribution to that extra money are those on the very lowest level of income. All of those people, except 15,000 of them, will now be included in this because of the rather low exemption limits the Minister is proposing.  We recognise that there are limitations on how far a Minister can go on this.  It is because of what those people on the lowest income <Col N="135" /> are expected to pay that I propose that the exemption limits the Minister has for the single person of £2,500 and £5,000 for married persons &mdash; as a consequence of what I did in the Finance Bill where the married couple, irrespective of whether the wife works at home or in some job, are entitled to twice the allowance of the single person &mdash; be increased to £2,700 for the single person and £5,200 for the married couple.  It is not, a generous gesture on the part of each succeeding Minister. It is that the level of income, because of inflation which might have escaped last year in real terms is in this year.  That is why we have always adjusted the exemption limits.  The Minister's minimal adjustments this year when inflation has only reduced by about two points during the whole year means that they are nothing like adequate to meet the normal requirements of protecting the really low paid.  That is the reason why I propose amendments Nos. 2 and 4.  As the Chair has indicated amendments Nos. 9, 10, 11 and 12 are consequential.  The same figures are in those amendments.  We have the figures of £2,500 being increased to £2,750 and £5,000 being increased to £5,400.  These are the reasons, as well as others I will be producing later in relation to other issues on income tax, why I hope the Minister will see fit to follow a long since established pattern to ensure that the income tax burden is not placed on the shoulders of those who have very little to contribute at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a couple of points about the amendments. The first one is in relation to the exemption limits for income tax purposes. I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that quite a number of people are not aware of the exemption limits and how they work.  Many people think that an exemption limit is the same as an allowance but that is not the case. If you go over the limit you lose the exemption entirely and revert to ordinary allowances.  There is of course a threshold for the difference between your income and the exemption figure.  The reason I <Col N="136" /> mention this this morning is that I get quite a number of people coming to me who are in the 65, 70 and 75 age group and have the higher exemption limits but have not been claiming them because they were not aware they could claim them.  Those people are usually exempt from tax without having known about it. Perhaps some special steps could be taken through the Department of Social Welfare whey they are issuing pensions to draw the attention of those people to those exemptions.</P>
      <P>I would like to see the figures being increased even more than proposed by Deputy O'Kennedy and Deputy Mac Giolla but the reality of the situation is that we are now four weeks into the new income tax year and there is no hope of those being applied even if we were to vote them through this morning.  Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy O'Kennedy know that.  We are only really playing to the gallery in proposing these amendments when there are quite a lot of serious amendments later on.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's apology is accepted.  I have attended public meetings and I know Deputy Mac Giolla has also attended such meetings, about water rates and all sorts of other things.  Deputy Mac Giolla has been playing to the gallery and telling the crowd what they need not pay, what they do not have to do, and what extra water rates they do not have to pay.  We know only too well that the only way we can increase these allowances is by cutting public expenditure.  In relation to every area where we have tried to cut public expenditure there has been an outcry led particularly by people like Deputy Mac Giolla ranging from four year olds going to school to water rates and anything else one wants to mention. If people are serious about increasing the tax-free allowance thresholds &mdash; it is an excellent idea which we will have to do sooner or later because of the despondency there is about people working &mdash; the only way to do that is to cut public expenditure.  If we are not pre-pared to bite the bitter pill we will not be able to increase those allowances.  It is time we stopped having a bob each way. We are either in favour of reducing PAYE by reducing public expenditure or we are not.  We cannot have it any other way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 1 of this Finance Bill proposes to increase the general exemption limits and those for aged persons.  If tax exemption is not increased to meet the level of inflation it simply is an additional tax burden.  That is the major point I want to make on section 1. The Minister is increasing the exemption limit in the case of elderly persons by 10 per cent, which I support and compliment him on doing.  He is increasing it by only 4.2 per cent in the case of those under 65 years.  The general exemption limit is only slightly over 4 per cent, which is 6 per cent below the rate of inflation.  It has to be put on the record in debating this section that this amounts to an additional tax burden on the ordinary PAYE worker because the tax exemption is 6 per cent below the rate of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil amendments set the figure across the board at approximately <Col N="138" /> 12 per cent which takes account of the rate of inflation and is, therefore, a more equitable proposal and a more equitable solution.  In giving the 10 per cent to the elderly the Minister is doing the right thing.  If you have got anything to give at all you should give it to those people but the 4 per cent at the other end of the scale is very short of what is needed to meet the rate of inflation.  I would like to remind the Minister that the National Planning Board in the report presented to him last week strongly recommended that the Government look at the indexation situation and act on it as quickly as possible.  While the Minister is increasing by the 4 per cent I am talking about the exemption limit of £5,000, £100 a week for a married couple, we should be clear in our minds what we are doing.  The exemption from income tax for people who earn less than £100 per week is to be applauded.  At the same time we must not clap ourselves on the back merely because of this, because £100 per week for a married couple is a miserly sum and is far short of what they would need to attempt to make ends meet.  In so far as the provision is a gesture, I support what the Government are trying to do, but it is 6 per cent short of inflation.  It must be said that any time an exemption is short of the rate of inflation it represents an additional tax burden.  Therefore, section 1 is imposing an additional tax burden, and that is what we must be clear about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Deputies O'Kennedy and Brennan have said. There is an inconsistency in the rate of increase in those tax exemption levels.  The exemption level in respect of a single or widowed person under 65 is being increased from £2,400 to £2,500.  This represents one twenty-fourth of the existing limit, which is just more than 4 per cent.  For people between 65 and 75 the increase represents three twenty-fifths, which is about 12 per cent.  That is about right.  For people who are over 75 the increase is 10 per cent.  It is difficult to understand why there should be such inconsistency between the different categories, categories created when there <Col N="139" /> was introduced the concept of exemption up to certain levels.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan has made the point that an increase of just more than 4 per cent represents 6 per cent less than the rate of inflation, and in respect of people who are under 65 whether they be single, married or widowed, this will increase the overall burden on the PAYE sector. What it means in effect is that proportionately more low income earners are now liable for tax than was the case this time last year.  This is a deplorable situation. While our amendment is not over generous, it about strikes the right balance, and I urge the Minister to consider it seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the concerns that have led to Deputies Mac Giolla and O'Kennedy proposing these amendments.  Clearly, it is the wish of all of us that people be relieved to the maximum possible extent from income taxation.  However, I cannot share all of the analysis presented by the two Deputies and by others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have taxation in the first place to allow us as individuals to contribute to financing the needs of the community.  To the extent that we decide what the community needs, it is inevitable that we must make substantial contributions by way of taxation.  Deputy Mitchell referred to this in a very direct way.  It is an inescapable result of our present situation that tax levels are as high as they are.  Deputy O'Kennedy has been making a meal in recent months of the fact that the total take from income taxation will be increased this year.  I am not so sure that the meal is as toothsome as the Deputy seems to think it is.  It is an inevitable consequence of the kind of system we have that if tax rates, bands and all the rest of the paraphernalia remain unchanged and money incomes increase, the total amount of money taken in by the taxation system must increase.  If we had no inflation and did not make any changes in our tax bands or rates but had an increase in money incomes, the total tax take would increase.  It can happen also, and this is the case this year, that <Col N="140" /> the increase in money incomes is more than enough to offset the effects of increased allowances and other changes in the system.  All else being equal, there will be a reduction in the total amount of taxation taken from individuals.  In those circumstances the total amount of revenue from taxation would increase as a direct result of the increase in money incomes.  The total increase in tax revenue would be less if changes were made in the system to relieve taxation at any level.  To be specific, the amount of the increase in tax revenue this year would be larger than what is now projected if we had not increased personal allowances, if we had not increased the exemption limits and if we had not taken the action we have taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The elimination of the 25 per cent rate, contrary to what Deputy O'Kennedy has been pretending since Budget day, combined with the increase in personal allowances, means that at those levels of money incomes less taxation will be paid in 1984-85 than was paid in 1983-84.  Individuals will find that the total amount of tax they pay will be more because of the increases in the total amount of their incomes and because of their proceeding up through the bands.</P>
      <P>There are questions of presentation in the way some of these matters are put, questions which would require of us in this House somewhat more precision than we manage sometimes to achieve. For example, Deputy O'Kennedy said that all but 15,000 of those on lower levels of income are included in the tax system this year.  That is a terminologically loose way of referring to what is meant when we say that 15,000 people have been removed from the tax system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that 15,000 people at the lower levels of income have been removed from the tax net.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is by no means the case that only those 15,000 are excluded from the tax net.  A much larger number of people on lower incomes than Deputy <Col N="141" /> O'Kennedy would seem to suggest, are excluded also by way of the operation of the exemption limits.</P>
      <P>I share Deputy Mitchell's concern that many people may not be aware of the exemption limits, of how they operate and of how the exemption limits on marginal relief operate.  To the extent that we can find more efficient ways of identifying those people and making clear to them what their entitlements are, I am happy to do so.  One way is to have as many people as possible who might be in that position to make tax returns.  All we would need then would be to have their date of birth in order to determine which of the exemption limits would apply.</P>
      <P>I take fully the point that it is wrong that people should be paying tax when the proper application of the system would exempt them from tax or would result in their paying less tax than they are paying.  I do not know in how many cases this situation arises.  I am sure Deputy Mitchell would agree that the cases that come to our attention are the hard cases.  We never hear about those cases in which the system works properly, but the more of those hard cases that we can resolve properly the happier we shall be.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan said that £100 a week is a miserly amount.  As I said, we would all like to relieve the burden of taxation more than we are in a position to do. There is an attraction in the idea of indexing bands and thereby of relieving people of taxation in a fairly substantial way. However, I must make the point that the cost of indexation would be substantial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we talking about indexation or about the exemption limit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a reference in passing to the overall problem.  The overall cost of indexation in 1984 of exemption limits and rate bands would be about £95 million this year and £159 million in a full year.  That puts it in a particular context and it is reasonable to say that if we want indexation there are certain other inescapable consequences which we must accept.  I have no evidence <Col N="142" /> that my colleagues on the other side of the House would accept those consequences because they have made no suggestion to that effect.</P>
      <P>We are taking amendments Nos. 1 to 4 and 9 and 12, as they are the most directly related.  Amendments Nos. 1,3, 9 and 11 were put forward by Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy De Rossa and propose higher increases in the exemption limits than are proposed in the Bill. The cost of implementing those amendments would be £7 million in 1984 and just under £12 million in a full year. Obviously 18,500 taxpayers would benefit from that but we must bear the cost factors in mind.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 2, 4, 10 and 12 are in Deputy O'Kennedy's name and do not go quite as far as those of Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy De Rossa.  Deputy O'Kennedy's amendments would reduce revenue to the Exchequer by about £5.4 million in 1984 and just under £9 million in a full year and would benefit about 13,800 taxpayers.  The Bill already proposes increases in the general exemption limits by £200 in the case of married couples and by £100 in the case of single and widowed persons.  The cost of those changes is £3 million in 1984 and £5 million in a full year which will benefit 9,600 taxpayers.  In the Government's view this is the limit we can do in that respect this year.  As I said when introducing Second Stage, this Bill gives effect to the budgetary policy which I outlined last January and, as I said on that occasion and many times since, the extent to which we can depart from the overall budgetary targets set out in January is very limited.</P>
      <P>In their budget policy the Government have put together the most balanced package which responds in the best way to our needs at present.  I am, therefore, not in a position to make the kind of changes to the revenue side that would be involved in either the amendments of Deputy Mac Giolla or Deputy De Rossa or in those put forward by Deputy O'Kennedy.  I oppose those amendments and propose that we accept the section of the Bill in so far as the matters covered by these amendments are concerned.</P>

If anything we propose either on this or other sections is playing to the gallery then we can go home now.  However, that is not our job and we are going to stay here.  I hope the Minister will be receptive to some amendments.  Of course it does not need to be stated that only those 15,000 people who have been exempted this year will be exempt from taxation.  Of course those on lower incomes than those 15,000 will also be exempt from taxation.  It would be an extraordinary world if others who are already exempt on lower incomes than those about which we are talking were, for some reason or another, to find that they were not now to be exempt.

The answer from them and from me is &mdash;&ldquo;thanks for nothing&rdquo;. We do not really need that kind of clarification or point making in this debate.  The Minister indicated that, if our proposals were adopted, an extra 13,800 people would be exempted which would bring the total exempted this year to 28,800 or thereabouts which is still below what the pattern has been but near enough to the average of exemptions over the years.

      <P>The Minister said that to increase the exemption limit from £2,500 to £2,700 for a single person and from £5,000 to £5,500 for a married person would cost the Exchequer £5.4 million and the Minister cannot afford that. Let us put it in context.  The total tax bill for this year, on the Minister's own forecast, will be £6,125 million.  We must get it in context to see how we can help these 13,800 people who are on very low levels of income.  A figure of £5.4 million out of a total taxation bill of £6,125 million is not even in line with the last four digits. That is the kind of percentage we are <Col N="145" /> talking about to help people on the very lowest level of income who find this a crushing burden.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell made a point about no extra allowances.  He was right because, if they are in the tax band, they do not get exemptions because of the way the allowances come into play.  Those with £8 a week will be taxed at 35 per cent roughly.  We are talking about people at that level of income who will be paying something like £2.50 per week in tax.  For people on that level of income that is a major problem which many of us in this House do not readily appreciate. We meet them once in a while in our clinics and when we go around and hopefully keep in contact with the realities of poverty.  We do not meet this problem in the home.  We do not see the effect of having to pay that kind of sum out of that miserable pittance.  Allowing for the problem any Minister for Finance has in saying: &ldquo;In principle I would like to do it but I cannot afford it&rdquo;, and having regard to the amount involved, which is a pittance in comparison with the total tax take this year, the Minister should realise, as his predecessors did, the need to keep the exemption limits in line with inflation. Then those who are least able to afford to pay this tax would not be brought into a tax system which is already ridiculously overburdened.</P>
      <P>How much public time, complicated procedures, inquiries and money will be wasted in trying to extract money from people like this?  We all know the tax system is creaking at the edges.  Apparently it is creaking to the point where it is ready to collapse.  We have to get consultants in to advise us as to how it should operate.</P>

      <P>Our proposal is intended to keep this taxation in line with inflation and to protect people on the very lowest level of incomes, apart from those already exempted.  We are talking about people with incomes of between £96 and £103 per week.  We want to take them out of the tax net.  Having regard to the tax bill of £6,125 million, surely that is reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not be making any lengthy contribution on the additional age exemptions because the case I have made is sufficient to sustain the arguments in that <Col N="147" /> regard.  We have adjusted them marginally in our proposals to acknowledge the principle that people over 65 and 75 years of age are entitled to extra exemptions. If the Minister does not adjust the base we are now dealing with, the adjustment for those over 65 and 75 years of age will not be very effective.  I want to ask the Minister &mdash; although Deputy Mitchell tells me there is no point in asking him; I do not know why &mdash; to adopt our reasonable amendments which would not open the floodgates of exemptions for people who can afford to pay tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief.  I want to make a few general remarks.  Deputy Mitchell made the point that if we are serious in this debate we must either increase the take from income tax or reduce public expenditure, that there is no other way, his actual words.  It was a rather foolish remark to which I would not have adverted but for the fact that the Minister endorsed it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Increase income tax or reduce public expenditure, there is no other way, the words he used.  There are other ways apart from increasing income tax.  There are many forms of taxation. At all times when I suggested reductions in tax I never suggested in this House or anywhere else a reduction in the total tax take.  Deputy Mitchell and the Minister will be aware of that.  Apart from reductions in expenditure to ensure the efficient running of the State machine I have objected to reductions in public expenditure because of the iniquitous tax system. The Minister said that increasing the exemption limits would reduce his take by £7 million this year and £12 million in a full year and that he has to look at our amendments in the context of the total amount of money available to him. As in all other cases I could suggest other ways in which he could make up his £7 million this year and his £12 million in a full year.  A simple way would be a reduction in the threshold of the capital <Col N="148" /> acquisitions tax.  About £13 million is taken in on it and that could be doubled quite easily with less inequity than keeping the exemption limits at a lower increase than the increase in the level of inflation.  The effect of that is to bring people who were not and should not be in the tax net into it.  If there is not an increase at least in line with the level of inflation people who should not be in the tax net will be brought in.</P>
      <P>The question at issue in this case is one of equity in taxation.  I wholeheartedly agree with the many points made by Deputy O'Kennedy about the lack of equity in bringing people with a low level of income into the tax net.  I should like to ask the Minister to have another look at the exemption limits from the point of view of tax equity and the growing poverty here.  He should consider the serious effect inflation has on the lower income groups compared to higher income groups.  It is easy to say what the general level of inflation is but even if it is 5 per cent it is more serious on lower income groups because they spend all their income on essentials, such as food and rent.  A high level of inflation affects them more than those in the higher income groups.  If there is to be equity the minimum increase will have to be about 10 per cent.  The minimum the Minister should bring in is about £5,280.  In other words, he is at least £250 short of the necessary amount to keep those who are outside the tax net in that position.  I urge the Minister to have another look at this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take up the points made by Deputies O'Kennedy and Mac Giolla.  As I said at the outset, we all wish we could raise the exemption limit higher than it is.  For Deputy O'Kennedy to put the discussion in the context of total tax income is a very useful ploy when one talks about £5 million or £7 million in the context of just over £6 billion.  Of course it is not a large amount, it is a very small fraction of the total, but when we put it in the context of £1.9 billion it begins to look rather bigger. Deputy O'Kennedy changes the basis of comparison in order to get the effects he wants.  That is an argument of presentation <Col N="149" /> and I would not quibble too much with the Deputy for making the argument in that way.  However, if he looks at the actual sums of money I believe Deputy O'Kennedy will agree that the raising of £4 million, £5 million or £7 million, relatively small amounts in the context of total tax revenue, by increasing taxation in some other area is a far more difficult job than would be suggested by the proportion between £4 million, £5 million or £7 million and £2 billion or the proportion between any one of those figures and £6 billion.  That is the way we will have to look at this.  There is no way out of saying at this point that if we were to reduce the tax take by an amount of this order in any one area we would have to find a way either of increasing the tax take from another area or reduce expenditure.  I am not prepared to take the kind of action that would change the overall budgetary arithmetic in that way and, therefore, I cannot respond to the type of amendments that have been put forward.</P>
      <P>As far as the position of people concerned goes, I must point out to Deputy O'Kennedy that perhaps he has not allowed for all of the factors.  Of course any person whose income is below the exemption limit does not pay the tax.  For people whose income does not exceed the exemption limit by a large amount we operate the system of marginal relief. Within a certain band there is a choice and we pick deliberately a choice which reduces the tax liability so that if the application of the tax system strictly would result in a given figure and the operation of marginal relief would result in a smaller figure it is the smaller figure which applies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell's point is still correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy was worried about the effect of all this on the administration of the tax system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the least of my worries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>What is happening is that <Col N="150" /> people are going out of the system to that extent.  I would wish, as Deputy O'Kennedy does, that there were more. I use those words in their strict sense.  I know that a few little words have been bandied around in the last 24 hours in a particular way.  I wish that a larger number of people could go out of the tax system because of this and other measures which we might readily enough agree on were we to agree on the consequences. No time is spent extracting money from these people once they are out of the system.</P>
      <P>The operation of the system with exemption limits and, indeed, with the system of marginal relief, is not a vastly complicated part of the system.  I do not think the Deputy need worry that the simple operation of that represents a major burden.  There is no doubt that if we had a smaller number of taxpayers in the system it would be easier to organise. However, we have to strike the balance between the total revenue and the total expenditure which that revenue is to support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy asked me to accept his amendment.  I wish we could go a lot further than the provision I have in the Bill, which represents the limit of the change I can make this year.  Deputy Mac Giolla usefully pointed out that he has never suggested an overall reduction in the tax take.  That simple statement shows a very big difference in approach to these matters between Deputy Mac Giolla, myself and Deputy O'Kennedy. We have not reduced the tax take this year and that is an argument for a different day.  We should aim in the direction of reducing the total tax take.  I am not referring to the distribution but to the total tax take, the three Ts as they may be called.  That has been an important factor which has a substantial influence on the level of activity here and on the way people react to their own participation in the economy.  I should like to ask Deputy Mac Giolla to rethink a little in those terms because it is not until we have in this House for a beginning the kind of consensus that is needed in order to put ourselves in a position where we can make progress in stimulating the <Col N="151" /> economy from our own efforts internally in a real way.</P>
    <P>For the clarity of Deputies I should like to give Deputy O'Kennedy, and the House, a breakdown of the numbers of people affected by the proposal in the Bill and their distribution over the different categories.  The increase in the general exemption limit will exempt 5,000 married persons, 4,500 single persons and 100 widowed persons, a total of 9,600, under my proposals.  The change in the limit applying to people between the ages of 65 and 75 years would bring 2,500 married people, 800 single people and 900 widowed people, a total of 4,200, out of tax.  The change in the limits in respect of people older than 75 years would take out 300 married persons, 300 single people and 600 widowed persons. In other words, under my proposals, 15,000 persons are being taken out.</P>

      <P>The Minister said the income tax take will be up.  According to my sums the increase in the tax take compared with last year will be 18 per cent to 20 per cent.  On the other hand, the Minister said the tax burden on the people will not be increased.  He was speaking about the money incomes of people.  People's incomes will not increase by anything like 18 per cent to 20 per cent this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  It is people now paying tax moving up through the bands. <Col N="152" /> This is a normal result of our system.  If a taxpayer is at the top of a band and his income increases by, say, 10 per cent, his tax bill will increase faster because he will move into a new rate band.  That is why the tax take, depending on what happens to allowances, tends to increase faster than incomes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Total income tax revenue last year was £1,664 million, and the forecast for this year is £1,952 million, an increase of 18 per cent or 19 per cent.  No amount of inflation would account for a figure like that.  I agree that taxation has reached such a growth rate that it is killing incentive and creating divisions among different sectors of the community. The income tax take this year has increased considerably.  We can only deal with the thing generally, and it is for that reason that I have proposed, in particular, that the people at the lower end of the scale, those on the miserable wages of between £96 and £103 per week for a married couple, be taken out of the tax net.  I am not seriously worried that the presence of such people in the tax net simplifies our complex tax system.  My concern is that they have no place in the tax system.  What I am concerned about is the impact a tax bill has on such people, about 13,000 of them who are paying tax That is why I am asking the Minister to accept our amendment.  We must try to get ourselves into the homes of such people and see the impact of even a small tax bill on them.  The Minister should adjust for inflation in their case, and if he does not I will have to press this.</P>

      <P>This is an amendment to increase the amount mentioned in the Finance Act, 1982, from which the £5,000 figure dates and has not been altered since, although there have been considerable alterations since 1982 both in tax and inflation.

      <P>I am discussing amendments Nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8.  In amendment No. 6 we would like to see the Minister's figure of £6,600 increased to £6,700.  The Minister's figure of £6,600 replaces the figure of £6,000 mentioned in the Finance Act, 1982, which in turn amended the Finance Act, 1980.  We are proposing that the figure of £6,600 be increased to £6,700 because the increase given by the Minister is not sufficient to cover the changes in the cost of living and so on which have taken place since.  In amendments Nos. 5 and 6 we propose that the Minister's figure be increased by a further £100 and in amendment No. 7 we propose that the figure of £2,800 be increased to £2,850.  In amendment No. 8 we propose that the figure of £3,300 be increased to £3,350, an increase of £50 in each case.</P>

      <P>We are speaking now about amendments Nos. 5, 7, 13 and 15. The amendments which we are proposing are exactly the same as those proposed in this case by Deputy Mac Giolla.  The increases being proposed here are very marginal &mdash; an increase of £50 for a single person and of £100 for a married person over and above the Minister's proposals in respect of people who have additional exemptions because of being over 65 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that we did not raise these matters last year.  As Deputy Mac Giolla has mentioned, we are trying to adjust upwards over a two-year period.  Last year we acknowledged the then difficulties and that because of the adjustment in the general tax allowance we did not then contest the matters.  Deputy Mac Giolla has pointed out that the Minister's adjustments are here more in line with actual inflation than at the lower level. The Minister should consider the extra hardship for people over 65 and 75 years, <Col N="157" /> very few being involved.  Could he say precisely, if our amendments were adopted, how many people would benefit? Secondly what would be the cost to revenue of adopting the amendments, now that the other have been defeated? How much are we speaking about in terms of cost to the revenue to give this extra minimum relief to these old people?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The exemption limits were first introduced in 1980 at a level of £1,700 for single persons and £3,400 for married couples.  Those were the general limits. The age exemption limits were £2,000 and £4,000 for single persons and married couples respectively between 65 and 75, and £2,500 and £5,000 for single persons and married couples over 75.</P>
      <P>In 1981 all exemption limits were raised by £300 for single persons and £600 for married couples.  In the Finance Act 1982, they were again raised by £200 for single persons and £400 for married couples.  In 1983 we were able to increase only the general exemption limits by £200 for single persons and £400 for married couples.  The additional increase which I am proposing this year in the age exemption limits would catch up and match the increases made in the general exemption limits of last year.  It is for that reason that I am now proposing in the Bill that we increase the age exemption limits of people between 65 and 75 by £300 for single people and £600 for married couples.  These increases and the associated marginal relief would cost about £0.9 million this year and £1½ million for a full year and would, as I mentioned earlier, work to the benefit of 4,200 people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional cost of the amendments as proposed here would be about £120,000 in the current year and £200,000 in a full year and would benefit some 300 taxpayers &mdash; that is as far as the married people are concerned.  There would, in addition, be a further cost of £60,000 in 1984 and £100,000 in a full year for some 150 single and widowed persons.  I think that is the information which the Deputy requested.  There would be a total of 450 altogether &mdash; 200 married persons and <Col N="158" /> another 150 single and widowed.  The total cost, taking the two together, would be £180,000 in 1984 and £300,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Bill proposes increases in the age exemption limits for these groups this year to catch up with and compensate for the fact that we were not in a position last year to increase the age exemption limits but were in a position to increase the general exemption limits.  What we have done is restored relativity between the general exemption limits and this group in the age exemption limits this year.</P>
    <P>I have every sympathy with the more generous approach being put forward by Deputies O'Kennedy and Mac Giolla on these matters.  As I have said in this and other cases in relation to allowances and exemptions, I would wish to be in a position to make further moves.  We all have the same objective and all feel the same way about people at these low levels of income.  However, I do not find myself in a position where I can depart from the lines set out in the budget statement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if I can add anything to those figures.  We are talking about exemptions which were not adjusted at all last year.  Deputy O'Dea was perhaps a little generous initially in saying that the adjustments on the age exemptions were more generous than they were on the normal exemptions, for the simple fact that the age exemptions <Col N="159" /> were not adjusted at all last year.  Taking account of the present adjustment for people between 65 and 75 and those over 75, they are nowhere near being in line with inflation in the two years but I am not going to go into that matter.  The fact that they more or less line up with the general level of increases of exemptions for other categories is not a very persuasive argument.</P>
      <P>We are now talking about buttons, in terms of the proportion of total tax.  I know that it is difficult for a Minister who has come to a conclusion and proposed a figure for any exemption subsequently to hear an argument from those in opposition for increasing that exemption. There is always the possibility that no matter what figure is fixed, the Opposition will want it raised.  However, one must acknowledge that the amendments being proposed by Deputy Mac Giolla and myself are, to say the least of it, restrained.  We are talking about a £50 increase for a single person and £100 for a married couple.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these proposals we are not proposing a huge charge on the revenue.  We are talking, for this year, about £180,000 and for a full year £300,000 to include all categories &mdash; married, widowed or single. We are talking about an extra 450 people for whom this would be some measure of relief at a stage of life when they need it most and would not have to worry about tax.  They probably have enough worries without that.  I do not want to milk the sympathy for old people but would have thought this to be a case where nothing would be lost to revenue.  The Minister's fundamental obligations, as he may see them and as we acknowledge on occasions to maintain a balance of responsibility between public expenditure and revenue, will not be in any way distorted and for once all parties in the House could agree enthusiastically that we are not being generous to these old people in these amendments.  Far from it, we will not be catching up with the position of two years ago.  Ideally we should go much further.  We did not do it at all last year; we are proposing it this year.  I hope that the Minister, for the sake of the £180,000 <Col N="160" /> that he will lose in a full year, will adopt this.  What more can I say?  At least 450 people who are old and also very badly off would have a little more security and comfort and a little less worry and anxiety. If we can give so much to these people it would be some small contribution from us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have to say is really the same thing but I want to ask the Minister emphatically if he is satisfied that he has adjusted for two years here. Inflation last year was well over 12 per cent and at the moment it is running at about 10 per cent.  Taking an average of 10 per cent over the two years, we would need to bring it up to the £6,000 mark to adjust fully for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The average for the two years was much more than 10 per cent.  The Deputy is talking about nearly 25 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>It might have been 17 per cent in 1982, so that £5,000 at this stage on those grounds should be coming up to nearly £6,000.  Does the Minister feel that he has made adequate adjustment for this?  In these cases of people over 65 the small amount of money involved as far as the Minister is concerned could mean a very big difference to 450 people, which is a considerable number of elderly people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking Deputy Mac Giolla's last point first, as I explained at the beginning, my intention in the case of the age exemption limits was to catch up and to compensate for the fact that last year we were not in a position to increase the age exemption limits.  Of course, people in those categories got the increase in the general exemption limit last year but we were not able to make a specific addition for the age exemption limits.  What I am proposing in the Bill will, first of all, bring into the age exemption limits the increase in the general limits that we have this year and, secondly, compensate for the fact that there was no increase, in a relative sense, in the age exemption limits last year.  Therefore, the <Col N="161" /> effect of the operation could be, in a sense, to restore the relationship that was there between the age exemption limits and the general exemption limits in 1982. Deputy O'Kennedy has asked, quite properly, for information on the extra cost of making the amendment which is under discussion at the moment and I have said that it would be £180,000 in this year.  The cost in respect of those in the other age exemption limit group, those over 75 years, would not be enormous in absolute terms either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>However, the total cost of the increases in the general exemption limits and age exemption limits as included in the Bill and the associated marginal relief would be £4.3 million in 1984 and would be just over £7 million in a full year.  Therefore, it is not quite complete &mdash; let me put it that way &mdash; to present the argument in the way Deputy O'Kennedy has.  Of course, I have a great deal of sympathy with the view he is taking on it but already in what we have provided in the Bill, which brings a substantial increase in each of these exemption limits for the current tax year, the cost in the current year will be £4.3 million which is a substantial and fair proportion of the total amount available this year for allocation by way of extra tax reliefs.  That being the case, I consider that what we have in the Bill, taking account of the factors I have mentioned, represents in this year's circumstances a reasonable effort at making a concession to these people who, I recognise, are in a difficult position, particularly people in the older age groups.  We would all agree that we would prefer to see such people not having to deal with the complexities of income tax, but the total of what is in the Bill when we take it all together represents in the circumstances of this year a reasonable effort to deal with their problem and the allocation of a reasonable and very fair proportion of the total available for tax reliefs this year to those people affected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the Minister <Col N="162" /> on his own authority in matters of such little impact in terms of total revenue can come to a decision as he sits there now.  He does not need to go back to his Government or to consult with his officials. If one accepts anything, obviously one is changing what one proposes.  If the Minister is in a position to do that and accept what we are proposing, it must be recorded that for the sake of £180,000 this year in total taxation we are not prepared to bring these age exemption limits for these 450 people anywhere near in line with what it would have been had we adjusted for inflation over two years. Even our proposals do not do that, as Deputy Mac Giolla should recognise. Our proposals do not go anywhere near keeping pace with inflation over two years.  A Minister is, of course, constrained coming into this House in terms of what amendments he can adopt here or there.  He must answer to the Government, to officials and even to parliamentary draftsmen, but this is one occasion when a Minister who has authority can act on his own and go back to his Government, his officials, the Secretary of his Department and the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and say that he has decided because of £180,000 to help 450 old people and to ensure that they will not be burdened with taxation.  The Minister does not see that he is in a position to do that, and I regret it.  I am afraid we must just press the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>We are speaking about increasing the exemption limit from £5,600 to £5,700 in amendment No. 5.  Therefore, we are talking about an increase of £100 for a married couple. This exemption operates to the effect that if you go over the exemption limit you then automatically revert to your ordinary allowances, with the exception that the maximum amount of tax you must pay is 60 per cent of the difference between your income and the exemption figure.  In other words, if your income was £6,000 and the exemption figure was £5,600, the difference is £400 and 60 per cent of that is £240.  That would be the maximum amount of tax you would have to pay.  If you compute your tax liability <Col N="163" /> on your ordinary allowances, if the amount you arrive at is in excess of £420 your limit is restricted to the £420.</P>

      <P>I mention this because the difference between £5,600 and £5,700 is £100 and 60 per cent of that is £60.  That divided between a married couple is £30 each and that works out at something like 75p a week.  Deputy O'Kennedy is not really being as magnanimous as he appears to be, and I do not know how the Minister arrives at the figure of £180,000.  We are talking of something in the region of 70p or 75p per person between the ages of 65 and 75. That is all we are talking about here.  It is important that it be put in context.</P>

But I am talking about the total of the provision that is made in the Bill.

Of the total amount available for relief this year &mdash; which I readily grant was fairly restrictive &mdash; we have allocated what I regard as a fair and reasonable amount to the people who are covered by the exemption limits.  This year we have compensated for the fact that we were not in a position last year to give increases in the age exemption limits. Personally I am not all that happy that we should not have gone any further but, of course, there are other considerations in these matters.</P>

It includes a figure for the loss of revenue by having a number of people left out of the tax system. It includes also a cost element because of the fact that there is an additional span in marginal relief at this point.</P>

      <P>In page 9, line 25, to delete &ldquo;£6,600&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£6,700&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The argument for this amendment is similar to that advanced in the case of the previous one where the Minister is raising the limit for either spouse of 75 years or over from £6,000 to £6,600.  We propose that that figure be £6,700.  This is an area in which no adjustment was made in 1982 unlike earlier amendments where an adjustment had been made in 1983.  In this case, as in the last one, no adjustment had been made in the Finance Bills since 1982.  Therefore, we are speaking of adjustments for two years, 1982 and 1983 and again for 1983 to 1984, to endeavour to maintain these people at or as near as possible to the same level as they were at in 1982.  In fact their standard of living is deteriorating.  Our amendment is an effort to assist them without over-burdening the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is in a position to accept any adjustments to this Finance Bill, here is an area in which he can do so with very little difficulty, with very little adjustment being made to his budget because of the small amount of money and the proportion of elderly people involved.  It is a substantial number of elderly people whose standards of living are being affected annually, more than those of younger people, because of the increases in the cost of living.  Like the last amendment, this would entail a very small adjustment of the Minister's figures in an endeavour to assist people over the age of 75.</P>

Indeed it is nice to see Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy O'Kennedy ploughing the same furrow in this, in a matter on which I can agree with them.  The proposals I have made would allocate an <Col N="167" /> extra £900,000 tax relief in 1984 to people over 75 and an extra £1.5 million in a full year.  Taking all the exemption limit proposals in the Bill, we are allocating £4.3 million this year to the people who benefit from these exemption limits.  We are catching up this year and compensating for the fact that we were not able to increase the exemption limits last year.  It seems to be a reasonable and fair proportion of the total allocation available for tax relief to people in those groups. I would wish that the total were bigger but it is not and I have struck a balance between people who benefit from exemption limits and the age exemption limits which seems fair and reasonable and takes account of the situation of those people.  I will not accept that the argument hinges around £60,000 or £120,000, although I am bound to say that there could be occasions when the Deputy might reflect that if you look after the pennies the pounds will look after themselves and if you do not look after the pennies then you are in trouble with the pounds.</P>

      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with what the Deputy is saying and I might even go as far as to agree that almost anybody over 75 years of age should be relieved of the burden of paying tax, although I can think immediately of several cases where it would not be justified.  There is a big difference between that and what the Deputy is proposing.  We are talking about exemption <Col N="168" /> limits and age exemption limits. Happily we have numbers of people aged over 75 whose incomes are substantially above the limits where this becomes a factor.  Whether we take my proposals or the Deputy's amendment, we are not talking about relieving people over 75 years of the anxiety of filling in tax forms.</P>

      <P>The Minister's proposal is to allow married persons over 75 years £132 a week without paying tax. Deputy O'Kennedy's proposals is to make that figure £134 a week.  That is what this argument has been about &mdash; £2 a week.  The Minister is being a little ungenerous in not even splitting the difference and getting the matter out of the way.  We will not get to the root of the problems facing this country if we spend so much time on the taxation of £2 a week.  It angers me somewhat that we cannot be generous in a small area like this and get on to our main business.  We are talking about people over 75 years of age who have probably worked for 40 years and paid an average of £2,000 or £3,000 taxation per annum at today's prices, the guts of £200,000 throughout a career.  It is an insult to people who have paid up to £200,000 taxation throughout their lives that we are fighting about whether we should give them tax exemption of £132 or £134 a week.  Perhaps the Minister would agree to the amendment so that we can get on with the business of the Finance Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we are dealing with the whole basis of our tax band system, the level of taxation and the total take of income tax. Our proposals are obviously intended to alleviate the total burden of taxation and minimise the divisive and disincentive effects of income taxation.  I will give some global figures as to the level of increase in income tax in recent years and some comparisons with the position in other countries.  I will focus on the consequences of the unprecedented and historically high level of taxation here.  We have proposed these amendments to <Col N="170" /> bring the tax bands somewhat more into line with inflation but also to ensure that the impact of the increasing burden of taxation will not kill the very spirit of enterprise that is at a very low ebb in the country at the moment.  I started with 1980 because it is the year that I had some particular involvement in.  In 1979 the total income tax collected here was £732 million.  Five years later it is moving close to three times that amount at just short of £2,000,000,000.  The figure is £1,952 million.  It has increased by a sum which far outstrips any other experience we have had even in public expenditure and is way out of line with what has happened elsewhere in the democratic world.</P>
    <P>Let us put it in another context.  In 1979 income tax as a percentage of our total GNP &mdash; it is important to express in the round as well as percentages &mdash; represented 16.9 per cent.  It was 18 per cent in 1980 and this year, on the forecasts and on the tax bands the Minister is proposing, it will represent 23.1 per cent of our GNP.  That is an enormous increase. In real terms, measured against any standard you want to apply in this country or elsewhere, an increase in the tax take from this economy from 16.9 per cent five years ago to 23.1 per cent now is a huge increase.  The total taxes in 1979 were only a little more than what the Minister is proposing to get from income tax this year.  In 1979 our total taxes were £2,317 million.  I know money values were different but it gives some indication of what is happening in our economy.  That figure is not much in excess of £1,952 million now.  That is the first point which needs to be got across when we look at the tax bands we are now proposing to somehow give relief to taxpayers who find they are being so burdened that the incentive which is required in our economy is being killed, and the divisiveness which has emerged is also a very negative fact.</P>
    <P>The second point I would like to make is that while that is the reality in this country we should look at the reality in other countries.  The Minister for Finance is the one person who has, more than any other Minister in my experience, focused on one issue as being the main avenue for <Col N="171" /> us coming out of the recession, which most other countries have already come out of, the magic term &ldquo;competitiveness&rdquo;. I have heard it repeated even in the debate on the Planning Board when he and a colleague of his engaged each other in debate on an RTE programme recently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take a look at <Col N="172" /> competitveness.  Our nearest competitor and our nearest customer is the UK. What do we find the situation is there by comparison with the tax bands we have here?  We find that a person earning up to £15,400 pays tax at the rate of 30 per cent.  When a person exceeds £12,000 here one is already at the highest rate of tax, 65 per cent, a band which does not exist in the UK.  A person can earn well over £3,000 more &mdash; that is sterling and you have to adjust up so that we are talking about well over £5,000 extra &mdash; in Britain than here and he will pay at the lowest rate of tax at 30 per cent whereas over here, in the country where we are always being told we should be more competitive, such a person will pay at the highest rate of tax of 65 per cent.  When you go down through the scale you find that when a person's earnings get up to £18,200 sterling, which is the equivalent of £22,000 here he pays income tax at 40 per cent.  Here he has long since entered the 65 per cent tax bracket.  At £23,100 he comes into a tax band of 45 per cent. That figure represents about £26,000 here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>50 per cent comes up next up to £30,600 sterling.  It is 55 per cent up to £38,000 sterling.  We have to add the increases all the time in Irish terms.  When you get to the final one you find that those who are really classified as capable of paying at the rate of surtax, which in the UK is 60 per cent, have to earn in excess of £38,000 sterling, which is equivalent to between £44,000 and £45,000 in Irish terms.  We now get some measure of comparison between tax burden here and that in other countries with whom we are being asked to compete and the consequence this has for workers who are understandably saying: &ldquo;We hear these sermons about competitiveness but we are anxious to know at the end how we will compete with people <Col N="173" /> who have much more in their pockets than we have&rdquo;.  It is no surprise that, because of the crushing burden of taxation, which is understating it, maybe they make demands in what are sometimes seen to be unreasonable terms that the economy cannot afford.</P>
      <P>There are other comparisons that can be made.  There are other countries with whom we compete but who are also customers of ours.  It will surprise the Minister to know, having regard to the increase we have seen particularly in the final couple of years, that in the USA the level of income taxation as a percentage of GNP has stayed constant for about 20 years at something of the order of 22 per cent.  Is it any wonder that over there there is a spirit of enterprise and initiative that people, whether they are employers or employees, are actually conscious of the fact that they are in an economy in a country where if you work and try to succeed you will not be penalised for it and the levels will stay the same in real terms for 20 years?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister comes back every time to public expenditure.  I appreciate that but if we look at what has happened here in the last two years the disincentive effect of what the Minister has done in some instances by increasing tax rates is to bring about a lesser return than would be the case if the rates had been left as they were.  The tax rates are being increased at every level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 25 per cent band no longer exists. Some of those people we were talking about this morning and who would otherwise have been exempt are now in the 35 per cent band.  The reality is that by comparison with any other country to which we hope to sell our products or with which we wish to compete, the tax burden here is crushing, not only in financial terms but in destroying the very spirit of enterprise and initiative we need.  Worse, it is causing divisions between the various sections of the community.  Deputy Mac <Col N="174" /> Giolla has dealt with some elements of that situation.  There is the view that because of the level of PAYE taxation those taxpayers who comprise a considerable portion of all this are paying for everything while the remainder are not paying for anything.  The Minister, unwittingly no doubt, contributed to the division last year when he gave inaccurate figures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>When he was asked the amount of outstanding tax he gave a figure on the basis of assessment.  This caused all kinds of reactions among the PAYE sector.  When you were asked about PAYE tax you did not indicate what proportion of PAYE is paid by the self employed and by those in what are known as close or family companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Minister to tell us today what proportion of PAYE tax is paid by the self-employed and by those in close companies.  It is important to have the figure on record so that we know exactly how much is paid by the employee and how much is paid by those who are described generally as self-employed but who are also in the PAYE system.  Whichever proportion we are talking of at least we are clear on one fact, that is, that all of those people are now contributing at a level of taxation which has increased enormously in recent years to 23.1 per cent of GNP.  That is in terms of income taxation.  It has gone beyond the point at which there is any encouragement for incentive on the part either of employer or of employee.  The reality points totally the other way.  If one inquires from any potential businessman as to why he is not expanding, he will reply in perhaps most unparliamentary terms that it is not worthwhile expanding. The climate is such that effort, initiative and investment are not being rewarded, that in fact they are being penalised.  If we ask an employee why he is not interested in doing extra work his reply will <Col N="175" /> be similar because for every extra £2 he earns, especially if his income is more than the £12,000 level, he will pay 65 per cent tax.  In other words, that level of income puts him into the bracket of being a very wealthy man.  We wonder then about the growth area of our economy. It is no harm to return to the question of the black economy.  The reason we have a black economy is because of these levels of taxation which the Minister is increasing this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody other than Deputy Skelly seems to acknowledge that taxation is at least the major, if not the exclusive, factor in the growth of the black economy.  We heard recently about black holes and about suction pipes that take revenue out of the economy, but there is a leakage in every economy to the extent that there is some element of the black economy in it and the growth of it in this economy by comparison with the decrease in the level of normal economic activity is a cause for concern. Obviously, one of the reasons for this state of affairs is the level of taxation and of income taxation in particular.  For that reason our proposals address this basic issue.  They do so, first, on the basis of restoring the 25 per cent tax band.  If one is above the exemption levels one goes into the tax net now at 35 per cent whereas his counterpart in Britain pays <Col N="176" /> at only 30 per cent up to an income of ST£15,400.  The situation here is that if one is earning more than £5,000 he will be paying at 35 per cent.  Surely these are the sort of disparities and anomalies the Minister would need to correct.  They underline the basic cause of the lack of competitiveness.</P>
      <P>One must always give practical examples in order to translate the effect of figures.  On that basis let us ask what the impact will be in a fairly representative case.  Let us take the position of a married man with two children.  If, in 1981-82 he was earning £100, and assuming normal allowances, he was liable for tax at £13.21.  If he was earning £150 then, he was liable for tax at £30.70 and if he was earning £200, his tax would have been £48.21.  What is significant is that in each case the person concerned would have been comfortably within the 35 per cent tax band at that time.</P>
      <P>If we adjust for inflation and take 47 per cent as the overall figure in that regard, in the past three years we find that the person who was earning £100 in 1981-82 would be earning £147 this year and would be liable for tax of £19.41 while the person who had been earning £150 then would now be earning £220 and would be liable for tax at £45.14 while the one who was earning £200 would now be earning £284 and would be paying £70.87 taxation.  No longer would the person earning up to £200 be comfortably within the 35 per cent tax band.  He has now gone into the higher tax band, he is at the top of the 45 per cent band and he will soon be paying the most penal level of 60 per cent.  That applies to someone who was on the lowest level of tax two or three years ago.  Take home pay is worth one penny more and when people get their tax allowances for this year they will appreciate that the economy needs zip, incentive, enterprising spirit, investment and competitiveness.  The Revenue Commissioners would also stand to gain a little more from increased investment, buoyancy in activity and proper guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1957 there were dramatic changes when people realised that they no longer had to emigrate and even the Taoiseach <Col N="177" /> acknowledged that.  People were told that if they worked they would be rewarded. A member of the Planning Board said recently that if the Government got off a certain part of their anatomy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister remembers what they said.  People want to work but the level of taxation makes it impossible. The Government are going to regulate and control tax contributions and to seal every loophole.  They see the role of Government as one of prevention and obstruction and will not try to create a climate in which people will work for themselves.  The Minister for Finance is on everybody's mind, he is the one person on whom we all have to focus because he decides what the tax levels will be.  Is it any wonder that the workers, businessmen and entrepreneurs do not get off that part of the anatomy which they were advised to do and are sitting exactly where they are?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what experience the Minister for Finance has of normal business life or of the impact of taxation as a disincentive to those who work and those in business but I suspect he has very little from the approach he has adopted, especially with regard to income tax.  Perhaps Deputy Mitchell is right when he said we should have stayed at home but, in a vain effort to bring some sense into it, we are proposing that the tax bands should be adjusted to restore the 25 per cent band and to get rid of the 65 per cent nonsense.  I know Deputy Mac Giolla will not agree with me but he must realise that he cannot get any more money from that source.  Many of those people will invest elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have an unemployment problem but it would be worse except for emigration which we thought we were rid of. People are leaving every parish in the country and the figures will eventually prove it.  We used to pride ourselves on attracting investment from other countries. <Col N="178" /> We talked about the outlets to Europe, competitiveness and the skilled labour force and we attracted investment. The Minister must know that we are now driving investment out&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Skelly agrees with me and he is a businessman.  It is good to see our established companies branching into international commerce but, unfortunately, their level of investment is very much higher outside the country.  The big construction companies are investing five times as much outside the country as in it.  Some businessmen have told me, not on the basis of political point scoring, that they are investing on a ratio of five to one outside the country to maintain skeleton activity at home. Can the Minister and the Government not see the signs or are they merely concerned with tax?  The role of Government should be broader and more important than that.  They should create a climate in which those who are not in Government will ensure that we succeed.</P>
      <P>The other view of the role of Government is that they are going to regulate, control, squeeze and seal off loopholes in every direction.  This is a role to which I do not subscribe although the Government seem to.  In view of the comparisons I made I hope that the Minister will agree to adopt our proposals.  I know the figures will be of more consequence than the figures we mentioned with regard to exemption.  I am convinced that the return to the Revenue Commissioners would be very much more significant if we took down the old signposts to the cul-de-sacs and put up new ones pointing forward.  There is a challenge to be met and I am sure many people will respond.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy dutifully raised the issues which are his responsibility and it is appropriate that we should discuss them.  I am sure the Minister is also concerned at the rates of <Col N="179" /> income tax and the disincentive they cause.  We cannot get away from the fact that we will either have to find another source of revenue or cut public spending if we are substantially to improve those bands.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy quoted levels of taxation in the United Kingdom and said that one would have to have over £38,000 taxable income before paying the 60 per cent rate of tax.  I do not think it is relevant to say whether it is in sterling or punts.  It is only relevant where sterling earned in the United Kingdom is spent here.  This goes to the kernel of the need for income tax reform.  In the long-term we cannot sustain a level of taxation where a single person goes on the 65 per cent tax rate on £8,000 of taxable income. The sooner we tackle that specific problem the better.  It is not long since we had tax marches.  Perhaps to some extent they were sparked off by misinformation about outstanding taxation.  It would take very little to cause justifiable dissatisfaction.</P>
      <P>On the last section we spoke about tax exemptions and about our aged citizens. We are all disposed to improve their lot as best we can.  In the United Kingdom they have not got the facilities we have here for senior citizens: free electricity, free travel, free television licences and free telephone rental.  We should maintain and improve those benefits.  If the Minister is to improve the tax bands he will have to cut other areas of public expenditure substantially.  As soon as he attempts to do that, there will be an outcry from the same Deputies who are now crying out against the tax bands.  We will have to deal with this problem sooner or later, and it might as well be sooner rather than later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only way to do that is for the Minister at a later stage in the year to bring in legislation to cut public expenditure substantially and simultaneously to widen the tax bands.  The Opposition cannot have it both ways.  That is the only way it can be done.  It is necessary in the interests of the income tax payer and the PAYE worker and also in the national interest.  Income from VAT and areas <Col N="180" /> like that would probably ensure that we were a little better off.  The Minister should consider that seriously.  It is time we stopped managing the affairs of the country.  We have the responsibility to govern.</P>
    <P>By November of this year we will be heading towards the half way mark in the Government's term of office.  I believe we can do something about the tax bands and give people an incentive to work. There is no incentive to work with the present tax bands.  The only way to reduce the tax bands is by cutting public expenditure.  It is possible, desirable and feasible to reduce the tax bands and cut public expenditure and it is just a matter of having the courage to do it.  If we do not, next year we will still have the same outrageously high tax bands which are a total disincentive to work.</P>
    <P>On the range of taxation Deputy O'Kennedy confined his remarks to comparing us with Britain.  I do not think he compared us with Britain on the spending side very fairly.  His sterling comments were not really relevant.  The range of taxes here is similar to the range of taxes in Britain.  The problem is on the spending side and, unless we have the courage to tackle that, we will not make any significant advance under this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with amendments Nos. 17, 18, 21 and 22.  I will be moving amendment No. 22.  Our amendments Nos. 20 and 23 were ruled out of order.  On the issue of the tax bands I approve of a good deal of what was said not only by Deputy O'Kennedy but also by Deputy Mitchell on the need for adjustments in PAYE taxes from the bottom to the top.  I do not agree with Deputy Mitchell's means for doing so. There are many other forms of taxation to compensate for a cut in the PAYE take and a reduction in the take from the tax bands.  A land tax is an obvious one which everyone expected to appear in this budget and which would bring in around £80 million without any great imposition on the farming community.  It must also be said that consistently in the budgets over the past decade there has been a reduction in the take from capital <Col N="181" /> taxation &mdash; it is down to 4 per cent this year, the lowest in ten years &mdash; and a constant increase in the take from the PAYE sector.</P>
      <P>On this Finance Bill we cannot deal with issues like that or suggest new taxes. We would prefer if there were only two tax bands, 35 per cent and 65 per cent, to try to bring some equity into the present system.  We are more concerned about a reduction at the bottom level &mdash; in other words, increasing taxable income at 35 per cent.  Because we felt our amendment would be ruled out of order on the ground that it would impose a charge on the Exchequer we tried to cover that by increasing the top bracket to 75 per cent. We wanted to have the 35 per cent rate on the first £5,000 for a single person and £10,000 for married people.  We proposed that over £13,000 for a single person and over £26,000 for a married couple income should be taxable at 75 per cent. We do not think it is unreasonable, if we are on a tax band system, that the people at the top should pay the most.  We felt we had covered the reduction in take from the increase in the 35 per cent rate by putting in that 75 per cent rate.  Apparently not.  We do not have any figures to indicate why, because the amendment was ruled out of order.  It was held that it would involve a potential charge on the people.  I accept that the Ceann Comhairle has done his figures on that.</P>
      <P>We want the Minister to increase the amount of taxable income on the 35 per cent band.  We would prefer if up to £10,000 of taxable income was on the 35 per cent band and that the tax take above that figure be increased.  We are into the question of tax bands and trying to bring some equity into the narrow area of PAYE taxpayers.  That is not the area we want to be in at all.  We believe that should be reduced and the take on capital taxation increased to make up for that. The people on the higher rate, 60 or 65 per cent, do not have any incentive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year and the year before we tabled similar amendments asking that widows, widowers, separated spouses and single parents be put on the Part 2 table, on the married persons tax bands.  Each year we made the same arguments pointing out <Col N="182" /> that those people have the same problems and expenditure as married persons. A house is a house and it needs a roof over it whether one is a single parent, a widow or married.  One has to pay for the house either by way of mortgage or rent. The education of children must be paid for and it is also necessary to pay for clothes, food and travelling expenses for children.  The single parent in order to provide for dependants must try to get work.  A single person who is working has more expenses than a married person. They must pay for a housekeeper, a person who comes in to clean the house, and are obliged to pay for special arrangements to get children to and from school and so on.  Their costs can be a lot greater than for married people.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not have any real argument against our proposal.  Two years ago the Minister suggested that there were some difficulties involved &mdash; I do not know if they were legal or constitutional &mdash; but he undertook to look into the matter recognising the equity of the argument.  Last year Minister Dukes argued against our proposal but not from the point of view of equity or the amount of money involved.  He suggested that if this was granted those who already have the advantage would be looking for the advantage again.  He said that in this way there would be some leap-frogging in the system if the concession was given to such people.  That is not an argument at all against our proposal.  We are talking about tax equity and justice.</P>
    <P>There is a strong case for putting the people I have referred to on the same tax band basis as married couples.  Ministers for Finance have not made an argument that our proposal was not justified.  They did not make the argument that because a spouse was dead the surviving person had less expenses for food or clothes and that the system was justified on the basis of the money income and money expenditure. That is the only way one can argue whether a tax is justified or not, but Ministers for Finance have not made that argument.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to look at this matter again and endeavour to introduce equity into this area.  Severe financial and <Col N="183" /> emotional strain and social problems are created by the loss or absence of one spouse.  The amendment askes that Part 2 of the table apply to persons with dependants who are widows, widowers or single parents, the same wording as last year's proposal.  I am sure the Minister will not be able to contest the inequity of this this year any more than he or his predecessor was able in the last two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister be able to give me some figures?  If he does not have them in the Chamber perhaps he will be good enough to give them to me later.  Will the Minister give the up-to-date figure of the number of people who are being moved into the 35 per cent band rate as a result of the abolition of the 25 per cent band rate?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I seem to remember a figure of 70,000 people who because of the abolition of the 25 per cent band are now on the 35 per cent rate.  Is the Minister in a position to tell the House the number of taxpayers in each band?  That would be useful information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  I should like to know the total number of taxpayers and the number in each band. What proportion of taxpayers are in the 35 per cent band, and what proportion are in the other bands?  What percentage of all taxpayers are on the 65 per cent rate?  It would be useful if we had that information later in the debate because we would know exactly where the burden of taxation is falling.  We would be in a position to see what the trends are likely to be.  I understand that there are about 760,000 taxpayers and that a breakdown of that figure would show that a preponderance of them are in the 35 per cent band.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="184" /> Fianna Fáil are trying to restore the 25 per cent rate because a large number of the people who were in that band have moved into the 35 per cent band.  We are seeking to introduce for widows and widowers a new range of bands, an imaginative and sensible proposal and one which the Minister should look at generously. We are also seeking to abolish the 65 per cent rate of taxation.  The proportion of people in that rate and the money brought in would seem to indicate that it is not worth the administration cost involved.  I concur with the comments made by Deputy O'Kennedy about the effect on incentive and work of this crippling level of taxation.  I must stress that because the bands have not been increased in line with inflation there is an additional burden of taxation on people.  If the bands are not changed and inflation continues to increase it simply amounts to additional taxation.</P>
    <P>There is an impression that benefits have been handed out in the budget.  Let us have a look at these benefits.  The average single person earning £8,000 a year with mortgage interest relief of £2,000 and PRSI deductions will have £22 more per annum, 42p per week.  It would not buy <i>The Irish Times.</i> A married person with three children on £11,000 per annum getting mortgage interest relief of £3,000 will have £45 per annum more, 85p or 86p a week.  Considering the increases in indirect taxation, most people are worse off because of this budget.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister has reasons.  He says he is doing the best he can.  One must be reasonable and remember that public expenditure has gone to the stage when it is gobbling up a greater proportion of people's incomes.  However, it is useless to give people 42p per week in their pockets.  That will only deepen the recession because if people have less disposable income demand for goods and services is smaller, production is smaller and unemployment is greater, and this budget, therefore, does not do anything to ease unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Minister might take a look at some of the economic reports on his desk and he will see the effect of budgets like this <Col N="185" /> and taxation like this on the level of unemployment.  Have the Government grasped the relationship between employment and taxation?  Recently, <i>The Times</i> of London in an editorial pointed out that if unemployment in the UK could be brought down from 3 million at once it would allow the standard rate of income tax to be cut from 30 to 20 per cent.  That has been backed up by a number of leading economists.</P>
    <P>I therefore say to the Minister, let us have pro-employment policies because if we can reduce unemployment we will reduce our need for additional taxation. The Minister is going at this in the wrong way.  The need for additional taxation is being justified by increased public expenditure.  I understand that pressure on any Minister for Finance in any Government, but this Minister is going at it in the wrong way.  If we can tackle unemployment concurrently with trying to get the budget into some kind of shape &mdash; I believe we can do it &mdash; we will then get people back to work, and if we can do that the need for taxation will be less.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of policy we must pursue and if we do not do it taxation will go through the roof, and the less disposable income people have the deeper the recession will go.  We must look at the problem from an employment point of view.  If the Minister can produce policies of this kind, if he puts people back to work, the greater the chance he will have to reduce taxation.</P>
    <P>The Minister must take risks, or a shot in the dark, to use a favourite phrase of the Minister.  He must bring in a sliding scale of PRSI payments so that the more people who are employed the less the PRSI payments will be.  He will find that firms will employ more and consequently the Minister will get in more money.  In the case of a person being paid £12,000 a year at present, the PRSI contribution by him and the employer is £2,500.  The Minister gets that money, that tax on employment, and the more we tax employment the less money we will get in and the more difficult it will be to handle public expenditure.</P>
    <P>The Minister has many reports on his <Col N="186" /> desk.  He has got the reports of the National Planning Board, the Commission on Taxation and the ESRI.  What we need is an economic plan based on reduced taxation which can be achieved by reducing unemployment and controlling public expenditure.  I do not suggest that these are simple things to achieve, but at least the Minister should try to get the direction right.  The Tánaiste is on record time and time again as saying that he favours a continuing high level of public expenditure.  The ESRI Report backs that up &mdash; it suggests more public expenditure. The Commission on Taxation Report and the Report of the National Planning Board propose the opposite &mdash; they want to reduce public expenditure. Which side does the Minister back? Which side do the Government back? Will expenditure go up or down?</P>
    <P>When we talk about taxation a decision has to be taken on that question.  Is the Tánaiste right or is the Minister correct? Whichever direction we decide to go let us get started in that direction together. If we are to depend on the State providing employment let us get started with the plan.  If we are not, let us say that and go in the other direction and reduce public expenditure, reduce taxation, give people more disposable income and in that way restore a viable economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am discussing personal taxation.  In 1980-81, 107,000 people were liable for the higher rates of taxation, 12 per cent of all taxpayers. Two years later the number had risen to 336,000 taxpayers, 40 per cent of all taxpayers. That shows the galloping escalation in taxation levels imposed by section 2.  I support what Deputy O'Kennedy has been saying.  If you want to give a worker a 12½ per cent pay increase and if you want to let him take home £1 extra per week, it costs the firm almost £4.  I am talking about a single worker on £12,700 a year.  That is an anti-employment policy. If the Minister wants to get the burden <Col N="187" /> of taxation down he must make it easy to employ people, not difficult.  That should be the Minister's guideline.  I know he thinks like that and I know his day-to-day financial pressures.  I ask the Minister to stand back and be courageous. He should pursue pro-employment policies.  That is the best way to get our taxation into shape.  It costs a company £20,000 a year to allow an employee take home £10,000 a year.  That means a company must sell an extra £100,000 worth of business.  That is what the Minister is asking companies to do.  The odds are too great.  It must become national economic policy to close that gap.  That is the approach I recommend be adopted towards taxation.</P>
      <P>I support the comments and amendments made by Deputy O'Kennedy.  The Minister should pursue pro-employment policies.  He should not keep going back to the taxation bucket and say that we do not understand the pressures he is under. We know the pressures he is under but we are saying that he is going in the wrong direction.  He should have a chat with the Tánaiste and try to get it going in the same direction.  For the sake of the country that should be done quickly.</P>

      <P>I have been wondering for the last 40 minutes whether we were having a Committee Stage or Second Stage debate.  It is not my place to say so but it seemed to be more in the nature of a Second Stage debate.  Many points were made which in the normal course I would <Col N="188" /> reply to.  However, I do not intend to reply to them because we agreed that there is a limit on the amount of time available for the first chapters of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputies opposite did not say a lot about the amendments.  In reply to Deputy O'Dea, the fact is that it depends on an individual's position.  What we have done is increased the personal allowance, taken out the 25 per cent band and made the income that becomes taxable once a person has used up the increased personal allowance taxable at the 35 per cent rate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We have Tables R, S, T and V where the double bands apply and for single bands, Tables A, B, C and D. They will continue to operate.  The point at which a taxpayer begins to pay tax depends on his allowances.  The increases in the personal allowances which we have in the Bill this year more than compensate for the fact that we have abolished the 25 per cent band.  At any given level of income for the same money income this year as last year there is a reduction in the tax bill as a result of our having increased the personal allowances by more than enough to compensate for the abolition of the 25 per cent rate.</P>
      <P>The question of comparisons between our tax system and those of other countries is one which Deputies find tempting to pursue in a debate of this kind.  It is not all that relevant but I shall allow myself to be tempted along that road because there is a great deal of mythology attached to this.  If we take the position, for 1984-85, in Ireland of a married couple with no children where the husband only is earning IR£10,000, he pays 20.3 per cent in tax.  In the United Kingdom the same person earning £10,000 would pay 20.5 per cent of his income in tax.  At £7,000 the respective proportions are 13.57 per cent and 16.48 per cent.</P>

Up to that point the Irish taxpayer pays a smaller proportion of his income in taxation than his UK counterpart.  After that the UK taxpayer begins to get an advantage. I mention that only because comparisons have been made by Deputies on the opposite side.  It is not relevant to compare our system to the taxation system of a country with a population of 60 million with a long history of higher incomes per head and with completely different needs.  The UK does not have a population growth equal to ours nor does it have the same population distribution. It does not have our infrastructural investment problems.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We must construct our tax system here in order to accommodate our situation.  Another point raised was the change in the tax liability of a person in Ireland over the last few years.  Take <Col N="190" /> Deputy O'Kennedy's example of a person earning £200 a week in 1980-81.  In that year he paid 24.1 per cent of his salary in taxes.  If we take that same person and simply index his money income and look at his situation in 1984-85, his pay will be £284 a week and he is paying 24.9 per cent of his income in tax, in other words, .8 per cent more of his income is being taken from him now.  I would not regard that as being a dramatic turn of the screw.  It represents an increased liability, a high liability, but it does not in any way support Deputy O'Kennedy's contention that there has been a galloping up of the rate of liability to tax during those years.</P>
      <P>Essentially, what I believe is this: in much of what he says about the levels of taxation Deputy O'Kennedy has a perfectly good case but he flogs it to death with his nonsensical exaggerating which bears very little relationship to reality. The question was raised what proportion of tax accounted for under PAYE is paid by directors of close companies.  The latest year for which a full analysis is available is 1979-80.  In that year the proportion of income tax accounted for under PAYE paid by directors of close companies was about 7½ per cent.  Offhand I do not have a more detailed analysis than that but my recollection &mdash; and I am subject to correction on this &mdash; from discussions we had last year, was that on a crude calculation, the proportion has increased slightly but is in the region of 7 per cent to 8 per cent.  I will come back to the Deputy on this and no doubt we will have another opportunity to discuss these matters at a later stage.</P>
      <P>I am not going into international comparisons of the tax burden, the proportion of GNP taken in taxation, although I have some figures here that show that the situation is not quite as Deputy O'Kennedy illustrated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Deputy mentioned it, I will.  Let us take the year 1982, the latest year for which we have OECD comparative tax statistics.  Total tax revenue <Col N="191" /> as a percentage of GDP, 1982, in a list of 23 countries &mdash; enumerated from one to 23 &mdash; Ireland is eighth at 40 per cent and the United Kingdom is ninth at 40 per cent.  The countries which take a higher proportion of GDP in taxation than Ireland, are in order, Sweden, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, France and Austria.  The United States is far down the list but I do not have comparative figures of expenditure. I do not see the direct relevance of all that to the amendments before us.</P>
      <P>I have been asked if I could give some information on the numbers of people in the different tax bands, how many people are paying tax at the given rates.  In 1983-84 the total figures were as follows: for those who benefited from marginal relief, 45,200; people paying tax at 25 per cent, 72,000; at 35 per cent 425,800; at 45 per cent 174,000; at 55 per cent 82,400; at 60 per cent 36,500 and at 65 per cent 33,000.  The situation for 1984-85, post budget, is as follows: the number of people benefiting from marginal relief is 36,000, the number paying tax at not more than 35 per cent&mdash;and that covers what used to be two bands&mdash;484,600; at 45 per cent 173,000; at 55 per cent 85,400; at 60 per cent 39,500 and at 65 per cent 38,900.  The total for 1983-84 was 869,000 and for 1984-85 post budget, estimated, 857,400.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy's amendments Nos. 17, 18 and 21 propose the introduction of a new rate band structure for single and widowed parents at a level about halfway between the single and married rate band structures.  He also proposes to introduce a 25 per cent rate band for the first £1,000 of taxable income of a single person or £1,500 in the case of a widowed person, or £2,000 in the case of a married couple, sets the 35 per cent band at £3,000 for a single person, £4,500 for a widowed person and £6,000 for a married couple and abolishes the 65 per cent band.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 22 in the names of Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy de Rossa proposes to extend the double rate bands applicable to married persons to single and widowed parents.  One of the consequences <Col N="192" /> of increasing the rate bands for single and widowed parents would be that married couples with children, each spouse with an income, would find it substantially to their advantage to choose to be assessed to tax as single persons under section 193 of the 1967 Income Tax Act. In that way, if each spouse accepted responsibility for one or more of the children they would obtain the benefit of two sets of increased rate bands compared with a married couple who have only one source of income or who are chargeable to tax in respect of their joint incomes under section 194 and would gain a fairly substantial advantage.  In addition, it would be extremely difficult to insert an additional separate rate structure applying to widowed and single parents with dependants into the current existing PAYE computer programme.</P>
    <P>If the wording of the amendment were to be changed to prevent married couples from claiming two sets of increased bands &mdash; one of the difficulties I see with it &mdash; the measure could then be regarded as being repugnant to the Constitution, being inimical to the institution of marriage following the Supreme Court decision in the Murphy case.  We would create a situation where if a widow and widower, each with children, wished to marry each other, with that proposed change they would be discouraged from doing so because as a married couple they would be entitled to only one set of doubled rate bands while if they remained in their separate states, they would get one set of double-rate bands each.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if it were possible to implement, it would inevitably have the effect of creating the leapfrogging of which I spoke in the corresponding debate last year and which Deputy Mac Giolla did not seem to have grasped.</P>
      <P>The cost of amending the rate bands applicable to single and married persons, as proposed by Deputy O'Kennedy, would be £73.6 million in 1984 and £122.6 million in a full year.  The additional cost of a new increased rate band structure for single and widowed persons would be about £1½ million in 1984 and £2½ million for a full year.  If, as I think would be likely, married couples with children, having two incomes, were to opt for single assessment so as to benefit from these rate bands, there would be an additional cost of £9 million in 1984 and £15 million in a full year.  So, the cost of that operation, which would be of highly dubious constitutionality, would be, quite frankly, prohibitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extension of the double rate band to single persons proposed by Deputies Mac Giolla and De Rossa would cost about £2 million in 1984 and £3 million in a full year if married couples were excluded.  If they were included &mdash; and, as I have said, I do not think it would be constitutionally possible to exclude them <Col N="194" />&mdash; the cost would be about £8 million in 1984 and £13.4 million in a full year. These, of course, are estimates, based on what would happen in the very unlikely event that the system could actually cope with this type of change.</P>
    <P>Those are the reasons for my not being able to accept those amendments this year.  They are also the reasons why last year I could not accept a somewhat similar amendment to today's amendment put forward by Deputies Mac Giolla and De Rossa.  The situation is largely determined for us by a ruling in a constitutional case.  Unless we want to change the basis of that, I think we have no option but to reject the amendments put forward here. I might add that we have deliberately, over a couple of years, found ways of increasing the amounts of allowances available to single parents and to widowed parents so that, in terms of allowances, they get the same total of allowances as married couples.  We cannot apply the double rate bands to those persons because the doubled rate bands to married couples are given because they are two persons.  A single band is given to each person.  We cannot then give double bands to one person.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not deal with my question with regard how the standard rate would affect a person investing in a building society, if it were reduced to 25 per cent.  At the moment, persons receiving interest on investment in a building society are deemed to have paid tax at the standard rate of 35 per cent.  Would that mean that, in computing a person's tax liability, if we were to reduce the rate as suggested here to 25 per cent, persons investing in a building society could have a higher tax bill?  It appears to me that they would, but that may not be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second question deals with the section of the 1982 Act, concerned with double tax bands.  This matter is more complicated than the Minister has outlined. What happens in the case of a woman who is living apart from her husband or whose marriage has been annulled by the church, now living happily with somebody else and having children from that <Col N="195" /> person &mdash; making up a family unit to all intents and purposes?  Does the father of those children receive the single allowance and the mother also receive a single allowance and can they claim for children's allowances?  In other words, are they treated as a family unit?  Do they come out as well off as the single parent family to whom the Minister has referred?  My information is that they do not, that if the man is the earner of the income he is treated, to all intents and purposes, as a single person, receives the single allowance and can only claim the single rate mortgage interest relief of £2,000 and the wife is treated as an interloper. Those cases are quite separate from the ones outlined by the Minister. I have been recently in touch with the Minister about a particular case.  As far as I can make out from information received, the only way around it would be for the father to covenant his income to his common law wife, who would then have allowances against that but only as a single person.  The area is much more complicated than the question raised by Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment, of giving single parent families and widows the double allowance.  Whether we like it or not, there are many family units of the category which I mention and for that reason the Committee on Marital Breakdown has been instituted.  We should be aware of these complications.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Just to clarify the decision in the Murphy case and its implications on the amendment, firstly when is a married parent not a single parent? The answer is when he or she is a married parent.  Also when is a single parent not a married parent?  When he or she is a single parent.  There is no ruling in law to suggest at all that if one makes provision, as is requested here, for widows, widowers and single parents, who have a very definite characteristic and distinction, one could say that married parents, who have a very different characteristic could suddenly declare themselves not married parents, but two single parents. If the law were to reach that point it would then really be an ass, but it is not quite that much of an ass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="196" /> The Minister is drawing the long bow in replying to my proposal in relation to a separate, special band for widows, widowers and single parents.  He says that one could have a good case for married parents declaring themselves entitled to assessment on the same basis as single parents.  That makes no sense and I can think of no court of law anywhere which would hold that.  It is not fair to ask officials to dream up responses like that to what is a case in its own right.  I was a Minister in government when the Murphy decision was made.  It was to apply the same allowances to a married couple, both of them earning outside the home, as if they were two single people earning. In government we extended the effect of that decision to an area to which we were not obliged or required to extend it under the Supreme Court decision, to give the same double allowance to all married couples as would apply to married couples both working outside the home. That was the effect of the Murphy decision. To say it will raise implications is to draw another long bow.  To say that it would raise implications for what I am seeking for windows, widowers and single parents by expanding it into an area where the court never went is not sustainable. I do not know whether there is some new legal section in the Department of Finance coming up with such ideas, but if it is there it could not possibly sustain that argument, neither could the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>To come back to the amendment, the Minister is right in nothing that because of the special condition of widows, widowers and single parents we are trying to fix a balance here between the position of the single person who is not a parent and the married couple who are parents.  First of all, there is a growing number of widows, widowers and single parents in our society and there should be a special band to take account of that.  They have to deal with the same problems, and the same overheads as have other people in relation to any of the normal running expenses of anything from household equipment to mortgages or anything else.  At the same time they are not being granted anything like a commensurate tax adjustment <Col N="197" /> or allowance in respect of those standard expenses.  I acknowledge that there is a limit to what can be achieved, but the Minister tells me at the same time that to adopt my amendment this year &mdash; it does not push too far, as I think he would acknowledge &mdash; would cost £1.5 million.  We are not talking about major sums for a very big category in our society at this stage.  In terms of equity, justice and whatever else you may care to mention, there is a strong case which is not answered by the arguments that the Minister has dreamed up which have no basis whatsoever in law and, if possible, less basis in fact.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to some of the broader arguments.  He mentioned the OECD countries and he picked out those which are higher than we are.  That does not occasion surprise because that is why I asked him to pick them out. Everybody knows that the standard of social service in the northern European countries is at a sophisticated level away ahead of anything we have.  These countries now, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash; and Austria &mdash; France is perhaps the exception, being outside the northern European band &mdash; have levels of sophisticated service.  Even France at the moment, as the Minister will know, in terms of promoting balance in the demographic structure there, makes grants available for family units over two, three, four, five, and the mother of five children gets all kinds of passes and exemptions and so on.  President Giscard D'Estaing introduced that a few years back to correct the trend in French society where the average family unit was going as low as 1.5 and they were concerned about the situation which would emerge in about ten years where the level of dependency of both the youth and the aged would be far too high to be sustained by the working population.  The tax situation in France reflects that kind of social programme which we have not got.  The level of the sophisticated service <Col N="198" /> that the other countries have had for years would explain their level of taxation. Any of the other democratic countries of the 23 with which we try to compete are away below us.</P>

      <P>As the Minister indicated, the increase in the level of taxation from thereon is such as to be undoubtedly a disincentive element on activity, on employment and on our economy.  Let me quote some figures to confirm what Deputy Brennan has said on this.  Recent surveys indicate that if we are concerned to use tax having regard to the needs of the economy and the needs to generate activity in the economy &mdash; a tax system can do that as well as imposing a brake &mdash; the tax system here at the moment is a disincentive to employment.  For every £100 that an employer invests in a worker it costs him £170 to discharge his bill. Each worker to whom he pays £100 costs the employer £170.  Machinery for which he pays £100&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to income tax, PRSI and levies, the tax situation here is such that for every £100 <Col N="199" /> take-home pay of an employee an employer must provide at least £170.  On the other hand, every £100 that he invests in a machine costs him £45.  There we have the answer.  There is an incentive to remove the worker.  That is what our system is doing, and the disincentive applies particularly to the tax code, PRSI and the income levy.  We can talk all we like about trying to generate employment and so on, but go out to the people who give employment and ask them if they will create more jobs and they will give you the answer fairly fast as to what it will cost them to do so while to get in another machine to do the same work will cost them a great deal less.  That is what the tax bill is doing.  In the last 12 months I have had communications from a number of accountancy firms &mdash; giving information which I did not seek &mdash; that for every £100 they pay to any of their employees they must make £200 before they begin to break even, and that even in the service sector of our economy. That is the kind of thing we have been underlining in here.  That is why the tax bands are the disincentive we have pointed them out to be.  In the last two years the Minister on his own responsibility has increased income tax from £1,459 million to £1,952 million or, in fair rounded figures, by 2 per cent of GDP which we should always include also.  It is all very fine to say that we should know that it should be lower but the Government and the Minister here have done this and they have brought about a disincentive effect where employment, either the employee himself or the potential employer, is being penalised.  For that reason we have introduced this proposal which, incidentally the Minister has costed at a figure of £73 million, which is in line with our own.  That is gross; I know it is.  If one allows for a buoyancy factor of approximately 35 to 40 per cent one is then talking about a net cost to the Exchequer of something less than £50 million.  Apart from the figures, if the Minister were to give this concession the effect would be so dynamic that at the end of the day he would actually lose <Col N="200" /> little or nothing.  That is why I am asking the Minister to accept these amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The agency which has been established by the Oireachtas to provide advice in relation to natural supplies is Bord Gáis Éireann.  Groups who are interested in the distribution of natural gas in the area should, therefore, contact BGE who will advise them on the planning studies necessary to establish the viability of individual projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not think it would be advisable to have proper co-ordination of the necessary plans for the usage of the natural gas in order to ascertain the various industries which would benefit most from its availability. Furthermore, for the normal network of piping for domestic supplies along the way would the Minister not agree it would be necessary to have a co-ordinating body in order to ensure that they are all at one in relation to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the function of Bord Gáis Éireann.  They were established by the Oireachtas to provide advice in relation to natural gas supplies. In this instance I would not like to see another co-ordinating body.  Bord Gáis Éireann were set up with this specific function, they are in a position to give the advice and it would be better that we allow them to do so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of the phased development of the natural gas market, it is intended to make natural gas available to industries located in proximity to the gas transmission network.  In line with this policy, applications from firms involved in the food manufacturing industry will be considered by Bord Gáis Éireann.  I would emphasise, however, that the prospects and timing of a supply will be subject to the technical and financial feasibility of individual projects.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister tell us when it is proposed to make gas available to firms in proximity to the pipelines? We have had a pipeline from the shore into Cork for quite a number of years now and we have had a pipeline from Cork to Dublin for, I think, the past 18 months to two years.  With the exception of a few industries in, I think, Little Island in Cork, virtually no other industries have got connections to natural gas although many of them are very close to the pipeline.  Therefore, when the Minister says it is the intention to make it available, can he tell us when it will be made available because Bord Gáis Éireann have done little or nothing so far as making it available to individual firms is concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary thrust of the natural gas utilisation policy has been and is to develop as far as possible premium domestic markets and commercial markets. Under the pricing and allocation policy which has recently been prepared by Bord Gáis Éireann bulk gas will be sold to industries which are located in proximity to the pipeline.  It is an on-going matter.  There is nothing to stop the board and the particular industries interested in the supply of gas setting up their contracts and getting on with it.</P>

We are now in May 1984 and they still have not got a connection although they would be very substantial users of the gas in an optimum way; similarly with other companies where arrangements were made, such as Smithwicks of Kilkenny, The Irish Glass Bottle Co., and various others.  What is the reason for this exceptional delay and the fact that after several years Bord Gáis Éireann have not delivered gas to any of these people who badly need it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>Bord Gáis Éireann are currently examining the feasibility of using natural gas as a fuel source for the market gardening and horticultural industry in north County Dublin.  The prospects for supplying natural gas to the industry in this area will be assessed in the light of this study, the results of which should be available shortly.  If growers in other locations within pipeline catchment areas have projects in mind, they should communicate with Bord Gáis Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that we are not fully utilising the gas supply?  The Dutch have monopolised the European market due to the availability of natural gas.  We have hundreds of acres of unheated glasshouses which are in use for only a few months each year.  We are importing about 8,000 tonnes of tomatoes and there is a market in Northern Ireland for another 6,000 <Col N="207" /> tonnes.  There is massive employment potential and it is regrettable that investigations have not been carried out in view of the benefits of import substitution in the field of horticulture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to be helpful to the Deputy.  I have stated that the study is about to be completed.  It would be short-sighted to undertake distribution without having full studies carried out.  There is obviously an area in the greenhouse belt of north County Dublin, a substantial load region, which would be quite suitable.  Other regions will also be looked at.  It is important to have the homework done before we carry out the distribution of the gas supply.  I accept what the Deputy says about the full utilisation of the available supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Recognising that the Minister has said there is considerable potential for job creation in this area, it must be pointed out that an important aspect is the price at which the gas would be made available.  Would the Minister give an undertaking to supply gas at a price which would allow the glasshouse industry to become properly established again and expand so as to achieve the maximum job creation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention would be where possible to ensure that the gas supply would be made available at competitive prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is it necessary to have a feasibility study as to suitability of natural gas for horticultural purposes when it is well known in every country in Europe which has natural gas that it is extremely suitable for these purposes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Many aspects of this possible project must be looked at, including the distribution of users, existing fuel usage, suitability for conversion of equipment at present in use, the question of efficiency and the potential fuel use at higher efficiency levels.  There is justification for having a study carried out because in time I would rather see the <Col N="208" /> project being successful.  The study will be completed shortly and we can then get on with the project.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The life expectancy of the Kinsale Head field will be determined by the rate at which the recoverable reserves of gas in place will be depleted.  In general these are expected to last until at least the end of the century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the reply mean that there is only 16 years' life now left in the gas field while the estimate a year ago was that it would last for 25 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy fully understands that there are many variables as to the off-take of gas.  The answer is farmed to give precise information and we are saying it will last at least until the end of the century while there is a possibility it will last longer, depending on the off-take.  The gas reserves of the Kinsale field were upgraded from 1 to 1.353 trillion cubic feet in 1980.  Given that fact, we can comfortably say there will be gas there until the end of the century and <Col N="209" /> possibly for a number of years after that, obviously depending on the variables and the amount of gas taken off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it intended in the next year or so to reduce the rate of depletion, particularly if the amount of gas going to the ESB is reduced, as appears to be the intention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There will be a reduction of the off-load to the ESB but that will be balanced out by the amount of gas going to Northern Ireland and the development of the pipeline elsewhere. There is a question of balance between the present off-take, the future expansion for industrial use and the whole question of the long-term off-take.  I can safely say the supply will not expire before the end of the century and could last for a number of years after that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>During the early sixties two exploration wells were drilled in west Cavan and some interesting gas shows were encountered in one of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="210" /> In early 1981 a new exploration group re-entered this well and by applying fracturing techniques, increased the gas flow rate.  While the improvement was substantial it did not establish commercial viability.</P>
    <P>Subsequently two major seismic surveys were conducted over the area and it is expected that a further well, located at Macnean, is being drilled since late last month.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Has any investigation been done into the market?  Have the Department been in consultation with the Northern authorities as it is generally accepted that the gas field extends into Fermanagh?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not been personally in contact with the Northern authorities. I am sure there are ongoing discussions with them.  The present situation is that drilling has just started on the well, as I am sure the Deputy is well aware, since the end of last month.  The situation now is to wait and see the result of the tests of that well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the EEC Social and Economic Committee place great emphasis on the natural resources?  Is it not a great pity, seeing that this is at EEC level, that there is not an accompanying examination of the needs?  Would the Minister not agree that in most cases it is the populous areas which are being facilitated and that regions such as this, which would be given a great fillip in regard to industry, are affected?  In view of the expensive surveys carried out would the Minister have accompanying examinations made of those areas for suitable markets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the studies which have been carried out will be fully utilised by us in looking at the structure of the area.  The question at the moment is that it will obviously take some time before any results are to hand in relation to the amount of gas in the area.  I assure the Deputy that full studies will be undertaken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree in view of the fact that the geological evidence seems to suggest that, if there is gas in west Cavan, it extends into Fermanagh and <i>vice versa,</i> a joint study on the area with the Northern authorities is far more likely to be useful than simply we operating on our own, that the amount of knowledge that can be gleaned is not simply the sum of the two separate studies but that a joint study and joint exploration could be infinitely more valuable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy's point in relation to the proximity of the location between Cavan, Fermanagh and the areas on both sides of the Border.  I do not envisage any difficulty in relation to getting the co-operation of the Northern Ireland and the British authorities regarding joint studies.  This is a matter which can be taken up and which will be of benefit to both areas if there is a commercial discovery.  Obviously it is not a simple matter of a finding on both sides because there will be interlocking of the fields.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 12 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>Gulf Oil (Ireland) Limited, Atlantic Resources Limited and Unionoil (Ireland) Limited comprise the consortium which holds block 49/9 under an exclusive offshore exploration licence. Gulf Oil (Ireland) Limited is the operator for the licence.</P>
      <P>The operator has, to date, drilled two exploration wells in this block.  The first of these was dry and was plugged and abandoned.  The second resulted in the discovery of hydrocarbons.  The operator then drilled the first appraisal well related to the discovery and drilling and testing of that well was completed on 5 April last.  This well has now been temporarily abandoned as was the discovery well.</P>
      <P>It is the practice that statements regarding the results of wells are in all cases issued by the operator.  In regard to the three wells now completed in block 49/9, Gulf as operator have issued formal statements on their results.  The latest such statement was issued by Gulf on 7 April last.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to depart from the normal practice by adding to those statements, especially in view of the confidential nature of the well data.  I will, however, be pressing the licensees to proceed with all haste in completing the delineation of the field.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the Deputy an exact date.  As I said in my reply, I am <Col N="215" /> anxious to see the full delineation of the field and we are encouraging the exploration companies to carry out investigations as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not have arranged already that as soon as the well on field 48/19 which is being drilled at present is completed the rig would return to 49/9 in view of the fact that in one of the three wells drilled so far there was a significant hydrocarbon find?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>We are encouraging the exploration of this field to continue as quickly as possible.  It is in everybody's interest that it be done but it is not a question of dictating one way or another. I do not see occurring the hypothetical situation to which the Deputy refers because it is in the interest of the company, of the Government and of the people generally that drilling takes place as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>There has been no change in EEC Regulation 1820/80 in relation to the supply of electricity to dwelling houses on farm holdings.</P>
      <P>The objectives of the western package electrification scheme were included in a programme submitted to the EEC Commission in 1981.  This programme on which the regulation is based was approved by the Commission in March of that year.  The programme has not been altered since that time and applications for new supply are assessed in line with its objectives.</P>
      <P>While the programme approved by the Commission in 1981 allows for connection of farm dwellings to supply, it is clearly stated that assistance for this purpose applies only to farms which do not have an existing electricity supply.

There was a liberal interpretation as to new supply to farms in the intervening period up to 1984.  The question of interpretation and eligibility requirements were subject to examination by the auditors of the EEC and as the Deputy will appreciate, we are at all times subject to examination and evaluation by the auditors who are of the opinion that we should apply this scheme in relation to new connections to farms.</P>

Does he also accept that people who applied some months prior to 1 Janury 1984 were informed that they were entitled to this benefit but then, in a very blunt fashion, the regulation was changed?  Applicants who rang the Department were told that grants which were not sanctioned before 1 January 1984 were not payable.

      <P>Does the Minister agree that the son or daughter of a farmer who wants to build a new house and live on a farm would make a major contribution to the development of agriculture provided they were working full time on the land?  Would he now give a direction <Col N="223" /> to his Department that these people can avail of the subsidy?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point but we do not live in an ideal world. When Deputy Fahey asked this question before I pointed out to him that we will attempt to have this scheme made as widely available as possible.  I know it is important to keep a son or daughter on the land but the aims of the package are to improve the viability of farms by facilitating the introduction of modern intensive farming methods, increasing the quality and quantity of production or improving farm hygiene.  The electrification scheme obviously helps to fulfil these aims with the improvement of electricity infrastructure but it was originally intended to use the scheme for new electricity supplies to farms.  That is the bone of contention between us and the EEC auditors.  Obviously, if we can extend the scheme we will do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if he will indicate the current situation with regard to the future of Allenwood generating station, County Kildare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The generating station at Allenwood is included in the ESB's Strategic Plan 1983-88.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESB's Strategic Plan was drawn up by the board and management of the ESB on their own initiative and responsibility to bring about major changes in the organisation to achieve substantial price improvement.  The plan sets out the <Col N="224" /> measures proposed by the ESB to achieve this objective.  These proposals include closure of certain generating stations, including the station at Allenwood, to reduce the board's dependence on older plant.  The plan also includes measures relating to such areas as administration, accounting procedures, consultancy services, general overheads, office development, trading practices and reorganisation of structures within the board.</P>
    <P>The plan is being examined in detail in my Department and until this examination is complete I do not propose to comment on any particular element of the plan &mdash; including the proposed decommissioning of Allenwood generating station.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that no decision will be taken on the board's plan without the fullest consideration being given to the social, economic, strategic and regional implications of the proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a mid-life renewal was undertaken at Allenwood some years ago which should have the effect of extending the natural life span of the station?  Taking that into account, would he give favourable consideration to allowing Allenwood to remain in commission until the natural resources available locally are exhausted and by which time the station will also have reached the end of its natural life span?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have full information on the Allenwood station.

I assure the Deputy that that will be done in due course.</P>

      <P>The Minister, his Department and his predecessors between them have had this strategic plan for about nine months.  Since, as I recall, it amounts to only 25 or 30 pages, how much longer than the nine months roughly for which he has had it does the <Col N="225" /> Minister think he will need for himself and his Department to study it and come to some decision?  Surely the proposals in it could have been evaluated and decided upon long before now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the present serious industrial relations situation within the ESB, including the intention signified yesterday to have a total strike in the ESB as and from 21 May, has been contributed to in a major way by this lengthy delay in evaluating quite a short and relatively simple although far-reaching plan?  If there is a further delay of several months the industrial relations situation in the ESB will deteriorate even further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It will take the time which I consider necessary for the evaluation of this plan.  It may be a short document, but the implications are far-reaching for future energy policy.  I am determined that it will be given the time necessary.  I would not consider it a major factor in relation to possible industrial difficulties in the ESB.  I can assure the Deputy that it will be brought forward with all possible haste.  Given the importance of the document and the uncertainty which many people in the ESB and Bord na Móna have hanging over them, it is obviously very important.  In the overall strategic plan for energy the importance of this plan should not be under-estimated. There will be a full evaluation.</P>

      <P>The amendment put forward gives rise to a number of difficulties, and perhaps, constitutional ones.  I should like to point out for the benefit of Deputy O'Kennedy and to refresh his memory a little, that during the course of Committee Stages debates on the Finance Bill, 1982, Deputy De Rossa and two of his then colleagues put down an amendment which proposed that double rate bands be applied to single parents.  During the course of that debate the then Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry, referred to the constitutional problems which could arise from the proposals.  That problem still exists.  In answer to a specific query from Deputy O'Kennedy, I can assure him that we have set up no new legal machinery in the Department of Finance or elsewhere to deal with these matters.  I can also assure him that the law or the Constitution has not changed in the meantime on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I advise the Deputy, if he does not wish to take my word for this, that he have a chat with his colleague, <Col N="240" /> Deputy MacSharry, who I am sure will be happy to oblige him by saying that the view he took in 1982 was totally justified and is still justified today.  For that reason I cannot accept the amendment or undertake to bring forward on Report Stage any amendment going in the same direction. That is not to say that I do not accept fully that widowed and single parents have a difficult job to do.  This has been a concern of the House for some years.  We have brought about a situation where the total of tax free allowances available to widowed or single parents is the same as the tax free allowances available to married couples.  That was done by specific increase in allowances that are related to the fact that those people have declared children.  There is a complete obstacle to applying double rate bands to people in that position for the reasons I have outlined.  As long as we have both that and constitutional obstacles that will continue to be the case. We will have to find other ways of dealing with what we perceive to be the specific problems faced by people in that position. I cannot accept that amendment, or the other amendments put forward by Deputy O'Kennedy, for reasons of legal difficulties and cost which I mentioned earlier.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to increase the PAYE allowance from £600 to £1,000.  The cost of making the amendment would be £84 million in 1984 and £140 million in a full year.  The cost of maintaining the allowances at their present level for the tax year 1984-85 will be in the region of £210 million. On these grounds alone I oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>It is relevant to the amendment. It looks at first sight as if the Minister is increasing the single allowance from £1,450 to £1,800, that is an increase of £350.  However, that is not the case. <Col N="244" /> Every PAYE taxpayer has a statutory allowance of £600 and an allowance of £286 for PRSI.  In effect the Minister is increasing the single person's allowance of £2,218 by £350, that is an increase of about 15 per cent.  When the fact is taken into account that the rate for the first £1,000 of taxable income has been increased to 35 per cent the allowance has not been increased to any real extent.</P>

      <P>It depends on the way the Deputy wants to do the sums.  The increase in the personal allowances, that is the increase from £1,450 to £1,800, more than compensates for the fact that we have abolished the 25 per cent rate. There is a net gain to each taxpayer.  The Deputy has chosen to follow the course of adding up the personal allowance, the PAYE allowance and PRSI allowance. That is not a relevant way of looking at the overall allowances.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 11, lines 24 and 25, to delete paragraph (b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="245" /> What we are proposing is to restore the PRSI tax free allowance to what it was two years ago.  It was £312 then.  Last year it was reduced to £286.  There is a cogent case to be made for restoring it to the previous level.  The position of a worker will still not be equal to what it was two years ago even if that is done.  We are not suggesting a higher figure than that because we know the cost of these concessions.  We do not want to push the Minister too far but we hope he will accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>In relation to social welfare contributions generally, the Commission on Taxation and the National Planning Board speak about all these levies, contributions and so on as being just one broad form of taxation.  Employers and employees are only concerned about take-home pay.  In the last two years the level of contribution to the Revenue through social insurance contributions has increased from £739 million to £960 million this year.  These figures are so stark as to put the whole question in context. In fact, the level of social insurance contributions is approximately half those collected through direct income tax this year.  I do not think these figures are sufficiently understood outside.  A sum of £960 million is collected by way of social insurance contributions and the income tax contribution is a little more than double that figure.</P>
    <P>The increase in the last two years of the social insurance contributions has been the highest single proportionate increase in the whole tax contribution system, an increase of £220 million on £730 million, over 40 per cent.  This is a huge increase.  As everyone knows, this is a major disincentive to work and gives rise to a great deal of frustration and even worse.  How often do we hear people say they would be better off if they were not working?  People at work are only interested in their take-home pay.  The Minister has reduced the PRSI allowance this year from £312 to £286.  Those figures are inordinately high and this has a very great impact on take-home pay.  What we are asking here is most unusual.  We are asking <Col N="246" /> the Minister to go where we were two years ago and grant the same tax-free allowances.  In view of the figures I have mentioned the Minister should look at this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan suggested that a sliding scale of PRSI allowance for employers would encourage employment but the Minister has not done that &mdash; he has done the opposite.  In my view he should do something to stem the flood of increasing unemployment and seriously consider conceding the well-based case we have made that we go back to where we were two years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose that we move forward from the £286 to £350.  We have taken inflation and other factors into account in reaching that figure.  I would like to refer to the Minister's 1983 budget speech when he came up with the wonderful idea of the family income supplement. This was to be an incentive to people on relatively low incomes to take up work rather than be on the dole.  The Minister set aside £5 million for this purpose. As I recall &mdash; I do not have the Minister's speech to hand &mdash; the PRSI reduction from £312 to £286 was to raise this £5 million.  I would like to know where that £5 million went, because no family income supplement scheme was introduced.  Twenty thousand families were to benefit from this £5 million.  We have not heard anything about this since. What happened to that £5 million?  What will happen the money collected this year?  Has this scheme been forgotten?  Is the money going into the coffers in the normal way without giving any assistance to people on lower incomes?  This was the incentive given in this House so that we would vote for this scheme.  This year the Minister is making the same suggestions but he is not giving any reason why he is taking this £286 from each worker, and he should tell us why he has not altered his position from last year or, alternatively, agree to the amendments suggested and increase the amount to at least £312.  In my view, this amount should be considerably increased.  Therefore I am proposing he accept amendment No. 25.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="247" />
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister if there is not a certain injustice in the operation of the PRSI tax-free allowances because it seems to be the same for married and single people.  It does not appear to be related to a person's ability to pay.  If I am correct, that is a regressive situation.  Unlike other allowances and rates geared for married and single people, this rate seems to apply across the board and does not appear to have any differential in it.</P>
      <P>The rate of PRSI paid by an employee is approximately 8½ per cent.  Would the Minister like to comment on that calculation? If a person earns £10,000 per annum and pays 8½ per cent PRSI &mdash; £850 gross &mdash; and if one applies 8½ per cent gross, allowing £2,000 taxation on £10,000, one is talking about 11 per cent net.  The effect of PRSI on the employee is exactly the same as if the Minister were to come into this House and increase the 35 per cent taxation rate by a further 11 per cent, bringing it up to 46 per cent. PRSI, because it is on gross income, is equivalent certainly to over 10 per cent net on taxable income which is the same as putting up the tax rate by 10 per cent. If I am reading it correctly, it is quite a hefty bill and I am sure that the Minister is not saying that it is a light one.  That makes the 35 per cent rate, in effect, 45 per cent or 46 per cent if put on net instead of gross income as with PRSI.</P>
      <P>The third point I wish to make is about another anomaly, that an employee on £12,000 salary would pay £1,000 and the employer about £1,450, making £2,500 PRSI going to the State on a salary of £12,000.  The employer can write that off with his business expenses because it is part of his cost of employment.  He is thus bringing down his profits and his taxation. The real cost to him is half of £1,450.  However, what happens to the employee?  He cannot write it off and he gets no deduction for it.  He pays up the £1,000 PRSI.  That is the second injustice, the first being the difference between the treatment of married and single people and the third being that the payment is on gross income and equivalent to 10 or 11 per cent on taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must reach the stage soon where <Col N="248" /> the complexity of our taxation regime has to be tackled.  I know that there must be different horses for different courses in the taxation code, but there are five different rates of income tax and three or four of PRSI &mdash; that is nine different rates of taxation applying to an ordinary worker.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that the PRSI system is part of a very complicated system of nine to 11 rates of taxation applying to the ordinary worker. There must be a way of making it simpler for the average person to understand.  A movement has begun in the United States and in many European countries to simplify their tax codes.  In that area we should try to simplify ours somewhat. There is a certain amount of inequity in the operation of that system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The present rate of PRSI for employees is 8½ per cent of gross income &mdash; that is the correct figure.  If you gross up the figure of £286, you get an income figure of £3,400.  Therefore, the vast majority of employees &mdash; practically all &mdash; are paying PRSI out of income already partially burdened with tax, if the PRSI allowance does not match the full amount of PRSI paid.  That is a principle with which I am in fundamental disagreement.  It is inequitable and wrong.  However, we are not asking the Minister to change that, but to increase the allowance slightly.  He should certainly look at that sympathetically because justice and equity demand it.  I should be very pleased and cheered to hear the Minister say that he will consider <Col N="249" /> our amendment.  It is fundamental as far as equity in taxation is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may be permitted for a moment to make a small international comparison, since such comparisons have been in vogue earlier today, the latest figures for OECD countries which calculate social security contributions both for employer and employee&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is going to compare these figures he will have to talk about the services provided for these contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Deputy to be patient for a moment and I shall come to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The services are very different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The services provided are not necessarily a matter of concern in relation to this section.  It might interest the Deputy to know that for Ireland the provisional figures for 1982 for PRSI social security contributions for both employer and employee represented some 6 per cent of GDP, or 15 per cent of total taxation.  That is consistent with the kind of figures about which we were talking earlier.</P>
      <P>In the ranking of 23 OECD members, Ireland is fourteenth &mdash; there are 13 countries where the relative rates of social security contributions are higher. They go from four times the Irish level as a proportion of GNP in Sweden to three times Ireland's level in the Netherlands and France and so on down the scale.  This is something which many people do not appreciate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>But the services provided in Sweden, the Netherlands and France are completely different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally, we have the lowest rate of social security contributions in Europe.  Secondly &mdash; and Deputies know this quite well &mdash; PRSI contributions do not by any means cover the total cost of <Col N="250" /> the social insurance system and have not done so for some years.  There is an input from general taxation into the cost of providing our social services in addition to PRSI contributions.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan made the point that there is no distinction in this allowance on the basis of marital status, that one gets the same allowance whether married or single.  This is an allowance given to each individual taxpayer and is similar in that way to the PRSI allowance.  A married couple, where both are earning income, get two allowances but this is an allowance specifically for each individual taxpayer by reference to his or her contribution threshold.  Deputy Brennan said if one were to compare PRSI contributions with net income, after-tax income or another method, one would find that the incidence is higher than the apparent rate of 8½ per cent in the case of the employee.  Of course, that is true.  I am tempted to remark that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet &mdash; there is not a lot of difference between 8½ per cent on gross income and 10 per cent on net income if the total amount being paid out is the same.  Our rates of contribution are among the lowest in Europe.  Our existing rates, combining both employer and employee contributions, do not fully cover the cost of social insurance services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose Portugal is about the lowest &mdash; am I right?  Is the Minister going to suggest that some countries which are very badly served as regards their social security system are comparable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall tell the Deputy, if I may, that among the countries which have lower rates than ours we have one of the Deputy's favourites &mdash; Denmark. Even the Deputy would say that the social services in Denmark are somewhat more advanced &mdash; or sophisticated, to use the Deputy's own words &mdash; than ours. Other countries in which the contribution rates are lower are Finland and Canada. Another country in which, curiously enough, they appear to be lower &mdash; although we do not have the final information <Col N="251" />&mdash; is Japan, but there is a different reason for it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a different reason for it in those cases.  There are with lower contribution rates, countries which have more sophisticated systems and countries &mdash; of which there are many &mdash; which have less developed social security systems than ours.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and £86 million in a full year.  Of course the figures are gross. The Deputy and I could switch sides constantly on this argument.  It would make your head go round to watch the two of us switching sides on this.  I will stick to the gross figures.  If he wants to put them net that is fair enough.  I will even give him the conversion if he is really interested in it.  To restore it to the level of £312 as Deputy O'Kennedy suggests would cost an additional £5 million in 1984 and £8 million in a full year and to go as far as Deputy Mac Giolla proposes would cost £12 million in 1984 and £20 million in a full year.  Given the circumstances we are in &mdash; Deputies have heard me say this before to-day and will no doubt hear me say it again in the course of this discussion &mdash; I would not be in favour of increasing the allowance because that would mean we would be foregoing that amount of revenue which would have to be at the expense of some other allowance or part of the programme.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Dea mentioned his fear that in some cases the allowance is not completely used up.  In fact, maintaining the allowance this year will benefit about 655,000 taxpayers of whom 10,000 would be relieved of tax altogether by the fact that this £286 is added to the total of their tax-free allowances.  In other words, there are people who would have £286 or less of taxable income but for the operation of this allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For those reasons I must oppose the amendment.  While, of course, we can calculate the incidence in different ways, our rates of contribution in comparative <Col N="253" /> terms are rather low although, as I have said, I do not believe that these comparisons are all that directly relevant, and the allowance itself is the maximum that we find it open to us to give in present circumstances.</P>

      <P>The net cost of what we are suggesting would be about £3 million. We have approached everything in relation to these amendments on the basis of taking account, as the Minister puts it, of the position in which he finds himself.  It must be recorded that the amount that it would cost the revenue to give effect to bringing us back to where we were two years ago is £3 million net. That is not asking too much to get something moving again.</P>

      <P>The Minister did not advert to the reference I made to the family income supplement.  Why was the allowance reduced last year to £286?  Was a specific reason not given that the money could be used for the family income supplement? Since it was not used, could the Minister indicate this year what reasons he has for retaining the reduction of the allowance to £286?  He has said that if the money was lost on that it would mean that something else would have to do without the money, but what would have to do without it this year?  Last year a reason was given as to why we should support the reduction.  Can he give any reason this year?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year I allocated £5 million to help families with low take-home earnings from work, subject to determining the details of a scheme.  This process proved more difficult than anticipated at the time.  I am glad, however, to be able to tell the House that the Family Income Supplement Scheme, with an annual cost of £13 million, will come <Col N="254" /> into operation in November.  The Minister for Social Welfare will announce full details of the scheme in due course. I do not think that I have made a very direct link between the change in the PRSI allowance last year and the introduction of a family income supplement. The two matters are linked to the extent that both have an effect on the incomes of low income workers. </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>There were no amendments that could be put down to this section so we are proposing its deletion. This income levy follows the youth employment levy of the previous year which was introduced for a very specific purpose, the money to be allocated for the specific purpose of youth employment. It was agreed on that basis.  That is why it had widespread support throughout the country and the trade union movement.  People were prepared to forego 1 per cent of their incomes knowing that it was for the benefit of their children and for the future of young people generally.  It was so successful the Minister then proceeded to introduce another 1 per cent income levy for no specific reason other than to bring in more income.  This started a very dangerous precedent in regard to income levies. Admittedly there are many calls at present <Col N="256" /> for a simplified tax system but it would be highly dangerous to introduce an inequitable simplified tax system and this imposition of income levies is the beginning of that very real danger.  For example, if next year the Minister wants to reduce income tax in a certain area he can bring in another income levy of 1 per cent when, instead of then having a 2 per cent levy on incomes, we would have a 5 per cent levy on incomes.  Then he might well decide to reduce VAT on something else and introduce a 10 per cent income levy when we would be into this simple percentage levy on incomes which would constitute a highly dangerous and inequitable system of taxation.</P>
      <P>The existing 2 per cent levy on incomes, in addition to the enormous PAYE and PRSI contributions we have been discussing, and the enormous VAT rates which have added to the cost of clothing and everything else, is most unjust.  The youth employment levy was accepted because everybody saw it as a desirable objective.  Unfortunately, most of that money has not gone to youth employment; that is another day's work, to ascertain where the money is going. But this latest levy is not designed for any purpose and the Minister can use it wherever he likes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole business of this income levy has got to be stopped and this one constitutes the beginning of the real danger.  It constitutes merely a Minister for Finance's simple system of collecting more money for his coffers by means of another 1 per cent levy on incomes. Therefore it is very important that we block this now.  There has been much talk about the desirability of tax reform, with the Commission on Taxation and everybody else advocating it.  But this is moving into a highly dangerous area and should be dropped even before we move into the tax reform area.  Therefore, we are pressing very strongly for the withdrawal of this 1 per cent income levy.  It is no answer for the Minister to say: &ldquo;Well, if I drop that it will cost so many millions of pounds and we cannot afford this at present because we are all in such a bad way&rdquo;.  That is the answer now advanced to everything raised.  I have <Col N="257" /> given examples repeatedly of other ways in which the money can be raised.  Land tax is one example, a reasonable property tax is another, an equitable property tax to replace the old rates system.  Indeed, there are others I can suggest to the Minister or, for that matter, he might just collect the money already due on foot of income levies, the youth employment levy, moneys outstanding by way of VAT, health levies or even the amount already due on income taxation from the unemployed and farming sectors.  If the Minister were to collect the moneys already well overdue he could avoid the imposition of these levies.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to drop this latest 1 per cent income levy because of its inequity and because of the danger of thereby moving into a whole new taxation system, a very tempting one for Ministers for Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing to be noted about the levy we are now debating is that it was introduced as a temporary measure.  It has been temporary now for two years and, by the looks of things, will remain somewhat less than temporary.  It is important that that be put on the record, that this was not meant to be a permanent feature of our taxation system which it is now becoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to note also that, while it was introduced as a temporary measure, even then it flew directly in the face of what the Commission on Taxation were recommending when they said, very specifically, in terms that could not be misunderstood, that whatever about increasing existing rates of taxation they very definitely advised against new forms of taxation that would render the system so unnecessarily and unduly complex as to make its reformation almost impossible. That advice was totally ignored. They recognised that there might be a temptation for a Minister to introduce taxation here or there but they specifically advised against new forms of taxation. The Minister has found a new form of taxation and, as Deputy Mac Giolla has said, this time it was not said to be for any specific purpose whereas the previous levy was stated to be for youth <Col N="258" /> employment.  Quite frankly, this latest levy constitutes a means of getting in money.</P>
    <P>I cannot revert to 1980 to draw a comparison, much less 1979, because we did not have any such levies then.  We had not then dreamt up this idea.  It was started in 1982.  The Minister has raised the contributions from levies from £34 million in 1982 to £153 million this year. Let us call it a tax because that is what it is.  This constitutes the largest single increase in terms of taxation, an increase of nearly 500 per cent, a huge increase. That is another of the irritants affecting everybody, particularly employees, in a whole variety of ways.  It is just another way of imposing tax and it is on gross income; there is no question of allowances. Even if the take-home pay is nothing like the gross income it is 1 per cent on gross income as if it were take-home pay.  All of us know the impact it is having on every employee, the way it is aggravating attitudes towards work, acting as a disincentive to work, indeed the alienation of so many people from their employment, not to say their attitudes towards the Establishment generally.  All of these levies &mdash; and this one is a classic example &mdash; contribute enormously to that attitude at present.  It was Edmund Burke who said at one time &mdash; and I say this without any attribution or implication in respect of the Minister, myself or anybody else who sat in that seat&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Long before we ever thought we would be involved in the political scene that is what Burke had to say.  He was a most enlightened person who knew something about taxation.  We <Col N="259" /> are now moving to demonstrate that taxes that perhaps Burke never thought of can be imposed.  We have all kinds of direct and indirect taxation.  There are the PRSI contributions and now the income levies as well, percentage levies on gross income as if it were net income which, of course, it is not.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the Minister must reconsider. This was to be a temporary measure but it looks like becoming permanent. The Minister is, of course, making a concession in this section by exempting those earning less than £5,000 from the 1 per cent levy.  The administration involved in this concession will cost a certain amount of money.  If the Minister tells me it will not cost anything in terms of administrative costs to provide this relief of about 50p per week to these people I suggest he should take his courage in his hands and get rid of the levy. Any kind of concession seems to be an acknowledgement that there are many objections in principle to this levy.</P>
      <P>The youth employment levy was stated to be for the purpose of creating jobs for young people but everyone knows it is not achieving that objective.  We are increasing the number of administrative agencies and their level of activities through interviews, training courses and placement schemes, to such an extent that the Committee on Public Expenditure, of which I am vice-chairman, have expressed grave concern at the lack of co-ordination between all the agencies concerned with &ldquo;employment placement&rdquo;. If the rate of growth in employment in the nation generally were anything like the rate of employment growth in those agencies, the economy would certainly be experiencing a lift.  The reality is that agencies, boards and sectoral committees will not create jobs.  Employers will say one of their problems is coping with those who are there to &ldquo;help&rdquo; them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were to leave this money with the people and tell them that they would have an extra 2 per cent in their pockets they would achieve far more than has been achieved by these various agencies.  We have more faith in the spirit of enterprise <Col N="260" /> of the people, be they builders, contractors, farmers or businessmen, than we have in the spread of agencies when it comes to creating jobs.</P>
    <P>We must define the role of Government. Is it their role to create conditions in which people can find it rewarding to go out and do things or should the Government say they know better and take money from the people to set up agencies?  I have a certain degree of respect for the Civil Service but it must be acknowledged that the Civil Service has never had to work in the context of giving employment in the competitive world of trade and business.  We will not generate more employment by taking an extra £153 million from the people.  I would not often quote Ronald Reagan but at least he had a message which the American people understood and it seems to have worked in terms of employment.  The alternative is Deputy Mac Giolla's way &mdash; all the way left, not stopping in West Germany but going right across to Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union.  Let it be socialist&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Not one of them has argued the case for the workers they claim to represent.  They are the ones who want all these agencies.  We cannot afford to see £153 million taken from the pockets of people who would generate jobs if the money were left with them. Many people are investing their money outside the State and we must recognise that we will not solve our problems by setting up boards and agencies at considerable cost to the Exchequer.  Let us give people back their money and the work they will generate will guarantee that the Minister will get a bigger take in tax.  There are 12,000 fewer taxpayers this year than last year and unless there is a change of policy there will be fewer and fewer taxpayers paying more and more tax.  I plead with the Minister to prove that this is a temporary measure by abolishing it.</P>

Deputy O'Kennedy spoke about the current budget deficit earlier in the year and also about fiscal rectitude.  Now he is proposing that we abandon that by <Col N="262" /> deleting a section which would cost the State £156 million.  Nobody would be happier than I to see this go because it probably affects a lot more people in my constituency than it does in Deputy O'Kennedy's.

I do not want to get too personal in relation to Deputy O'Kennedy because I know he is presenting the case as best he can.  It is not very credible to suggest that we should delete a section which would not just increase the current deficit by over £150 million but would throw the Government finances generally into disarray because of the lack of confidence there would then be in the Government's ability to control their own figures.</P>

I understand that when a person is paid on a monthly basis it will be divided by four.  If a person is paid on a weekly basis and is out sick for five weeks will that affect his annual average?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not in any way get in the way of concluding section 10 at 5 o'clock.  I have been, compared with my usual way, rather taciturn today quite deliberately.  With regard to the question raised by Deputy Mitchell, and I believe Deputy O'Kennedy mentioned it earlier, the application of the exemption of people earning less than £5,000 a year from the operation of the 1 per cent levy it is quite simple.  It is a little crude but that is necessary in order to be simple. We will simply provide in respect of people whose income comes entirely from remuneration, that for employment in any week where a person is paid less than £96 by his employer no deduction on foot of the 1 per cent levy will be made.  It is quite conceivable that an employee at work would find himself some weeks of the year not paying the levy and in other weeks paying it.  If he is paid on a fortnightly basis, anytime he is paid less than £192 in that fortnight he will not pay the levy and so on on the monthly side.  When we are talking about a self-employed person we will have to wait until the end of the year to see if during the course of that year that persons's income exceeded £5,000.  If it exceeds £5,000 he is liable to pay the 1 per cent levy.  If it does not exceed £5,000 he is not liable to pay the levy.</P>

It is £40 million in 1984 in terms of the budgetary side because, technically, we are now continuing the levy in existence.  I have to say to Deputy Mac Giolla that he is again taking the case of intent against me by saying that once this Minister gets a levy in God knows where the levy might go.  Perhaps I am inclined to be a bit too devious about these things but, listening to Deputy Mac Giolla and reflecting on where he thought I might go, it seemed to me that he was almost going to suggest that a good way of getting through the system proposed by the Commission on Income Taxation, so dear to Deputy O'Kennedy's heart, would actually be to keep these levies and gradually jack them up year by year until we came to what we might regard as an appropriate level for a single rate of tax, but that would be too devious a way of going about changing the tax system.</P>

      <P>As I said during our discussion on an earlier section, a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.  If we had to find in a full year £73 million through the normal taxation system we would either have to add an extra surcharge on to the existing rates or we would have to reduce tax-free allowances by an amount sufficient to produce the same income.  I feel it would not be entirely appropriate to do that because once you build it into a rate or into a tax-free allowance it becomes more permanently a part of the system than the kind of levy we have now which, whatever else one might say about it, at least has the advantage that it is renewed from year to year and gives Deputy O'Kennedy and Deputy Mac Giolla the opportunity to make the points they have been making.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned has been awarded a widow's non-contributory pension at the rate of £53.40 per week with effect from 9 September 1983, i.e., the Friday following the death of her husband.  This is the rate of pension payable to a widow under 66 years of age with three qualified children and whose weekly means exceed £20 but do not exceed £22.  Her means derived from a two-thirds share in the profits from a holding were assessed at £20.46 per week.  In calculating her means a deduction of £6 per week for each qualified child was allowed.</P>
      <P>One of the children reached 18 years on 15 February 1984 and in the absence of evidence to show that she is receiving full-time education by day she ceased to be regarded as a qualified child from that date.  The rate of pension payable was reduced accordingly to £36.55 in respect of the pensioner and two qualified children, based on weekly means of £26.46, i.e., exceeding £26 but not exceeding £28. If the oldest child is still in full-time education, the appropriate form which has been sent to the person concerned should be certified by the school authorities and returned to the Department. Payment in respect of that child will then be reviewed.</P>
      <P>A pension order book payable from 27 April 1984 has been issued to the designated post office for collection by the claimant, and she has been notified accordingly.  The arrears of pension for the period from 9 September 1983 to 26 April 1984, less the amount of unemployment assistance in respect of her late husband paid to her for six weeks after his death, will be sent direct to her by payable order shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the claim for a contributory pension the qualifying conditions for receipt of this pension require that there must be at least 156 weeks of insurable <Col N="237" /> employment in respect of which the appropriate contributions have been paid and at least 39 contributions in either the last three or five contribution years prior to the death of the husband.  Alternatively, the latter condition may be satisfied if there is a yearly average of at least 24 contributions since entry into insurance. These conditions may be satisfied on the insurance of the late husband or on that of the widow herself.</P>
    <P>The combined contribution record under the insurance numbers quoted by the Deputy and under the RSI number of the late husband when calculated from his first date of entry into insurance in 1944 up to the last contribution paid for him in 1974, show a total of only 131 paid contributions.</P>
    <P>The insurance record of the widow herself gives a total of 488 contributions between her date of entry into insurance in 1949 and 1957.  No contributions are recorded in respect of her after 1957.  This figure of 488 gives her an average of only 14 when calculated over the 34 year period, from 1949-50 to 1982-83.</P>
    <P>The statutory contribution conditions are therefore not met on either the late husband's or the widow's own insurance. The widow's claim to contributory pension has therefore been refused and she has been notified to this effect.</P>
