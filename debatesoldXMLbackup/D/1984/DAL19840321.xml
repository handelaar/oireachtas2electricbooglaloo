      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, arising from his reported statements to journalists in New York that the publication on 11 March 1984 of a transcript of a telephone conversation would be discussed at a meeting of the Government on Tuesday, 13 March, he will state the decision that was taken by the Government in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the statement issued by the Government after its meeting on Tuesday, March 13 and also to the statement <Col N="2" /> released by the Garda Press Office, indicating that a Garda investigation has been initiated.  The results of this investigation will be reported to the Garda Commissioner and also to the DPP should the evidence collected suggest that a criminal charge is warranted.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I do not propose to comment further on the matter now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that a series of transcripts were published at the weekend disclosing further private conversations?  Did he or the Minister for Justice give permission for these further breaches of the Officials Secrets Act, <Col N="3" /> allegedly with the assistance of a civil servant in the Department of Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Taoiseach's reluctance to answer the question but it is related.  The initial leak which allegedly came from a high Garda source is also related.  In view of the fact that the Taoiseach claimed in the statement to which I refer that the original offence had been compounded, would he clarify what he meant by that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat taken aback.  Is the Deputy alleging that the original leak came from a high Garda source and has the Deputy any evidence for that allegation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state in respect of visits abroad by himself and the Ministers of State attached to his Department between 1 March and 20 March, on business other than official EEC business, by whom they were accompanied on each such visit; and the cost to the State, including air fare, accommodation and expenses of each such person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already given details, in reply to a Parliamentary Question on 13 March by Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, of the official visits to the United States by myself and my wife (from 9 to 16 March) at the invitation of President Reagan and by the Government Chief Whip, Mr. Seán Barrett, TD, (from 15 to 20 March).</P>
      <P>The officials who accompanied me to the United States included the Secretary to the Government, the Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Government Press Secretary, a Principal in my Department, a Counsellor from the Department of Foreign Affairs and my Private Secretary.  The Government Chief Whip was accompanied by his Private Secretary.</P>
      <P>Details of the costs involved have not yet been finalised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down this question <Col N="5" /> to the Taoiseach and to each Member of the Government.  I protest against the way that it has been transferred to each Minister.</P>

      <P>A question please, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach as head of the Government or the Government authorise each of these visits by Ministers or Ministers of State?  When such matters were considered was he or the Government aware of the purpose of each visit or did Ministers undertake visits independently without consulting the Taoiseach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All such visits are authorised by the Government and are all matters that come under my personal purview.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the visits for the period in question were reasonable and effective in terms of the purpose of the visit and the outcome?  If they were undertaken as industrial promotion efforts can the Taoiseach give an indication of any consultations which took place or any successes which followed any such industrial promotion activities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the visits in question were worthwhile and effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will obviously rely on a very short, terse statement like that.  However, he will not be unaware of the degree of interest nationally in trying to acertain the purpose, intention and effectiveness of the whole range of visits by Ministers and Ministers of State.  Can he not say to the House and the public that each such visit was fully considered and examined as to its purpose, cost and likely result and that we will have a report on the results of these visits to justify their enormous expense?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The visits were well justified and well worthwhile in presenting Government policies in the United <Col N="6" /> States, Australia and Britain and in seeking investment, trade and tourism for this country.  I am satisfied that the campaign which we undertook at this time of year was well worth while.  The Opposition are not helping themselves much by carping at the efforts being made by this Government in the interest of this country.</P>

      <P>A question, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Taoiseach makes a comment about whether we are helping I think I have a right to reply.  In so far as the Taoiseach has not indicated the cost of the visits in terms of all the officials who accompanied him, I would like him to indicate that he will as soon as possible, not just in respect of himself but of each of the Ministers and Ministers of State, their officials and any other advisers or public relations officers who went with them, ensure that that cost will be indicated here to the House as quickly as possible.  It is now known and should be available to the House at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That information is always available to the House as soon as it has been compiled and, in reply to questions by Deputies on any side of the House, that information will be made available as soon as it is ready.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If I put a question to the Taoiseach and the Ministers, will the Taoiseach then give me the information as to the costs of these visits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course that information is made available to any Deputy who wishes to have it when it is available. That has been the universal practice in this House.  Because the information is not yet available in detail, I am not prepared to give estimated or inaccurate information to this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of fact, I want to ask the Taoiseach, who has just now indicated that that was not the question that was asked, is he not aware that the question that I submitted to him, and to him alone, was in respect of himself and every other Minister who travelled in the period?  Is that not the very question that Deputy Molloy is now pursuing and the Taoiseach insists that is not the question that was submitted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is not the question <Col N="8" /> before me.  The question was submitted in accordance with normal practice. The relevant parts of the question relating to individual Ministers has been transferred to them to answer, as has always been the practice in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will outline the circumstances under which a Garda surveillance van was stolen on 18 February; the progress that has been made in recovering the van; and the contents of the van at the time when it was stolen.</P>

    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will outline the circumstances which led to confidential Garda files being mislaid and their subsequent discovery on Dollymount Strand; and how such files came to be in such a public place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together, as they relate to the same set of incidents.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that a report has been submitted for the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Accordingly, as it would be inappropriate for me to make any reference to anything that might be liable to be at issue in court proceedings, the only statement I can make is a restricted one and I must make it clear that it does not purport to cover all aspects of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda Síochána that they had a quantity of old files that were earmarked for destruction because they were no longer needed.  A Garda van had been used to take some of those files from Dublin Castle to another place <Col N="9" /> where there is an incinerator.  However, the incinerator was not working properly and it was not found possible to burn all the material.  The files had been packed in bags.  Six of those bags remained unburned and were left in the van.  The van was subsequently left parked in a city street &mdash; not by the person who had used it for the transport of the files.  It was stolen and has not since been found.</P>
    <P>The six bags were found at Dollymount Strand.  Four of them were intact but the remaining two were torn at the sides. Later a civilian discovered, on the same strand, some papers that turned out to have come from the bags.  Further searches were carried out by the Garda and some additional papers were found in the vicinity.  Later again, some more were found some distance away by another civilian.  It appears that all the papers found after the initial discovery of the bags had been in the water and had been washed up by tidal action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems a coincidence that this surveillance van vanished on 18 February and it was later on the same day that the disclosures took place in relation to the Mallon bugging affair.  Would the Minister give us an assurance that there is no connection between the disappearance of this surveillance van and that bugging affair, and can he say that the van has not been found as yet?  Is that true?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Life is full of coincidences and I have given the reply in great detail.  It would be inappropriate for me to make certain references in the reply because this matter may be liable to be an issue in court proceedings. I cannot make a fuller reply that I have made, but the van has not yet been found. I assure the Deputy that the date is a matter of coincidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> When the House gave me the authority and power money was not allocated in the 1983 Estimates which were in large part inherited from my predecessors.  The money is allocated now in the 1984 Estimates and as soon as the recruitment of the necessary staff is done there will be no delay in implementing this scheme.</P>

      <P>Could I ask the Minister if in the Estimates last year he returned certain moneys at the end of the year and some of the moneys for staff were transferred to equipment instead as an exceptional measure?  If I remember correctly he had £7.08 million over at the end of the year.  He might agree that the House would have supported him if he had gone ahead with appointing these people at an earlier date.  When can we expect to see these orders put into operation?  Is the <Col N="12" /> Minister aware that many of the crimes being committed at present are being committed by people who are on holidays from prison because of the overcrowding situation?  Will he agree that it is urgent that these measures be put into operation so that that situation can be improved?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I assume that the question relates to non-public duty performed by members of the Garda Síochána under arrangements made by the Garda authorities with organisers of events such as football matches and race meetings who seek their services to perform duties for which they would not normally be officially assigned.  Traditionally, members of the Force have been made available for the performance of such duties and the State has charged for their services.  Nearly all the work is done by members who would otherwise be off duty.</P>
      <P>Compilation of the detailed information sought in the question would involve a disproportionate amount of time and resources.  The only information which is readily available relates to the total amount received each year in respect of non-public duty performed by members of the Garda Síochána.  The amounts received in the years 1980 to 1983 were as follows: 1980, £92,673; 1981, £95,109; 1982, £104,331; 1983, £115,838.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> On the first point, I regret that I have not the absolute detail of information requested by the Deputy but it is not readily available and would require much time and expenditure to acquire.  The records are not kept centrally, it would require getting the information from various divisions. With regard to the second point, this procedure has gone on for many years.  Up to 1952, it was the practice to provide personnel for non-public duties from members on duty.  It is the practice now to look for volunteers and to put off-duty gardaí on this kind of work.  I cannot give a list of the events but, in general, it comprises race-courses, football matches and so on.  On occasion there is obviously a necessity to keep playing pitches and race tracks free from encroachment by the public.  It also applies to where exhibits are on show so that the public will not do any damage. The public also have to be kept from injuring themselves and this arrangement has been enforced for a great number of years.  The Garda have training in all areas related to the commission of crime and crowd control and have experience in those matters.  Obviously, their experience is related to the fact that they have been on duty at race meetings and matches over the years.</P>

Research into the causes of crime has repeatedly indicated that there is a variety of possible contributory factors, many of which overlap in complex ways.

There are many such projects in a similar state in my Department. After the completion of the present stage, namely, the developed sketch scheme, the following stages arise: working drawings and bills of quantities which the committee's consultants will have to complete before referring them to my Department for examination.  On the question of accommodation pending the opening of the school, this matter has been examined by the planning section in my Department.  We have concluded that the intake of new pupils and the overall enrolment in the Lucan centre will not increase to any significant extent next September and that between them the three existing schools will be well able to cater for the expected demand in the general area for places.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that in circumstances where there is a rapidly increasing school-going population, as is the case in St. Oliver's and St. Laurence's, her decision in respect of the pupil-teacher ratio is having drastic consequences? Is she aware that the teacher allocation on full-time day courses shows a reduction of approximately ten teachers on the number that should normally be allocated?  Does she agree that a school cannot operate properly with such a shortage of teachers and that as a result of her decision the education of the pupils in the colleges will be affected adversely?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the educational provision for the students has been affected adversely.  As I pointed out in my reply on 11 May last, the initial allocation for 1983-84 represented a reduction of three teachers in the number allocated for the 1982-83 academic year. <Col N="30" /> I can only assume that the committee are basing their calculations on different figures.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts, as the Minister is well aware, are that St. Oliver's and St. Lawrence's should have approximately ten more teachers than they have at present.  The Minister has granted one extra teacher, which, as I pointed out, will not change the number of teachers at present on the staff of these schools.  Is the Minister aware that there are over 1,300 students attending these colleges, that there is only one remedial teacher for that number of students and that that teacher can only devote part of his teaching time each week to helping disadvantaged children?  In the circumstances, how can anybody associated with these colleges take seriously the Minister's expressed concern for disadvantaged students? Is the Minister aware that subject choices in the colleges have had to be very severely restricted because of her attitude in relation to pupil-teacher ratio?</P>

Is she aware that her predecessor, Deputy Gerard Brady, recognised the special position of these colleges with their increasing schoolgoing population and granted a special increase of 3.5 whole-time teacher equivalent? There is no question about it but that the Minister's decision to grant only one full-time teacher equivalent shows scant consideration for the educational welfare of the students attending these colleges. I would like to raise another matter in relation to this question.</P>

      <P>I am not asking for that. As the Ceann Comhairle has granted me the honour of quoting me on quite a number of occasions in respect of order in the House perhaps he will listen to me on this occasion and I will ask him to give a ruling later on.  The position is that the school year began in September 1983 and for quite some time before the commencement of the school year the Drogheda Vocational Education Committee sent a number of requests to the Minister asking for an improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio.</P>

      <P>I also wrote to the Minister on the matter.  The response of the Minister was unsatisfactory and I put a question down on the Order Paper.  This question is many months on the Order Paper.  As the Minister has stated a deputation was received by her officials about two months ago and there was no result as far as the pupil-teacher ratio was concerned. When the time to answer my question was imminent the Minister decided to grant one extra teacher to the colleges and, as I pointed out, that will simply maintain the <i>status quo</i>.  A few days before my question was answered in the House the Minister wrote to Deputies in my constituency informing them of her decision.  In her letter to me she gave as the reason for writing to me rather than <Col N="32" /> replying to my question, that it was necessary to inform the VEC as quickly as possible of her decision.  In view of the fact that we are now seven months into the 1983-84 school year, that the Minister's decision makes no change in the actual number of teachers in the school and that my question was on the Order Paper for months, I suggest to the Chair that the action of the Minister in writing to Deputies in circumstances outlined by me displays an attitude which is not conducive to the upholding of the status and dignity of this House.  I ask you to consider the points made and to give me a ruling on it.</P>

Leaving that aside, the Taoiseach will appreciate that it is very important to allow sufficient time after the Second Stage to consider amendments on Committee Stage, which constitutes the vitally important element of the Bill.  Will the Taoiseach assure us that there will be sufficient time allowed <Col N="91" /> between the Second Stage and Committee Stage and, equally, that we will have time to debate the Committee Stage in detail here?  I have asked if the Taoiseach would indicate the final date by which the Bill must be passed.  Perhaps he would now do so.</P>

      <P>The Bill must be signed by 25 May.  But with regard to the time between Stages, this is very much a matter for the Opposition.  We will place ourselves in their hands in this respect.  It is very important that this Bill be adequately debated.  We have a problem with the date of the Easter Recess.  Owing to the date of the Easter Recess there is a choice to be made &mdash; and it is a matter for the Opposition &mdash; between taking the Second Stage in the penultimate week before the Easter Recess and the Committee Stage the following week, which leaves rather little time, or, alternatively, holding over the Committee Stage until the resumption after Easter which would compress the Committee and Report Stages in this House, allowing for time in the Seanad, in a way that the whole might be undesirable.  How this is best handled is a matter that we are more than willing to discuss with the Opposition and to take the Bill in the House in the way most suited to the Opposition's requirements.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Any person who, at a time after the commencement of this section when copyright subsists in a work&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  makes for sale or hire, or</P>
      <P>(b)  sells or lets for hire, or by way of trade offers or exposes for sale or hire, or for the purposes of trade has in his possession, or</P>
      <P>(c)  by way of trade exhibits in public, or</P>
      <P>(d)  imports into the State, otherwise than for his private and domestic use,</P>
      <P>any article which he knows to be an infringing copy of the work, shall be guilty of an offence under this subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(5)  If a Justice of the District Court is satisifed by information on oath that there is reasonable ground for suspecting that an offence under subsection (1), (2), (3) or (8) of this section is being committed on any premises, such Justice may grant a search warrant authorising a named member of the Garda Síochána accompanied by such other members of the Garda Síochána <Col N="96" /> as may be necessary, to enter on the premises, if need be by force, and to seize any copies of any cinematograph film or any work including plates in respect of which he has reasonable ground for suspecting that an offence under any of the said subsections is being committed.</P>
    <P>(8)  Any person who after the commencement of this section causes a literary, dramatic or musical work to be performed in public, or a cinematograph film to be shown, knowing that copyright subsists in the work or in the cinematograph film, and that the performance or showing constitutes an infringement of the copyright, shall be guilty of an offence under this subsection.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Basically these amendments are broken down into three parts.  They are proposing amendments to subsections (1), (5) and (8) of the original section 27 and each of these new subsections involves a change in the original.  I would like to go through them in order to indicate to the House their importance.  In respect of the amendment to subsection (1), if a person has offending material for which a copyright exists and in respect of which the obligation of copyright has not been met, then, in addition to it being an offence to make these for sale or hire, to sell them, lease them for hire or expose them for sale, in future as a result of this amendment it will also be an offence simply to possess them for the purpose of trade, in addition to offering or exposing them for sale.  The amendment deals with the technical possibility that under the present law a trader who possesses infringing copies with the intention of selling or hiring them could have them stored somewhere in his premises other than in the display area and could escape prosecution on the grounds that technically they were not exposed or offered for sale even though the intention was that they would be available for sale as and when necessary. This is the only new point in subsection (1).</P>
    <P>As for subsection (5), there are four changes being made as against the original subsection (5) of the Principal Act. <Col N="97" /> These are in response to suggestions made by Deputy Flynn during Committee Stage which I promised to take into account.  Firstly, whereas in the past it was necessary to obtain the consent of the District Court, on the supply of information on oath that there were reasonable grounds for suspecting an offence, to obtain a search warrant, it will be sufficient now to satisfy a justice of the court who can grant a search warrant, not necessarily in the full court but in his chambers, at any time.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it is proposed to make it possible that a search warrant can be issued not solely to a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of Inspector but to any named member of the Garda Síochána.  This named member will, of course, be capable of being accompanied by such additional members as are considered necessary, as was the case under the previous provision in regard to Inspector or higher ranking officer.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, in response to a suggestion made by Deputy Flynn, subsection (5) is being amended to remove the restriction on the time when a search may be undertaken. Under existing legislation, authority is given to enter premises only between the hours of 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. No time restriction will apply in the new section.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, the purposes for which one may apply for a search warrant will be extended to encompass not only the suspicion of an offence against subsections (1), (2) and (3) of the 1963 Act which include making for sale or hire, selling or letting for hire, exhibiting in public, distributing or holding plates but also offences against the new subsection (8) of section 27 which includes the offence of performing in public or providing a performance in public of an offending work or film.  A search of the premises may be undertaken where a performance is being given or where it is suspected that a performance is being given.  The premises may be searched in respect of that offence as distinct from the offence of selling, distributing or possessing plates.  These are very significant extensions of the search powers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="98" /> The proposed amendments will extend the provisions of section 8 which relates to performances.  Where previously section 8 dealt with the unauthorised performance of a literary, dramatic or musical work in public, the new subsection (8) will deal with the unauthorised performance of a literary, dramatic or musical work and also the showing of a cinematograph film.  Either type of performance will now be an offence against subsection (8).</P>
    <P>In these comprehensive amendments to section 27 I have met not only the points made by Deputy Flynn but I have also made other desirable changes.  I recommend the amendment to the House. I am confident it will strengthen the legislation and represents the consensus that was achieved during the debate on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

      <P>What the Minister has done goes a long way to tighten up the section. He has included in subsection (1) subsection (8) as being part of the overall thrust of subsection (5) which I regard as most important in the implementation of the Bill.  The four changes do everything to make this legislation more effective in the interests of all concerned.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister one or two small questions about the rewording of the section and if he would be available to do that.  In the original Act &ldquo;cinematograph film&rdquo; is not defined.  Is there a loophole there that might be worth considering, if not at this time, on another occasion?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, &ldquo;cinematograph film&rdquo; covers the question of a video even in the modern context.  I am particularly pleased that the Minister found it possible to remove the provision that a named particular level Garda officer had to be involved in the seizure or the investigation of the offence and the question about the time during which this matter could be attended to.  That made a nonsense of the effort that might be made to seize the copies.  If the Minister was considering that subsection (8) would be incorporated in the wording of subsection (5) it might have necessitated another change particularly in so far as subsection (12) was concerned.  That was the question of appeals that might be taken to the Circuit Court from any orders under special named sections of that section.  I would have felt that it was necessary to have amended subsection (12) to include subsection (8) in particular, as it would seem incongruous that one could be charged under that section and could not subsequently follow an appeal to the Circuit Court, whereas under all the other subsections one was entitled to do that.  The Minister might be in a position to elaborate on the need not to include that in section 27 (12).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>My officials will be looking at this, but as I see it subsection (12) relates to subsections (4), (5), (6) and (11) under which an order may be <Col N="100" /> made.  All that subsection (8) does is create an offence.  It does not confer an order-making power.  The order-making power in respect of the offences created under subsection (8) is given under other subsections as I read it, namely the subsections mentioned in subsection (12).</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is purely a technical matter, but if somebody is charged under section 27 (5) of the Act, would that person be empowered to have an appeal lodged with the Circuit Court if it is not included in the list&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the normal appeals procedures would apply in respect of any offence.  That is implicit in the legislation and, I take it, in all legislation. What is inferred in subsection (12) is simply an appeal against order-making powers as distinct from normal criminal proceedings.  I will check that.  I think it concerns orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer the Minister back to subsection (4) of this section.  Did he consider it might have been necessary to include any further wording in that subsection particularly where the original Act says, &ldquo;are offered for sale&rdquo;?  Did he consider the inclusion of the words, &ldquo;or hire&rdquo; in that section? As I explained on a previous occasion, 95 per cent of the trade being conducted in videos is in the hiring of them as against their retail.  For that reason I would have thought that that subsection might have been tightened to include the question of the hiring of videos as against the question of offering them purely for sale.</P>

      <P>I appreciate very much the Deputy's statement that we have on both sides tried to improve the Bill regardless of who is making the suggestion. I would be prepared to look at this possibility that that power could be extended to include items that were being offered for hire as distinct from being offered for sale.  However, I would have to deal with that in the Seanad.  At this stage there is no way in which I can introduce an amendment unless by consent here to introduce an oral amendment, but that is rather a risky proceeding to engage in in a matter as important as this.  All I can say is that I will look at that.  The Deputy will appreciate that I am not involved in the day-to-day enforcement of this legislation, hence the type of problem that he has adverted to would not normally come to my attention. I presume that if it were a real problem those concerned with the enforcement would have made representations to me asking that an extension of the powers of destruction and confiscation of the offending copies would be made.  They have not done so.  However, I will avail of the opportunity and the time between now and the Seanad debate to examine that matter and if an amendment would be useful to take account of the Deputy's points it will, of course, be made.</P>

      <P>I believe that the Minister has done everything that one could possibly ask him to do in making this section of the original Bill an effective measure in dealing with what has now become recognised as a very great and growing problem which has caused considerable <Col N="102" /> loss of revenue in the first instance to the State, because a large number of these fly-by-nights and illegal operators, of course, make no returns to anybody about how they procure their product or how they sell it to the consumer.  It is also a considerable loss of revenue to the legitimate operators in the field, to the merchants who have been selling and hiring for a livelihood and creating employment in this area.  If this new section of the original Bill is pursued vigorously to the full limit of the new penalties as outlined by the Minister and agreed here, it will go some distance to meet the demands of legitimate operators and it is hoped to bring about a cessation of what has become endemic&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide a revised procedure for filling casual vacancies in our representation in the European Assembly.  The existing procedure <Col N="103" /> is that the Dáil appoints a person to fill the vacancy on the nomination of the party which won the seat at the preceding Assembly election.  If the seat had been won by a non-party candidate both the nomination and appointment would be matters for the Dáil.</P>
    <P>On filling the first vacancy under this procedure, members of the Credentials Committee of the Assembly voiced certain reservations about our system on the basis of Article 1 of the relevant European Community Instrument, which provides that representatives in the Assembly shall be elected by direct universal suffrage.  These reservations were brought to the attention of the Government and the Government indicated that consideration would be given to amending our legislation in order to ensure that the arrangement for filling casual vacancies would be seen to be fully in keeping with the relevant European requirement. The understanding is that any new procedure decided on will have effect from the next Assembly elections which will be held in June of this year.</P>
    <P>Considerable thought has been given to devising a method of filling casual vacancies which would be seen to be in keeping with the requirement of election by direct universal suffrage and, at the same time, would be appropriate in our particular circumstances and would fit in with our unique electoral system.  This has not proved to be a simple problem to resolve.</P>
    <P>The system of election used in this country, proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote, is widely regarded as a most democratic electoral system giving electors the widest choice as between candidates and parties and the greatest measure of control in the election of representatives.  I think it compares very favourably with the various systems favoured by neighbouring countries.  Our system enables the elector to make a complex series of choices and there are particular difficulties in devising a method of filling casual vacancies which will complement this process while satisfying the requirements of fairness and simplicity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="104" /> In this country we are familiar with two methods of filling casual vacancies under the STV system.  These are by-elections in the case of vacancies in Dáil Éireann and co-option in the case of local authority vacancies.  By-elections can, of course, have the effect of distorting the proportional representation of a constituency as decided by the democratic vote of the people at the preceding general election. But whatever different views there may be about the pros and cons of by-elections generally, what we would be faced with here is the prospect of by-elections in far flung constituencies, possibly in winter conditions, in a situation in which the European Assembly seems, as yet, to have commanded only limited electoral commitment.  The unsuitability of the by-election approach to filling casual vacancies in the Assembly seems apparent.</P>
    <P>Maintaining the political composition of the Assembly as established by the people at a general election is regarded as being of considerable importance.  It is significant that none of the draft proposals for a uniform electoral procedure prepared over the years, commencing with the draft prepared for the original six members of the EEC over 20 years ago, envisaged a by-election procedure.</P>
    <P>In regard to co-option, it is clear that straightforward co-option by the Assembly as a whole to fill a vacancy in the Irish representation would not be appropriate. For this reason the arrangement contained in the 1977 Act was devised.  This arrangement is, in essence, a development of the co-option idea with a built-in refinement to ensure that, as far as possible, the political composition of our representation in the Assembly would not be distorted as a result of casual vacancies.  The arrangement had the support of all parties.  The House will recall that it was originally included in a Bill sponsored by the Coalition Government and, following the general election of 1977, was repeated in the Bill introduced by the Fianna Fáil Government.  Unfortunately, because of the reservations of the Credentials Committee, it has become necessary to seek an alternative arrangement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="105" /> Looking abroad, we may note that in Malta and Tasmania, where the STV system is used, a special method of filling casual vacancies has been developed. Under this method the ballot papers of the vacating members are re-allocated, in accordance with the preferences shown on them, among the unsuccessful candidates and a fresh count of these papers under the STV rules takes place.  In effect, an effort is made to ascertain which of the unsuccessful candidates might have been elected at the original election if the vacating candidate had not been in the field.  Apart from the unfamiliarity of this concept from our viewpoint, there are some serious practical implications.  It can, of course, result in a seat changing hands.  A further and basic problem is that under this system parties would be constrained to nominate additional candidates who would be available as potential replacements.  This addition to the number of candidates who would already be required to provide an adequate choice would complicate the electoral process unduly.  This option, therefore, does not commend itself as appropriate to our circumstances.  This same basic problem would apply in relation to other options for filling vacancies &mdash; for example, an arrangement under which the vacant seat would be allocated to the next highest candidate of the party in the constituency.</P>
    <P>Having considered the various options, the Government decided to recommend the arrangement set out in this Bill. Essentially, the proposal is that at an Assembly election each political party and each independent candidate will be entitled to nominate a separate list of replacement candidates who will be available to fill any vacancies arising in the constituency.  The order of names on the list of replacement candidates will be determined by the party or the non-party candidate concerned.  On the occurrence of a vacancy, it will be filled by the person whose name is at the top of the list presented by the political party or the non-party candidate who held the seat at the Assembly election.</P>
    <P>The list of replacement candidates will be published throughout the constituency <Col N="106" /> in the formal Notice of Poll to be given by the returning officer in advance of the election.  It is intended that the lists will also be displayed at the polling stations and they will, of course, be given appropriate publicity by the parties.  The entry in relation to each candidate on the ballot paper will include a reference to the appropriate list of replacement candidates, but the names of the replacement candidates, as such, will not be printed on the ballot papers.  This aspect of the proposals is dictated by practical necessity. The ballot paper at an STV election contains the names of a relatively large number of candidates and the elector is required to indicate a fairly sophisticated range of preferences.  It would be highly confusing and therefore inadvisable, if not impracticable, to add to the ballot paper the names and addresses of all the replacement candidates likely to be nominated under these arrangements.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill sets out in detail how the arrangement will operate.  I will, of course, be very pleased to expand on any aspect on this Stage, or on Committee Stage should the House wish me to do so.</P>
    <P>I should mention that the European Assembly is required to draw up proposals for a uniform electoral procedure in all member states pursuant to the terms of the Treaties.  Proposals were drawn up by the Assembly during its present term but it was not possible to reach agreement at the Council of Ministers' level in time to enable a uniform system to be in operation for this year's elections.  Efforts to reach agreement on a uniform system are to be resumed with a view to having a uniform procedure in place for the 1989 elections.  It is possible, therefore, that the arrangements we are now considering may apply for a single five-year term only.</P>
    <P>The opportunity of this Bill has been taken to propose certain amendments to the European Assembly Elections Act, 1977.  The most important is contained in section 2 of the Bill, which provides that a person holding the office of Attorney General shall not be eligible for election to the Assembly and that holding office as Ceann Comhairle or Leas-Cheann <Col N="107" /> Comhairle of the Dáil, Cathaoirleach or Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad, or Minister of State, will be incompatible with membership of the Assembly.  As the House is aware, members of the Government may not, under the European Community instrument, be members of the Assembly.  I am sure the House will agree that it is desirable that the position in regard to the other offices referred to should be clarified.</P>
    <P>I should also call attention to section 7 (b) of the Bill which provides that the verification of ballot paper accounts will be carried out in each county and county borough rather than at European constituency level.  The advice of the returning officers is that this is the most convenient arrangement.  I would emphasise that this relates only to the verification of ballot paper accounts.  The actual counting of the votes will, of course, take place at a single centre in each constituency.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their attention and commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 1 of the Act of 20 September 1976, concerning the election of the representatives of the European Parliament, states that the representatives in the Assembly of the peoples of the states brought together in the Community shall be elected by direct universal suffrage.  It is clear, therefore, that the onus is on each member country to lay down appropriate procedures for filling seats in the European Parliament and any vacancies that may arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well known that the Committee on the Verification of Credentials expressed very serious reservations concerning the method of replacement of Irish members who had resigned.  I am referring to the appointment of Deputy Cluskey to replace Deputy O'Leary who was resigning and the appointment of Deputy Treacy and Deputy Pattison to replace Deputy Desmond and Deputy Kavanagh.  Those resignations and the proposed filling of them caused serious reservations to be expressed by the verification of credentials committee.  We accept, therefore, that it is necessary to alter the law here in regard to the replacement <Col N="108" /> of members of the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have no objection in principle to the method proposed in the Bill for the filling of vacancies in the European Parliament.  However, we strongly object to the limiting of the number of names on the replacement candidates list to the number of candidates plus two, which is proposed in the Bill.  In other words, in the constituency of Connacht-Ulster, where my party have decided to put forward two candidates.  Being a registered political party, we would be entitled to have a substitute list consisting of the number of candidates, two, in relation to the number of candidates we had selected, and two others to be added, giving a list of four names.  In practice, I am sure the House will accept, it is most likely that each political party nominating more than one candidate in a European constituency will name each of those candidates on the replacement list.  Where a political party nominates two candidates to contest a constituency they will most likely name the same two candidates on the replacement list, thus allowing the addition of only two more replacement candidates to fill the quota of four.  If the two candidates succeed in getting elected there will, in effect, be only two names remaining on the replacement list, which is merely a one for one situation.</P>
    <P>If the experience of the Irish Labour Party is anything to go by, a situation could arise where a vacancy following the resignation of a Fianna Fáil candidate would be filled by the Government of the day with the name of a candidate taken off the Fine Gael or Labour Party replacement list.  We cannot accept such a proposition and we cannot understand how the Government arrived at this decision because they have advanced no valid reason as to why the replacement list should be limited in the number as proposed.  This proposal bears no relationship to the position which obtains in other European Community countries where long lists of candidates and supplementary lists are drawn up prior to the election.  In each country some provision is made for the filling of vacancies even when the list of party substitute candidates <Col N="109" /> has been exhausted.  No such provision is being made for Ireland.</P>
    <P>In this legislation a Fianna Fáil vacancy could be handed by the Government to a Fine Gael or Labour Party representative. It is very hard to understand how the Government thought we would agree to that system.  I should like to give some examples of the position which obtains in other European countries.  In Germany there are two lists, a substitute candidate on a party list and also provision for selecting the highest placed candidate on a party list.  In Germany, where an elected candidate dies or declines acceptance of election or where a member dies or otherwise subsequently retires from the European Parliament, the law states that the seat shall be taken by his substitute candidate.  However, where no substitute candidate has been nominated or the substitute candidate has previously retired or later retires, the seat shall be taken by the next candidate not yet to have been declared elected on the election proposal for which the retiring member or candidate stood at the election. For the purposes of succession candidates and substitute candidates who have withdrawn from the party or political organisation since the dates of adoption of the election proposals shall not be considered, but where the list is exhausted the seat shall remain vacant.  Therefore, there is no provision in German legislation to allow opposition parties to fill the vacant seats in the European Parliament created by the resignation or otherwise of a member of another political party.</P>
    <P>In Italy replacement must be from the same party and the same constituency list.  Any seat which falls vacant for whatever reason during the exercise of the mandate shall be assigned by the national election office to the next candidate on the same list and for the same constituency as the originally elected candidate. Similarly, in Greece, where the replacement list is exhausted, they must hold a by-election which ensures that the party which had the seat has an opportunity of holding on to it.  I am quoting these cases to give an indication that there are other ways and that our fellow member countries of the European Parliament have <Col N="110" /> not adopted the system which is proposed by our Government.</P>
    <P>In Greece the position is that seats of Greek representatives of the European Parliament which for one reason or another fall vacant shall be filled by the substitutes from the same list in the order in which they were declared.  In cases where there are no substitutes, as described in the preceding paragraph, or in cases where their numbers have been exhausted, a supplementary election shall be held to which all the provisions of the present law shall apply by analogy.  During this supplementary election the lists referred to in Article 3 of the present law shall contain up to three times as many candidates as the number of seats vacant.</P>
    <P>Seats of Greek representatives in the European Parliament falling vacant within the last year of the parliamentary period shall not be filled by supplementary election as long as the number of vacant seats does not exceed one quarter of the total number of Greek representatives.</P>
    <P>I am quoting the position in other countries to show that none of the other member countries would tolerate a situation where a vacancy would be filled by a member of another political party. There is no real justification for limiting the number of names on the replacement list.  I am surprised that the Minister omitted to make any substantial reference to the whole question of the replacement list and the numbers that may be contained in it.  If the Government insist on a limit, at least four more than the number of candidates should be allowed. For example, where a registered political party have two candidates on the ballot paper they would have six names on the replacement list.  This would not always mean six replacements were available because of the likelihood of the two ballot paper candidates being the first two names on the replacement list.  As proposed in the Bill, the unregistered political party has an advantage over the registered political party.  If an unregistered party puts up two candidates in the same constitutency the party could name six substitutes as against a likely four substitutes <Col N="111" /> in the case of a registered political party.  A non-party candidate would not be his own substitute.  Of course, he could be a substitute on his colleague's replacement list which might equalise things somewhat.</P>
    <P>It all depends on the extent that parties see any advantage in having well-established names on replacement lists to attract support for the ballot paper candidate. In former times it was considered an advantage to a candidate to have the name of his proposer and seconder printed on the ballot paper and often it was printed on his election literature to show he had the support of people of standing in the community who could command electoral support for the candidate. He was not then seen to stand in his own right but was seen to have clear electoral support of other persons of influence in the community.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that political parties will see some advantage in choosing appropriate names for their replacement lists.  This is particularly the case when the constituencies are large, covering several counties, where no one candidate can expect to have great personal support in every part of every county throughout the constitutency.  It will prove advantageous to candidates who have been nominated to contest this election to have people standing as replacement candidates with them.  It will attract support for an individual candidate and his party, particularly where a large county with a substantial number of voters does not have a candidate from that county.</P>
    <P>It seems strange to me that the unregistered political party, which is to be deemed non-party for the purpose of this election, appears to have an equal or even greater advantage than the established political parties.  I do not think the House would support such a position. Therefore, I urge the Minister to change that part of the Bill, to provide either for an unlimited number on the replacement list or, if he considers it has to be limited, it should be extended from plus two to plus four.</P>
    <P>I do not see how the Minister can argue in favour of his Bill, as presented to the <Col N="112" /> House, that the number should be limited to two.  He has personal experience of the replacement procedure which has operated here up to now.  He knows of the difficulties encountered by the people who were nominated to replace him in having their membership of the European Parliament confirmed.</P>
    <P>At the time of the next general election those who are Members of this House and who succeed in being elected to the European Parliament may be faced with a decision as to whether they will continue membership of the European Parliament. The Minister, as a member of the European Parliament, will recall that when he was about to be nominated as a member of the Government he was disqualified from continuing his membership of the European Parliament.  He had to relinquish that membership and he was replaced.  The possibilities I am mentioning are not unrealistic.</P>
    <P>The situation where a major political party of the size of the Fianna Fáil Party would be limited to having two other names on our replacement list in respect of the Connacht-Ulster constituency &mdash; I will quote that constituency as it is the one with which I am the most familiar &mdash; other than the two people who will be selected at our convention would not be satisfactory.  If we succeeded in having two people elected and if both had to resign, their replacements would be clear.  However, once they became members of the European Parliament Fianna Fáil would have exhausted their replacement list and in the event of either of the people having to resign we would not have any name left on our list.  According to this Bill, the Government &mdash; I assume the present Government will still be in power for the purpose of this example &mdash; will be able to pick someone from the Fine Gael list or the Labour Party list to replace one of the seats won by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>The whole situation is ludicrous and I do not understand how the Minister thought the House would agree to such a proposal.  It is a very political proposal and if the Government thought they would get away with it without it being exposed they must have a strange belief <Col N="113" /> in our approach to politics.  As party spokesman I consider it important to highlight the possibilities.  We do not want to enter into a political wrangle over a simple procedural matter.  We do not want a long haggle between the Government and the Opposition on a matter of this kind.  It should not take up the time of the House for any great length of time. We should be mature enough to agree to a system that is acceptable to all sides and vote it into legislation without any disagreement.</P>
    <P>There is no way we could give our support to the notion that the replacement list be confined to the number of candidates plus two.  Personally, I do not know why there should be any limit.  It does not matter if there are six, ten or 20 names on the list.  It is not going to make any difference with regard to people having to resign.  However, if people give a mandate to a party it is important that that mandate be represented in the parliament to which the candidates are elected.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to give some indication, through intervention in the debate at this stage or through some subsequent speaker from the Government side at a later stage, that he will agree to amend the section that contains this proposal. Otherwise, we will fight this tooth and nail and we will delay the passage of the Bill through the Dáil.  That should be unnecessary, but we have to get our point home to the Government.  We will use whatever parliamentary means are available. However, we should not be forced into a situation where we have to fight for this kind of principle.</P>
    <P>This is a matter which should be decided by the electorate, not by the Government through legislation.  If the people make their choice in a democratic election using our PR system the will of the electorate as expressed in the votes cast and the quotas given to the various candidates should be maintained throughout the life of the Parliament where those people will sit; otherwise there must be a by-election system.  I cannot understand the validity the Government see in their proposal to limit the number of substitute candidates to <Col N="114" /> two, particularly in the manner in which it will affect a large party of the size of the Fianna Fáil Party on whose behalf I am speaking.</P>
    <P>It is the first time I have seen legislation which gives equal status and advantage to unregistered political parties in comparison with registered political parties. With all due respect to my colleague, Deputy Blaney, he will claim to have a political party of his own.  He does not fulfil the requirement for the registration of a political party as laid down by the Oireachtas, so his candidates will be deemed non-party.  Under this Bill non-party candidates are entitled to three substitutes. If Deputy Blaney decided to put forward two candidates in the constituency of Connacht-Ulster he would be entitled to have six substitutes plus his two candidates, that is eight.  If Fianna Fáil put forward two candidates we are entitled to only two extra which makes four.  It is more than likely that two of those four will be the two candidates we nominate.  I appeal to the Minister to cut short a long protracted political argument on this proposal by indicating that he will bring in an amendment increasing the number of replacement list candidates to the number of candidates plus four.</P>
    <P>The situation in Europe is different in some respects.  It is not unknown for very prominent people to have their names put on the ballot paper and having garnered the votes, people indicating their support for them &mdash; well known national figures &mdash; after being elected they indicated to the returning officer that they are declining membership of the European Parliament.  They never take their seats and their seats are passed on to others on the list.  This is the first time we have introduced any listing of candidates. It is clear from the Government's half-hearted attempt in relation to this matter that they have no real understanding of the effects of it.  It should be done in an open democratic way and the Government should not have sought to manipulate the system for their own advantage. That is clearly what they are trying to do here if they persist in limiting the number of replacement candidates to the number <Col N="115" /> of candidates on the ballot paper plus two.</P>
    <P>There are a few other points I would like to refer to.  There is a clause in section 2 which lays down prohibition on membership of the European Parliament for certain persons.  It names the Attorney General and the person holding the office of chairman or deputy chairman of Dáil Éireann, the person holding the office of chairman or deputy chairman of Seanad Éireann or a Minister of State.  None of these people can hold membership of the European Parliament.  I notice in only debarring such people that the Bill allows members to be members of the European Parliament and Members of the Dáil.  It is another matter whether the Oireachtas should continue that system.  I know the Government have avoided that issue and have not introduced any prohibition on dual membership of both Parliaments.</P>
    <P>I know the Bill deals solely with election to the European Parlaiment but I am interested in the principle whereby a Minister of State and other named persons cannot retain membership of the European Parliament and membership of the Oireachtas.  It is time the House enacted legislation which debars members of the Government and Ministers of State from retaining membership of local authorities on appointment to the Government.  I am sure Deputies on all sides agree that it is time that matter was cleared up.  I would like to see something along those lines contained in future legislation because there is incompatibility in a member of the Cabinet being a member of a local authority.  We had the unique situation not long ago when the Minister for Energy, who was then Minister for the Environment, was also a member of Kerry County Council.  I submitted continuously here that there was clear incompatibility in the dual membership. Eventually, following persistent highlighting of this in the House, the then Minister for the Environment agreed it was wrong and resigned his seat on Kerry County Council.  It should not have been necessary for me to have to point that out to a Minister in an Irish Government. Some provision should be made in future <Col N="116" /> legislation to ensure that that situation does not continue.</P>
    <P>Section 3 states that a person's name cannot be included on a replacement list in more than one constituency.  Would the Minister indicate if a person can be a candidate in more than one constituency? If the Minister feels it is proper to apply the principle that a person should not have his name on a replacement list in more than one constituency, surely a person should not be entitled to offer himself for election in more than one constituency? I have not given a lot of thought to the matter but I would like to hear the Minister's views on it.</P>
    <P>We are told in section 4 that the replacement list candidates' names will not appear on the ballot paper and that they will be identified by reference to letters.  I would like the Minister to give more explanation than that contained in his speech about how this will operate. Could he give us some examples?  I understand that the notice of polling day and stations will contain the names of replacement candidates.  Will there be official publications inserted by the election officer indicating the names of the persons who are replacement candidates for each of the parties and the non-party candidates?  I should like to know exactly how much official publicity will be given to those names and what status they will have in election literature.</P>
    <P>The procedures in section 6 for the filling of casual vacancies state that the Clerk of the Dáil will communicate with the registered political party concerned with a view to ascertaining the name of the person standing highest in the relevant replacement candidates' list.  But in the case of a non-party list, the Clerk of the Dáil will communicate with the returning officer for the constituency.  As the replacement candidates are registered with the returning officer I wondered why the Minister thought it necessary to include a section which would require the political party to be consulted in one case and the returning officer in the other.  It seems strange that any distinction be drawn in that matter.</P>
    <P>Section 7 can be welcomed by all sides and eliminates any confusion with regard <Col N="117" /> to the checking of votes and their eventual re-counting.  I should like the Minister to clarify whether returning officers will be appointed on a county basis or on a constituency basis because, if it is on a county basis, then some constituencies overlap counties and there will be need for some tidying up in that matter.  But if the ballot paper counts are to be checked on a county basis, if there are to be local county returning officers, then I ask the Minister to give an assurance that full facilities will be made available at the checking centre for representatives of each of the candidates and the political parties.  I know that when the ballot paper account is being checked the number on the back of the ballot paper must not be disclosed to any agents of the candidates. Therefore, that must be kept face downwards, which allows the party representatives present to do a quick tally by looking at the face-upward part of the ballot paper where the vote is actually marked.  As the Minister knows, it has been a long-established practice that this forms an important part of the election machinery in this country, that the agents be allowed observe the counting of the votes and make their own tallies.  This will enable the county by county tally to be recorded before the votes are gathered together and forwarded to a central counting place.  Fianna Fáil accept all of those changes.</P>
    <P>I should like some brief explanation of the points I have raised.  We accept the principle of the Bill but we do not accept its mechanics under which the number is being limited, as I have already explained.  I hope that in this debate the Minister will give an early indication that he will agree to the suggestion we are making, either that he leaves the list unlimited or, if it is to be limited, that he will increase his figure from plus two to plus four.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and the opportunity it provides us to review the existing law in this matter even though, as the Minister says, it looks as though the provisions of this Bill will operate only for the forthcoming elections if, as the Minister again suggests, <Col N="118" /> there is a uniform voting system for all of the ten countries of Europe in the 1989 Eurpoean elections.  I suspect that the difficulties in arriving at a uniform system, which will apply in all ten countries, will be extremely difficult.  I doubt very much if the system of proportional representation, which operates in most European countries in some form or other, will be acceptable to Britain.  I can foresee difficulties there.  Nonetheless, the Minister, with his distinguished record of service in the European Parliament, is especially well qualified to introduce this Bill.</P>
      <P>We spend far too little time talking about European matters in the Dáil.  I am very glad to see Deputy Blaney here today for this Bill because he has been one of the most effective of the Irish Members of the European Parliament.  It should be useful for us to obtain his views on the practical application of much of what we are talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that the existing situation cannot continue.  It would be easy, as people have done, to blame the people involved or one particular party for the type of musical chairs we have had with European seats over the last five years. But what has happened over the last five years is exactly what was legislated for here, with the agreement of all parties in the pre-1977 period &mdash; the time of the National Coalition Government &mdash; and the period after 1977 under the then Fianna Fáil Government.  Probably what has happened is that the rapidity of changes in the composition of the parliament was not envisaged at that time. Reverting to the debate at that time it is clear that we chose that system then &mdash; which we are now changing &mdash; because it was seen to be efficient, speedy, inexpensive and maintained the political composition of the parliament, and contained the composition of seats as they had been won in European elections.  The fact that it might be less than democratic, that it allowed small groups to make the changes, was not seen then as contributing in some way to a lessening of the popular respect for parliament.  There is no need for people to become in any way sanctimonious about the way in which <Col N="119" /> the system has worked over the past five years.  Indeed it was inevitable in 1978-79 &mdash; when this Bill was last being discussed &mdash; that there would be teething problems. We have had an opportunity over the past four or five years to see, by trial and error, what system is best suited to our needs.  This Bill affords us that opportunity.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat surprised that the Minister in an almost casual way dismissed the most obvious means of filling casual vacancies in the European Parliament, that is by the ordinary by-election.  This is the system which has operated here at national level since the foundation of the State.  In spite of some of the colourful things some of my colleagues had to say recently in this House about the need for getting rid of by-elections, about their general undesirability, that they were time-wasting, expensive distractions that hindered the general work of government, that they lead to rash promises and so on, that they are enormously expensive and indeed they are &mdash; they are especially expensive on the pockets of Deputies who must now, as is the practice, flock to the constituency and there pay out of their pockets for the privilege of taking part in this exercise &mdash; any attempt to change the system that has operated &mdash; even though it was advocated by some members of my party &mdash; is something I would very strongly oppose.</P>
    <P>What we have seen in recent years &mdash; and is one legacy of Deputy Blaney &mdash; is a distortion of the by-election process. We have seen by-elections become virtually mini-general elections.  It would be in the interests of all parties, though not relevant to this Bill, if the whole process could be seriously reconsidered with a view to preventing the type of saturation involvement of all parties in a particular constituency, if we could agree within certain limits on the amount of money spent by parties, if we could perhaps agree that by and large the by-election should be run by the local constituency parties.  When I say I support the principle, I should like to see it made part of the European process.  I should like to see casual vacancies filled in this way. <Col N="120" /> There are very positive advantages to be gained by this type of properly run by-election. In the case of the Euroean Parliament especially I find it difficult to accept the arguments put forward by the Minister against this process.  The Minister talks about expense, about far-flung constituencies, about the difficulty of campaigning during the winter months. But a by-election, properly run, would be especially useful in the case of the European Parliament as a means of bringing home to the voters, who have much too little contact with the Parliament, the issues involved, the workings of the Parliament; it would be a means of bringing a member of the European Parliament into more direct contact with individual constituents.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is much hope that my support for this will be accepted by Government or Opposition. I am surprised that the Minister had dismissed this possibility in the rather easy way he has done.  This point is especially important in that the type of coverage the European Parliament have got from the media in general over the past couple of years has not been particularly good.  For obvious reasons it has been all too easy for sections of the media to trivialise the work of the European Parliament, to harp on the sensational aspects, to harp especially on the salaries being paid and the expenses and so forth without making any real attempt to explain to the public just what exactly the work of the European Parliament involves in the sense of its great national importance to this country or what actually is being done.  In recent times Mr. John Healy in <i>The Irish Times</i> has been writing extensively in a way which is readily comprehensible of the actual day to day work of the Parliament and the involvement of the Irish members and indeed of the great importance to this country of the work which is being done.  I hope this good example from a writer with whose political views I do not always agree will be followed by other areas of the media as we approach the European elections.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Molloy, I am very unhappy with the proposal limiting the <Col N="121" /> number of names of replacement candidates. I do not accept the argument at all that the inclusion of a number of names on the ballot paper would mean an unduly long ballot paper.  There are two points to be considered here: first of all, the number of names which will appear and secondly, the number of names which will be legally allowed under this Bill.  First of all the argument that the names do not appear on the ballot paper because it would lead to an unduly long ballot paper is not an argument which stands up to reason or detailed examination.</P>

      <P>I visited the United States of America from 9 to 16 March at the invitation of President Reagan.  I also attended the European Council in Brussels on 19 and 20 March, where I was accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Peter Barry.  The Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Austin Deasy, also attended in Brussels on the Irish delegation.</P>
      <P>At the outset, I wish to place on record my appreciation of the outstanding warmth and generosity of the welcome accorded to us in the United States.  From the Administration, I met President Reagan, Vice-President Bush, Mr. Schultz, Secretary of State, Mr. Brock, United States Trade Representative, Mr. Clark, Secretary of the Interior, Mr. Regan, Secretary of the Treasury and Mr. Block, Secretary for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>At the initiative of the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, The Hon. Thomas P. O'Neill, I addressed a joint meeting of the US Congress following which I was received by the Friends of Ireland in Congress and was guest of honour at a lunch hosted by the Speaker.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Everywhere the unique character of the relationship between Ireland and the United States was clearly reflected: and everywhere the greatest understanding was shown of the problems and prospects <Col N="123" /> of our country.  In particular the reception accorded by Congress to the address I delivered on 15 March was for me, and for the other members of the Irish delegation, an overwhelming experience.  I have had copies of this address presented to the House, for information.  I hope that in the welcome we accord to President Reagan when he visits Ireland at my invitation next June, we can reciprocate something of the warmth and generosity shown to us in the United States.</P>
    <P>My first objective in making the visit was to affirm the relationship based on history, common interest and beliefs and the closest ties of affection and kinship, linking Ireland and the United States.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I wished to present to the political leaders and the people of the US our analysis of the situation in Northern Ireland; as we see it developing.  I asked that no support or encouragement, direct or indirect, should be given to the use of violence for political ends.  I also described, in terms agreed with the other Forum leaders, the work of the Forum and the hopes we have for it.</P>
    <P>On previous occasions when Irish leaders visited the States there have been dissonant voices.  These were lacking or muted on this occasion.  I formed the impression that the positive efforts we are making through the Forum, and the hope that it is providing for the future, were favourably received.  Indeed, I believe that my visit helped to effect a certain shift in opinion among some of those who have, perhaps, hitherto had a residual sympathy for the men of violence and their methods.  What I said has certainly achieved a better level of understanding of the objects of Government policy in relation to Northern Ireland as the single most serious political problem facing our country today.</P>
    <P>Next, I outlined at many meetings with leaders of commerce and industry the opportunities for further American investment in Ireland &mdash; both as a location in its own right and as a member of the European Community.  I told them that there are already more than 350 American firms located here, representing an investment approaching five billion <Col N="124" /> dollars and employing about one-seventh of the Irish manufacturing workforce. This flow of investment is now being reciprocated in a significant way through a number of Irish enterprises operating in the United States, to the benefit of both our countries.</P>
    <P>In my discussions with the President, Vice-President and other members of the Administration, we touched on the many problems facing Ireland and the European Community.  As Deputies are aware, Ireland will be assuming the Presidency of the Community on 1 July next. What was particularly notable in the discussions was the strength of the opposition expressed to the growing tendency to protectionism in world trade.  The defects of this form of economic nihilism are too obvious to need restatement here. Its most immediate effect now could be to stunt the recovery from recession which is quite marked in many countries, particularly the United States, where the growth rate for the first quarter of the year is put by some commentators at an annual rate of about 6 per cent.  Given the weight of the United States in world trade, this growth must be reflected in the Community and other countries &mdash; if the benefits are not eroded or eliminated by restrictive tariffs or other protectionist devices resorted to for short-term or sectional reasons.</P>
    <P>We also discussed a wide range of issues of common concern including other aspects of US-EC relations, East-West relations, Central America, the Middle East and disarmament.</P>
    <P>I now come to the European Council which concluded yesterday in Brussels.</P>
    <P>The agenda for the Council as presented to us by President Mitterand included (1) Budgetary Discipline; (2) Budgetary Imbalances (including the British problem); (3) Common Agricultural Policy; (4) Own Resources; (5) Structural Funds; (6) Enlargement; and (7) New Policies.</P>
    <P>In the event, since there was no unanimity on the issues, the Council was unable to reach agreement.  The Presidency did not, therefore, issue the usual statement of conclusions.  I propose to touch here on the main issues we discussed <Col N="125" /> and in particular on the issues of concern to Ireland.</P>
    <P>I turn first to the question which is clearly of greatest interest to Ireland &mdash; the proposed milk super-levy.  No one should underestimate &mdash; I think that in reality no one does underestimate &mdash; the extreme difficulty of this problem.  Deputies will recall that I had bilaterial meetings with the heads of State or Government of all member states &mdash; the Deputy Prime Minister in Belgium, in the absence at that time through illness of the Prime Minister &mdash; before the last European Council in December to ensure that the strength of our arguments was fully understood and appreciated.  I continued this programme of discussions at a meeting with President Mitterand in Dublin in February and through other contacts before and at the Council with Mr. Thorn, President of the Commission and with other leaders.</P>
    <P>The scale of the milk surplus within the Community is clearly unsustainable &mdash; with output running at an estimated 106 million tonnes or almost 20 million tonnes above requirements this year, costing the Community budget a sum of about £4 billion.  Because of our uniquely high dependence on the dairy industry it is, in fact, in the interest particularly of Irish farmers that this surplus be tackled, but in a way that will not impede the continued expansion of output in Ireland from the abnormally low level at which it was held prior to our entry to the Community, by historical forces &mdash; by the operation of British cheap food policies, the effect of which was compounded in the post-war period through the introduction of deficiency payments for farmers in the United Kingdom.  In other words, we were simply seeking the application to us of those fundamental Community principles of market unity and comparative advantage from which other countries themselves had so long benefited without artificial constraint and on which their agriculture has for so long based its ability to invest and thus to achieve its present levels of efficiency and output.</P>
    <P>However, irrespective of the basic strength and logic of our case, the negotiating <Col N="126" /> problem posed for Ireland has been a formidable one: to secure the agreement of our partners to the continued expansion of Irish dairy production at a time when an average cut of 5 per cent to 6 per cent was being imposed in the Community as a whole, with production of other members countries being sharply reduced below last year's level, or, in two cases, held at last year's level, without a possibility of further increases.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that, following the failure of this European Council meeting, we are still in a negotiating situation with the crucial decision affecting our dairy sector still to be taken, I am, in the nature of things, limited in what I can say to the House today and Deputies will, I hope, have regard to this fact.</P>
    <P>I can, however, say that the situation which faced us in the European Council yesterday morning was one of peculiar difficulty.  In the course of discussion of the milk situation a powerful consensus began to emerge amongst the member states, with the exception of the Presidency and Greece, that Irish milk production should be held indefinitely at the 1983 level.  A quota, even at the 1983 level, would have involved an increase of 720,000 tonnes on the base figures being used for the purpose of the Council's deliberations &mdash; viz. production at the level reached in 1981 plus 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>It was essential to achieve at that stage two objectives: first, to establish beyond doubt that there were no circumstances in which we could accept such an outcome and that the opportunity to continue to increase production, without the application of a super-levy, at the kind of rate achieved since we joined the EEC &mdash; viz. 5 per cent &mdash; was for us a <i>sine qua non</i>; and second, that in pressing this point not to adopt an unreasonable attitude that could be presented in other countries as involving our seeking an arrangement that would objectively be politically impossible for other member states to &ldquo;sell&rdquo; in their own countries in the face of pressures deriving from in most cases a requirement to reduce production significantly by comparison with last year &mdash; and even more significantly <Col N="127" /> by comparison with the level of production likely to be attained under normal circumstances in the current year.</P>
    <P>We faced two real dangers: on the one hand that our position would go by default if we failed to make a sufficiently strong line and to demonstrate our determination; and, on the other hand, the danger of posing this demand in a form that would unavoidably create such a negative reaction among member states as to undermine our whole position.</P>
    <P>It would, of course, have been easy, and in the short term at least politically very attractive, to have ignored this latter element and to have allowed the interests of our dairy industry to be sacrificed to a fine show of intransigence.  I was not prepared to take this course of irresponsibility however.  My concern had to be to create conditions in which either at this meeting or later we would secure the agreement of our partners to the opening for Ireland of a growth path which they themselves were being required to abandon.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, after a considerable amount of discussion and negotiation I agreed that a Presidency proposal be put before the Council.  This proposal involved a 260,000 tonne increase in Irish production this year &mdash; a figure designed to establish the principle of a 5 per cent annual increase in production &mdash; combined with a review of the Irish milk quota in each of the subsequent years on the basis of the milk situation in the Community and the possibility of the development of new markets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I made it absolutely clear to the Council that there were no circumstances in which we would agree to move from this position and that failure to accept this proposal would lead to the maintenance of an Irish reserve on any conclusions that might be reached on other matters before the Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has always been accommodating in the past when Community concerns or the vital national interests of other States are involved.  It did not seem at all <Col N="128" /> unreasonable to me, in view of the crucial issues at stake for us on this occasion, to ask for similar understanding for our position.  That is why early in the proceedings I had stated formally our intention of withholding consent to the adoption of any measures that the Council might seek to agree upon in respect of other items on the agenda, many of which would have serious cost implications for us, unless an understanding was reached on our situation.</P>
    <P>When this Presidency proposal was rejected by two member states, I made a brief intervention in response to the comments made on behalf of one of the member states that had objected to our proposal and then withdrew from the meeting, leaving the Minister for Foreign Affairs with instructions to withhold agreement in respect of anything else that might emerge in the course of subsequent discussions.</P>
    <P>By this approach we have made it perfectly clear to our partners that we will not be moved from our position in relation to the continued expansion of milk production in this country.</P>
    <P>In subsequent discussion, the Council failed to agree upon another important agenda item &mdash; the so-called &ldquo;budgetary imbalances&rdquo;, involving a proposed payment to Britian of part of the contributions required from them to finance the Community under the terms of the original Treaties and the subsequent agreement on Own Resources which was in force at the time that Britain and ourselves, with Denmark, joined.  Even if agreement had been reached on the British problem there would have been no positive result from the Council because unanimity is required for a decision and because of the position we had adopted in relation to the withholding of agreement &mdash; unless, of course, the member countries which had objected to the Presidency proposal in respect of Irish milk production had decided subsequently to withdraw their objections.</P>
    <P>At the end of the meeting, following the failure to agree on the British problem, the President of the Council, President Mitterand of France, indicated that when he returns from the United States <Col N="129" /> he will undertake diplomatic initiatives with the various member states to see whether there would be a possibility of agreement on the outstanding issues of Irish milk production and the British financial problem if a meeting of the European Council were reconvened in three to four weeks time.  The resolution of these two issues is now equally necessary if there is to be a successful outcome to the prolonged negotiations that have followed the Stuttgart European Council meeting.</P>
    <P>There were one or two other matters dealt with at the Council upon which I should perhaps make some comment. One is the general question of budgetary restraint.  We are firmly opposed to the imposition of any legal limitation on the expansion of Community expenditure other than that implicit in the limit on the Community's own resources but we recognise realistically that a political consensus on restraint in the growth of spending is necessary and have been prepared to agree to a proposed formulation along these lines.</P>
    <P>On the question of Own Resources, a consensus emerged at the Council in favour of recommending to national parliaments an increase in maximum VAT rate from 1 per cent to 1.4 per cent, contingent on agreement on the other matters outstanding.  This was complemented by a political understanding that this increase, to take effect at the beginning of 1986, could be supplemented by a further increase to 1.6 per cent in 1988 on the basis of unanimity being secured for such an increase within the Council. Member states accepted that if such an agreement were secured at Council level, they would present a proposal to their Parliaments for such a further increase.</P>
    <P>The fact that this aspect of the proposed package requires parliamentary approval in ten member states is a complicating element not normally present in European Council discussions.  Finally, agreement appeared to be emerging on proposals to deal with the gradual phasing out of monetary compensation amounts, which, as they operate at present, offer a price advantage to farmers in Germany, the Netherlands and the UK <Col N="130" /> which tends to induce additional production in these countries.</P>
    <P>There should be no illusion but that the failure to reach agreement at this European Council will have negative implications in the short-term for the farming community here as elsewhere, but repercussions are unavoidable if we are to stand our ground on this issue of crucial long-term importance to the Irish farm sector and the Irish economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>Having reached the 1 per cent VAT limit, and with an increase in this limit now blocked, together with interim measures that might have provided additional resources pending the coming into effect of a higher VAT limit, the Community's finances are now under grave pressure.  Indeed, with the Community expenditure at the limit of its resources, the Commission will be forced to take action to cut spending under various headings, including agriculture.  What form these economies will take and just where they will have impact is something we cannot yet know, but I believe that Irish farmers are prepared to take the short-term financial consequences of this situation rather than concede the principle of foregoing the potential of the Irish soil and climate for the increased production of milk in reasonable market conditions over the years ahead.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, some balancing advantages in the short run.  Neither the proposed effective cut of 1 per cent to 1.25 per cent in the price of milk and beef nor the proposed 1 per cent additional co-responsibility levy may now take effect on 1 April.  On the other hand, the benefits of the 3.4 per cent price effect arising from the proposed MCA adjustment will also be postponed.</P>
    <P>Obviously much now depends on whether the President of the Community, President Mitterand of France, can succeed in finding a basis for agreeement on the two major outstanding issues.  Pending these efforts we can only await events. At this point I must express my warm personal appreciation for the efforts made by President Mitterand, not merely in his unremitting attempts prior to the Council to establish a basis for agreement <Col N="131" /> on these two major issues and others, and for his assiduous, skilful and extraordinarily patient handling of the meeting, but also for the support that he has given throughout to the Irish Government's position.  These efforts were, as we should expect, reflected in the efforts which the entire French delegation put into the meeting.  Our thanks are due to them all.</P>
    <P>Deep disappointment and a measure of disillusionment about the Community are inevitable in the light of the failure of this Council and the intransigent attitude taken up by certain countries in relation to the outstanding problems.  The Community has, however, great resilience and has overcome major crises before.  Current difficulties will also, no doubt, be resolved in due course.  I believe that member states are now quite clear that these cannot be resolved without agreement that milk production in Ireland is permitted to continue to expand, and they know that no agreement that does not make provision for such expansion will be acceptable to the Government of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Council of the last two days was a total disaster for Irish farmers and for the country at large.  The Taoiseach has been personally humiliated and rejected by his colleagues in Europe.  After all the talk about total opposition to the super-levy, the Taoiseach's resistance collapsed ignominiously in Brussels, a fact he has attempted to disguise by his silly pretence of a walk out.  He has accepted a derisory concession, an exemption of 5 per cent which does not even cover one year's increase in our milk production; but he could not even get this pittance agreed by those who, he tried to tell us, held him in high regard.  When it came to the point, he was brushed aside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no joy for anyone in this pathetic performance.  Over the last months we have seen a vital national interest, one universally accepted as such by the politicians of all parties, farmers and trade unionists, disastrously bungled. Here let me say that the Government <Col N="132" /> cannot on this occasion resort to that shabby tactic to which they are so addicted, namely, of blaming Fianna Fáil, because on this occasion we made it clear from the beginning that anything the Government would wish to do would have our wholehearted support.</P>
    <P>Is there any need at this stage to reiterate here today that milk production has a unique importance in the Irish economy?  It has been stated that it represents 9 per cent of GNP.  It is the basis of the whole agricultural sector.  Other European countries have nearly maximised their milk production.  We need time to catch up, a minimum of five to ten years.  The milk super-levy will allow developed European countries to retain their comparative lead and keep the Irish dairy industry in a state of underdevelopment. The expansion of this, the most profitable agricultural enterprise in Ireland, and the whole manufacturing and processing superstructure based on it, will be completely blocked as a result of the Taoiseach's failure.</P>
    <P>We do not know at this stage what the final result will be, but we do know that the pass has been sold.  Will the Taoiseach, having given his position away in Brussels, now be forced to settle for even less?  The President of the EEC Commission has already strongly hinted today that the Commission's proposals will not be based on the French Presidency's 5 per cent offer.  It is clear that the concession for Ireland of 5 per cent growth this year is partly used up already.  The end of year review which was proposed in Brussels will be worthless.  Once the major issues are settled now Ireland will have no leverage left to ensure that any concessions are made to us in future years.  What are we to make of a man who, when offered 10 per cent in Athens, refused it and now is prepared to accept 5 per cent?  He should be kept at home.</P>
    <P>I want to recall the different stages in this fiasco.  It all started with a complete misreading of the situation by the Taoiseach in last year's Stuttgart European Council.  Let me quote what the Taoiseach said, when he came back, full of forced bonhomie and false promises from the Stuttgart meeting, where it all began. <Col N="133" /> He said, &ldquo;the Minister and I, with gratifying support from colleagues, were successful in preventing damage to Irish interests in the Common Agricultural Policy.  In fact, a comparison between the proposals circulating recently on that subject and the conclusions of the Stuttgart Council will show a really remarkable degree of understanding and support for the basic principles of Community policy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that, without the benefit of having been at the meeting to gauge the mood at first hand, I pointed out in reply that I did not think the Taoiseach had done a great day's work for Irish farmers, and that it was only necessary to read the list of questions to be examined under the Common Agricultural Policy &ldquo;to realise that they constitute a major onslaught on the Common Agricultural Policy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>How right I unfortunately was.  The Commission soon came up with its proposals, which the Taoiseach declared &ldquo;would be severely damaging to this country and would also operate in a manner that would be inconsistent with the basic principles of Community policy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>From the start the Government's position was totally contradictory.  The Minister for Agriculture was quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 30 July 1983 as saying in the same breath: &ldquo;I hope we will get major changes.  These proposals are not acceptable in any form&rdquo;.  Unfortunately, there was no clear statement of unequivocal opposition to the super-levy.  The Taoiseach, playing his usual good European part, deprecated references to the use of the veto and made it clear how reluctant he would be to use it.  That surely did not go unnoticed in other European capitals.</P>
    <P>The performance of the Minister for Agriculture throughout this episode has been dismal and defeatist.  We all recall him going out to one crucial meeting when he told television news reporters that he was &ldquo;deeply anxious and nervous&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach went to Athens and to London and around Europe.  A memorandum was sent to EEC capitals, and the Taoiseach commented: &ldquo;This has had <Col N="134" /> a significant impact in a number of capitals, judging from the reaction to it&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Irish Press</i>, 2 November 1983.  After a meeting with the Greek Prime Minister in Athens we were told a &ldquo;working alliance&rdquo; between the two poorest member states had been formed.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach went to London, we were told that he left the British Prime Minister &ldquo;fully aware of the problem&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(<i>The Irish Press</i>, 8 November 1983).</P>
    <P>Some very clear and some very public commitments were made at the last Fine Gael Ard Fheis.  The Minister for Agriculture stated, and I quote: &ldquo;We are not going to accept the proposals from the Commission on milk.  We are going to get a derogation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Let me also recall this particularly nauseating piece in the Taoiseach's own Ard Fheis address: &ldquo;For my own part I have already started to take advantage of the friendly and influential contacts I have made during and since my period as Minister for Foreign Affairs to ensure that the Heads of Government of other member states of the Community understand just how serious would be the problem for us if an agricultural policy were adopted which put a stop to the growth of our dairy industry&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the week or two preceding the Athens Summit there was a flurry of diplomatic activity and we were given the impression in our media that all was going well.  At the Athens Summit itself, which was as usual overshadowed by the British budgetary problem, an actual offer of 10 per cent above the 1983 milk production level was offered to the Taoiseach by the Greek Presidency and was turned down. I quote from the Taoiseach's report to the Dáil on that Athens Summit: &ldquo;In so far as the super-levy was concerned, various proposals were made at different stages that would have provided for exemption in Ireland's case up to levels of production which eventually attained a figure of 10 per cent above the current year's output.  We made clear our opposition to the limitations contained in each of these proposals&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It has been calculated that a 40 per cent rebate would have been required over a five year period to give us the equivalent <Col N="135" /> of an exemption.  At that time the Taoiseach was reported to be looking for at least 20 per cent to 25 per cent.  However, in view of his opposition on Ireland's behalf, the Greek proposal in Athens was not further pursued.</P>
    <P>After the Athens Summit there seems to have been a complete collapse of the Irish diplomatic effort.  There were no more bilateral meetings.  The Government did a complete U-turn and switched from opposition in principle to the super-levy to total support for the super-levy, provided Ireland received an exemption.  Then last week we had the spectacle of the Minister for Agriculture throwing in the towel and allowing a package which included full agreement in principle to the super-levy to go up to the European Council.  This broke the most elementary rule of EEC negotiating.  It was actually claimed at the time by some of the media here at home that Ireland had won a great victory at that Agricultural Council meeting, even though it actually cleared the way for the Brussels debacle.</P>
    <P>Here let me recall an occasion, I think in 1981, when Deputy Ray MacSharry as our Minister for Agriculture was in the same situation as was Deputy Deasy at the last Agricultural Council.  I distinctly remember receiving a telephone call from Deputy MacSharry at three o'clock in the morning in which he said: &ldquo;I am isolated, I am alone.  What shall I do? Shall I stick it out?&rdquo;.  I told him &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. He stuck it out and he won and no super-levy was imposed.</P>

      <P>When the rabble have subsided, I shall continue.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach came to the Brussels Summit in the weakest possible position, that of a supplicant, supporting the imposition of the super-levy on other countries and with nothing left to him but to beg for special treatment for Ireland. He would have been in a stronger position if the Government had continued to oppose the super-levy in principle at all times.  But, of course, the Minister for Agriculture had given agreement in principle instead of letting the fight continue at every level.</P>
      <P>At the Brussels Summit we have seen the Taoiseach's reputation and the current favour-currying type of Iveagh House diplomacy exposed for what it is. At the crunch, when Ireland's vital interests were at stake, they were hardly taken seriously.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has persuaded himself, and has sought to persuade the country, that his influential friends and contacts would help Ireland in time of need, as indeed he hinted at the Fine Gael Ard Fheis.  Where were they on Monday and Tuesday?  I hope after this episode, with all illusions shattered, a less fuzzy and more hard-headed approach to foreign policy will now be adopted.</P>
      <P>I believe the Taoiseach's futile walkout from the Summit will have done his cause, and regrettably Ireland's cause, great harm.  Perhaps he realised early yesterday afternoon that his tactics of leaving the matter to the end would put him in an even weaker and more exposed position.  But he should have stayed in there and argued, instead of abandoning the fight.</P>

    <P>I direct the attention of the House and the general public to the portion of the <Col N="137" /> Taoiseach's statement which contains the nub of the whole thing.  I quote:</P>
    <P>Accordingly, after a considerable amount of discussion and negotiation, I agreed that the Presidency proposal be put before the Council.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach here agreed to the 5 per cent proposal before the Council meeting. He then goes on to say:</P>
    <P>I made it absolutely clear to the Council that there were no circumstances in which we would agree to move from this position.</P>
    <P>There are two things which arise from that.  Firstly, why did he do what no farmer would do at a fair &mdash; agree to this proposal being put up before he had some indication that it was going to be agreed?</P>

      <P>No one accepts the Taoiseach's spurious claims that the 5 per cent increase will secure the future of the Irish dairy industry.  They are in total contradiction to everything he and everyone else have previously said.  In fact, we all know that it will amount to a major irreparable setback for our farmers.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the British Prime Minister succeeded in keeping the Summit concentrated exclusively on Britain's position and that the Taoiseach was totally outmanoeuvred.  As far as the British budget rebate, which has dominated virtually every meeting of the European Council since late 1979, is concerned, I think it is time that the Community took a firm stand against British blackmail.  The Irish case, and indeed the case of every other member state, is drowned out by the incessant pressing of British interests to the exclusion of the interests of everyone else and, indeed, of the Community as a whole.  The Irish Government should now support the firm stand adopted by the French Presidency this morning.  No pretence about mutually advantageous Anglo-Irish relations has ever deterred a British Government from opposing Ireland in the Community.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach's problem, of course, after all the changes of stance was that no one at European level takes him seriously.  His acceptance of the French offer has proved them right. The Taoiseach is not an effective negotiator, but, unfortunately for Ireland, it was on Ireland's behalf that he was negotiating on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to waste time on the Taoiseach's American visit.  What was the Taoiseach doing in America all week <Col N="139" /> before this vital Summit took place in Brussels?</P>

We have been told of the gratifying support for various Irish objectives in meetings with all sorts of prominent people in the United States. I want to know what is the substance of these claims?  These are the sort of claims made by the Taoiseach in the course of the super-levy negotiations.  What do they ultimately amount to?  I have only this one comment.  The Taoiseach in all his speeches in America did not once seek support for Irish unity, as far as I can ascertain.</P>

      <P>He lost the opportunity of an historic occasion for once again pressing that claim on American public opinion and on the American administration when he addressed both Houses of Congress.</P>
      <P>Let me now turn to Anglo-Irish relations. It is to be noted that the customary bilateral meeting between the Taoiseach and the British Minister did not take place.  Despite some erroneous reports in one of our morning newspapers, I did not ever attend a European Summit at which I did not have a meeting with the British Prime Minister.  It would appear that the Taoiseach offered support to the British Prime Minister on the budgetary problem but that this went wholly unreciprocated. Indeed, I note that the British Prime Minister openly condemned the Taoiseach's departure from the conference table.  The Taoiseach gets no recognition for all the gestures of appeasement and compliance he has made since he came to office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been constantly told for some time now how friendly and co-operative Anglo-Irish relations are under the Taoiseach and the Government by way of <Col N="140" /> contrast to the unhappy state of affairs that prevailed under Fianna Fáil.  Where was the evidence of that friendliness and co-operation in Brussels?  In a matter that vitally affected our national economic interests, which will have a direct bearing on the standard of living of thousands and thousands of Irish families and that did not in any way directly affect Britain's interests, the British Prime Minister could not find enough generosity or goodwill to support our cause.  After all the Taoiseach's protestations and compliance, the British Prime Minister, far from supporting him, led the pack against him. Will he never learn?  Will he never understand that, no matter what soft words or protestations are used, the age old reality prevails &mdash; Britain relentlessly and remorselessly pursues her own self-interest no matter who it hurts or affects.  I hope that lesson will be fully understood in another context also.  The old people had a phrase which applies to the Taoiseach's situation &mdash; he who sups with the devil must use a long spoon.</P>

      <P>Can we now hope that all the sophistry, ambivalence and self-deception that has oozed out of Iveagh House for some time now will cease and that the cold harsh reality will be accepted: that Ireland's interests are best defended by Irishmen and women and that all the appeasement, the platitudes and honeyed words mean nothing when the chips are down?</P>
      <P>It is to be noted also that the British Prime Minister in opposing any super-levy exemptions completely ignored the interests of Northern Ireland farmers.  I would like to quote from Report No. 41 of the Northern Ireland Economic Council on Agriculture, page 44: &ldquo;The adoption of a quota system implemented by a super-levy on production above the quota would be extremely damaging to the industry in Northern Ireland: we recommend that the government should vigorously oppose the proposed super-levy on milk&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday's meeting represented the most disastrous two days that Ireland has <Col N="141" /> experienced since joining the EEC.  It represents disaster for Irish farmers.  The Taoiseach said in an interview on 26 September 1983 that these were the most important EEC negotiations Ireland will every handle.  It is now clear that he has completely mishandled them.  It represents a complete failure of Irish diplomacy. The complacent assumptions of recent times have been completely shattered.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said this morning that the 5 per cent deal was the best Ireland could get.  He has made a complete fiasco of Ireland's negotiating position, revealing it to have been so much empty bombast. The proposal of 5 per cent is totally unacceptable.  The Taoiseach and the Government have failed the people of Ireland.  It is his duty to go back to the European leaders and say that the 5 per cent cannot be accepted.  He must take some new initiative to put the negotiations back on the rails.  The Taoiseach must accept full responsibility for what has happened.  The much heralded European experience and standing of this Taoiseach has been shown up to be another public relations myth and with its disappearance in Brussels yesterday goes the confidence of the country in this Administration.  The farming population in particular will now, I believe, deal with the Taoiseach and his party in their own way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's speech was not over-packed with enthusiasm, punch or verve or anything that would rally the people behind him in his fight within the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his remarks about his visit to the United States I would be more perturbed about what the Taoiseach does not tell us than about what he told us.  He seems to be inviting US participation in the effort to find a solution to the Northern problem but he does not give any indication of the kind of help he is talking about.  Is it economic, political or military aid?  If he is expecting help from the United States, what did he offer President Reagan or Mr. Bush as a <i>quid pro quo</i>? Naturally, one will not get anything for nothing from the United States no more <Col N="142" /> than from Britain.  The Taoiseach gave us no indication of what he offered in return or how he would persuade America to give us aid with regard to the North. I am glad, however, that he raised the issues of disarmament and Central America in his discussions with the President and Vice-President.  Did he object to the current US policy in Central America and did he voice Irish feelings in regard to what is happening in El Salvador and Nicaragua?  Did he object to Cruise and Pershing missiles being sited in Europe and did he emphasise the Irish policy of neutrality?  Did he mention our policy at the United Nations in regard to disarmament? I hope he did.</P>
    <P>With regard to the EEC Summit, it appears as if the Taoiseach was on a hiding to nothing from the start.  I suppose nobody wants to listen to us looking for money and undoubtedly he had great difficulties there.  I do not intend to criticise the Taoiseach's negotiating tactics; they may have been good or bad, I am not in a position to judge.  However, it is a pity he did not give us more information on the other EEC issues, apart from the super-levy.  The EEC is changing fundamentally in character and the Irish people are not being told of those changes.</P>
    <P>I do not think that Irish farmers know what they have to face in the future.  At present there are 50 per cent more people unemployed in the EEC than working in agriculture.  Yet the EEC has a Community wide policy on agriculture but none in regard to unemployment or job creation for the 12 million people unemployed. The numbers employed in agriculture in the EEC have declined in the past 25 years from 20 million to 8.7 million. The figure of 20 million refers to six countries while the 8.7 million refers to ten countries.  With the proposed enlargement of the Community, the farming population will again increase by 57 per cent and the changes in agriculture and the overmanning which exists in EEC farming is shown when you make comparisons with the USA, which is somewhat overdeveloped and perhaps not comparable.  Nevertheless, for about 250 million people in the EEC there are 8.7 million in farming and in the USA there <Col N="143" /> are only two million people engaged in farming, with a similar population.</P>
    <P>The price support system operated by the CAP has resulted in a huge surplus of butter, milk and cereals.  Recently somebody said it would take 500,000 railway wagons to shift the ten million tonnes of excess cereals.  While the butter consumption dropped by 8 per cent last year, production increased by 10 per cent.  The CAP has resulted in overproduction of certain products and in the underutilisation of land in some regions.</P>
    <P>The price support system has helped to maintain inefficient and unproductive farmers in control of land but it has not been able to stop the inevitable decline in the numbers involved in farming. There are surpluses of products for which demand is declining but the high prices of commodities such as meat puts it outside the means of many families in Ireland.  It is becoming a very scarce commodity on the tables of many working-class families.</P>
    <P>There are huge sums of money going into Irish farming.  From the EEC some £400 million has been given to the industry and the taxpayers paid £200 million in 1982.  However, there has been no improvement in farming efficiency, agricultural output or job creation in the related industries.  Irish agriculture remains the least developed and most undercapitalised in the EEC with the exception of Greece.  Measured by the two most important criteria &mdash; wealth generation and job creation &mdash; Irish farming is a disaster area and this after ten years in the EEC.  Independent surveys and reports have concluded it would be possible to double the present output of agriculture in Ireland.  Such an increase, with the processing of high demand products, could earn more than £2,000 million in exports.  The NESC have estimated that a 5 per cent to 6 per cent growth in agriculture would mean an extra 75,000 jobs in agricultural-related industries.</P>
    <P>However, the Common Agricultural Policy is not concerned with job creation and it is not concerned with regional development which is vital for industrial <Col N="144" /> development.  It is a price support system to protect farmers from the worst exigencies of the market forces.  Even the July 1983 proposals of the Commission for reform of the CAP do not include job creation or regional and social development.</P>
    <P>The IDA have identified the agricultural processing industry as our most important single industry, with great potential for employment and wealth generation.  We see our greatest natural resource being developed to maximise employment in related industries and to provide good quality food at reasonable prices.  Therefore, we support the broad thrust of the policies for agriculture and its related industries of the European Trade Union Confederation, representing the majority of organised workers in the EEC.  The Workers' Party want reform of the CAP.  Therefore, subject to the maintenance of our national interest in the EEC, we will support the theory of the reform of the EEC budget, a question that will dominate the Parliament in Strasbourg for a number of years to come.</P>
    <P>The fact that we are calling for reform of the CAP and increased emphasis on social and regional policy and development does not mean that we agree with or support the super-levy as proposed now.  It is an <i>ad hoc</i> solution, added to a basically wrong system.  It is nothing more than a piecemeal reform and it is not in our overall economic interest.  I stated before that we would back the Taoiseach in his opposition to the super-levy and maintain Irish political unity in opposition to the levy, although obviously for different reasons.  However, the Irish farming community must be prepared for major changes in the EEC.  The interests of industrial workers and consumers must be heard as well as those of the farmers.  EEC funds must go into more efficient development of agricultural production rather than into the pockets of farmers in the form of price supports.  In the current negotiations we were prepared to back the Government's efforts to gain maximum exemption from the super-levy but in our overall EEC policy we are totally at variance with the <Col N="145" /> blind support of the current CAP policy pursued by the Government and by Fianna Fáil.  We will fight for some benefits, both in jobs and in prices, for the working-class who so far have got nothing from the EEC but who have lost everything.</P>

The Deputy is well aware that, with regard to a statement by a member of the Government, I have discretion to allow a spokesman nominated by a party in opposition to contribute following the Taoiseach's statement.  Deputy Haughey, leader of Fianna Fáil, spoke, as did Deputy Mac Giolla, leader of the Workers' Party.  I am working within Standing Order No. 38 and for that reason I cannot allow Deputy Blaney to speak now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying before Deputy Blaney ensured that I would have a full House to appreciate the doubtless important thoughts I am about to impart on this very significant Bill, there are two aspects of this Bill about which I will raise certain questions.  The first is the omission of the names of the replacement candidates from the ballot paper.  I do not accept the argument which is made very strongly in the memorandum which accompanied the Bill that this could lead to difficulties, printing difficulties, layout difficulties and so forth and that the ballot would be unduly long and would place great strains on the credibility of the voters. There is an important principle involved in this.  The replacement candidates mean something or they do not. <Col N="148" /> Either the parties or the individual candidates are serious about the people they nominate as replacement candidates or they are not.  I believe the names of the replacement candidates may be almost as significant as the names of the candidates themselves in making up people's minds about who they vote for in the election. If parties are serious about the quality of the candidates they nominate as replacements, if they ensure that the names of those who are so nominated are people who could step into a European Parliament seat and perform there with distinction, then I believe the electorate to some extent will be more inclined to vote for that party.</P>
      <P>It is the right of the voter to know who exactly the replacement candidates are. The Minister said that there will be posters at polling booths telling people who the candidates are and I know there will be a certain amount of publicity, but that is not enough.  I believe we have reached a stage of technology in the printing industry when it should be possible, without too much strain on the imagination or the resources of the designer of ballot papers, to include the names of the replacement candidates.  It may well be that these names will appear in small print.  So be it.  If it is in small print at least it is there for voters to see, check and verify or it may be possible to have the names on the reverse side of the ballot paper.  Surely there are sufficient people around with experience of design and type-setting to ensure that at least some specimen ballot papers could be produced so that we could ascertain whether that is possible.  I do not like to accept straightaway the view simply that this is not possible.</P>
      <P>The second point &mdash; one raised by Deputy Molloy in a rather surly way &mdash; indicated that there was something devious in the Minister's mind in the way in which a limit is placed on the number of replacement candidates.  The Deputy spoke as though one party only could suffer from this arrangement.  I, too, believe that the number of replacement candidates should be greater.  I do not see the merit in limiting the number as the provisions of this Bill do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the question of the replacement candidates.  I mentioned earlier that when the Opposition spokesman was talking about this he approached the entire question in a surly way in which he seemed to impute bad faith to the Minister, as if the only party which could suffer as a result of this section would be the Fianna Fáil Party.  I was astonished at the way in which he built this into almost a question of principle. I believe the Minister is wrong with regard to this problem in the provisions of the sections.  I believe the number of replacements should not be limited to two or three.  I believe Deputy Molloy is correct, that there could be the type of eventuality he mentioned in which replacements from a different party might well, in some perhaps tragic or unforeseen circumstances, find themselves replacing somebody from another party.  That situation may not be so far-fetched. <Col N="150" /> For example, MEPs fly quite a lot.  If there was a plane crash and if two MEPs of the same party, of the same constituency, were killed then we would have straightaway the replacements on the list with all the places being filled immediately, so that any further change during the life of that Parliament would mean candidates coming from a different party.  I would urge the Minister to look again at section 6.  There is no question of principle involved here.  It is simply a matter of practice.  It is simply a matter of increasing the number of candidates available under the Bill.</P>
      <P>I want to look now at two aspects which the Bill does not cover, aspects at which the Minister might look, if not now at least the next time this subject is raised. What happened here today highlights the matter, and I say this in a constructive way.  I refer to what happened to Deputy Blaney this afternoon.  I would like to have heard Deputy Blaney speaking on this question of the Summit because his European experience obviously meant that what he was going to say would have been worth listening to.  Unfortunately under the rules of the House the Leas-Cheann Comhairle quite properly did not allow him to speak.</P>
      <P>What I am talking about now really is the whole question of some sort of structured link between the European Parliament and this House.  We have had five years of direct experience of direct elections and six years of experience of an indirectly elected European Parliament. During that time we have not, no more than any other parliament in the Community, faced up to what should be the proper type of link between our national parliament and the European Parliament. Matters have been discussed in the European Parliament on a daily basis which are of direct relevance to the vast majority of Deputies here, and there is very little way in which Deputies here can benefit from the experience and vastly superior information of our European Deputies.  This operates also at parliamentary party level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not a question for the Oireachtas but it is a question of linkage of the ability of MEPs to participate in their own parliamentary <Col N="151" /> parties.  That ability is extremely limited, because for the most part parliamentary parties meet on a Wednesday and that is the day on which MEPs are away.  This absence of a direct link constitutes a loss from the point of view of the MEPs themselves.  They could very often feel stronger if they knew they had the backing of their colleagues at home in whatever case they are making in Strasbourg or Luxembourg or Brussels. The absence of a linkage means that the parliament feels more cut off from the national parliament than it needs to be.  I am surprised there has not been more pressure over the last number of years for a closer and more formalised link.</P>
    <P>Recently when a small group from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation visited the European Parliament at Strasbourg we made this point with officials and members of the parliament there, and, while everybody we spoke to admitted there was a need for a much closer formalised linkage between the national and the European Parliament, it is clear no country has as yet come up with some sort of system which would provide access to members of the European Parliament at national level and which would also provide for easier direct contact between Members of this House and the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>In our case I believe there should not be any great difficulty constitutionally or otherwise.  It should be possible to have a situation where Irish MEPs who are not already Members of the Dáil or Seanad should have access to the Seanad &mdash; in other words, have the right to participate in Seanad debates directly relevant to their European experience.  Their European experience would be good for the Seanad.  It would give it some more work to do, but, more importantly, it would ensure there would be the right of access for members of the European Parliament who feel they have something important to say to the Oireachtas, who feel they can make a contribution on a debate which has a European dimension.  I believe this right of access would create no constitutional problem.  The MEPs <Col N="152" /> would not have the right to vote.  They might well be barred from participating in certain debates.  Nonetheless this is something that should be considered very seriously.  It might well add to the quality of the debate and to an understanding of what is happening.  The existing gap is exceedingly serious.</P>
    <P>The other question I wish to raise &mdash; it is not mentioned in the Bill &mdash; is that of the dual mandate.  It is rather ironic that Fianna Fáil who were in the past so sanctimonious in their attitude to the dual mandate should now have done almost a total about turn on the issue.  I think most people would agree now that the dual mandate has become almost a physical impossibility.  I think most would agree that the very existence of the dual mandate brings into question the type of service which those who carry it can give to either parliament.  From the experience of the last five years we have seen that the sheer time available for debate in either parliament is limited. The quality of the performance may be as good as ever, though I am not so sure that it is, but MEPs with a dual mandate are human.  They must be very selective, and I believe it is not good for the image of either parliament that the dual mandate continues unimpaired.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I think the question is not a simple black and white one.  It should be possible not to adopt a too rigid line on this.  It is right that someone from this House, someone who has given long service and who has a wide range of experience, is probably well qualified to give good service to this country in the European Parliament, and it would be wrong to adopt a dual mandate which cut off that possibility.  It would be wrong to bar as candidates people from this House who wished to run for the European Parliament. I believe that would be unfair and contrary to the national interest. There should be a certain amount of mobility between the two parliaments, but I think we will have to draw a line, and draw it fairly soon, and the best system that could be adopted is that those who run from this House for the European Parliament and are elected should be obliged to make up their mind before <Col N="153" /> the next general election whether they want to opt for the European Parliament or to stay in the national parliament.  We are talking about some sort of transition process or mechanism which makes it possible for a person to move from the national parliament to the European Parliament without causing a by-election back here, without cutting off his base at home, but the time will come, and come fairly soon, when that person will have to decide which parliament he wishes to serve and we shall have to face up to this question in the very near future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  Like the Minister I hope it will be a temporary Bill.  I hope some sort of uniform electoral process will have been decided upon by 1989. With a few small changes I believe the Bill is totally acceptable, and I welcome the opportunity the Bill has provided of some debate on some aspects of the European Parliament.</P>

      <P>I do not believe that the proposal which contains the provision for the registration, recording and ultimately <Col N="155" /> the display of whatever number of substitutes, be it great or small, meets the objections of the credentials committee. From my knowledge of the barney that went on on several occasions at that committee on which I sat, we do not meet the objections raised at those meetings of the committee.</P>
      <P>I have little regard for the systems of election in many countries which would try to teach us what democracy is all about.  In most cases their systems are daft.  Their thresholds of 5 per cent are crazy and undemocratic, and I hope we never get around to importing that commodity which these countries have adopted and regard as sacred.  What they have in common is that where they have lists in their system, whether national, regional, constituency or a combination of all, all the people's names appear on the ballot paper.  People of standing are put at the top of the ballot paper although they have no notion of going into parliament if elected.  They are put there to gather votes.  They are listed numerically and invariably are elected.  They have no interest in politics and very often do not believe in the politics of the party on whose list they appear.  I do not know for what consideration they appear.  The people who follow them can be said to have been before the electorate. Although what we are doing seems to be all right in that they are recorded and duly displayed &mdash; perhaps they may be displayed even at polling stations &mdash; I do not give two hoots how they are displayed, if they are not on the ballot paper they will not get over the problems we were confronted with in accepting the substitutes, from Ireland in particular, that we accepted in the parliament over the last four or five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met the present chairman of the credentials committee.  He had a copy of the Bill but I did not.  I only had a newspaper report of it but it was sufficient to enable me to know what it was about.  His reaction was that it does not and will not meet with what he regards as the requirements of the credentials committee.  It would be unnecessary to say this if the Minister had sussed it out and was satisfied that it met <Col N="156" /> the norm.  I do not believe we are meeting the norm.</P>
    <P>I do not see anything wrong with the system we had.  It was eminently sensible and suitable and, apart from an oddball like myself, quite democratic that parties who wanted to replace people should be entitled to do so with the imprimatur of this parliament and there should be no more talk about it.  It is our parliament's business, and if we are not capable of doing it in our own way relative to our system of election, I do not see how any European is capable of teaching us anything, because of the nonsensical and undemocratic nature of some of their systems which they would like to have imposed as the uniform one.  God forbid we would ever have them.</P>
    <P>I do not believe this will meet the requirements of the credentials committee who vet the substitutes from every country, because there is no way that the substitutes, as provided for in this Bill, will be accepted as having been before the electorate.  In my estimation from my experience that is where they fall down. Taking it on the assumption that it does not fall down and that the Minister is satisfied and has assurances which will satisfy him, I hope he will keep in mind that it will not be the same parliament next time, and even then minds could be changed.  That parliament might accept something which the present parliament would not accept, and for that matter what might be acceptable to the present parliament or what they might indicate as being acceptable to them may not be acceptable to the next one.  There is no hard and fast written rule such as our Constitution on this matter.  There is a general belief to which we do not subscribe, and the U.K. are totally different in their approach to elections, systems are totally different, lists are foreign to us and I am not sorry that they are.</P>
    <P>To get on to the assumption that this Bill becomes an Act and is acceptable in its content in that aspect, I feel that a few points are worth making to the Minister and the House on this matter of how many and where candidates are entered as substitutes.  In other words you are doing cross doubles.  The candidates have <Col N="157" /> cross-doubled, or cross-trebled for that matter, by way of being candidates and substitutes, and that is understandable and acceptable.  It is proper that that facility should be there, that they can run as candidates and whoever is not successful out of the team should be substitute and probably first substitute if any justice is being done within the parties, but that is their business.  We should not count the candidates who are crossed as substitutes. I suggest to the Minister that the substitute numbers should be added to those, and not in the manner proposed at the moment.  In other words you do not count them if they are already candidates; there may be substitutes and you add on the appropriate number of substitutes as if they were not named as substitutes, or even where they are not named.  If they are named they should not count as candidates and as substitutes. In other words they should have the extra on that basis.</P>
    <P>We have suggestions here about various matters that might be improved.  I thought that Deputy Molloy went slightly off course, and maybe he intended to do so.  He talked about non-party candidates being given advantages.  I was in a party as long maybe as half the Members of this House and I cannot see where the advantage is now that I am in an unregistered party.  I have a party and I am quite entitled to be registered here as a party except for one little flaw, that is that I retain the name &ldquo;Fianna Fáil&rdquo; in that party and because of our laws, which probably are fairly sensible, the name would be too similar to that of the existing Fianna Fáil Party.  That is the only reason why the party that I represent is not registered. In every other respect we are similar.  We conform to the same sort of rules as did the party to which I belonged in the past and other parties in this House, but where the advantage is that Deputy Molloy talked about I do not know.  Being a member of a non-registered party means that I must run with, after my name, nothing, &ldquo;independent&rdquo; or &ldquo;non-party&rdquo; whereas all runners from each party, whatever the number be, one, two, three or five, have the facility within the electoral laws of having the <Col N="158" /> name of their party after their names.  I have not that facility, but I trade under the name of my party.  I advertise under it, billpost under it, elect councillors under it and I am elected to this House under it.  We fulfil the requirements, but we are non-registered because the name would not be accepted and we are not prepared to accept or to acknowledge that the existing Fianna Fáil Party, big though they may be, are the real Fianna Fáil Party.  That is why we are not registered. We might change our minds about that.  In the meantime, where lies the advantage that Deputy Molloy talks about?  I must ask him, because I find that we have the disadvantages but none of the advantages that the parties have. One advantage that he sees as very attractive he seems to apply to only non-party or non-registered party candidates.  That is they can get all sorts of names by way of substitutes in order to boost their chances.  Have the parties not the same advantage with multiple candidates up and the addition of substitutes in respect of each candidate in the multiplicity they have?  They will be putting one up in every county in a constituency such as mine, Connacht-Ulster.  They will be trying to pick a county man with some allegiance to the parties, no doubt.  Does Deputy Molloy imply that that was general, or was it only in the case of non-registered party candidates that they would avail of this and therefore it would be unfair?  I do not see how it would be unfair.</P>

      <P>If the Blaney Fianna Fáil Party put forward two candidates for Connacht-Ulster you can name six substitutes. The real Fianna Fáil Party who are putting forward two candidates, can name only four substitutes two of whom will be the candidates anyway.  We can have only four and you can have six.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I just try to resume where I left off?  Regarding substitutes, a stage can be reached in which, despite the addition of substitutes over the quorum proposed by the Bill, that list runs out.  It would then not be at all wrong to provide in the Bill &mdash; and therefore in the Act &mdash; for reverting to what we had been doing up to now, in such a very unlikely eventuality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lot to be said theoretically, although in practice it may not be very sensible and certainly is not very convenient, for by-elections.  As often as not, these result in the party which already have the seat not retaining it.  In a sense, perhaps, what we were doing was more democratic and reflected better the wish of the electorate compared with what we are now proposing.  It would be a great bit of sport to have a by-election in the wide territory of all Leinster, Connacht-Ulster or Munster, and even the whole of Dublin city and county.  I am not too sure that it would be a useful exercise and give the results of restoring to the electorate representation of the same outlook as those candidates elected previously under a multi-seat PR system, as is our practice.  Perhaps we should consider having by-elections.  One result would be that there would be much less attraction for Members who had gone to <Col N="161" /> the European Parliament to opt out unless for very good reasons such as death.  I think that is the only time when we had by-elections.  It would certainly preclude someone good and useful being recalled to serve in his Government &mdash; no matter which Government that might be &mdash; because of the possibility that if he vacated his seat and it was to be filled by a by-election the fall of the cards was such that by coming back to serve in his Government the seat would be lost to his group or party.  Therein lies one of the difficulties in going for a straight by-election, even on the large constituency basis.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister in replying please clarify the checking and/or counting on a county basis being provided for?  As I listened to him, perhaps not very intently, there seemed to be a contradiction. I rather gathered that a change was being proposed here.  The last time, as far as I know, we did not have any county checks.  The checking of the accuracy of the number of ballot papers as against the presiding officer's returns in each box or polling station was done on a county <Col N="162" /> basis the last time, but in such a manner that they were then put into laundry hampers and arrived at the county centre in Galway in that condition.  They were then shovelled up on to the various tables and were just like straw coming out of a combine harvester.  That is about as near as one could get to knowing what was going on.  Are we going to have a change there? If so, what is the point in having a central count, such as was mentioned by the Minister? I do not know how these proposals being put forward differ from the procedure of last time.  Perhaps the Minister might clarify the position for me, as I am a little confused.</P>
    <P>There was mention also of the provision, appropriately perhaps in a Bill such as this, although I doubt it, for having more communication between the Parliament Members and the Oireachtas, whether the Seanad or the Dáil.</P>

The question of approval to the contract documents must, however, be considered in the context of the capital available for sanitary services and the large number of fully approved schemes in progress or getting to construction for which adequate finance must be provided.

      <P>Except in the case of persons from EEC countries entitlement to health services in Ireland depends on residence in the country.

    <P>Entitlement of students from outside <Col N="52" /> the EEC would depend on their ability to establish that they are residents.  If they can establish that they are residents they would be assessed for eligibility on the same basis as Irish students.</P>

She will be notified of the outcome as soon as the appeals officer gives his decision.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 480 and 481 together.</P>
      <P>There have been no reports to the Department of any violent assaults taking place at the employment exchange, Limerick, in recent times.  Plans are being drawn up for the construction of a new employment exchange in Limerick.  This will relieve the accommodation problems which have arisen due to the increase in the live register in recent years.  Pending the construction of a new exchange it is hoped that temporary premises will be made available to which certain sections of the existing exchange could be transferred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime all possible measures are being taken to relieve congestion at <Col N="69" /> the exchange.  The signing and paying arrangements at all exchanges are kept under review to ensure that claims are dealt with as quickly and efficiently as possible.  Experience has, however, shown that the present arrangements whereby claimants sign on at one hatch and are paid at another is the most suitable arrangement in an office such as Limerick.  To have signing and pay functions performed at one hatch would be less efficient and would undoubtedly worsen rather than alleviate congestion.</P>

      <P>He made an application for unemployment assistance on 5 March 1984 and his claim was referred to a social welfare officer for investigation.  Inquiries are still being made in this case and when they are completed his means will be assessed and his entitlement to unemployment assistance will be determined accordingly.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was disallowed payment of disability benefit from 22 June 1983 following examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.</P>
      <P>He appealed against the disallowance and was examined on 5 October 1983 by a different medical referee who also considered him to be capable of work.</P>
      <P>His case was referred to an appeals officer who decided that the claimant was not incapable of work during the period from 22 June 1983 to 20 February 1984 &mdash; the date of the latest medical certificate before him at that time &mdash; and was not entitled to be paid disability benefit for that period.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 22 April 1983.  He was not qualified for benefit initially as he had less than the required minimum of 26 contributions paid or <Col N="71" /> credited in 1981-82 the contribution year governing his claim.</P>
      <P>Following inquiries concerning his insurance record since 1981 it has now been established that he has a title to benefit.  However, a person claiming or receiving disability benefit must observe certain rules of behaviour.  He must not do any work unless it is work which is permitted under the Department's regulations. The claimant has admitted being in gainful employment while submitting medical certificates.  Inquiries are being made concerning this matter and when these are completed his claim for benefit will be reviewed.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The precise arrangements for the policing of any particular area are a matter for the local Garda officers, having regard to available resources, local circumstances and other demands on Garda services.  The Garda authorities state that, since the beginning of 1983, five vehicles were taken from the flats complex without authority.  Those vehicles were later recovered.  In addition there were some cases of unauthorised interference with motor vehicles.  The Garda also state that the area in which the flats complex is situated receives regular Garda attention from both foot and mobile patrols.  They will continue to give the area as much attention as possible.</P>

      <P>I have already dealt with the position in regard to general maintenance work which the Deputy raised in Parliamentary Question No. 590 dated 18 January 1984.</P>
      <P>Because of the on-going nature of the correspondence which passes between national school authorities and my Department, it is difficult to ascribe applications for financial assistance towards the building of new national schools or extensions to existing national schools to a specific year.  I am, therefore, setting out for the Deputy a list of the projects and their locations in County Meath in respect of which applications for financial assistance were under active consideration or as in the case of projects under construction, where financial assistance was being provided.</P>
      <P>It is not the practice of my Department to give in relation to individual projects the amount of finance paid, such information being regarded as confidential as between the school authorities and the Department.</P>
