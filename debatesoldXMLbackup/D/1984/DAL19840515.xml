    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the present position regarding the implementation of the Erne catchment report related to arterial drainage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. J. O'Keeffe) Jim O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. J. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a drainage scheme was prepared in 1970 for that part of the river Erne catchment lying in the State.  The scheme was not proceeded with for economic reasons.  I understand that the Commissioners of Public Works have no immediate plans to renew activity on the matter as their resources are fully committed to other drainage projects in hands.</P>
      <P>With regard to the restoration of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal, a detailed survey of the feasibility of restoring the canal is being undertaken by the Commissioners of Public Works and should be available in 1986.</P>
      <P>Work on the design and estimate for the drainage of the Finn/Lacky rivers is proceeding.  When it is completed an assessment will be made of the project's merits as a capital investment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this catchment area was removed from the priority list of the Office of Public Works, that it was examined by two groups of consultants, Stokes Kennedy Crowley and PA Management Consultants in 1979, who produced a report which was directed to the EEC recommending its drainage&mdash; I note that the Minister has part of that report with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy comments, I am aware of the report to which he refers.  I am aware also of his strong interest in the development of this area. In regard to the priority list, my understanding from the Office of Public Works is that there is a priority list there which has been and continues to be maintained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>

      <P>A question, Deputy, please.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Deputy has to say in regard to the support under the cross-Border scheme for the projects to which he refers but I do not fully understand the purpose of his question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in December 1980 the cross-Border committee met a number of Ministers here and senior engineers of the Office of Public Works when they discussed possible problems relating to drainage&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should confine himself to questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes &mdash; through the statutory water levels of the inter-lock channel at Enniskillen?  On that occasion, 18 December 1980, the drainage engineers were asked to undertake a study, examining the relevant problems, so that a scheme could be prepared for implementation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the Deputy to confine himself to questions. He said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and then resumed his speech.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope we are not at cross purposes.  My understanding is that both the Finn/Lacky and Blackwater rivers have been selected for consideration in the cross-Border drainage programme for which EEC funds will be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>But the entire Erne catchment area was the subject of a study and it was recommended that its drainage be carried out as a cross-Border project with the assistance of special EEC funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a major study of the Erne catchment area but this goes back quite a number of years.  The scheme was designed as far back as 1970 covering about 1,400 square kilometres but it was not proceeded with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if the Government have any plans to raise the question of a solution to the Northern Ireland problem at EEC Council level during the forthcoming Irish presidency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will no doubt be aware that the competence of the EEC Council of Ministers is confined to those matters covered by the Treaties.</P>
      <P>I should say that it is the policy of the Government to secure the interest and support of the international community and particularly of our partners in the European Community in the search for a solution to the problem of Northern Ireland.  We have made that clear repeatedly and most recently following the adoption by the European Parliament of a resolution in relation to the Northern Ireland problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy can take it that I will use every appropriate opportunity to ensure <Col N="820" /> that our partners are aware of our position on the problem of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that that is a rather dated reply because, obviously since the reply was drafted, we have had the Forum report which adds an extra dimension to the matter?  Would the Minister also agree that the contents of the Forum report and the thinking behind it should be brought, as a matter of extreme importance, to the notice of our partners in the EEC by the Minister for Foreign Affairs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That seems to be another question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a related question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is big enough to be a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept that my reply is dated because the Forum report has been presented to Governments of all the member states and has been discussed with senior officials in those states since its publication.  It has also been made available to members of the European Commission, to the President of the European Parliament and the Secretary General of the Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the advantages for Irish trade with South American countries that would result from the accession of Spain and Portugal to the European Community; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not anticipated that the traditional pattern of Irish trade with South American countries will be affected by the enlargement of the European Community, since the constraints on this trade are of a different order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Community's trading relations with countries of that region are governed by the preferential tariff arrangements laid down under the Community's generalised system of preferences. <Col N="821" /> On accession to the Community, Spain and Portugal will progressively adopt the same preferential arrangements in respect of South American countries as are applied by the present Community.  Prospects for Irish trade with South American countries may be improved as a consequence of any move by the enlarged Community to develop new commercial relations with these countries.  However, these prospects would be very difficult to quantify at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he will seek assurances that the elections to be held in Nicaragua will be attended by at least one international observer from the EEC; that he will seek guarantees that parties representing all political views will be allowed to campaign freely; and if will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Observers can attend only at the invitation of the government of Nicaragua.  It will be for the member states of the European Community, including Ireland, to consider their reactions if and when such invitations are received.</P>
      <P>Elections are scheduled for 4 November and the government of Nicaragua have stated that all political parties will be allowed to campaign freely.  We welcome this statement and hope that all shades of political opinion will have the opportunity of participating in the elections on an equal footing.  This would be a significant step towards the establishment of pluralistic democracy in Nicaragua.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he intends to raise the safety of Irish fishing vessels at sea and the conduct of submarines in Irish fishing grounds at the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and at the Security Council; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he has any plans to raise the question of the safety of Irish fishing vessels at sea at the level of EEC Ministers for Foreign Affairs meeting in political co-operation; if he will ask the Community to take an initiative to draw up a more stringent code of conduct establishing new limitations on the passage of submarines through EEC fishing grounds; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>Clearly, Irish trawlers should be able to proceed without hindrance or threats to their safety in the fishing grounds around our coasts.</P>
      <P>In the recent past, there has been an increase in the incidence of allegations concerning threats to the safety of Irish fishing vessels from the activities of submarines. However, I should point out that in only one such incident has it been established that a submarine was involved.  In addition, the allegations of which we are speaking have in all cases related to the high seas as distinct from Irish territorial waters.  The right of innocent passage on the high seas is long recognised in international law and is enjoyed by ships of this country as well as all other countries.</P>
      <P>Obviously as the Minister for Communications has recently stated in the House, &ldquo;all craft, above or below the water, must behave with due regard to the safety of other vessels&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have, therefore, taken steps to make other governments aware of the Government's concern that the movements of submarines in the waters off our coasts should be conducted with full regard to the safety of merchant and fishing vessels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Specifically our concern has been made known to our partners within European political co-operation &mdash; and also through the diplomatic channel to the governments of the United States and the Soviet Union.  In addition, my Department are currently examining the most effective way of dealing with this question within the framework of the International <Col N="823" /> Maritime Organisation &mdash; the IMO &mdash; which is the appropriate United Nations body.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State, quite rightly, has made the Government's view known with regard to the passage of these craft.  Did he get any response from other governments, in particular from that of our near neighbour?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the practice to disclose confidential discussions which take place between this country and the governments of other countries.  I can confirm that the Government take a very serious view of the incidents which have occurred, are greatly concerned about them and are taking every step possible to ensure that there will not be a repetition of such incidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State made the point that the Government had contacts with other countries about the passage of submarines but he is not prepared to tell us the response, if any, which he got.  Did he get a positive response from our fellow members of the EEC? The Government seem to be playing down this threat to our fishermen&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>A question please, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Minister of State emphasise only one incident when a craft was sunk and there was positive identification of a submarine?  There have been many other incidents.  Does the Government doubt the word of the fishing community with regard to the other incidents which have taken place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I must stress that it is not appropriate to disclose confidential discussions.  I accept the Deputy's point that there have been a number of incidents affecting Irish and other vessels, including Danish and French.  The problem is not confined to this country and, in our efforts at international fora, I anticipate that other countries, especially those who have been affected by such <Col N="824" /> incidents, will be prepared to join us in attempting to find an international solution to the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>To which countries have the Government made representations concerning these incidents?  Could the Minister also indicate what concrete steps have been taken by the Government to prevent a recurrence of these incidents?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>As I mentioned in my original reply, we have made our concern known to our partners in the Community within the context of European political co-operation.  We have also made our concern known, through diplomatic channels, to the US and USSR governments. We are not taking these problems lightly.  What was the second part of the question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>What steps have the Government taken to prevent a recurrence of these incidents?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have to understand that I cannot guarantee to this House that there will not be recurrence. These incidents have occurred on the high seas.  We are trying (1) to make our concern known to the countries I mentioned and (2) to see how we could have the matter dealt with in an effective way and, in particular, within the framework of the International Maritime Organisation.  Those are the steps we are taking at the moment.  While I cannot guarantee to the House that they will prevent a recurrence, all our efforts are devoted to finding a solution to the problem which will ensure that there will not be a recurrence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that, apart from the elements to which he has referred in relation to the near waters of the Irish coast, an entirely new dimension has been raised by the proposed regime in regard to the law of the sea which involves the high seas?  We have a vested interest in the development of an economic zone into the Atlantic off our coast and we will be involved in what could be very interesting mineral and <Col N="825" /> other developments to the west of our coast.  This is far more serious matter than occasional damage done near our coast, and it involves the whole traditional idea of freedom of the high seas which has now been circumscribed by the law of the sea as proposed.  Would the Minister agree that this matter should be followed up in a far more detailed and planned manner than merely taking account of <i>ad hoc</i> incidents as they arise off our coast?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess I do not see the immediate relevance of the Law of the Sea Convention.  Basically what we are talking about is the right of innocent passage on the high seas which is long recognised in international law and that right is not in any way circumscribed by the Law of the Sea Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is to be development of economic zones, and in our case an economic zone into the Atlantic, the development and exploration of that zone involves knowledge in regard to movement of vessels in that area.  This whole traditional concept of free movement, without information being conveyed between the coastal states concerned, represents a very real danger to the proper exploitation and development of these resources.  There must be a regime accompanying the Law of the Sea Convention of exchange of information so that the free passage of such vessels, which has been the traditional way, is compatible with the appropriate economic development of the ocean zones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is raising two issues.  One is the economic development of the sea bed.  I presume he is referring to oil exploration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there have been reports of sightings of submarines within our territorial seas and within our jurisdiction?  Under the Law of the Sea Convention there is power to introduce legislation.  Have the Government any plans to introduce legislation in that regard?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>On that one I will have to take refuge in the stock reply that it is a separate question.  The steps we may take under the Law of the Sea Convention are a separate issue.  I understand the Deputy's concern but I believe it is a separate issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

      <P>Question No.5 asks if it is intended to raise at the United Nations the safety of Irish fishing vessels at sea and the conduct of submarines in Irish fishing grounds.  Question No. 6 suggests that the matter of submarines should be raised at EEC Ministers level. To widen that into a discussion on new legislation would be to raise a separate question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is Question No. 6. He has not answered that.  He keeps talking about the right of innocent passage. Surely it is nonsense to talk about the right of innocent passage on the high seas when we are talking about submarines pulling fishing boats through fishing grounds in the Irish Sea.  That is an exaggeration as between innocence and the high seas.  Have the Government done anything about a more stringent code of conduct?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs when the United Nation's Charter on torture, which has been under discussion since 1978 and which would make torture a crime under international law, is likely to be signed and ratified; if he supports a proposal repeatedly made by Sweden that an investigating committee should be allowed to visit countries where torture is alleged to be practised; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The draft convention against torture and other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is still in the course of preparation within the UN framework.  At this stage it is not possible to say with certainty when it will be adopted by the United Nations and thereby become open for signature and ratification.  However, considerable progress on the drafting of the convention was made at the last session of the UN Commission on Human Rights and it is my hope that this important international legal instrument will be adopted during the next session of the United Nations General Assembly which opens in September.  As soon as the draft convention is adopted and is open for signature and ratification, it is my intention to bring the matter to Government for decision at the earliest available opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the provisions of the draft convention is the establishment of a committee to oversee the implementation of the convention when adopted.  However, while the principle of establishing this committee has been agreed, there is no <Col N="829" /> agreement to date on the nature of the committee's functions.</P>
    <P>Most delegations involved in formulating the draft convention, including Ireland, are strongly in favour of the committee having a mandatory rather than an optional inquiry system.  Part of this system would include the possibility of the committee visiting the territory of a state party to the convention if the committee receive information that torture is systematically practised in that state.</P>

      <P>Ireland is represented by an ambassador in Buenos Aires and maintains diplomatic relations with Brazil and Venezuela on a non-resident basis.  The establishment of diplomatic relations with other countries is kept under continuous review in the light of our international interests and the availability of the necessary financial and personnel resources.  The absence of diplomatic relations does not preclude our having friendly contacts with South American countries which we maintain through the United Nations and other international organisations.</P>
      <P>Ireland also has honorary consulates in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, Brazil, in Quito, Ecuador and in Lima, Peru.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the relationship between the European Community and the countries of Latin America, there was a significant development in December 1983 when an agreement between the Community and the Andean Pact countries was signed in Colombia.  I attended the ceremony on behalf of Ireland.  To mark the importance which the Andean Pact countries attach to this agreement, the signing ceremony was attended by the Presidents of Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Panama and by the Vice-President of Peru.  The agreement itself will make a major contribution towards the Andean Pact countries own efforts at regional integration and economic <Col N="831" /> development.  It will also allow for better co-ordination of EEC financed actions in the Andean Pact countries under the non-associated developing countries programme and will facilitate the development of trade, industrial co-operation and technology transfers.</P>
    <P>In a separate development, the European Commission will shortly be forwarding to the Council of the European Communities a set of proposals aimed at stimulating relations between the EEC and Latin America.  It is understood that the proposals will cover financial, energy, scientific and technical co-operation as well as promoting trade, training and cultural co-operation.  Ireland will study these proposals carefully and participate actively in the ensuing discussions with a view to furthering Ireland's opportunities for the establishment of a mutually advantageous relationship with the countries of Latin America.</P>
    <P>On the political side, we are concerned at the absence of democracy in some of the countries of South America.  Consequently we welcome the return to democracy in Argentina.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question seems to fall outside the scope of the question before the House.  The question of diplomatic relations with many countries is kept under continuous review.  We are under pressure from the point of view of resident ambassadors, external accreditation and the appointment of consulars and so on, in many areas throughout <Col N="832" /> the world.  Generally, while I would favour a considerable increase in our diplomatic relations at all levels from a politcal point of view we have to bear in mind very much the economic aspects and resources available to the Department as far as any extension of our diplomatic relations is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any cost involved in the exchange of consular representations between nations.  It is merely a recognition of our commitment to friendship among nations.  In this case, in view of the position in Nicaragua, a country with a similar history to our own in the last century, it is important as an act of solidarity with the oppressed people of that region that we exchange consular officials with that country.  My question does not have anything to do with the opening of expensive embassies or anything else but is an act of solidarity with the people of Nicaragua.</P>

Will the Minister agree that the Andean Pact umbrella which facilitates the Community and the Andean Pact countries is not sufficient as far as our potential economic interests are concerned in that expanding and developing region?

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are concerned about the mining of waters around Nicaragua, which can only serve to exacerbate the already tense situation in the region and constitute a threat to the safety of shipping in international waters.  I am glad that recent reports indicate that the mining operation may have ceased.  Deputies will have noted the provisional decision by the International Court of Justice at The Hague on 10 May calling on the United States to cease and refrain from <Col N="835" /> any action restricting access to Nicaraguan ports and in particular the laying of mines, calling for the sovereignty and political independence of Nicaragua to be fully respected and calling on the Governments of the United States and Nicaragua to ensure that no action of any kind is taken which might aggravate or extend the dispute submitted to the Court.  The US State Department in response have said that nothing contained in the court's decision is inconsistent with US policies or activities.</P>
    <P>All parties involved in the tragic situation in Central America are aware of the Government's views and concerns on the matter.  They were most recently set out in an address by my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to a conference on Central America held in University College, Cork, on 27 April when he said that a solution to the problems of Central America must be political, not military, and that such a solution must be based on reform and moderation and on a strict application of the principles of non-interference and inviolability of frontiers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. D'Arcy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am, of course, concerned about the industrial action referred to and its potential danger for our inland fisheries.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the dispute arose on a suggested salary scale in the context of the framing of a staff scheme for the staffs of the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards as provided for in section 32 of the Fisheries Act, 1980.  The regional board staff had sought parity of salaries with their counterparts in the Central Fisheries Board and, in fact, the offer made and approved by me provided for such parity.  Indeed, I consider that in the present financial climate the proposed salary scales represented a very genuine and generous offer and I regret that it was rejected by a majority and industrial action taken.  Even at this late stage I would hope that the staff concerned would reconsider their position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State will be aware already of the inadequate financial resources, of staff shortages and, indeed, of the total lack of adequate facilities which the board have.  Already there is a very serious threat to stocks, especially salmon stocks.  Is he also aware that this further action is now in danger of causing the collapse of the whole industry?  Estimates have been quoted in excess of £20 million.  The Minister will be further aware that the Department have already conceded the parity issue and that what is really the issue here is a detail, that people who have been granted parity will get some recognition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Visit of President of the United States: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That, to welcome the visit to Ireland of Ronald Reagan, the President of the United States of America, and to mark the event in a single manner, a joint sitting of both Houses of the Oireachtas be held on Monday, 4th June, 1984, in the Dáil Chamber and that the President of the United States of America be invited to address such joint sitting; that the proceedings at such joint sitting shall consist of a speech by the Ceann Comhairle welcoming the President, the address by the President and a speech of thanks by the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad for the address; and that the time for such joint sitting shall be 12 noon. </P>
      <P>President Reagan is visiting Ireland in his capacity as Head of State and as Chief Executive of the United States of America. It is our intention that the President should be welcomed in Ireland and afforded the countries appropriate to his position.  Successive Irish Taoisigh have been treated with great courtesy in the United States in the course of official visits to that country, several of which have been made within the past couple of years at the invitation of President Reagan himself.  During two of these visits within the past eight years, two Taoisigh, Mr. Liam Cosgrave and myself, have been accorded the opportunity to address Joint Sessions of Congress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="939" /> President Reagan's visit is at the invitation initially of my predecessor in office and was confirmed and renewed by me earlier this year.  He is visiting Ireland as part of a European tour which will also extend to France and to London, where he will attend the Western Economic Summit.  The visit is valuable from an Irish point of view because of the opportunity it provides to consolidate the excellent relations between our two countries.</P>
    <P>The President's visit will of course focus the attention of the people of the United States on the tourist attractions of this country at a time when we have been failing to secure an adequate share of expanding US tourist trade traffic to Europe.</P>
    <P>US investment here already amounts to £4 billion involving 350 factories and 37,000 jobs.  This visit, if its impact on the US opinion is positive, offers a prospect that these benefits might be enhanced at time when jobs and foreign investments were never more badly needed.</P>
    <P>I know that account will be taken of these factors by all who are concerned for the employment prospects of the present and the next generation, and that it will influence the manner in which responsible people, who may wish to convey their disagreement with aspects of US policy, bring their feelings to the attention of the President.</P>
    <P>The Government for their part will of course take advantage of this occasion to express to the President the concern felt by many Irish people about aspects of the US policy in Central America.  We shall also be conveying our concern, already expressed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the opening of the Conference on Disarmament in Europe in Stockholm earlier this year, and known also to the Soviet Union, that the negotiations on intermediate and strategic nuclear forces should resume, and should do so with the genuine and manifest aim of succeeding, and thereby bringing about substantial reductions of nuclear weapons and conventional forces to the lowest possible level.</P>
    <P>Those of our people concerned about these matters can, therefore, be assured <Col N="940" /> that their views will be conveyed without the need for public demonstrations of a kind that might prove counter-productive. It may be noted in this connection that Speaker O'Neill, who opposes a number of policy stances adopted by the President, including the Central American policy, emphasised during his recent visit to Ireland that the President should be welcomed in a manner appropriate to his office.</P>
    <P>I might add that now that the efforts of the New Ireland Forum have given a fresh impetus to the search for a solution to the Northern Ireland problem it is important to bear in mind the positive role that the United States can play in creating a climate favourable to political progress in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>Finally President Reagan, one of two recent US Presidents of Irish descent, is head of one of the most influential countries in the world, and we regard as an honour that he has accepted our invitation to visit this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party I support this motion and the invitation to President Reagan to address a joint session of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  President Reagan is coming to Ireland at our invitation as the Head of a friendly State.  In our view everyone in the country is entitled to their view of American foreign policy and everyone in the country is entitled to object to and protest about any particular aspect of that policy they may wish to.  Most of the parties in the House have clear positions on American foreign policy, for example on the problems of Central America and the nuclear arms race.  Fianna Fáil do not see that as relevant to this particular invitation.  We believe it is right and proper that the Head of State of a great and friendly nation should be invited to address our Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We, of course, are deeply conscious of the almost limitless bonds of friendship and relationship which exist between the people of Ireland and the people of the United States.  I believe there are many opportunities available to those who wish to avail of them to express their points of view about American foreign policy in <Col N="941" /> any part of the world.  For my part my primary concern with American foreign policy is to have that policy include as a major objective the achievement of the historic unity of Ireland.  This aspect has been given a new focus by the publication of the Report of the New Ireland Forum. I urge the United States administration to give a clear and positive response to that report and to use all their endeavours to persuade the British Government, in particular, to accept the proposal in the report for the establishment of an all-round constitutional conference by the British and Irish Governments for the purpose of setting the structure of a new unitary Irish State embracing the whole island of Ireland.</P>
    <P>President Reagan in my view is being offered an historic opportunity when he addresses both Houses of the Oireachtas to announce in Dáil Éireann the acceptance by his administration of the report of the New Ireland Forum and support for the achievement of a United Ireland and in this way to bring to an end the tragedy of Northern Ireland and to achieve peace and stability in these islands.  It is the wish of Fianna Fáil that the President, by doing this, will acknowledge the great contribution that 40 million Irish Americans have made to the building of America and still make in the operation of the democratic politics of that country.  I am disappointed that in speaking, and I believe rightly so, in this context about the opportunity given to Irish heads of Government to speak to the Houses of Congress the Taoiseach omitted to mention that Eamon de Valera had been afforded such an oportunity. Those, particularly on the Fine Gael benches, who intend, as we are told, to absent themselves from this House on the occasion of President Reagan's address should recall those occasions when Irish political leaders were given the honour of addressing both Houses of Congress.  How would they feel if some particular member of those Houses had felt it necessary for some reason to absent himself or herself on the occasion of an address by an Irish head of Government? That point should be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>We support this invitation and we hope <Col N="942" /> that it will receive the unanimous approval of Dáil Éireann.  I stress the word &ldquo;unanimous&rdquo; because I believe it is something separate, apart and distinct from any of the other issues which may arise in connection with the President's visit.  I believe it would be an important and an historic occasion for Dáil Eireann and Seanad Éireann to be addressed once again by a President of the United States. Let us be clear in our minds that there are many countries around the world who would give a great deal to have the opportunity of having the President of the United States address their Parliament.</P>
    <P>All of us recall with great sentiment and emotion the last occasion when a President of the United States addressed us.  I believe that on this occasion, just as on that occasion, whatever our views may be about American internal policies or external foreign policy the Head of State of the United States of America should be honoured by being invited to address both Houses of the Oireachtas on this occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to oppose this motion.  I hope the House will debate the motion on the basis that it has come before us for the first time and it is something the House should debate, that it is not a <i>fait accompli.</i> Although the information about it was issued last March, it is only now being debated here whether President Regan should be invited to address this House in a joint meeting of the Dáil and the Seanad.  I wish to oppose the motion on the basis that President Regan would not be a suitable person for a number of reasons to address the combined Houses of the Oireachtas and I have grave objection to our marking his visit in, as the Taoiseach said, such a signal manner.  I am not quite sure what &ldquo;signal&rdquo; means in this context but I am sure it means an exceptionally important manner giving him the highest honour the country can give to any Head of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how many Heads of State have been asked to address the combined Houses of the Oireachtas but I think only very few have received that honour.  I do not know whether any other than American Presidents have been <Col N="943" /> asked to address a meeting of both Houses of the Oireachtas so it is a signal and very great honour to give to a particular President visiting the country.  Not all Presidents of the United States visiting this country would be automatically asked to address both Houses of the Oireachtas.  May I point out that I think President Reagan is least worthy to be given this signal honour, first, because of his escalation of military policy in Central America, both in El Salvador, something which is very widely known in this country, and in Nicaragua where arms and money have been poured in.</P>
    <P>In the case of Nicaragua it is openly admitted by the United States in debates in both the Senate and the House of Representatives that the CIA have been carrying out a deliberate policy of sending people from Honduras across the border into Nicaragua.  They have also been mining the ports of Nicaragua.  It has just been announced that our Government made no protest about this.  Now that is a lesser action.  They make their opposition known by a speech by the Foreign Minister.  In fact in the United States itself the Senate condemned the mining of the Nicaraguan ports, so the US Senate takes stronger action in its opposition to President Reagan's policy than our Government do.  Antagonism to President Reagan's action in Nicaragua is shared by a great number of people in the United States and by US politicians who have voiced considerable opposition to his policy in Latin America and therefore opposition to President Reagan's visit here is not seen as opposition to America in any way.</P>
    <P>The second reason we should not be seen to give President Regan any signal honour is because of the escalation and development of a war-like atmosphere particularly the siting of Cruise and Pershing missiles in western Europe which has resulted in a further escalation by the USSR to counter the American placing of nuclear misiles in western Europe, and so the USSR are now placing nuclear missiles in Eastern Germany. This is an escalation of the whole nuclear policy and the CND movement here and <Col N="944" /> peace movements here are the result of President Reagan's policy and we should, in association with other European countries, make it clear that we are totally opposed to this development.</P>
    <P>Jimmy Carter will, I suppose, never be considered one of the great American Presidents.  He was generally just regarded as a peanut farmer but the more we see of President Reagan the more respect there is for Jimmy Carter and the greater his reputation becomes because it can be seen now that he was concerned for the preservation of the human race and he was concerned, something President Reagan does not seem to be, for human rights.  He was concerned for peace though at the time we may not have thought he was doing that much, but it can be clearly seen now that had the Iranian hostages incident occurred during President Reagan's time in office instead of during Jimmy Carter's term of office we would now have a holy war because President Reagan would have gone in with all guns blazing irrespective of the result.  This is the type of situation we are in constant danger of while President Reagan remains in office as the most powerful man in the world with the greatest potential for developing a war-like situation.  Because of that we do not think he is a person on whom this signal honour of addressing the combined Houses of the Oireachtas should be conferred. There is widespread opposition to his visit in the country by a very broad group of organisations.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise here that this opposition to President Reagan is in no way trendy, left-wing opposition.  If I may clarify that, the main opposition to President Reagan's visit is by a group called the Irish Campaign against President Reagan's Foreign Policy.  Apparently there is another group organised by the trendy lefties &mdash; I am not quite sure what their name is.  The former group was established back in March and the first communication I got from them was on 28 March.  It was in the form of a circular and it was probably addressed to everyone here.  That group asked for support. It was a group of eight or ten different organisations which had come together <Col N="945" /> to protest against President Reagan's foreign policy in Latin America.  Now neithere I nor anyone else had any part in establishing that group.  Furthermore neithere I nor my party are affiliated to that group because they will not accept affilitation from any political party.  I have informed them that I support their objective and my party support their objective and their campaign.</P>

      <P>I am making the point that this Irish campaign against Reagan's foreign policy comprises a broad group of people who are opposed to his foreign policy.  They are Irish in their thinking and in their attitude.  Some of them have been involved in the countries concerned and they know at first-hand what has been going on.  They have been working in the Philippines, in El Salvador and elsewhere and they know the situation that exists.  They want to show their solidarity with the mass of people in those countries and thus they oppose the visit of President Reagan.  It would be an insult to them and to the people down <Col N="947" /> there if we should give such a signal honour to President Reagan.</P>
      <P>The importance of American investment and jobs here has been emphasised on many occasions.  We have been told we should not oppose President Reagan's visit in case these jobs would be endangered. The Taoiseach referred to this when he said:</P>
      <P>I know that account will be taken of these factors by all who are concerned for the employment prospects of the present and the next generation and that it will influence the manner in which responsible people who may wish to convey their disagreement with aspects of US policy bring their feelings to the attention of the President.</P>
      <P>In other words, whatever we do we must worry all the time about these jobs, which the Taoiseach listed in his speech today when he referred to 37,000 jobs, 350 factories and investment worth £4 billion. The American firms who have invested here are very glad they have done so because it has turned out to be the most profitable investment they have made in any country outside of America and probably even within America, because they get a 29 per cent return on capital invested.  They cannot get a return like that in any other place.  They can take out every penny and they are delighted to do so.  That is why they came here and nobody was in any doubt about it.  We accepted them on that basis: they are getting the benefit, we are getting some jobs as a result and that is that.</P>
      <P>Therefore, why should we become subservient to the dollar?  Just because these jobs are there, should everyone touch his cap and say, &ldquo;President Reagan, you are a great man&rdquo;?  This subservience to the dollar leads to the danger of repeating here what happened in Central and South America.  They were subservient to American investment to such an extent that now the American dollar can control governments and dictatorships, can control who owns what in Central and South America and can have it under US domination. We do not want to get into that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="948" /> We are glad of any foreign investment here.  If there was more investment from our own resources in the development of jobs and resources we would not be so dependent on foreign investment but even in our present state we should not allow US investment to dictate our foreign policy, our attitudes, our independence, our neutrality and our solidarity with other peoples throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On this issue I find my self in the unusual situation of being in agreement not just with Deputy Haughey but with my own leader also.  What they have said expresses fully the sentiments not just of this House but of the vast majority of the Irish people with regard to this visit.  Those who have opposed the visit have centred their arguments largely on the policies of President Reagan in Central America and they have said that because of these policies we should not welcome the President.</P>
      <P>Perhaps like most of the people in this House, I do not profess to understand fully the complexity of Central American politics.  I have not had the benefit of a fact-finding visit, not even one of two weeks, and I cannot say that I have seen the situation at first-hand.  I am not an expert on the history of Central America or on the multifarious social and economic problems there but two things come across very clearly from the debates on Central America and from all that has been written and said about that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point is that there is great unease, and indeed opposition, to the policies of the Reagan administration in Central America.  This opposition comes from people whose judgment I respect, from leading journalists, politicians and academics in the US who have outlined their differences.  Opposition has also come from the Department of Foreign Affairs and from leading members in the Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour parties. I believe this opposition is based on informed assessment and goodwill.  I take very seriously these reservations and I support fully the case made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on this matter. This case was made in a cogent, reasoned <Col N="949" /> way and I believe most people in this House would agree with it.</P>
    <P>However, if we have these doubts, reservations or even opposition, we are far more likely to be listened to if we show our good faith and genuine respect for the US which is still one of the great open democracies in the world.  It is a country that millions of our people have helped to build and it has always been a good friend to us.  If, having shown our goodwill then our doubts, hostility or opposition, expressed in a reasoned way, is much more likely to be listened to and much more likely to influence policy.</P>
    <P>Like everyone else in this House I fully support and uphold the rights of those who want to protest or the rights of those who want to stay away but I doubt very much their judgment in choosing this particular form of action.  In some cases, I must say, I doubt also the goodwill underlying these actions.  If we disagree, as many of us do, let us say so in a reasoned, informed and courteous way and then we will be taken seriously.</P>
    <P>The second key point about the protests on Central America is their utter selectivity.  Central America is not a black and white issue.  The issues there are not simply those of good and evil.  They are far more complex and there is no monopoly of right on either side.  Not all leading churchmen are opposed to the Reagan policies or see things in the terms expressed by the opponents of Reagan. Not all leading journalists or scholars have come out strongly on one side or the other.  Anybody who is reasonable on this subject sees the enormous complexity of the issues involved.  Opinions are far more divided than those opposed to President Reagan's visit here would have us believe.  President Reagan's policies may be wrong but to represent them, as some people here have done, as evil incarnate is simply grotesque, does no service whatsoever to the cause of truth or to those who are involved in Central America.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget that there are other super powers involved in Central America. We have heard very little about the role of the Soviet Union in Central America or in other parts of the globe, or of <Col N="950" /> the subversive work of the various activities of that super power.  At least President Reagan is accountable to his electorate and is open to persuasion by friendly powers where they disagree.</P>
    <P>I find it very hard to take seriously the words of the Leader of The Workers' Party here today in the distinctions he drew between various American Presidents. For example, he insinuated that if President Carter were still the American President we would be inviting him here today.  One thing is very clear, nothing is more certain than that if President Jimmy Carter were the American President coming on this visit The Workers' Party would be equally involved in whatever opposition existed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because at the very core of that party is a deep-seated anti-Americanism. Let us be clear about that. I will take The Workers' Party seriously on foreign policy on Central America when I hear from them similar condemnations of the rape of Afghanistan, on the suppression of free trade unions in Poland, on the deportation of nationals of Vietnam to slave labour camps in the Soviet Union, on the continued persecution of Soviet Jews and on the shooting down of unarmed aircraft.  When I hear condemnations of these then I will take their views on Central America seriously, because all those matters were grotesque, terrible outrages against humanity, violations of human rights on an unparalleled scale.  When I hear those condemnations, then I will listen but, until then, I would ask The Workers' Party to have the decency to remain silent on foreign affairs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>There are positive reasons we should welcome President Reagan here.  He has shown a genuine interest in the Irish question and in this country over the past four years, an interest which I believe is not motivated by <Col N="951" /> electoral concern.  He has twice visited the Irish Embassy on St. Patrick's Day, which no other American President has ever done.  He has spoken consistently in favour of the British Government taking a more positive role in the problems of Northern Ireland.  He has worked hard to prevent the importation of money to help buy guns and bombs to be used for destruction in Northern Ireland.  In spite of what has been said, he has seriously encouraged investment in this country, without which there would be fewer jobs today.  All of those are positive reasons why I personally would welcome his presence here.  I welcome his visit in spite of my opposition to him on questions in Central America.  Most of all I welcome him here, symbolically, because he is President of a country which has always been a good friend of this country, a country for which many people here have respect and affection.  It is a powerful country whose leaders and people take us seriously and who in turn, should be taken seriously by us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wholeheartedly support the contribution by the Leader of my Party.  I shall be very brief in my remarks.  I accept, as we all should, that President Reagan is the democratically elected President of the United States of America.  I accept that decision &mdash; they are the people who elected him &mdash; and he is coming here to us as Head of the American people.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Manning when he said that, from the very beginning, President Reagan showed a very special interest in Ireland.  President Reagan cannot be accused &mdash; as he is blatantly on radio and television by some of the people on my right in this House &mdash; of coming here for the purpose of being re-elected.  President Reagan would be elected without ever having come to Ireland for electioneering purposes.  President Reagan, who I am sure is the busiest leader of any country in the western world, has found time to come to this country, taken time off in an exceptionally busy schedule to visit this country and we should respect him for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="952" /> The Taoiseach in the course of his contribution to this debate did say that in the past a number of Taoisigh, he himself and Deputy Liam Cosgrave, for example, had addressed the Joint Houses of Congress in the United States.  President de Valera, also as President of Ireland visited the United States and had a similar privilege accorded him.  I am sure that, on that occasion, there were some members of the American Congress or Senate who probably would not have had agreed with President de Valera at that time, have agreed with many of the things he stood for, and certainly might not have agreed with the policies he adopted on behalf of the Irish nation during the Second World War.  Yet these people &mdash; in particular those from the New England States &mdash; all to a man took their seats, listened with courtesy and dignity to the person who was there representing Ireland, a very small nation at that time.</P>
    <P>All the indications are that President Reagan will be re-elected even if he never came to this country.  The accusation being hurled at him that his visit is being made purely for political reasons is something we should scotch here.  I listened to some radio comment over the week and this was the main thrust of the presentation of a particular programme, which was grossly unfair.  At every opportunity I have said that I was gravely concerned with the foreign policy of the American Government, in particular in relation to their policy directed at Central America. During my brief term as Minister for Foreign Affairs I had discussions with official representatives, with members of the Nicaraguan Government, their Foreign Minister and others.  I met them here in Iveagh House in Dublin, I met them at the United Nations.  I agree with Deputy Manning that there is a very difficult situation obtaining there, and that it is not simply as black and white as it appears.  I have had discussions with American State Department officials on the situation there also.</P>
    <P>But there is worldwide concern &mdash; and this must be acknowledged &mdash; with the American foreign policy in relation to Central America, which concern is now <Col N="953" /> beginning to bear fruit on internal public opinion in the United States.  I believe it is as a result of this worldwide concern that the American Senate and Congress, in the course of recent debates &mdash; particularly in the Senate &mdash; adopted a resolution not supporting President Reagan's foreign policy by a vote of 84 to 12.  This is a clear indication to us that most of the Republican Senators &mdash; and President Reagan's party has a majority in the Senate &mdash; most of the President's own political party in the Senate voted against him. This is an indication to us that there will be a change within the thinking in the United States on their foreign policy as far as Central America is concerned.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that members of the Government parties are now saying that they will not come here and be present on the day about which we are speaking, the American President's visit to this House.  I regret that that is so.  I would sincerely ask that they have a rethink on it.  I would ask that they show regard for the president of the greatest nation of the western world.  I would ask that they honour the office he holds.  I regret very much that the leader of The Workers' Party has taken upon himself to be as insulting as he possibly could about the American President in a very veiled way.  The insinuation by the Leader of The Workers' Party that if President Reagan had been President when the people were being held in Iran he would have gone in with all guns blazing is the sort of cheap, pub talk we could well do without, because the debate should be on a much higher plain than that.  If Deputy Mac Giolla has to play to the Lefties or the Trotskyites of his political grouping, then I reckon he should do it somewhere other than here. There is a great privilege being bestowed on us, that an exceptionally busy leader finds time to visit our Parliament, a small nation in the western world, as the Leader of our party said, a nation which has contributed a tremendous amount to the building of the United States where there are 40 million to 45 million Irish Americans who would not understand our attitude if we did anything other than show respect and dignity to the President they elected.</P>

      <P>The views of the Labour Party in relation to this visit are well known.  The annual conference of the party have decided that, as far as Labour are concerned, the policies of the Reagan administration in Central America and in relation to the arms race are quite unacceptable. The party attitude is certainly not based on any intrinsic anti-American feeling.  I want to make that perfectly clear to the House.  Apropos of Deputy Manning's comments, as far as the Soviet Union and that bloc are concerned, I unreservedly condemn their invasion of Afghanistan, the suppression of liberties in Poland, their harassment of my co-religionists in the Soviet Union, the shooting down of an unarmed aircraft and so on.  Any comments I make in the context of the proposed visit can be taken into account having made those statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The American policies in Central America have contributed widespread misery and injustice in that part of the world and are seen as such in the eyes of a substantial body of influential American opinion.  It is seen there as gross interference in the affairs of many countries in that region.  One influential Congressman in the United States has described the actions of the administration, particularly in Nicargua, as &ldquo;an act of war&rdquo;.  Another, disputing this, has described them instead as &ldquo;an act of damn foolishness&rdquo;.  In the midst of the debate raging throughout the United <Col N="955" /> States, President Reagan has chosen to visit this country.  He is not doing this to improve American investment prospects or for the sake of our tourist industry.  He is doing so for one reason only &mdash; as part of a carefully planned re-election strategy. The Irish-American vote or that portion of it which might be persuaded to vote for the Republican Party is being courted by this visit.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition has described these issues as irrelevant to the visit.  He might as well say that this country's commitment to neutrality is irrelevant.</P>

When President Reagan visits this country there will be protests &mdash; and it is right and inescapable that there should be &mdash; but they must be protests that enhance the dignity of the issues on which they are based.  Any protest for peace that turns into violence would be a hollow protest indeed.  My party will be having a full discussion of the visit at Parliamentary Party level tomorrow and we will discuss all its aspects.  As the House knows, the leader of our party has already expressed his intention of meeting President Reagan to express our party's protest to him personally. I do not wish to pre-empt the decision that may be taken tomorrow about the parameters of protest as far as we are concerned but I assure the House that it will be a dignified protest and one concerned with issues that must be dear to every Member of the House.</P>

      <P>When the Bruce Arnolds of the year 2000 and onwards sit down to write the political history of these years it will be clear that the last ten years have given rise to a more relevant element of our democracy as far as the ordinary person in the street is concerned.  That element will be highlighted in any future analysis of what is happening now.  That is perhaps a good thing as nowadays people have mechanisms to make their feelings known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are discussing an invitation to a President of a friendly nation to address the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Already in this debate we are beginning to see the intemperate reactions which are surfacing because of the visit.  Unfortunately, it reminds me of the divisive debate which we had last year about an amendment People were pigeonholed without a proper analysis of the issues at stake and the stands being taken.  If you said you were voting one way it was automatically assumed that you were in favour of everything that everybody who voted against the amendment was for; and if you voted for the amendment the same applied. What I object to most in the controversy which this visit has given rise to is the pigeonholing of people who, if they say we must welcome any visiting president, are put into a category which says they do not care about the loss of life, human rights or foreign policies with which they would fundamentally disagree.  If people who object to the President's visit and his <Col N="957" /> policies do not say they are going to spit at him, throw eggs at him or walk out of a joint session of the Houses of the Oireachtas when he is speaking, they, in the eyes of some people, lose credibility in their protests about his foreign policy.</P>
    <P>I was one of the Members on this side of the House who spoke in a debate in April 1983 and said that I had grave concern about the policies being adopted by the American administration in Central America and other areas.  I was not alone in that.  Members from every side of the House said the same thing.  I do not feel that there is any loss of my credibility in saying that I am willing to sit at a joint session of the Houses of the Oireachtas and listen to a visiting President.  That is what we should be discussing and not the wider issues.  I draw a comparison between the visit of President Reagan and the visit of the Taoiseach to the United States over the Saint Patrick's weekend when he addressed a joint session of the Houses there.  I have no doubt that there were members listening to him at that session who vehemently opposed the Taoiseach's actions and policies with regard to Northern Ireland. It is not recorded that anyone stood up, heckled him and made him feel unwelcome or were discourteous to him.  I know that many members of the Noraid group in the United States may have expressed their concern about the Taoiseach's attitude to Northern Ireland.  On the other hand they may support other attitudes on Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not think that at any point during his trip to the States the Taoiseach was treated discourteously.  I do not think any of us would like to have seen the Taoiseach being treated rudely because of our national pride in our countrymen when they are abroad.  We would all like to see the Taoiseach being given a warm welcome, which is what he got.  We should try to prevent this debate getting to the stage where we are trying to pigeonhole each other.  Much intemperate language has been used.  Anger has been aroused. There are accusations on all sides.</P>
    <P>We are all politicians.  We may be members of other groups and organisations, voluntary, business or professional. <Col N="958" /> First and foremost we are elected to this House as politicians.  That is how we should see ourselves.  There are political mechanisms to enable us to get across our differences and our divergent views to people like President Reagan.  I should like to quote from the Taoiseach's address in the States.  He had referred to his visit as Minister for Foreign Affairs when he had a chance to discuss common concerns between the United States and the EEC Community.  He said:</P>
    <P>On this visit I shall be engaged once again upon a similar task, recognising that the common concerns of Europe and the United States are matched also by divergent interests in certain areas of commerce and finance, as also by somewhat different perceptions of the political situation in various parts of the world.  It is well that together Europe and America should seek to reconcile these divergent interests and different perceptions, so far as we may be able to do so without doing violence to the legitimate interests and the principles of each of the partners in this relationship.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Barry, spoke at a seminar in Cork on Central America and US foreign policy.  He made it perfectly clear that Ireland had joined together with all the other members of the EEC in comdemnation of a military answer to the problems in Central America.  That was a combined effort by the EEC countries which showed categorically that they were at one in disagreeing with a military solution to the problems of Central America.  That was a loud condemnation of the policies adopted at the moment by the American administration.</P>
    <P>That is a political forum which can be used to get across in a meaningful way our objections to the foreign policy of a powerful state like the US.  Another political forum is the United Nations. Nobody can say Ireland has been slow in sponsoring or supporting motions dealing with the lack of human rights in many areas around the world.  That is a political mechanism to enable us to get across our opposition to certain policies.  It is <Col N="959" /> through those mechanisms that we will be listened to.</P>
    <P>I respect the right of any group to be on the streets when President Reagan is here, or any other President or leader of a country with whom we might have divergent interest and views.  That is democracy.  That is their right, and it would be a sad day if that right was taken from them.  We should address this problem as politicians.  Some politicians have decided, for whatever reasons, that they will not attend at the joint session.  That is their democratic right, but it is not the political way to do it.  There are other mechanisms open to them and they should use those mechanisms to the best of their ability and make a more meaningful and relevant point to President Reagan when he visits us here.</P>

      <P>I should like to join with the leader of our party, Deputy Haughey, Deputy Collins and Deputy Byrne in supporting the Taoiseach's motion:</P>
      <P>That, to welcome the visit to Ireland of Ronald Reagan, the President of the United States of America, and to mark the event in a signal manner, a joint sitting of both Houses of the Oireachtas be held on Monday, 4th June, 1984, in the Dáil Chamber and that the President of the United States of America be invited to address such joint sitting; that the proceedings at such joint sitting shall consist of a speech by the Ceann Comhairle welcoming the President, the address by the President and a speech of thanks by the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad for the address; and that the time for such joint sitting shall be 12.00 noon. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel it is an honour to be present in the House representing the people of North County Dublin and supporting such a motion extending this signal honour to the leader of the largest and strongest democracy in the western world.  I should like to see the Irish people according the warmest of welcomes to President Reagan, not just in his office as President of the United States but also as an individual who has done so much for his <Col N="960" /> country during his Presidency.  As was said earlier, he has shown a special interest in Ireland during his Presidency.  We are welcoming President Reagan to this House and inviting him to address us at a joint sitting.  He is the President of a country with which we have the closest of ties.  We have 40 million blood relations within his constituency, within his country, a country which has supported us down through our history, prior to our independence and since then, in a political sense, an economic sense and in a sense of friendship.  Various leaders of our country were afforded a welcome to the US prior to our independence and since then.  Various leaders of our country were given the opportunity to address joint sittings of their Congress.  At the very minimum as an Irish sovereign parliament, we should invite the President of the United States to address a joint sitting here.</P>
    <P>Many red herrings have been brought into this debate.  I regret that there was even a need for a debate.  If I had my wish the motion would have been proposed by the Taoiseach and welcomed by the Leader of the Opposition.  That is what I would normally expect as the minimum welcome for the President of the United States.  We had various red herrings such as President Reagan's policy on Central America, nuclear weapons, and so on.  They are not relevant to the visit of the President of the United States to this country.  Let us be absolutely clear about that.  Even if everybody was opposed to the President's policy on Central America, that is still not relevant. Not everybody is opposed to it.  As Deputy Manning said, there are many points of view on Central America, the states within Central America, and the behaviour of other super-powers in that area.</P>
    <P>Central America and nuclear weapons are irrelevant to this motion and should be treated accordingly.  We heard a comment from Deputy Mac Giolla about arms and money being poured in to Nicaragua by the American administration. I do not approve of putting arms and money into Nicaragua.  Deputy Mac Giolla spoke with a Pontius Pilate <Col N="961" /> approach that no other super-power he knew of had ever poured money or arms into another country, or ever used their client states, or used paid mercenaries from Cuba within the states of Africa, independent states, in such a way as to affect the independence of those states. Indirectly, through Cuba, they have used money to cause dissension and disquiet in other countries in South and Central America.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla referred to solidarity. Where was his party when the real solidarity question arose, when the workers movement, Solidarity, in Poland was being tackled by that super-power Russia? Where was the solidarity of The Workers' Party with the Polish Solidarity and the mass of Polish people?  I was a bit taken aback at the contribution of Deputy Taylor.  The Leader of the Labour Party is the deputy Prime Minister of the country, yet that party have decided to reserve their position with regard to the invitation to the President of the United States to address a Joint session of the Houses of the Oireachtas. What standards are we dropping to? Deputy Taylor gave us an example of an individual trying to ride two horses.</P>
    <P>We have been told that President Reagan was visiting Ireland as an election gimmick.  Elections are due to be held in the United States this year and they are free and open elections.  Thank God that they are free and open.  How many countries have such open and free elections? A couple of weeks ago we heard of the grotesque charade of the elections to the Supreme Soviet in Russia.  The President of that country Russia was the only candidate because only one is permitted and only one party can nominate a candidate. What is wrong with having free elections in the United States?  I do not see anything wrong with the President of the US visiting Ireland in an election year. Ireland has many close ties with that country.  The Taoiseach informed the House that there are 37,000 jobs as a result of a £4 billion American investment here.  Apparently that is cast to one side by Deputy Mac Giolla and others.</P>
    <P>In my view it is an important aspect of Irish life that we have that number of <Col N="962" /> jobs as a result of American investment. That does not amount to tipping the cap to the almighty dollar; it is a recognition of a very important economic fact here. We have close tourist links with the US and I would like to see more Americans visiting Ireland.  I would like to see closer friendship between America and Ireland and that will not be helped by people expressing views on selective pieces of American policy whether in Central America or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It is my view that many of the trendy Lefties who are opposed to President Reagan's visit would be opposed to a visit by any American President whether he was involved in controversial policies in Central America or not.  They would oppose such a visit because it was by the President of the United States.  I do not make any apology to anybody for supporting this motion.  As a Deputy for north County Dublin I am pleased and honoured to unreservedly &mdash; I am not talking about pigeon holes or anything else &mdash; welcome the motion and I look forward to the visit by President Reagan to this House on 4 June.</P>

      <P>Like the last speaker I unreservedly welcome the invitation extended to President Reagan by the Taoiseach to address a joint session of the Houses of the Oireachtas which was ably seconded by the Leader of the Opposition.  As a Member for south Tipperary I should like to avail of this opportunity to call for a spontaneous welcome for President Reagan.  I will be saddened if there is even one dissenting voice.  It will take from the dignity of the occasion and will mean that a lot of questions will be asked among the 34 million people of Irish extraction who live in America.  Regardless of the decision of the House today the people of south Tipperary will extend to President Regan, a third or fourth generation Tipperary man, a céad míle fáilte. Already he has niched for himself a place in the hearts of the people of Tipperary. He will go down in the folklore of the Irish people and, in particular, those of south Tipperary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am saddened at the tone of the debate <Col N="963" /> so far.  I had hoped that there would have been unanimity on this motion rather than it being divisive.  Irrespective of the outcome of the debate untold damage has already been done to our good name in America.  It has always been held that Irish people had a tradition for hospitality and courtesy to visitors but I am afraid that those who are not friends of the Irish people throughout the world will avail of this opportunity to highlight the protest here in a different light.  I am fearful that they will magnify those protests out of all proportion.</P>
    <P>Some people here have very short memories.  I should like to put the visit into an historical context.  After the Great Famine from 1844 to 1847 many Irish people were forced to flee the land because of hunger, lack of employment and disease.  America opened its hospitable shores to the Irish people.  We should not forget that.  Since then Irish people have played a magnificent role in building up the great American nation. The Taoiseach when he addressed a joint session of Congress on 15 March, recalled the great Irishman who had been given an opportunity of addressing a joint session of Congress.  We must go back further than Mr. de Valera; we must go back to Charles Stewart Parnell who was accorded that great honour in 1880.  We must consider the historical bond that has existed between our two countries.  I am fearful that something will happen as a result of these protests to mar that relationship.</P>
    <P>I do not know very much about Central America or American policies in relation to that part of the world except what I read.  We are all aware that we cannot fully rely on the literature or newspaper reports in regard to Central America. The Taoiseach, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Barry, have stated definitively where Ireland stands in regard to the denial of human rights for any people, irrespective of where they live.  I have no doubt that that message has been conveyed in a proper manner and with dignity to President Reagan and member of the US Congress.  I hope that those who are thinking of disrupting this <Col N="964" /> visit will consider the great damage they are doing to the friendly relationship that exists between America and Ireland. They should consider the vast amount of American investment in Ireland.  They should also consider our tourist industry. A lot of damage could be done to that industry.  If the positions were reversed, if our Taoiseach, the leader of our Government, was shown discourtesy, abstentionism and protests by a section of the American people, we would not take too kindly to it.  We would be prepared to react in a way that would hurt the American economy.  I hope that the Americans will look upon the protest as being by just an infinitesimal section of the Irish people, a conglomeration of lefties, weirdies and others who crawl out from under the stones and from the woodwork on such occasions and who are not truly representative of the Irish people, that the real welcome will not be shown to come through these hired, rent-a-crowd who are at the moment planning and scheming how they can disrupt this visit of the leader of a great friendly nation.</P>
    <P>Even at this late stage I request the Members of this House not to absent themselves from the occasion here on 4 June when the great leader of a friendly nation will honour us by his presence and will address both Houses of the Oireachtas. It will be most undignified if they do so.  I accept that some of them have misgivings about part of American policy in Central America, but they should not use this occasion to show their disagreement. They should come in, we should have a full muster here of all the Members of the joint Houses and we should give President Reagan the traditional welcome that he and the 44 million people of Irish extraction in America would expect us, as representatives of a sovereign State, to give their leader here in Dáil Éireann. I urge these people who are protesting, if they must protest and wish to persevere in this, to protest in a dignified manner and not to turn the visit into a shambles or do anything that would take from the dignity of the occasion.</P>
    <P>Finally, I as one of the Deputies for South Tippearry, hope to be here on 4 <Col N="965" /> June to extend a céad míle fáilte on behalf of the people of South Tipperary to a great third or fourth generation Tipperary man.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

      <P>I am very pleased to take the opportunity of joining with the Taoiseach and other speakers who spoke in favour of the motion and of giving a proper, suitable, dignified, traditional Irish welcome to the leader of the greatest democracy on earth, President Ronald Reagan, when he visits here in a few weeks' time.</P>
      <P>It must be stated clearly for all those listening to this debate that the decision was taken with the full consent of all the major political parties in this House and has the full consent and support of all the leaders of the major political parties, and, as far as I am concerned, they represent the views of the vast majority of the people.  It is not, as one commentator suggested on the show referred to by Deputy Mac Giolla, some 80 per cent.  I believe it is well in excess of 90 per cent of the Irish people, and that view is being expressed across the length and breadth of this country at all the meetings and functions that I attend.  Indeed, they are quite embarrassed at all the hostile publicity that has been given to this proposed visit, and it does not reflect in any significant way the attitudes of the ordinary people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well to remember that it is not just a question of courtesy and dignity that we must show in this regard.  We must recognise that President Reagan is the Head of State of the most important and powerful country on earth.  It is well to remember also that he was elected in a landslide victory by the American people, and I would think that any insult offered by any individual or group in this country through his visit here is a direct insult to those who elected him, and they would think very poorly of those who would perpetrate that kind of attitude to their Head of Government and their President travelling on their behalf.  Just as Deputy Mac Giolla misjudges the popular opinion towards this visit in his contribution this evening, he also misrepresents the remarks made by me on <Col N="966" /> television last Saturday evening on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;.  Quite readily I accept that I made reference to the orchestrated hostile reception that was being prepared for President Reagan, but at no time during that television appearance did I refer to any question of money being provided or arranged for the protest and for the protestors.  It is just as well that the matter is put straight in that regard. He will have to attribute that remark to another guest on that show.  It is not mine.</P>
    <P>Deputy Monica Barnes on the same evening when she was put into a corner had to make up her mind on the spot that she would not be present to greet the President here in the House.  I am quite sure that her defection from the ranks of Fine Gael in this matter is a cause for considerable embarrassment to the Fine Gael Party &mdash; as it should be &mdash; and she will have to suffer the opprobrium of her colleagues in this matter during the next few weeks.  At least I can say that Deputy Monica Barnes went to some pains on that programme to suggest that her stand was not anti-American.  I will give her that much, but the same cannot be said of The Workers' Party in their contributions in this matter.  They have not been quite so generous in this regard, and that only leaves it open to me to understand&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They are getting coverage far above what their opinion represents in Irish society.  Let us be clear about one thing.  When it comes down to trendy lefties, as the Leader of that party referred to some others that he would not himself subscribe to, they are left for sure but they are certainly not trendy.  To be trendy you must have popular support widely based across the society in which you live.  They have none, so they cannot claim to be trendy in any way.  Also I put it to the Deputies of The Workers' Party in the top benches that there is a very small minority of support for far left thinking in this country.  They are just coming out of their rabbit burrows on this occasion because it suits to get a left attitude on to the streets of Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the Deputy had been listening carefully he would recognise that I did not refer to the workers' representatives here coming out of their rabbit burrows.  I referred to the lefties. If the lefties are the people who support the Deputy who has recently spoken, so be it.  I referred on the programme to an orchestrated attempt to bring about a hostile reception for this visitor.  I am standing by that.  It is painfully obvious to anybody keeping track of what is happening that there is a certain organising of a hostile reception.  It was borne out by the Leader of The Workers' Party when he quoted from a letter he received from some organiser trying to put certain organisations together in the hope that they would coalesce and provide the visiting Head of State with a nasty reception. That is slightly undermocratic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>That is nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is certainly nothing more undemocratic than the proposed walk-out by various Members of this House when the Head of State is visiting here.  Members are elected to attend here when the Dáil is convenced and when this motion is passed the Dáil will convene on that day.  Every single elected representative who is physically capable of attending has a duty to be present.  That is what the people elected him for, to attend here on the days in question.  Those who do not attend are committing an undemocratic act and do not deserve to hold their seats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the attitudes being expressed by various individuals are a little hypocritical. I find it hard to reconcile the attitude of the leader of the Labour Party with the fact that he, as a member of the Government and Tánaiste, was party to the official invitation on behalf of the Irish people to the President of the United States.  It is difficult to understand how he can reconcile his point of view <Col N="969" /> with being a member of the Government who invited the President.  At the same time he is prepared to lead a protest of his party in some way that is to be decided tomorrow.  It is threatening that the Whip of that party should suggest that the format for that protest will be decided tomorrow, as if the House had to live under the shadow of a threat from a small section of one of the Government parties regarding the kind of reception they will give the Head of State when he visits the House.  There is something incongruous in the attitude of the leader and of the Labour Party in general.  Another member of that party is on record as saying that everything possible should be done while the President of the United States is here to see that he is not re-elected. Talk about gross interference in the politics of a sovereign State.  It is very hard to adjust to that kind of thinking.</P>
    <P>Our Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, was in the United States representing us all and he did so very adequately.  We were all honoured by the fine, dignified and courteous reception he received.  He did us proud, as did our former Taoiseach, Deputy Charles J. Haughey.  It would have been unacceptable in the extreme if any US politician had made a public statement while the Taoiseach was there &mdash;&ldquo;Do everything in your power to denigrate the Taoiseach of Ireland and make sure he does not have any hope of being re-elected&rdquo;.  That kind of attitude has been expressed by a certain Member of the other House.</P>
    <P>All the political parties here were hoping and expecting that it might be possible for the President of the United States while on his visit here to express the concern of the American people about the reunification of our country and the possible stand that might be taken by the American people in support of our claim to a solution for the national question. On the one hand we are asking him to take a direct interest in foreign policies in so far as they affect the Republic and the British Government but on the other hand we are saying that he has no rights in relation to his own foreign policy.  It does not matter whether we agree with it or not.  The American people are providing <Col N="970" /> money in support of American foreign policy and they are the ones who are best able to judge that foreign policy. They will get the opportunity later in the year.  They will give their answer and it will have to be accepted by all of us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Some people are very vocal today in wishing to give a &ldquo;nasty reception&rdquo; to the President.  I understand I am quoting accurately the words used by the leader of The Workers' Party.  No matter how one interprets the word &ldquo;nasty&rdquo; it has a certain undercurrent of a violent attitude which I do not like.  If those who are preaching that kind of reception for the President of the United States had taken the same attitude to others who have a direct bearing on matters that concern us very closely, they would have been a lot more vocal over the years when other Heads of State visited this country. They were very muted on those occasions. When they give as much verbosity to the interference of other sovereign States directly in Irish affairs as they are giving to the visit of the President of the United States, I might be prepared to give them a better hearing.</P>

      <P>I was hoping that the leader of The Workers' Party would decide this was a suitable occasion to withdraw the remark he made on 29 April 1984 about the nasty reception and say he made the remark in haste.  It is time somebody called on the leader of The Workers' Party to withdraw that remark, otherwise we shall have to take inferences from it. There is no point in telling me that there can be widespread protests and massive disruption without incurring the use of the security forces.  There is no point in saying that there can be massive, peaceful disruption of traffic and of Irish life on a particular day without causing considerable difficulties and without the possibility of violence coming into play.  For that reason, I should have thought that The Workers' Party would have gone out of their way today in the House to make a very big plea that, whatever protests might ensue following their words at least they would be seen to support the view that it should not be, as they say, a nasty and hostile reception.</P>
      <P>The President of the United States will be visiting my constituency and he has the welcome of the vast majority of my constituents.  I look forward to seeing all Deputies and Senators elected democratically to these Houses of Parliament present on the day in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Much has been made of the visit of the United States President to Ireland in the year of the Convention Elections in the United States.  Deputies who have supported the President's addressing of the House have been at pains to try to suggest that his visit here has nothing to do with the Convention. Let us be honest and frank about it, it has to do with the coming election.  And if it has, that is the American President's business.  If we go to the United States on business, or if the Taoiseach wishes to address the Joint Houses of Congress there, we are not going on American business but to promote the business interests of this country and this Government. <Col N="972" /> We should not be too concerned about the reason for the forthcoming visit, that is the American President's business.  Our concern is how we receive him when he arrives here.</P>
      <P>I support this resolution.  A lot can be said about US policy in Central America and this is an area about which there is a lot of ignorance.  We have, in our party, a foreign affairs committee of which I happen to be chairman and I have been trying very hard to brief myself on this very complicated subject.  I have a lot to learn about Central America but believe that many people who say that they are not going to meet the President when he comes here because of American policy in Central America should be asked to explain American policy there.  It appears that they are taking certain quotations from certain parts of the press.</P>
      <P>There are many things wrong with American policy in Central America, there is no doubt about that.  I have said earlier in this House that whereas we have very strong ties with the United States, as one of what are considered to be constitutional democracies in the world today, we should not accept the Americans throwing their weight around in Central America, nor should we accept the Soviet Union doing likewise.  That latter is something which has not been mentioned here.  In monetary terms, if we assess which of these power blocs have interfered more in Central America, it is surprising to find that the friends of Deputy De Rossa and Deputy Mac Giolla are far in advance.  I am not apologising for American policy, I have very strong misgivings about it.  However, I want to have something to say about that policy, with an input into changing it. That we want to insult the American people by insulting their President is how it will be interpreted, whether we like it or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that Deputy Mac Giolla is not present at the moment, but he wants us to insult the United States President, a few months after he insulted the United States Ambassador by tearing up an invitation received from him.  I have in my possession a photograph of Deputy <Col N="973" /> Mac Giolla with the Ambassador of the Soviet Union in this country.</P>

Sometime ago, 259 people were murdered on a Korean airline jet plane, and there was not as much as a murmur out of the same people who are now orchestrating this campaign against President Reagan.  I am in favour of the Americans being told our position on Central America and of our trying to influence the United States against some of the clowns and clownish activities that they have been supporting in Central America.  If we really want to influence them, there is a way of doing so.  We should be balanced and be prepared to condemn other certainly more severe and more blatant atrocities which are hardly mentioned in this House.</P>
      <P>The United States is the largest democracy in the world and we have a lot in common with it, not least because there are over 40 million Irish Americans over there which, of course, plays a part in the visit here of the American President.  Of course, it plays a part in the appointment of an American Envoy to the Holy See during an election year.  These things have happened.  We have very close ties and unlike politicians here who take views from all and sundry morning, noon and night, that is not done in the United States.  Also, the American public do not like to hear denigratory statements about their leaders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not long ago we had in this House a number of American students who were working as interns with Members of the <Col N="974" /> House of whom I happened to be one. Many were very young and would be voting for President Reagan because, as far as they were concerned, he was the first President of the United States in a very long time to give them back their self respect and national esteem.  We may not see it like that, but that is how they view it.  They are the people that we are going to offend if we try to protest in the National Parliament in a way which would be offensive to the American people and their President.</P>
    <P>I do not have a great regard for imperialism, whether American, Soviet or British.  There are ways of airing one's grievances on foreign affairs.  We may not always agree with much of what the super-powers are doing and we must show our disagreement in this House.  I have tried to raise the question of having in this House a foreign affairs committee because we have no opportunity, on a regular basis, to have a debate on foreign affairs.</P>

      <P>We must be very clear on where our duty lies.  If President Reagan were a Hitlerite or someone who had carried out such terrible anti-social atrocities that we could not welcome him here, I would understand, but that is not the reason why people are not ready to receive him here.  There is another story and we should give the President the opportunity of coming here and putting his point of view to us to so that we can understand and also put across to him our views.  I regret that the Americans have not taken the opportunity to try to put forward their views, with the exception of the speech by Ambassador William <Col N="975" /> H. Luers in University College, Cork, on 28 April.  That is the only occasion to my knowledge on which they have tried to put forward a case, if they have a case.  I hope for an early debate on the reservations of the members of this Government on American policy, and our point of view should be put so that we can have some influence.</P>
      <P>This country, and in particular this city, have been bereft of the type of lift to tourism which is needed and which will be given by the Presidential visit here. Since our job is to promote the public interest, if we believe that this visit is in the public interest, we should welcome President Reagan.  I wish to support this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add my voice to those who have spoken before me in welcoming the visit of President Reagan to this country.  We are very fortunate to have him coming here.  Many speakers have already mentioned the 40 million Irish-Americans in the United States. While those people have strong emotional ties with this country they are, nevertheless, very patriotic, loyal Americans. If the message went back to the USA, arising from President Reagan's visit here, that he had in any way been snubbed, it would not be very good for Ireland.  Irish-Americans first loyalty is to America and we should not forget that.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand the mentality of the people who attack President Reagan's visit here purely out of political motives based on, as Deputy Flynn said, anti-America.  It is interesting to note that last year our exports to the United States were £561 million, that the number of tourists we got from America was approximately 330,000, that the value of that tourism to the country was £134 million and that the American tourist is worth approximately one and three quarter tourists from other countries from the point of view of the money they spend here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The links which exist between this country and America go back very far. There is hardly anybody in the House who does not have relations in America. <Col N="976" /> Many people have brothers and sisters living in America and they have very close links with that country.  It is a tremendous boon to the country to have President Reagan visiting us and he should be welcomed.  We will get publicity to the value of many hundred million dollars.  During his visit the cameras will be on the country and not only will American cameras see his visit to Ireland but people in other countries will also receive news flashes of his visit here.</P>
    <P>I have always said that Dáil Éireann represents a cross-section of the people of Ireland.  If you want to see the people of Ireland you have only to come into Dáil Éireann and you will find them. Approximately 95 per cent of this Parliament welcome the visit of President Reagan to this country.  This is a reflection of what the country as a whole feels about his visit.  Those of us who are old enough to remember the visit of President Kennedy to this country remember the wonderful welcome he was given on that occasion.  I believe the people will rise to this occasion and will give a great welcome to President Reagan.  I believe they will come out in their thousands to welcome him and will not let the country down.  I want to say to the people who are sincere in their reservations not to be influenced by those with ulterior motives. There are such people who will use this visit for their own ends, and this would be a disaster for the country.  News is when something starts to go wrong. There are some people who will try to orchestrate a protest just for their own ends and they should not be encouraged to do this.</P>
    <P>We are very proud of our Irish-American people like Speaker McCormack and Tip O'Neill, those people who have Irish ancestors.  They are very proud of their Irish heritage.  I know that the vast majority of the people will give a céad míle fáilte to President Reagan on his visit to Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to preface my remarks by referring to what Deputy Flynn said about the Labour Party.  He said he found our attitude on this strange. I do not find that comment at all incongruous coming from somebody of the mentality of Deputy Flynn.  I stand up here in the name of the Labour Party. There is no party in this state, inside this House or outside it, who have a better right to comment on the visit of President Reagan and the institutions of democracy. We are not any latter day converts to the concept of democracy or democratic institutions, whether we are speaking about the seventies and eighties or the twenties and thirties.  Our policy is given to the leadership from the Members on the floor as enunciated recently at our annual delegate conference.  It is not handed down to the members by the leadership, as is done in many other parties in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to President Reagan's visit, I was approached recently by newspaper correspondents and asked for my view on it.  My party and I defend absolutely the right of anybody to protest their disagreement with the Government and <Col N="978" /> the political system of a country.  That is the cornerstone of our political system and is the difference between that system and any other political system.  I remember a conversation in Russia in 1979 when we were discussing political systems. They were being contrasted and it was fairly one-way traffic.  I am not a defender of American policy-making.  I despise what the American Government are doing at the moment in Central America in the name of the American people.  My party criticised that and we made it very clear at our recent annual conference. We tend to draw semantic distinctions between the President of America and the people he represents.  I believe America is the greatest democracy in the world. It was two journalists who brought down Nixon, who was conceivably the most powerful political figure in the world at that time.  I believe there is no other country in the midst of an international war who would have allowed its correspondents to expose what happened in My-lai in Vietnam.  I pointed it out that evening in that conversation.  I think any other Government, including our own, of whatever hue, would have made an attempt to avoid what was a major political embarrassment in the middle of an international war.  I am talking about the incident in Vietnam.  Two correspondents again brought that out and I said that, whether it was Ireland, France, Britain or Russia, that would have not made the public news headlines.</P>
    <P>With regard to my position in regard to this proposed visit, I think it was Voltaire or one of the French revolutionary leaders who said: &ldquo;I despise your views but I am prepared to die for your right to express them&rdquo;.  I believe the most effective demonstration we could make would be one that would be most dignified and most peaceful.  That goes without saying. I was responsible for organising another demonstration in the case of the Springboks, when they came here, because of the treatment meted out to the native people in South Africa.  There were elements in those demonstrations which sought to turn them from peaceful, dignified demonstrations into disorderly mêlées which were counter-productive <Col N="979" /> from the point of view of what we wanted to achieve.  I believe the same thing can happen if those in our community who have the most legitimate, democratic and perfect right within our political system to convey their opposition to American politics allow themselves to be manipulated. What worries me is the background of some of the people who are orchestrating this opposition.  In the Labour Party we form our own foreign policy and that policy is not lifted from the foreign policy of any other Government.  Our funds are raised at church gates by sincerely committed supporters in spite of the sardonic comments of some jaundiced sources.</P>
    <P>I am a bit worried about the credentials of the people who, on the one hand, talk about democracy and I remember those same people &mdash; and I know them &mdash; talking <i>sotto voce</i> when Jaruzelski destroyed Lech Walensa in Poland.  I remember the same people in 1956 murmuring quietly &ldquo;Do not have any discussions&rdquo;.  They criticised movements here, movements protesting against what happened in Poland, because it was against their Stalinist outlook. I would hate what should be a legitimate protest to fall into their hands. Equally, I am concerned&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Chair. I am deeply concerned about the remarks of people like Deputy Flynn.  The major reason they advance or seem to be <Col N="980" /> advancing, if I understand correctly, as to why the President should be accepted is purely on commercial grounds from the point of view of what industrial benefit might accrue to this country.  To me that is a disgusting reason and I deprecate that type of approach.  It is as bad on one side as on the other.</P>
      <P>We, as the Government, have invited the head of a sovereign state and he should be received in that capacity.  The Chinese differ profoundly with American foreign policy, but he was received correctly by that Government.  No one need elaborate on the fundamental differences that exist as between China and America. If demonstrations take place I emphasise that they must be both dignified and peaceful and not manipulated for the purpose of misrepresenting or distorting the views of the Irish people.</P>
      <P>I am often concerned, and this is no fault of the media as such, by some of what comes across which would appear to represent the viewpoint of the majority on different issues.  I would call for a balance in that regard.  To make my own position clear, I was elected here by my constituents and I hope to be here representing my constituents on the day of the visit of President Reagan; but I intend to boycott any other social function to which I may be invited.  I am not obliged to attend social functions but I feel there is a political obligation on me to present in the Dáil in response to the people who elected me here.  That is the distinction I make.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I add my support to the acceptance of the invitation by President Reagan to visit Ireland.  The United States and President Reagan are paying a great honour to this country by accepting the invitation.  There has been a tremendous traditional long lasting relationship over many, many years between the United States of America and Ireland. This visit affords both countries an opportunity to further that relationship, which I hope and trust will be in the interests not only of the two countries concerned but in the wider interest of both western and eastern democracy generally and the improvement of relations <Col N="981" /> throughout the whole world.  Objection to the visit has been raised because of the policy of the United States in Central America.  Many examples have been given here this afternoon of events in that part of the world.  We are all conscious of the situation, but I must say that the United States of America has been and is one of the greatest democracies in the world and has been a tremendous leader in the cause of freedom.  That has been demonstrated in many cases over the years.  The critics of this visit have sounded very ominous but those same critics have been very quiet on other occasions when atrocities were being committed by other countries.  To me this is the vast difference on this occasion between those in favour and those against this particular visit and that difference is patently obvious.</P>
      <P>America has been a very close friend of Ireland all down the years.  It is a country in which our ancestors found opportunities many years ago and it would be the height of bad manners from the Irish point of view when the Government invite the President of the largest democracy in the world if elected public representatives were not seen to give the civic welcome due to the President of the United States of America.</P>
      <P>As far as The Workers' Party are concerned, they have been very vocal in their judgements on this visit and my colleague, Deputy Flynn, has given dates and times of speeches made by Deputy Mac Giolla of The Workers' Party when he called for a nasty and hostile reception.  He has also called for a peaceful protest.  Now anybody with any commonsense at all will understand and accept&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wish to support the motion.  Any Deputy who has reservations about attending the joint session of the two Houses of the Oireachtas should consider the matter seriously. They should answer a number of questions before making a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President of the United States is <Col N="983" /> the invited guest of our democratically elected Taoiseach who heads the Government.  It is the second time in the history of this State to have a visit by an American President and it is the second time in the history of the American Presidency that an American President will have visited Ireland.  There is a duty and an onus on us to act as responsible elected public representatives and to come here and represent our constituents.  Secondly, he is the President of a major world power and of a country to which many of our ancestors were forced to emigrate.  Those of us whose ancestors were not forced to emigrate should not abuse the privilege we have of living in this country and we should not put the descendants of those who were forced to leave our country in an embarrassing situation; in this connection I am speaking about the Irish-Americans.  That matter should be considered seriously.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have said we should not resort to discussing economics and jobs here in considering the approach we adopt with regard to the visit of the President. We should realise there is major American investment here and a substantial number of jobs are provided directly by American-based companies.  In addition, there are many service jobs that are provided indirectly as a result of American companies working in other countries. The visit of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the United States made a major impression on the American public and the business world and a special meeting of more than 300 top Irish-American businessmen was held in Texas.  The sole purpose of the meeting was to examine ways and means by which the Irish-American business community could assist Ireland in our serious economic situation.  The question must be asked, what position will the managing directors of companies find themselves in when they go back to their board meetings and try to impress on their directors to make a decision in favour of coming to Ireland if the President of their country gets a hostile reception here?  Irish-Americans are Americans first even though they are proud of <Col N="984" /> their Irish heritage.  If we see fit to insult in any way or to show hostility towards the US President we will damage future investment here.  We should be under no illusions about that.  I should have thought that The Workers' Party would be examining seriously the future of workers in this country and they should consider the points I have made when they address the joint meeting of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>As Members of the Oireachtas we are in a special position and we have channels open to us that are not available to the ordinary citizen.  I can appreciate that many citizens may feel strongly about certain matters and may decide to have peaceful demonstrations to protest against policies pursued by various governments in South America.  All of us disagree strongly with the policies pursued in South America and with the terrible atrocities taking place.  However, as Members of this House we have various channels open to us and many of us have used them.  Our democratically elected Minister for Foreign Affairs on numerous occasions has brought to the attention of the American Government the fact that he does not agree with policies pursued in South America.  As has been said already, the Irish Government have joined with other EEC countries in condemnation of the policies pursued in that region.  Members of this House have used the channels open to them in a proper manner and if Oireachtas Members should start to protest in a manner other than that it would leave much to be desired.</P>
    <P>It is my opinion that the majority of the Irish people are looking forward to the visit of the American President.  The majority welcome his coming and they hope as a result of his visit we will have a better and a brighter economic future.</P>

      <P>If Deputy V. Brady cares to come up here and sit beside me he can leaf through the speech made, when he can then stand up and apologise for repeating an incorrect statement.  I find it extraordinary that, on the one hand, we are being urged, in the interest of manners, to smile and accept the impending visit of President Reagan while, on the other hand, Deputy V. Brady has not got the good grace or manners to accept that he was wrong in this instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of points need to be made in relation to this debate.  It has been suggested that in some way it is slightly undemocratic to organise protests against the visit of President Reagan to this country. In view of other remarks made by other Deputies &mdash; for example, in relation to Poland, Northern Ireland and a whole range of other issues &mdash; I should have thought that the organising of protests is considered probably by all people in this House as an essential part of the democratic process of any country. Therefore, it is incorrect for any Deputy, whether he or she belongs to the Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or the Labour Party, to infer that in some way the organising of a protest is undemocratic and, therefore, <Col N="986" /> to be deplored.  It is also suggested that because a person is elected to this House they should in some way forego their right to protest in relation to the foreign policy of any country, that those outside the House may be free to protest in the streets, but that elected representatives are not entitled to that freedom.  That constitutes a slightly distorted view of what the democratic process is all about.</P>
    <P>It is argued also that, if large protests took place, in some way violence would result.  I might remind Deputies in this House that the largest protest ever seen in this country took place in 1979 when almost 250,000 workers marched in the streets of Dublin demanding tax reform, when the comment generally was that despite the huge numbers taking part there was good humour and good will among the marchers &mdash; and that despite the presence of what some people in this House call weirdies, trendies, lefties and so on.  There is no logical reason for assuming that if protest took place violence of some kind would occur.</P>
    <P>The arguments in favour of supporting this motion boil down to three, firstly, that it would be bad manners to protest in any way; secondly, that it might put at risk American investment in Ireland and, thereby, jobs and, we are told also, perhaps result in a drop in tourism from America.  But there is no evidence advanced to back up those arguments; the contrary is the case.  It has been demonstrated in the course of Deputy Mac Giolla's contribution and in statements made outside this House that a very large proportion of the American population do not support President Reagan's policies in relation to the deployment of nuclear weapons or in relation to Central or Latin America.  The fact that there is no evidence advanced to support the view that it would affect investment or tourism does not prevent people from continuously getting up here in the last few hours repeating that charge.  The fact is that, even before President Reagan was invited here, American investment had begun to decline, that the number of tourists in real terms &mdash; in relation to the growth of tourism within America itself and Ireland's share &mdash; has also been in <Col N="987" /> decline.  If one compares the effect of any protest there might be about this visit with the troubles in Northern Ireland over the last 15 years, the effect that has had on American investment North and South, and indeed on tourism both in Northern Ireland and Great Britain, then any protests about this visit would be seen as a drop in the ocean.</P>
    <P>Our Minister for Foreign Affairs, was in America recently seeking support for the Report of the New Ireland Forum, when he stated in interviews with national papers and television that there was a serious risk of civil war in Ireland. Does anybody seriously think that protests here in relation to President Reagan's visit about his Latin American and nuclear policies would have a greater effect than the statement of our Minister for Foreign Affairs on that occasion? Nobody could reasonably argue that they would.</P>
    <P>We appear to be discussing this issue on the basis of emotions, that there is a lot of sentiment tying Ireland to America. No doubt that is true.  Indeed somebody here said there is hardly a person in this country who does not have a relation in the United States.  I am sure if I thought hard enough I could find one as well.  But the policy of the United States in restricting immigration of Irish people to the United States is gradually eroding that connection between Ireland and the United States.  That is not necessarily a good thing but it must be faced that it is happening.  If any investigation were carried out into the reason for the decline in our share of tourism from the United States then it would be ascertained that it is the distancing, the erosion of this connection between our two countries. We should view things realistically.  We should ascertain whether we are justified in welcoming with open arms the President of a country that has been described as the largest democracy in the world, whether we are entitled to welcome without any dissent whatsoever the President of that country while at the same time that country is engaged in a whole series of actions in Central and Latin America <Col N="988" /> which is causing death and destruction in that region.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Gay Mitchell who made the point today that there is a much if not more Soviet interference in Latin and Central America than there is United States involvement.  I would say to Deputy Gay Mitchell that is not the factual position.  Along with myself and Deputy N. Andrews two of his party members met two Ministers of State from Nicaragua in this House approximately a month ago when we discussed the problems in that country at length, when they said where the Nicaraguan people themselves felt the solution lay and who was interferring with whom.  Those Ministers of State of the Nicaraguan Government said quite clearly that as far as Nicaragua is concerned the Soviet Union is not a problem.  The problem is that the United States are attempting to replace the Government there with one suiting their policy interests.  That basically was the problem <i>vis-á-vis</i> the United States and Nicaragua &mdash; that if the United States do not like the complexion of the Government there, or are unhappy that the Somosa dictatorship they supported had been deposed, they do their level best through overt and covert actions to destabilise that Government.  To say there is more Soviet intervention in Nicaragua or Latin America without presenting any factual basis for saying that is incorrect and misleading this House.  Members of the Nicaraguan Government have said quite the opposite, that the problem is United States policy in relation to Nicaragua.</P>

      <P>Many Deputies referred to The Workers' Party and I should have an opportunity of responding to them.  I <Col N="989" /> will be as brief as possible.  The Taoiseach referred to Afghanistan and a number of Deputies alleged that The Workers' Party did not make a statement with regard to Solidarity in Poland and the shooting down of a Korean airliner.  As I said, they must have had cotton wool in their ears for the last number of years because our party have made their position clear in relation to all these issues. On a radio programme I condemned the shooting down of the Korean airliner. The Ard Fheis of The Workers' Party condemned the military Government in Poland, but that does not mean we have to support every point which conservative Deputies in this House throw at us. We have a political position in relation to socialism and capitalism and we are obviously entitled to articulate that position.</P>

      <P>I will give an analogy in relation to Northern Ireland.  When the Provos commit an atrocity in Northern Ireland the response is always: What about the UDR, the British army and so on?  Everybody is expected to pull in their horns and to agree with it.  I refer to it as &ldquo;what aboutery&rdquo; and it is used to justify American policy in Central America and the siting of Pershing and Cruise missiles in Western Europe.  To condemn American policy is not justifying Soviet policy in Afghanistan or any other country which is engaged in the denial of human rights.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>He has.  I am usually asked to speak on these matters and I have always called for disarmament.  We should not indulge in the luxury of letting ourselves off the hook in relation to American policy throughout the world by comparing it with policies of other governments.  American policy is either right or wrong.  If it is wrong the Government and the people of this country should make their position clear in relation to it.  Those who have said they are going to protest are not confined to people on the left.  Religious orders and lay missionaries in Central America, who are concerned about the policy in Latin America, are also going to protest.  They are the main movers in opposing American policy on these issues.</P>
      <P>We should examine the reasons for the visit taking place now.  The Taoiseach said that the invitation was given to the President some years ago and that he was free to accept it at any time.  He has chosen to accept it in the middle of an election campaign in the United States. A figure of 43 million Irish-Americans has been quoted by a number of Deputies as having an interest in Ireland.  I am in no position to dispute that.  I have no way of knowing whether they have an interest in Ireland, but I hope they have.  However, it cannot do the President of the United States any harm to visit and get an open arm welcome from the people of Ireland in the middle of an election campaign. It may not be the intention of this Government to assist the President of the United States in that way but I am convinced it was a primary consideration as far as President Reagan's advisers were concerned when he decided to accept the invitation now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another consideration.  The president is tagging on his visit to Ireland on a Western European tour and we are in the middle of an EEC election campaign. It must be seen that there is widespread opposition to American policies in relation to the siting of Cruise and Pershing missiles in Western Europe. <Col N="991" /> Millions of people have marched for peace and disarmament.  I do not think it is stretching things too far to believe that President Regan's visit to Europe, apart from coming to Ireland, is connected with the fact that there is widespread opposition to his policies and that we are in the middle of an EEC election campaign. Candidates will be standing in opposition to that policy and, presumably, he will be hoping to strengthen his position on those issues.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the Taoiseach got a very warm welcome in America and that Congress accepted him with open arms.  That was very pleasant from the point of view of Irish people but there is no comparision between our Taoiseach and our President and the President of the United States.  We are not an imperial power.  We do not have armies in any other part of the world except on peace-keeping operations with the United Nations.  We have no interest in any other country other than the interest of ensuring that there is peace and that everybody has a proper living standard and human rights.  We have no imperial interest.  It is not reasonable to compare the welcome a representative of Ireland would receive in any other country with the welcome given to the president of a country which is involved in many other countries in arms supplies, in relation to nuclear weapons and its policy on Central America. There is no valid comparison to be made.  I am about to finish, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I can see you are getting very nervous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that we should be given an opportunity to make these points.  If President Reagan loses the election this year &mdash; and I personally hope he does; that is my view and I am entitled to it &mdash; if he comes back next year as a private citizen he will be more than welcome.  The 300,000 Americans who it is expected will visit these shores during the coming year are more than welcome.  The Workers' Party have made <Col N="992" /> it clear a number of times that our protests are against the policies of the American administration and not against the American people.  We recognise the brotherhood of working-class people in Ireland, America and in every other part of the world.  We are not anti-American.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the motion and I welcome the visit of the United States President to Ireland.  As president he is head of state as well as chief executive. When Speaker O'Neill was here he emphasised that fact.  That is very different from our system.  In the one person we do not embody the formal head of state and the chief executive.  When a sworn political enemy of the President of the United States &mdash; and that is what Tip O'Neill is &mdash; exhorts us to extend courtesy to the president as the head of state of the United States, that neatly expresses the difference between the two systems.</P>
      <P>Having invited him here it is incumbent on us to extend the courtesies to him and the courtesy of this House in welcoming him to speak here.  I am sorry The Workers' Party cannot see that difference and cannot have the magnanimity to say he should be welcomed here, even though they disagree with him.  There are ample forums for expressing their disagreement, and they are quite entitled to do that.  It would be a very fine gesture on their part if they could see their way to welcoming him with us unanimously to the House.  That is what we all desire.</P>
      <P>References have been made to emotionalism as if there was something wrong with that.  The man we are speaking about is president of a country, 20 per cent of the population of which are of our flesh and blood.  What is wrong with that kind of emotionalism?  What is so reprehensible about saying that?  It creates a unique and very special relationship.  A ratio of 10:1 between the population of the mother country and the United States is an absolutely unprecedented connection between any two nations anywhere, and is an additional reason for placing more importance on this visit than on the visit of any other head of state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the Presidential <Col N="993" /> election in the United States.  That election is five months away.  It is infantile to suggest that people voting in the United States in the month of October will be significantly affected one way or the other by whether or not the President of the United States comes here.  Deputy De Rossa has just made an interference about the visit to Europe, the primary purpose of which is for the President of the United States to attend an economic international summit in London.  It was arranged on a yearly basis and has nothing whatever to do with the popularity or otherwise of American policies in Europe at this time.  That is the primary reason he is in this hemisphere at this time. Obviously it was convenient for him to accept our invitation at around the same time.</P>
    <P>The foreign policy of the United States raises the hackles of many people.  Some people disagree with elements of it.  All of us are concerned about the nuclear arms race and the lack of progress on nuclear arms de-escalation.  I am certainly concerned about that, and I am critical of aspects of American actions in that respect.  Central America is the other issue which is in the minds of many people here at the moment.  To say it is a complex problem is to underestimate the complexity of it.  There is rightful concern about some American policy and actions there.  I am astonished at the thousands of experts on Central America who have sprung up overnight all over the country, on a subject which is so complex that nobody can speak about it with any authority who has not studied it in great depth.  That is not to say we should not be concerned.</P>
    <P>All of these things are amenable to peaceful protest and are quite separate from and irrelevant to whether or not we receive the president in this House as the head of the greatest democracy on this earth.  I do not think those issues should be a factor in our decision here.  The President of the United States knows well that there are policies and actions of his government which are not universally acceptable, nor would he expect that they should be.  It is right that people here should be concerned about such issues <Col N="994" /> and channel their concern into some form of peaceful protest.</P>
    <P>Deputy Owen expressed it very well this evening when she made the point that because one is for or against this motion, one is not either for or against United States policies on Central America or nuclear disarmament.  That would be a gross and reprehensible interpretation of people's actions.  Talking about United States policies and the policies of President Reagan, one should speak also about his economic policies.  The number of times I have heard on all sides of the House references to the economic recovery of the West, led by a perceptible recovery in the United States, and the way in which the whole world is looking for and getting a lead in the economic recovery of the West should not be lost sight of, and it happened in the short presidency of President Reagan.</P>
    <P>References are also being made to our judgment being coloured by self-interest in terms of industrial development, tourism, and so on.  Equally one must accept that the United States has acted in respect of industrial development here in a particularly favourable way from our point of view.  In 1981 this president endorsed US overseas industrial investment in Ireland, the only country in the developed world to receive such endorsement. That is a fact.  You do not spit in the face of a man who will do that.  You do not insult him by even raising the question of whether or not he should address this House.  It is unfortunate that we should be even questioning that.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development Authority will bear out the fact that they are competing in a fiercely competitive world for manufacturing industries, and so on. Deputy Mac Giolla's view that American industrialists are here simply because it is the best place to be is not borne out by the facts.  If it were, we would have no unemployment.  The fact is that we are in a highly competitive situation, competing for industry all around the world.  The primary source of that industry is in the United States.  We have the goodwill of the American administration and the president himself.  That is not a subject which should be taboo, or should not be <Col N="995" /> raised at a time like this, because we should not, and cannot, take that goodwill for granted if we are not prepared to reciprocate in a courteous and friendly manner.  That is what we are talking about.  The same is true of tourism. Whether we like it or not this is a secondary tourist location for Americans.  Primarily they are on their way to the Continent of Europe.  We are on the edge of that Continent and Americans have to make a distinct effort to stop off here. We pride ourselves on being &ldquo;Ireland of the welcomes&rdquo; and if we portray ourselves before the United States during the visit of the head of that country in an unfriendly and discourteous manner that will be damaging to our tourist industry. It is inevitable that it will be and it is a factor that must be considered.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that The Workers' Party, who are so concerned about workers, at a time when there are so many on the dole are ignoring that industrial and tourist investment is central to our job creation programme.  The goodwill of the United States is a factor in that.  The President of the United States coming here, with the attention of the entire US media on that visit, presents us with a rare opportunity to sell ourselves in that market place.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may draw his own interpretation of those words. We are selling Ireland to US tourists and Irish-Americans.  That is what I am talking about and the Deputy is aware of that.  It was very moving for the vast majority of Irish people to observe the Taoiseach address, as leader of this country, the joint Houses of Congress and to see the way he was welcomed by people whose views would be quite different on many subjects.  If we were not to reciprocate, as a minimum, it would be a very sad day indeed.  We have invited the head of state of the greatest democracy on earth in our capacity as the elected representatives of the Irish people.  I welcome <Col N="996" /> the motion and welcome the president to Ireland.</P>

      <P>As a Tipperaryman I am proud to be associated with the spirit of according a hearty welcome to the President of the United States when he visits here next month.  In a more parochial vein I should like to say that our county is proud that his ancestors were born and reared there and, like so many others, emigrated to the United States. Many ancestors of the present generation of Americans made a great impact on the newly developing America and we are all justly proud of them.  It is sad that once again in our little country we have a collection of anarchists, trotskyites and communists raising their ugly heads in protest. Many of those people, I suggest, are just the mavericks of our society who are professional protestors against everything and are not for anything.  It is sad that within this House and our democracy that one party, The Workers' Party, have decided to go overboard in condemning this visit.  It is amazing how, like the three card trick merchants, they are involving themselves in and indulging in verbal sleight of hand &mdash;&ldquo;Now you see the lady; now you don't&rdquo;.  They say one thing at one time and later contradict themselves and say they did not.</P>
      <P>It is a fact that on 30 April, according to <i>The Irish Times,</i> after their Ard Fheis, their president, Deputy Mac Giolla, in supporting the campaign against the Reagan visit, stated, &ldquo;so let us destabilise President Reagan&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Perhaps Deputy De Rossa would like to hear what one of his councillors &mdash; a member of my local council, Councillor Kinehan &mdash; said at that Ard Fheis?  He said:</P>
      <P>Would you invite a mad dog into your home?  Would you invite a psychopath to have tea with your family? Would you invite the Boston strangler to your daughter's wedding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are reprehensible comments and <Col N="997" /> the type that should not emanate from the members of any respectable or decent political party.  However, I am not at all surprised at the source from which they came.  This is an appalling discourtesy and disrespect and a slur on all Americans.  The Workers' Party councillor also compared President Reagan to Hitler but it is not surprising that he did not make any comparison between him and Stalin.  I wonder if the President of the USSR was invited here would the Trotskyites, the blood red communists who now comprise The Workers' Party, rise in protest?  Somehow or other I doubt if they would.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">

      <P>Has the oppression of Poland by the USSR been condemned by them and, if so, has it in any way affected their close alliance with their cohorts within the Russian Embassy?  I doubt it. The vast majority of us respect the United States as the leaders of the free world, as the protectors of peace for the free world.  While we would all ideally support the concept and principle of total nuclear disarmament we must recognise that this can only be achieved by bilateral agreement by both the United States and Russia.  However, many of us doubt the bona fide intentions of the USSR should any such arrangement be agreed on.  The Russian lust for power and total world domination, geographically, politically and ideologically, is their prime long-term objective.  The Russians realise that ultimately this can only be attained by military domination of the free world.</P>
      <P>The United States of America, the leaders of the free world, stand between all of us who believe in peace and democracy and that unholy and unthinkable holocaust.  We should show our fullest respect and support for the United States and its people and welcome President Reagan as the democratically elected leader of the greatest nation in the world when he visits us in June.</P>

      <P>I will be brief because in the short time left for the debate a number <Col N="998" /> of other speakers are anxious to contribute. I regret that this debate has taken place today because I would have felt that on an occasion such as this a motion in the name of the Taoiseach, seconded by the Leader of the Opposition, would have got the full support of the House.  It is unfortunate that that is not the case. While many of us have reservations about American foreign policy, it must be remembered that President Reagan is visiting this country as the democratically elected leader of the American people. In offering President Reagan an opportunity to address a joint session of the Oireachtas it is my view that if we believe in democracy we should behave like democrats and give him the audience he deserves.  I will gladly play my part in giving that audience and I fully support the motion before the House.</P>

      <P>Like many other Members I did not intend to contribute to the debate because it was my understanding that it would be a short one.  It is a good thing that Members are having an opportunity to fully discuss the motion before us.  The motion is worthy of support from all sides of the House not because I support the foreign policy of President Reagan, not because there are 37,000 Irish jobs as a result of American investment, not because 40 million Irish-Americans live in America, but because President Reagan as head of the USA is a representative of that state, having been freely elected, and when he travels here he is worthy of our support and courtesy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the objectors see fit to absent themselves from here on 4 June and many others have decided to protest.  Are all sincerely motivated?  In many cases I do not doubt the sincerity of the manner in which they have chosen to object.  I disagree with them, but I give them the right to do that because we live in a free democracy, a society in which we all want to see that kind of protest allowed freely and no possible implication drawn from people's choice to involve themselves in such demonstrations.  I am sorry that some Members of this and the other House have chosen to behave in that way because I believe that many of them are <Col N="999" /> misled.  I know that some Members of this House who have decided not to come here on 4 June have done so from the best of motives.  It has taken them a long time to come to this decision and they have done so after careful consideration, and they should not be abused in this House or anywhere else for having reached that conclusion.  I believe that they have come to the wrong decision because as politicians our obligation and our duty as people who have been elected democratically to this House, as President Reagan has in his country, is to chose the political way, to have dialogue and discussion with those with whom we disagree.</P>
    <P>For the past 11 months the politicians from the four nationalist parties sat together in order to try to draw up a report to convince others on this island with whom we disagree that they should come with us around the conference table and try to thrash out a new Ireland for all the people here.  We acknowledge that there are people in Ireland who disagree with us, but we are prepared to understand their disagreement and we want them to enter into dialogue and discussion in order to convince them that they are wrong in the manner in which they happen to see things.  I disagree with President Reagan's foreign policy as much as I disagree with the shooting down of an aircraft by the Soviet Union, the harassment of Soviet Jews &mdash; many Deputies in the House tabled a motion last week in regard to that &mdash; and the denial of liberty to Polish workers; but many people who chose to enter into this debate have seen it from a one-side point of view.  Unfortunately demonstrations, irrespective of whether they are peaceful, draw into them the kind of people who are drawn into every possible demonstration. No matter what the issue, some people, motivated by malice or whatever, always see fit on an occasion like this to object, and I am sorry to say that in some cases they diminish the motivation of some of the other genuinely motivated people.  I was very disappointed last year when as a Member of this House I attended a reception at the American <Col N="1000" /> Embassy to meet the Vice-President of the US.  When I came out of that reception later that evening I watched a television programme on which I saw a Member of this House openly and publicly in front of a television camera tearing up his invitation.  That is not a responsible way for a Member of Dáil Éireann to behave. That is the kind of thing I would expect from the Rev. Ian Paisley but not from a Member of Dáil Éireann.  However, a Member of Dáil Éireann decided to behave in that way.  I hope that no other Members of the Dáil or Seanad will behave in that petty, silly manner on the occasion of 4 June.  That will not do anything to enhance the image of either the Members of this House or this country. Equally when I was attending that reception I was disappointed to find that as I entered I was abused continually by some of the people who saw fit to protest.  I would allow them their right to protest in a reasonable fashion.  They should allow me to chose my way of putting my point of view forward.  Just as I should not abuse them, neither should they chose to abuse those of us who see things in a different way.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that in some cases when people are putting forward a case for President Reagan being welcomed in this House or in this country they have chosen to highlight the fact that the importance of our trade links with America or of the Irish-American links should influence our behaviour in some way. The leader of the American people, their democratically elected president, their representative, is coming to this country, and these matters should not be brought into this discussion.</P>

      <P>This motion refers to the address of the President of the United States to the joint Houses of the Oireachtas. Of late the Irish people seem to have the doubtful ability of becoming overinvolved in matters over which they have not really any control.  As Deputy Coveney pointed out, quite rightly, we have an enormous number of overnight experts on El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras and Costa Rica.  Some of them even speak with a slight Spanish accent. People who speak on such important global matters do so in many cases from misinformation and even ignorance. People who speak on matters of that nature should do so from an informed point of view and many of our overnight experts do not do that.</P>
      <P>This visit of the President of the USA will not inspire the same level of emotional involvement as happened in the case of the late President Kennedy when he came here.  People's attitudes and views have changed.  As ours is a free country, undoubtedly some sort of protests will occur.  I hope that these will be dignified and peaceful.</P>
      <P>The motion refers to the address of the president before the joint Houses.  In his capacity as head of the US Government and President of that country he should be given the honour of full attendance in the House here.  I live in the west and every week for the last century people there have had direct contact with the US. Indeed, many families have been reared here directly as a result of finance from the US and their people in many cases built the cities and highways of that great country.  The influence of the US President in terms of the implications and consequences of the Forum for a New Ireland Report should not be underestimated, and I am sure that everybody on this island with a nationalist point of view would welcome his direct interest in that.</P>

    <P>I am surprised at the lack of protest by <Col N="1002" /> The Workers' Party Members in relation to Afghanistan.  While they have made some slight references to it they have not done so in the same context as their remarks on Central America.  Many people in this House are not qualified to speak with any degree of authority about the flash points across the globe, but it is well known that the Russians are now practising what analysts now call migratory genocide in Afghanistan.  The Red Army in their first armed conflict on foreign soil since the Second World War have now spent five years in occupation of a different country and we hear no protest about that and very little protest about the 20,000 young Afghans who have been taken to the Soviet Union for appropriate indoctrination and a certain kind of education.  Other flash points are Beirut, the Philippines and Central America.</P>
    <P>As a Government we should welcome the Presidential visit and we should welcome President Reagan as the head of a great country.  Politicians, as people involved in the circle of politics, often-times are carried away by the importance of this.  While the visit is very important another viewpoint abroad is far removed from the economic aspects of it.  I was in Cong village last weekend.  The President will stay there.  The local sewerage scheme is being put down there at present. I said to one of the workers there: &ldquo;I suppose after the presidential visit you will not be inclined to speak to anybody&rdquo;, and he said: &ldquo;You know, we are used to having important people down here.  We had Jim Mitchell here a few weeks ago&rdquo;. The ordinary people have a different viewpoint and they will welcome the President of the US.  Whether we like or dislike his foreign policies, we should give him the courtesy of coming into this Chamber and hearing his address as his representatives on both sides did when our Taoiseach addressed the Joint Houses in the US.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">

      <P>I am opposed to this motion principally because I firmly believe we as a small nation who suffered for so long from foreign aggression by an imperial power <Col N="1003" /> have special responsibility to protest, on the occasion of the visit of the President of the United States, about US interference and aggression, particularly in Central and South America.  If we do not register a strong protest we are in danger of being seen as supportive of current US foreign policy.  Millions of downtrodden people in South America are looking to us for an expression of solidarity with them and we are morally bound to show that solidarity.</P>
      <P>I am all the more opposed to this motion because of the calculated timing of the visit.  I believe the visit will be used to a significant degree in President Reagan's election campaign.  Indeed the visit is deliberately designed to assist his personal campaign.  Given the controversial nature of President Reagan's policies surely it is most inappropriate that a visit should take place at this point.</P>
      <P>This view has convinced me that a protest is essential and I intend to participate in such a protest.  I need hardly add that I share Deputy De Rossa's view on the forthcoming elections in the United States.  It would be better for world peace if President Reagan were not to be re-elected. If for no other reason I am opposed to this motion.</P>

      <P>Most of the relevant arguments have already been made but, because of the extensive coverage on this subject which has been given in recent weeks to a very small minority of people, I feel an obligation to state on behalf of all the people I know in my constituency and throughout the west that there is almost a unanimous will that we should give a céad míle fáilte to President Reagan as the head of a great democracy, a friendly nation with which Ireland has had such long contact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke about the platform given to a small minority who hold a certain view on this subject.  During the night when I drive long distances I can tune in to Radio Moscow.  The small minority who propose to offer insult to the Head of a State with which we are friendly would be very gratified at the coverage they are receiving on that station and the manner in <Col N="1004" /> which their words and actions are being used to deceive people who rely on that medium for their information and education about world affairs, people who are not free to get other information.  If I were to tune in tonight I am sure Deputy Mac Giolla would be portrayed as a majority leader in this House instead of the representative of a small minority.</P>
    <P>We have our concerns about American foreign policy but that is not relevant to the visit of the President and the welcome we should give him.  We have our concerns about economic policy.  When I campaign in the forthcoming election I will be proposing that one of the reasons we should have a united Europe is that we should not be dominated by American economic and foreign policy.  In the absence of such unity in western Europe the best guarantee we can have of choosing our own system of government is the fact that the United States is powerfully present on the world scene.</P>
    <P>I join with the majority in this House in offering céad míle fáilte to President Reagan and I implore those who would offer him any discourtesy to think of the traditional hospitality with which we have treated our visitors, particularly those from the United States of America.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the speeches in support of this motion from both sides of the House and even for the point of order.  I found Deputy De Rossa unconvincing in what he had to say about investment in tourism.  He suggested that investment was declining, as if that were a reason for taking actions which might make it decline further.  He said that tourism had been more affected by Northern Ireland than it would be by anything that might happen during this visit.  That is perfectly true but tourism that has been so badly hit by events in Northern Ireland cannot easily take further blows arising from adverse effects in the American <Col N="1005" /> market as a result of actions being taken that would seem to insult the office of the Presidency.  Although something like half the American people disagree with President Reagan &mdash; whether it is more or less than half we will find out in due course &mdash; nonetheless he is their President and they respect him as such.  They have a great respect for the office of the President and we should have a similar respect for it.  If we show disrespect it will undoubtedly have adverse effects.  It is right that these should be taken into account, though they should not be the primary consideration.</P>
      <P>The credibility of any attitude in international affairs, especially in a country like ours which is outside military alliances, depends on the avoidance of double standards.  The reason our position is respected worldwide is that we have been even-handed in our judgments.  When we as a Government on behalf of the Irish people have expressed our concern about aspects of US policy in Central America our voice has carried some weight, despite our small size, because we have expressed concern also about the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.  Tens of thousands of Afghans defending the freedom of a small country have been killed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla and his party carry no credibility because of their selective, pro-Soviet attitude.  I challenged Deputy De Rossa on Afghanistan.  He said he would deal with it but he did not do so. He chose to deal with other matters.  His party do not have, to my recollection, a record of a clear stand on Afghanistan or a clear and continuous condemnation of the Soviet Union.  I have not heard their voices raised anything like as vociferously on that subject as in regard to the United States.  There is no doubt that double standards are being applied.  It is clear that those who apply double standards carry no weight.  Any party that applies double standards in that way will not carry weight with the Irish people who are fair-minded and concerned with human rights everywhere, not just in some parts of the world upon which for ideological reasons some people concentrate their attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same is true of the nuclear question. <Col N="1006" /> On this, when challenged, Deputy De Rossa said that he had on some occasion deplored the deployment of SS20 missiles.  The fact is that in this House his leader, when speaking, chose to omit any reference to the SS20 missiles and claimed that it was the deployment of Pershing and Cruise missiles that deploy-off the current Soviet missile deployment. That is a <i>suppressio veri</i>&mdash; the omission of the initial act which brought about the cycle of build-up of arms.  I shall not go into the question here of whether the particular action in deploying Pershing or Cruise missiles was the most appropriate, or has been effective, or whether the matter might have been handled in another way.  I am concerned that double standards are applied in this way and an attempt&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">

There must be some reason why this activity relates to the reactive deployment but not the initial deployment which sparked it off. That reflects an inherent bias which leads to the attitudes of those concerned carrying very little weight with the bulk of our people.</P>
      <P>There is no room in the modern world for double standards.  We have to be concerned with human rights everywhere &mdash; in Central America, in Chile, in Poland, Afghanistan, South Africa or Iran and, indeed, it must be added, Northern Ireland.  No authority which applies double standards in a manner designed to favour the Soviet Union, concentrating its criticism on the United States only, will ever make any great headway in this country.</P>

Having said that about The Workers' Party, I should like to add &mdash;<Col N="1007" /> and it should be added, because some comments from some Deputies in the heat of the moment could be otherwise interpreted &mdash; that amongst those who are concerned to express their unhappiness at aspects of US policy there are many genuine democrats.  Amongst those concerned to protest on this occasion are people who do not apply double standards, who are as concerned, and in many cases more concerned, about Soviet actions than about United States actions. It would be wrong to apply epithets in this House to many people who are genuinely motivated and who are not governed by the double standards of The Workers' Party.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate has been useful.  The House has on this occasion expressed the feelings of the Irish people as a whole in a way, perhaps, that has not happened during the last few weeks through the media &mdash; and that is no fault of the media because they, like other institutions, can be used and abused.  Organised campaigns of letter writing can produce results which do not reflect the real feeling of the Irish people.  This House, elected by the Irish people, has a greater capacity to reflect their views.  I believe that it has done so here.  These views involve, certainly, concern about aspects of American policy which we can and will properly express in an appropriate way, but also involve a sense of the dignity of the State and the concern that in receiving the leader of what has been rightly described as the greatest democracy in the world we should bear ourselves in a manner that will be dignified and will be seen throughout the world to reflect credit on this country.  That is the will of the Irish people expressed through this <Col N="1008" /> House today and I believe that it will be very clearly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the issue of divorce is one of the nettles which various Governments from time to time have looked at and avoided grasping.  It is an indication of the kind of double standards which various Governments have applied in relation to social issues in the country. They have made various declarations in favour of social change but when it comes to actually getting into power and implementing their declared objectives the double standards are then applied and they back off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the need for divorce is beyond dispute.  The Committee on Marital Breakdown have received many submissions, the vast bulk of which have indicated that there is a need for divorce in this State and that the present devices used to extricate couples from marriages which have failed are not adequate.  We have a situation where there are 7,000 deserted wives at present in receipt of either deserted wife's benefit or allowance. I suppose that can be termed the <Col N="1010" /> Irish solution to an Irish problem.  There are many thousands more who, because they are in a different economic income bracket, have agreed to separate and make various financial arrangements. There are others who are in a higher bracket still and who can afford to go abroad and get foreign divorce.  There is the barring order, which is the clumsiest way of dealing with marital problems in this State.  To argue, as some people do, that there is no need for divorce in Ireland is to ignore all the evidence which exists and which any of us who are active in constituency advice centres can see every week.</P>
    <P>The Government have an opportunity on the occasion of the EEC elections to put it to the people of this State to remove the constitutional ban on divorce which is in the 1937 Constitution.  It is a long overdue reform of the Constitution.  The opinion polls over a great many years have shown a gradual increased support for the removal of that ban.  The most recent opinion poll puts it in excess of 60 per cent.  Obviously the real test is when it is put to the people in a referendum. We have the opportunity for both partners in the Coalition Government to put their declared policy into effect by presenting a referendum to the people on 14 June and testing the opinion of the people which in my view would be in favour of the removal of the ban.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the Government have decided to oppose the Bill which I moved in the House.  If they had not opposed it it would at least have allowed us to have a number of hours debate in the House on the issue.  This is something which has not occurred since 1937.  While there was a debate in the Seanad last year there has not been any debate in the Dáil for that length of time.  An opportunity has been lost by the Government by opposing the Bill at this time.  I appeal to the Minister of State not to oppose the Bill but to allow it to go forward for a Second Reading debate and put the policy of Fine Gael and the policy of the Labour Party, which are both in favour of divorce, into effect and end the double standards which have been practised in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are opposing the granting of leave to introduce this Bill.  The Dáil will be aware that when, acting on behalf of the Government, I opposed leave to introduce a similar Bill by Deputy De Rossa in February 1983 it was on the basis that the Government intended to set up a Joint Oireachtas Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  The Dáil will be equally aware that this committee were set up last year, with the agreement and participation of the main party in opposition, to consider the protection of marriage and family life, to examine the problems which follow the breakdown of marriage and to report to the Houses of the Oireachtas thereon.</P>
      <P>The philosophy underlying the setting up of the Oireachtas Committee was that the issue is of such crucial importance, that every attempt must be made to arrive at political consensus on how it should be dealt with and, while this process continues, leave to introduce the Bill will be opposed.  Common sense dictates, as the sponsors of the Bill well know, that a final decision by the Oireachtas on the question of divorce must await the report of the joint committee.  It is inevitable that the constitutional prohibition on divorce should come within the scope of the committee's inquiries and the Taoiseach, in replying to a parliamentary question asked by Deputy De Rossa, last year indicated that this aspect of the matter would indeed come within their deliberations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of whether to legislate for divorce is a question that has now definitely entered the arena of political debate in our country.  Whatever the outcome of that debate, whatever views one may hold, it is important that the question be faced and that it have serious consideration.  Many questions arise in this context: divorce is not a matter of a simple yes or no.  If we are to have divorce, is it to be divorce on demand?  If not why not, and what restrictions should be imposed?  If restrictions are imposed can those restrictions survive?  This last question arises because of the way <Col N="1012" /> divorce legislation has tended to develop in those countries whose laws permit divorce.</P>
    <P>I would, however, like to assure those who are personally concerned with marriage breakdown that both the Government and I share this concern and to the extent that this exchange enables public attention to be focused on the issue, it is certainly to be welcomed.  We live in changing times in which traditional answers no longer provide an adequate response.  As politicians, we are all aware that public opinion has moved in the direction of a more flexible and human approach to marriage breakdown and I am sure that the members of the joint committee are equally aware of the shift that is taking place in our society.  I cannot anticipate the conclusions of the committee, but I am satisfied that the best interests of people who are genuinely concerned with marriage breakdown is served by allowing the committee to get on with their work without let or hindrance.</P>
    <P>I would hope that our proceedings here today may encourage more serious and widespread public debate on these matters. That, I think, would be a very worthwhile outcome.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to provide the funds necessary to ensure the continuing operation of the five rural home economics colleges.</P>
      <P>This decision by the Government to withdraw the necessary finances from these colleges is blatant discrimination against women.  We hear much talk of women's rights but this is another example of the Government's attitude towards this matter.</P>
      <P>The five rural home economics colleges at Claremorris, Navan, Ardagh, Ramsgrange and Dunmanway are the colleges concerned.  It is important to point out that when the Department of Agriculture was established in 1900 it was known as the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction.  Among the functions of the Department were to aid, improve and develop the agriculture of Ireland in such a way as to stimulate the self-reliance of the people.  The intention was to help the people to help themselves, especially by encouraging local initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1014" /> Under the 1900 and the 1931 Acts the county committees of agriculture were set up to administer schemes to help rural people.  In those early days the Department of Agriculture, through the county committees of agriculture, also set up schemes of education.  These schemes were administered by instructors who were employed to help rural people.  The Department recognised that progress depended on the training of Irish instructors and educators so that they could impart their knowledge to the young men and women of rural Ireland.  The thinking at that time was sound.</P>
    <P>By way of grant subsidy the Department set up a faculty of agriculture in UCD and they also set up the Munster Institute in Cork to train instructors in poultry keeping and dairying.  This was for the purpose of training poultry technicians to deal with practical problems of poultry production and dairying.  The Munster Institute trained teachers to teach dairying and poultry production in the rural home economics schools.  In more recent times the Munster Institute trained farm home advisers.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture recognised the value of research and the problems relating to farming and rural living. They carried out research at their institutions, at the agricultural schools and colleges and also at Johnstown Castle in Wexford.  Responsibility for this research was transferred to An Foras Talúntais in 1958 and this still continues in vigorous form.  Responsibility for agricultural instruction, advice and education was transferred to ACOT in 1980.</P>
    <P>Education is a continuing process throughout adult life.  Like so many cutbacks by this Government, particularly in the agricultural area, the farm home advisory service has been phased out. This has been done on the instructions of the Government in a money-saving exercise. It is now being replaced on a much slimmed-down basis by a socio-economic service that will deal with farm problems and the problems of farm housewives in a very limited way.  It will not be done on as broad a basis as the farm home advisory services that have operated up to now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1015" /> In addition to advice and education given locally in the counties, the county committees of agriculture and their successor, ACOT, provide scholarships in agriculture and horticulture to agricultural schools.  Some of the schools are owned by the Department and some are privately owned and State-aided.  These scholarships have enabled young farmers in their late teens and early twenties to spend a year at an agricultural school where they obtained a sound knowledge of the principles of agriculture and how to apply them.  This is justified because farming today calls for business and technical knowledge of a high level.  The farmer of the future must understand the sciences of animal production, of crops, as well as the importance of maintaining farm records and accounts in order to meet the demands of modern agriculture in knowledge and practical skills.</P>
    <P>Along with these agricultural colleges there are State-aided private residential colleges of rural home economics of which there are five, to which scholarships were provided by ACOT for young girls. The course of instruction at these colleges is designed to prepare young women for farm work and rural living generally.  The course includes dairying, poultry-keeping, gardening, household management, cookery, laundry and needlework.  Participants are also taught the necessary practical skills when they return to their home farm or when they marry into a farm.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Yet, in an ever-developing technological era, when so much skill and expertise is required, we find that these five rural home economics colleges are being phased out, and that scholarships are no longer being awarded to young girls to avail of their courses.  The Munster Institute, which trained instructors and teachers; has been closed by the Department of Agriculture.  If we are not careful in the very near future we will arrive at a stage when not alone will rural people not possess the skills to do their job but we will not have teachers to train them because of the closures of training colleges like the ones to which I have referred.  Yet we have the Minister for Agriculture asking that we should be more self-sufficient in cereals, fruit, vegetables and so on.  In the context of the report issued today on the food-processing industry surely it is important that we endeavour to produce a proportion of <Col N="1017" /> imported products?  The ideal way of doing so is through the training of our young boys, particularly, and girls in the area of self-sufficiency.  As a result of the closure of these colleges men and women in rural areas will not have an appreciation of the home-produced material because they will not have been trained in their value.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> It is important that such knowledge and skills be instilled in their youth in order that they form a balanced judgment.  Otherwise they will be brain-washed by the multinationals by high-powered advertising and through the media into accepting what is alien to them and what may be of dubious value to the country.</P>
      <P>The closure of these colleges certainly will lower the educational standards of the farm family.  It constitutes a blatant discrimination against farm women and, ultimately, the farm family.  When one considers the paltry amount of money involved as against moneys made available to AnCO for industrial training, one will readily see the point I make in regard to discrimination.  The amendment proposed by the Minister reads:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann endorses the policy of the government that in the allocation of State support to agriculture, priority in the provision for agricultural education and training should be given to activities which contribute directly to increasing agricultural production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely the Minister is not implying that these colleges would not contribute to increasing agricultural production? Nothing could be further from the truth because I have ascertained from my contacts with these colleges that 85 per cent of the girls who participate in courses at them end up as farmers' wives, contributing in a very real way to increased agricultural production.  Therefore the Minister's amendment rings very hollow and clearly indicates to me that the Minister is unaware of the facts.  This is blatant discrimination by the Minister and the <Col N="1018" /> Government against the women of rural Ireland, particularly the young girls on whom the future of our country is dependent.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this matter.  In the course of the debate this evening and tomorrow evening my colleagues will outline every clearly the other advantages of retaining these colleges and providing the small amount of money required.  These should be retained as institutions &mdash; notwithstanding what has been said by this Minister &mdash; which will contribute to increased agricultural production in the future.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider his decision to close down these colleges for the reasons I have outlined, for the importance of the role played by women in rural society, contributing to agricultural production, as they have done in the past and will in the future.  Time and time again it has been said that behind every good man there is a good woman. Is this not more evident in agriculture which contributes upwards of 50 per cent of our total net exports, comprising the very basis of our economy?  Therefore our farm women, who may ultimately become farmers' wives, should have a basic training in the rudiments of good farming, ensuring that agriculture in the future will contribute to our economy.</P>

      <P>The Deputies will find all the decisions in the Book of Estimates. Among the factors which underlay that decision were the following: The colleges were originally set up early in the century to equip farmers' daughters with the practical skills to manage a family farm home and to operate farm enterprises such as butter-making and poultry-keeping. Changes in social and economic conditions have gradually diminished the contribution they make directly to the training needs of the agricultural industry, notwithstanding periodic revisions of the curriculum.  In the words of the ACOT expert group which examined the situation in regard to agricultural education and training in 1981, the one-year RHE College Course &mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>is largely a young home-managers course with some emphasis on agriculture. <Col N="1021" /> It does not lead directly to a profession or career in agriculture and most girls take up a non-agricultural occupation on leaving.</P>
    <P>Data available on the destinations of 122 students leaving two of the colleges in the years 1980 and 1981 would confirm this comment of the expert group.  Only 15 per cent of these students went to work on their home or other farms or proceeded immediately to further training in agriculture.</P>

      <P>By contrast, 56 per cent went into nursing, catering or secretarial work.  Indeed a survey carried out in one county showed that not a single one of the 32 girls who attended the colleges on State scholarships over the period from 1977 to 1981 was engaged in agriculture at the time of the survey (1982).</P>

      <P>Training in home economics which accounts for about 70 per cent of the RHE programme is of course widely available through the general education system.  It goes without saying that the residential training system of the RHE colleges catering for some 250 students is an expensive one.  The State support for the RHE colleges has been substantial, covering full recoupment of teachers' and technicians' salaries, grants for student capitation and management expenses, while scholarships were awarded through ACOT to the majority of the students &mdash; 75 per cent in 1981.  In addition capital improvements were grant-aided to the extent of 70 per cent for student accommodation and 50 per cent otherwise.  In 1980-81, 204 students attended RHE colleges.  I exclude here the Home Economics College at Dunmanway which is only partially funded for RHE training.  In that year total State non-capital expenditure, including scholarships, was £437,575 or £2,145 per student, as compared with £2,040 per student for university and £780 for secondary education.  In addition, capital grants amounting to £56,000 were paid to the RHE colleges that year, bringing total subventions to almost £500,000.</P>
      <P>These then were some of the factors on which the previous Government had based their decision.  In doing so, they no doubt also had in mind their own declared priorities in regard to Exchequer funding for agriculture.  Perhaps the proposers of the original motion will bear with me if I quote briefly from a document they may recall, <i>The Way Forward.</i></P>
      <P>At page 61 we read:</P>
      <P>Resources available to the Exchequer are limited and will remain so for the foreseeable future.  Agricultural policy must, therefore, be redesigned in the context of a reallocation of existing resources, i.e. farmer's own resources and those of the Exchequer, in such a way that the overall level of returns to agriculture will be significantly improved;</P>
      <P>and again at Paragraph 6&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's objective in <Col N="1023" /> relation to agriculture is to achieve the greatest possible increase in output with consequential improvements in farm income, the balance of payments and the impact on demand throughout the economy.  The utilisation of resources, whether of a current or capital nature will be strictly related to this objective and policies will be directed towards:</P>
    <P>&mdash; ensuring a more efficient use of inputs with a view to generating increased net agricultural product; </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>On coming into office, the Government reviewed the decision which had been taken in regard to the funding of these colleges but, in the light of the serious financial situation, they found themselves unable to reverse it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is in line with a major objective of Government policy &mdash; to provide a framework within which the agricultural industry can grow on an efficient and progressive basis and to ensure that the sector makes the greatest possible contribution to the national economy.  It follows that State spending on agriculture must be directed to those activities which contribute most directly to increasing farm production.  Consideration of the Government's support programme for agriculture &mdash; as indeed for all sectors &mdash; must be looked at in the context of the problems in relation to the public finances.  Notwithstanding the action which the Government have already taken to correct the position, the situation &mdash; despite a considerable improvement &mdash; remains serious.  It is the Government's view that it is more than ever imperative that the main thrust of Exchequer support for agriculture as for all other sectors must be for directly productive purposes.  This inevitably has <Col N="1024" /> called for many decisions which may be unwelcome but nevertheless must be faced.  Expenditure on rural home economics colleges has to be seen in this light.  The facts which I have already set out on the marginal contribution which they make to agricultural training speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>I might add here that there is no question of any discrimination against women in the decision taken.  There is equal access for boys and girls to training in the agricultural and horticultural colleges under ACOT.  I am glad to say that the number of girls entering these colleges has been increasing in recent years and is currently about 10 per cent of the student total.</P>
    <P>At present over 1,000 students are attending these agricultural colleges run and supported by the Department.  That number has doubled over the past 12 or 15 years.  It is a considerable number.  As well as that, 1,000 students are participating in ACOT certificates in farm training. That was when the course started last year.  It is open to both boys and girls. Far from discriminating we are expanding the involvement of women in this activity, in farmer training.  We would be the last party to deny women a fair share in participation in any such training.  We are the party who led the way in this House in providing articulate and independent-minded women such as Deputy Taylor-Quinn.</P>

This was conditional on the necessary State funding for that purpose being provided to ACOT and this has been done.  This has given a breathing space during which the colleges could consider their future course.  Last year the colleges, through ACOT, submitted a modification of the course as a basis on which the State funding might be continued.  I found myself unable to accept the proposals as they did not constitute a sufficient re-orientation of their traditional activities to warrant an approach to the Government to have the original decision reversed.</P>
      <P>However, in view of the possibility of the colleges having a role to play in the context of general youth employment and training programmes within the province of the Youth Employment Agency or AnCO, my Department have been in touch with these agencies and have facilitated the college management association in entering negotiations with them in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Labour, at my request, has been actively involved for some months past.  This followed a meeting I had with representatives of the board of ACOT.  I am as anxious, if not more so, as any Deputy present that these colleges should continue to provide a meaningful agricultural training for young people, whether girls or boys, or both.  We would like to see the Youth Employment Agency and AnCO helping in this area.  They get considerable funds <Col N="1026" /> from the European Social Fund.  It is more appropriate that the type of training which is necessary should be administered by one of these State agencies.  The Minister for Labour and I are anxious that one of these groups, or perhaps both of them in unison, should take over the role of financing these colleges in the future.</P>

      <P>I particularly dislike being accused of evading an issue when I am trying to be helpful.  If these colleges are left under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture, if their courses do not change sufficiently, and if their curricula do not change there is no future for them. Their future lies in a change of direction. If that change of direction takes place, they could be financed by the two agencies I mentioned.</P>

However, as far as the provision of further funding through ACOT is concerned, the position must remain for the reasons already outlined, that the original Government decision cannot be reversed.  Rather than having the closure I strongly recommend to the House that the line of approach I have suggested be adopted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's contribution was like a long-playing record we hear on occasions when there is anything awkward to be dealt with or decided on. We are told on those occasions that the last Government had made the decisions. One would think that the Government were bound by every decision taken by the last Government.  If I wanted I could spell out all the decisions that were changed by the Government because they did not like what the last Government had done.  If they liked the decisions of the last Government the people were told that the last Government had made the decision and would have to carry the can.  The Minister should realise that he and his colleagues were elected to govern the country.  The Minister's contribution tonight reflects his thoughts and his speech on the night he was appointed to the Department of Agriculture.  At 1.30 a.m.  I was with the Minister when he announced on radio that he did not know in God's name why the Taoiseach put him into the Department of Agriculture. He said he had experience in health because he was a member of a health board, had experience of local government because he was a member of a <Col N="1029" /> country council, but for the life of him he could not understand why the Taoiseach put him into Agriculture.  Today our farmers have a good idea why the Taoiseach should not have put him into Agriculture, but the Minister does not seem to have realised that as yet.</P>
      <P>The Minister's miserly contribution tonight shows clearly that not alone did he not know anything about the courses run in those colleges but he was hardly interested in their existence.  I am aware that when they were trying to contact the Minister in Waterford he was not the slightest bit interested in them.  That was his first response.  Under pressure from some of his party the Minister had to give them a hearing.</P>

I was a member of a Cabinet and I am aware that a Minister can jockey around money any way he wishes.  A decision is made on a certain amount and the Minister can change around the subheads any way he wishes. If the Minister takes a look at the Estimates I put forward in the Department of Industry and Energy, which his colleague changed very little, he will see I reduced it by 21.4 per cent in 1983 without any hassle.  I exercised common sense and had my feet on the ground.  I did not go around looking for excuses. Nobody ever heard of a Government 18 months after they came to power blaming the previous administration for taking certain decisions.  I must emphasise that as a member of the Cabinet I consistently opposed the closure of those colleges.</P>

There are people in the Department of Agriculture who for a reason best known to themselves want to draw a hatchet on such places, and for a long time.  This is not the first occasion that this has appeared on the horizon.  If that is the view of the Department of Agriculture, the Minister and the Government, I call on them to to back to the Cabinet table and get the Department of Education to pay the salaries of the people involved or get the Department of Labour involved, as I suggested on many occasions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been a member of the Cabinet for 18 months and he has not done anything.  One would imagine that the Ministers were living on different continents because they cannot contact each other.  The Minister cannot contact the Ministers for Education or Labour to decide on a constructive approach to this.  The Minister must be aware that such colleges have served rural Ireland well.  They have prepared women for managing household budgets. I am sure the Minister is aware of how important that is today.  We have not heard anything from the Government since they took office except how they were running their budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard talk tonight about scarce resources.  I do not know how the Government can continue to repeat the argument about scarce resources when they increased our national debt by £2,900 million in 1983.  On taking office they said they would reduce foreign borrowing, but they increased it.  They have not a clue what way the economy will turn out at the end of the year and have the audacity to try to convince the House that because of financial reasons they want to change this.  If the lady Members are worth their salt they will get together <Col N="1031" /> like they did last week to get this decision changed in favour of the women of Ireland.  I hope that when we have the vote tomorrow night we will see all the ladies joining together.  Last week they were able to twist the arm of Minister Dukes and tell him how wrong he was. This Minister has gone as far wrong in regard to this for the sake of a miserly few pounds.</P>
    <P>One of those colleges is located in my constituency and has been operating since 1927.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>They are aware of my position.  There were reductions by every Department in the 1983 Estimates, although some people said Fianna Fáil would never do that.  The Minister has told us that every item that was reduced in those Estimates was decided at Cabinet level.  He should not give me that nonsense.  It will not wash with me.  The Minister should not try to convince those who have not been in a Cabinet how the system operates.  If the Minister knows anything about how to run his Department he is aware that it is possible to find £50,000, £100,000 or £400,000 under a different subhead and that the Minister for Finance will be only too glad to let a Minister have whatever projects he likes in his Department.  If, however, it is all to be run by the Department of Finance, as appears to be the position now, then it cannot be done.  If all Ministers maintain their own independent republic and do not care what happens in any other Department it is no wonder the Government are on a hiding to nothing with the Irish people.  It is no wonder that the Government ran away from the local elections because they knew they would get their answer.  They will get their answer in the European elections and a resounding answer in Laois-Offaly.  It is a pity that one of the colleges is not located in that constituency because the Government are inclined to change their <Col N="1032" /> views when sufficient pressure is put on them.</P>
      <P>There is a request with the Department of Education for a subvention of £24,500 to keep the rural college in Ardagh, County Longford, in business.  The teaching sisters there are prepared to forego their salary cheques to keep their school open because they know the benefit it is to the rural community and how well the girls they turn out are prepared for life in the household or in a career.  That represents their contribution.  I do not think it is unreasonable for any politician to ask the Government to match that with £24,500 from Government funds to keep that college open and give 53 young girls an opportunity to be educated in rural science, domestic economy and home management.  If the Government vote that request down on Wednesday night, so be it; but when they go to the people of rural Ireland they will get their answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said time and again that the Government are only interested in Pale politics and if matters do not concern Dublin city and the east coast they are not of any interest to the Government. This type of decision demonstrates that that is the real situation.  An amount of £24,500 is being requested in subvention towards the salary of the lay people teaching in that college and if the Minister does not consent to this he will be creating six redundancies in that area, putting six people out on the dole away from teaching for the sake of £24,500.  If the Minister for Labour has to give them redundancy pay or otherwise then they will be paid a damn sight more than £24,500 between six.  Also 53 young girl students will be deprived of the opportunity of furthering their careers and the Minister will have them walking around the streets as he has 220,000 people walking around the streets because he does not know what makes the economy tick or when he is getting good value for money.  The financial position must be put right but using a sledgehammer to crack a nut is not the way to do it.  He can get better value for the money he is spending.  The people have no idea how he managed to push up the national debt by £2,900 million, yet he comes in here <Col N="1033" /> talking about the few quid which could be very well spent and make a decent contribution to rural life.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not seem to recognise that those colleges have given sterling service down through the years, that they are making a fundamental contribution to home management.  It is just as hard for people in rural Ireland today to manage a household budget as it is for the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Finance, to manage his budget.  Yet the Minister is prepared to take away the training and career prospects from these students and to say that rural Ireland does not need good housekeeping.  He has been preaching good housekeeping since he came into Government and long before that.  Indeed, he has not been very successful at it so far and he will not be successful if he makes this sort of decision.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government have stood back from the vital decisions necessary to put this economy right.  He knows them as well as I do.  They preached for two elections before they came into office that current expenditure had to be cut down.  They talked about miserly decisions and tried to pass the blame to somebody else; yet they took the soft option in two successive budgets of reducing capital expenditure because they were not prepared to take the unpopularity or the political flak for some decisions that had to be taken.  However, saving £24,500 at the expense of the rural college in Ardagh will not put the country's finances right.  When the people elected the Government they elected a Government they thought would look after all the interests of all the people and not just the Pale politics of Dublin and the east coast.</P>
    <P>There are many options and solutions. I would not object one iota to taking this away from the Minister's Department because somebody over there decided long ago that it should go.  In his speech here tonight the Minister appeared to say that he would love to pass it on to somebody else.  Let him get the money from wherever he likes and forget about this present carry-on between Ministers saying: &ldquo;I was talking to the Minister for <Col N="1034" /> Labour and maybe he will do something&rdquo;. The Ministers sit at the Cabinet table I do not know how many times a week.  I know that the meetings have become very boring and that Ministers are not appearing as often as they should and some of them are tired of going to them.  I can see by their faces that Ministers are disillusioned because they cannot do the things they want to do, the Taoiseach rambles on and no decision is taken.  All you can do is try to pass the buck to a Government 18 months out of office.</P>
    <P>Forecasts are made up and known by the name of Estimates.  The Government produced and carried through this House the budget of 1984 which brought effect to the Estimates that were produced.  The Government were bound by no Estimates produced by a previous Government, by no blanket decision as to what reductions were to be made and in what areas.  The Government examined the Estimates when they came in and changed any that suited them to change. Do not try to pass the buck and the responsibility down the line.  The Government have the responsibility. They were elected to do it and they brought in that budget in January 1984 which implemented those decisions. They must carry the can and take the responsibility because God and the Irish people hate people who run away from their responsibilities and try to blame somebody else.  That feature has been developed by this Government since they came in.  It has been developed very well and very professionally by the professional handlers of this Government.  It is no wonder that their faces were down on the floor last week when the opinion polls showed that people thought for the first time that the Government have gone wrong.  The trend in those polls in the last while shows that it did not happen overnight. It will continue to happen because the Government have been found out 18 months after they went in.  They are all talk and no action.  Governments are about leadership, decision, action, not about looking into this and that, it is under consideration, we will appoint a committee, a task force, a planning board <Col N="1035" />&mdash;everything under the sun that you can name.  Governments are elected to rule, to lead the country, to make decisions. The Government have passed over decision-making to every conceivable task force committee, task force of Ministers, everything they could dream about, to try to get away from the responsibility.</P>
    <P>The real problem is inherent within the Government because the two parties are ideologically different.  They have no unity of purpose.  They cannot agree on what to do, and when any little bit of good news comes out concerning, for instance, the National Development Corporation that the Minister seems to think is a good idea, what happens?  The Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and the Minister for Energy rush to the Press, one blaming the other for upstaging him.  That is not what Government is all about.  They must decide to make their decisions and get rid of the paralysis.</P>
    <P>The excuse that previous Governments were to blame when they have been in government for 18 months will not wash with the people or in relation to the rural college in Ardagh.  No Government can justify the closing of such an institution. I am not familiar with the other four but other speakers will line them out.  This college is isolated.  It is not part of a secondary operation that can use its facilities otherwise.  It is a unity of purpose. The sisters there have made a contribution in good faith.  They are asking for a response from the Government and expect a result from this motion tomorrow night when it will be voted on.</P>
    <P>The Minister has plenty of time between now and then to tell this House who is going to make up the funding.  We do not mind who does it.  The Government can decide.  The Minister can make his decision any day he likes.  They have a lady Minister for Education who has had the application on her desk for quite a long time.  I will accept in good faith that the Minister has been talking to the Minister for Labour.  We have until tomorrow night to find out the results of the long discussions and consultations.  In <Col N="1036" /> 1983 the same Department handed back £11.5 million into the Exchequer because they did not know what to do with it in relation to young people.  An obvious way to spend spend £11.5 million is in relation to career guidance, which was referred to.  The Department of Labour have money that they could not spend in 1983.  Maybe they cannot spend it all in 1984 but they are not going to spend it in industrial development.  They are going to produce only about 1,100 jobs this year.  Money is to be got from various Departments.  Other Departments may have a little money to spare but no Department would tell you.</P>
    <P>The Government are charged with the responsibility of governing.  Give people value for money.  Recognise the problems of rural Ireland.  They will not get smaller.  Let the Minister show his concern that young girls like this have the opportunity of being educated in the role they want to play in society, that he is caring and concerned about rural Ireland.  We will know from the attitude the Minister adopts tomorrow night.  I hope he will take the opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Motion before the House, which is:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to provide the funds necessary to ensure the continuing operation of the five rural home economics colleges.</P>
      <P>The Government, through the Minister for Agriculture, intend to close the colleges on 30 June 1984.  I am absolutely disgusted when I read the amendment put down by the Minister.  We do not ask where the funds are to come from &mdash; we do not care if the money comes from the YEA or AnCO &mdash; provided the five rural home economics colleges are kept open. I thought I detected a wilting in the Minister's stance in relation to the colleges. Maybe he is only now waking up to the fact that they are due to close on 30 June. I hope it will not be a case of closing the door when the horse has bolted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to clear up the matter of who took the decision to close the colleges in the first instance.  All Departments came under the hatchet in the Book of Estimates <Col N="1037" /> prepared by Fianna Fáil, and this line of action was followed by the present Government.  In our Book of Estimates we did not specify that the five rural colleges should close.  ACOT received on 17 June 1983 a communication from the Minister for Agriculture specifying that the colleges should close.  That was the first communication received on the matter by ACOT.  The Minister should not give us the bull that we were the people who decided to close the colleges.  If the Minister can disprove what I am saying, then I will listen to him.  When I see the communication from the Fianna Fáil Minister to ACOT specifying that the five colleges should close, then I will believe the Minister.  I am a member of Wexford County Committee of Agriculture and it was indicated to us that this very definite direction came from the Minister to ACOT on 17 June.</P>
    <P>I have a particular interest in the Ramsgrange College but I am also interested in the whole scene because of the tremendous work that has been done through the years.  The amount needed to keep the five colleges open for a year is £446,000, or about £100,000 per college. The colleges made tremendous sacrifices last year and did everything possible to enable them to remain open.  They sought scholarships and held open days, and this kind of activity received the full co-operation of all rural organisations in Wexford and throughout the country because they believed that they should be kept open.  I do not believe any group of colleges in any sphere of education could have given such excellent productivity as the rural home economics colleges.  The teachers there are wonderful.  I do not know if the Minister has met them, although the Minister of State has done so and concurs with my view.  In Ramsgrange we have a wonderful principal in the person of Sister Matthias.  She has been reasonable and very patient and has put all her energies into keeping open these colleges.  The Ramsgrange College is in an excellent state of repair and anybody who visited it could only remark that it seemed to be very new, although it was in existence prior to 1900.  This is a reflection of the way the Sisters of St. <Col N="1038" /> Louis have kept the college.  The work done by religious has not been recognised. Nuns, Christian Brothers and other religious have done a tremendous job, not only for agricultural education but for all types of education.  This is particularly true of Ramsgrange and the other home economics colleges.</P>
    <P>I was delighted that Deputy Yates raised this matter last year.  He definitely committed himself, as can be seen in the Official Report, to the continuation of that college.  I am sure that will be reflected in his vote tomorrow.  Deputy D'Arcy and Deputy Avril Doyle have also indicated their strong support for keeping Ramsgrange College open, and I am sure the people of Wexford will be very interested to see how they vote tomorrow.</P>
    <P>There are five of these colleges and the size of the farms are as follows: Ramsgrange, County Wexford &mdash; 67 acres; Ardagh, County Longford &mdash; 230 acres; Claremorris, County Mayo &mdash; 30 acres; Portumna, County Galway &mdash; 30 acres; Dunmanway, County Cork &mdash; 25 acres. They have capacity for 260 students in full-time residential training.  27 salaries are recouped by ACOT and 25 others are not recouped.  Total State financial aid in 1982 was £446,500.</P>
    <P>The course content in the colleges is of major significance, particularly since the Minister has tried to tell us that because the colleges have been in operation since 1900 the courses are out of date.  There is a course on dairying which is concerned with milking, dairy hygiene, calf rearing, common diseases, feeding and management. Does the Minister feel these are relevant today?  The course also deals with the production of dairy products such as cheese, butter and yogurt.  I have often heard the Minister say that if we are to make progress in the dairy industry we must diversify and go into the area of new cheeses, new types of yogurt.  These courses are training people for the very things about which the Minister has so often spoken with conviction, yet he now finds it necessary to close the colleges and put an end to the training of people in these areas.  How hypocritical can he be? The aim of the course is that any student <Col N="1039" /> should be able to operate a dairy unit profitably.</P>
    <P>Farm accounts are an important aspect in the colleges, and this subject has been dealt with by my colleague, Deputy Noonan.  The Department of Agriculture insist that farm accounts be kept.  My personal view is that it is absolutely essential. It is well known that farmers are not the best keepers of accounts.  I suppose they did not have the same educational facilities as those in other walks of life. Therefore, they leave it to the good wife and in most cases she is a fairly good accounts keeper.  Farmers' wives could be trained in accounts keeping, yet, against his own advice again, the Minister will not support this training.  He wishes to close down those very relevant courses which have existed since 1900.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Chair, I propose to take 12 or ten minutes and to give eight or ten minutes to Deputy McEllistrim.</P>
      <P>On 2 May I asked the Minister for Finance if he would take urgent action to prevent the proposed sale of land on the Muckross Road, Killarney, which was purchased by the State in connection with the provision of accommodation for the Department of Justice staff to be transferred to Killarney under the decentralisation programme and also if he would make a statement on the up-to-date position.</P>
      <P>I am most dissatisfied with the Minister's answer as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is Government policy to dispose of all property surplus to State requirements, <Col N="1040" /> including sites which were acquired for the decentralisation programme. </P>
    <P>I wish to give a brief history of the decentralisation programme generally and in relation to Killarney.  The Fianna Fáil Government considered carefully the proposal for the decentralisation of Government offices.  I want to put it on record that I have consistently, both in this House and outside it, favoured decentralisation to the maximum possible extent down the years.  The Fianna Fáil administration in 1980 decided to embark on a programme for decentralisation and Killarney was designated as the town to which a part of the Department of Justice staff would be transferred &mdash; I understand about 200.  I know full well what this meant, even to people employed in the State service in Dublin, because many in all grades were applying for transfers to the Department of Justice in order to get down to Killarney, particularly people who had come to the Civil Service in Dublin from the south and south west.</P>
    <P>The land was purchased early in 1981. At that time it was very difficult to get land in Killarney for any type of project, but the owner of the land in question was glad to sell it to the Government when he realised that it was required for State purposes.  His family stated that they would not hinder progress, particularly when the State were interested.</P>
    <P>In 1982 plans were prepared and put out for tender by the then Fianna Fáil administration.  The tenders were being considered at the time of the change of Government in December 1982.  There was a Private Members' Motion some time in 1983 in connection with the decentralisation programme, requesting the Government to change their decision. This was defeated by the Government on a vote.  I always was and am in favour of decentralisation because Dublin has become top heavy.  It is well known that decentralisation, to a great extent, would ease many of the problems here in Dublin, such as planning, traffic, housing, environmental and transport problems. I could understand a Government <Col N="1041" /> deciding, in special circumstances, to postpone for a short period such a programe, but to abandon it is outrageous.</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind what 200 jobs of this nature would mean to a town like Killarney and the surrounding area.  The people of the area were considerably looking forward to the construction of the offices, and their staffing and manning. There is no doubt that such a project would be of tremendous benefit to the business community in the whole area.  It would benefit the retail outlets, the garages, be a great boost for the housing and construction industry and would mean more employment in the area of recreational facilities in the town and in the surrounding district.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to reconsider favourably their decision regarding this decentralisation programme and to declare this intention.  I cannot understand the thinking behind the decision to abandon entirely this scheme.  I ask the Government, above all, not to sell the sites which have been purchased for the decentralisation programme throughout the country and particularly that in Killarney, where the State own thousands of acres of arable land.  This particular site is suitable for Government offices and would not be suitable for other types of development, outside of housing perhaps. It is in a residential-cum-business area of the town.</P>
    <P>There would be an outcry, not alone in Killarney but throughout the country, should the Government embark on their intention of selling this site.  If they have not the will to develop it as Government offices I ask them to retain it until Fianna Fáil are returned to office.  Fianna Fáil would proceed with the programme of decentralisation which is realistic, justifiable and in the national as well as in other interests.  I have no doubt that this property will be developed as Government offices some time &mdash; perhaps in the not too distant future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>I also was extremely disappointed at the reply to Deputy O'Leary's question which stated that the Government intended selling the site <Col N="1042" /> which was purchased in Muckross in Killarney for decentralisation.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil had a decentralisation programme and at that time purchased 13 sites throughout the whole country.  They got great co-operation from many of the urban councils in the different counties who offered premier sites for this purpose. I was Minister of State in the Office of Public Works at the time when the site in Muckross, Killarney, was purchased. It is a beautiful site, in a marvellous area in Killarney where it is very difficult to get sites.  It was a great achievement by the Office of Public Works to be able to negotiate a deal and get a site in Muckross. I am very disappointed to hear that the Government intend selling that site. The Fianna Fáil Government selected 13 towns for decentralisation.  Some of the places selected were Killarney, Limerick, Nenagh, Cavan, Ennis, Letterkenny and Galway.  Those buildings were designed by architects in the Office of Public Works.  It must be very disappointing to those people after designing such beautiful buildings to see the whole programme scrapped.</P>
      <P>I was very disappointed, like Deputy O'Leary, to hear that the site near Killarney was up for sale.  I appeal to the Government, even at this very late stage, not to sell this site because at some future date, when we have a Fianna Fáil Government in power who are very committed to decentralisation, the decentralisation programme will be carried out.  I believe the section in the Office of Public Works dealing with decentralisation was disbanded some time ago.  That means the Government do not intend to go ahead with any of the decentralisation programme.  This programme under Fianna Fáil was fully supported by the Public Service and a significant number of civil servants were to be transferred down the country.  They welcomed this because they would get an opportunity to work in rural Ireland in their own counties and some would get an opportunity to work in their own towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil started decentralisation when they transferred motor registration to Shannon.  This has been very successful. Decentralisation would bring many <Col N="1043" /> social benefits.  It would be a great relief to Dublin in relation to infrastructure, less traffic in the city, fewer houses needed in the city, where there is a great demand for them, and less parking.  It would also mean that the salaries of those civil servants would be spent in the 13 selected towns which would be a great boon to the economies of those towns, and rural Ireland.  There would be more room in the schools throughout the country for the children of those civil servants.</P>
    <P>It was anticipated that over 200 civil servants would be transferred to Killarney. We hoped that 150 private houses would be needed in Killarney to house those civil servants within a year or one-and-a-half years of their transfer which would give a great boost to the construction industry.  It is a very bad time for the Government to sell those sites.  The property market is in very bad shape and some of those sites will not realise half the price they cost.  I appeal to the Minister of State to ask his colleagues in Government to hold on to those sites because the property market is so bad they may not be able to sell them.</P>
    <P>The construction industry in rural Ireland is doing very badly.  If decentralisation proceeded it would mean there would be construction of buildings worth between £50 million and £60 million which would be a great boost to this industry.  Parts of the country are becoming denuded of people.  Those civil servants would give a great boost to rural Ireland especially to County Kerry and Killarney.  This is not the first time the Government have undermined the activities of the Office of Public Works because some time ago they laid off 260 drainage workers.  Now they are discontinuing the decentralisation programme and selling those sites.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil intend to go ahead with the decentralisation programme.  This was welcomed by all public servants who would be given an opportunity to work in their own towns and counties.  Those sites were specially selected with great co-operation from the sellers.  We also got great co-operation from the county councils and the urban councils to get <Col N="1044" /> those sites, some of which were bought at a reasonable price.  I appeal to the Minister of State not to sell those sites as we will have decentralisation when we get back to power sometime in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Bermingham) Joseph Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Bermingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>This site of 2.77 acres at Muckross Road, Killarney, was purchased in connection with the decentralisation programme which has now been cancelled.  The Minister for Finance has directed the Commissioners of Public Works to dispose of properties surplus to State requirements in order to provide additional funds for the commissioners' building programme which in turn generates great employment.  The decentralisation site at Killarney is now surplus to requirements.  Registration of title is now in progress and it is to be sold.</P>
      <P>The thinking behind the selling of these sites is that the decentralisation programme would cost in the region of £45 million which is not available to the Government because of the economic climate. It is not envisaged that there will be building in Killarney in the next four to five years at least.  It was with some reluctance that the Government decided not to go ahead with the decentralisation programme.  The Government in general have a lot of sympathy with that programme. However, in practical terms and having regard to the present economic climate a sum of £45 million was not available.  As it is not envisaged that the site will be used in the next four or five years and taking into account the present economic climate, it is more important to sell the site and invest the money in the building programme of the Office of Public Works.  This will boost employment. It would not be right or proper for the Government at this time to leave a valuable site lying idle when there is no prospect of using it in the next four or five years.  I wish to point out that there were six sites available to the Office of Public Works when they decided to buy this land.  I consider it good policy to sell the site and invest the money in a building programme that will create employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the decentralisation <Col N="1045" /> programme, it was the view of the Government that it would not create any new jobs but would merely transfer jobs from Dublin to Killarney and to other centres.  We are in the business of job creation and as the public building sector of the Government we should use all the moneys available to create jobs from our building programme.</P>
    <P>I heard about decentralisation for many years before I became a Member of this House but very little has been done.  Deputies have said it has been highly successful but I am not too sure that from an economic point of view it has been all that beneficial.  I am not discounting entirely the advantages of decentralisation, which are many, but there are disadvantages.  It costs much more to run part of an office in Killarney or elsewhere and part in Dublin.  This has been quite evident in some instances where partial decentralisation has taken place.</P>
    <P>There are many arguments put forward to justify decentralisation but it is not a one-sided issue.  For instance, it has been found in the Department of Lands that by having the accountancy section in the west of Ireland payments are delayed. That is one of the disadvantages of decentralisation.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works have found that it is not difficult for them to get sites in any area.  As I have said, they examined six sites in Killarney but they happened to pick this site.</P>

      <P>A Government decision has been taken not to proceed in the foreseeable future with the building of these offices because the money necessary is not available in the present economic climate.  Having regard to this, it cannot be argued that it is wise policy to leave a valuable site lying idle when the money could be used on projects that would provide immediate employment. The Government have adopted a responsible attitude.</P>
      <P>If at any time the Government decide to go ahead with the decentralisation programme, land is available in Killarney and in other towns.  As the site in Killarney will not be developed in the next four or five years by the Government it is better policy in the long-term to make it available for development rather than to leave it as a derelict site in the town.  It is wise policy for the Government to make this site available either to the local authority or to other developers.  This will create employment in the area.</P>

Under the relevant legislation, there is no provision to allow the Government, or myself as Minister, to intervene in such a case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IDA have in fact, reviewed their initial decision, announced on 14 March 1984, not to make any grants available to either provincial or national newspapers. As a result of that review, the authority, as they had indicated previously, are prepared to consider assisting new proposals which would result in such clear economic benefits as extra export earnings. <Col N="850" /> In addition, the authority are prepared to make a limited contribution to the retraining of key operatives in the use of computerised photo composition equipment, because of the strategic importance, for the sector, of moving to the new technology.</P>
    <P>The authority would expect the major portion of the retraining funds to come from the European Social Fund, or the industry itself.</P>

      <P>The Programme for Government states that &ldquo;facilities will be provided for broadcasting debates of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In my capacity as Leader of the House, I have been considering the various aspects and technicalities of broadcasting both plenary and committee sessions in this House and the matter has been discussed at Government.  It has also been the subject of detailed consideration by the Dáil Committee on Procedure and Privileges, particularly in recent months. It is my intention to bring the matter before Government, for final decision, in the very near future but I should say that the initial focus of attention will be on radio coverage.  I should point out that both the Dáil and Seanad Committees on Procedure and Privileges have been in touch with RTE in recent months and have had experimental tapes of the type likely to be broadcast by RTE prepared. These tapes proved to be generally satisfactory. As the Deputy will be aware, the factors affecting television coverage of parliamentary proceedings, in particular the cost factors, are of a more complex nature.  However, once experience is gained from radio coverage of proceedings, I will then consider when and in what circumstances it would be appropriate to commence television coverage of Dáil and/or committee proceedings.</P>

      <P>On 7 March 1983 a system of fees was introduced for all planning applications.  With effect from 3 January 1984 voluntary organisations were exempted from the payment of planning application fees for community-type development not intended mainly for profit or gain.

The allocation of grants by my Department for the group scheme must await finalisation of the foregoing matters.</P>

      <P>A claim for payment of site subsidy was submitted by Dublin County Council in respect of a number of schemes including Bawnogue A and B which, it is understood, includes the Ashwood Estate. From the information submitted it appears that the scheme as a single unit does not qualify for subsidy as the sale price condition referred to above has not been met.  The county council were informed of the position in this respect on 18 April and were asked to submit information that might show that the conditions related to the payment of the subsidy had been fulfilled in relation to individual phases or sections of the scheme.

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 210 of 31 January last in which I indicated that the development envisaged is a depot at which limited quantities of waste would be bulked up and stored under stringent conditions, pending export to approved facilities abroad and that it was possible that some treatment of waste might be undertaken at the centre in the future if the quantities of waste being received and economic considerations justified such a course.  The instructions given by the National Building Agency to Danish consultants in relation to the preparation of the planning application reflect this position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that some residents of the general area have declared their opposition to any development along the lines proposed for the Baldonnel site but I believe that this opposition is based on a misconception of what it is intended to provide and a lack of understanding of both the need for the facility and the <Col N="870" /> safety standards to be observed in its construction and operation.  The views of those opposed to the development will no doubt be taken into account by the planning authority when the planning application is made later this year and every effort will be made to explain the development (and the safeguards being taken) to persons living in the area when that stage is reached.  Pending the submission of this application, I have no further statement to make about the proposed development other than to again assure those opposed to the project that there is no intention to provide a toxic dump either at Baldonnel or in its environs.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is satisfied with present fire safety standards in supermarkets in Dublin city and county; if inspections on a regular basis are implemented by the local authority under the Fire Services Act 1981; whether he is satisfied that free egress is available through emergency fire exits during trading hours; whether in view of the large numbers of the general public frequenting supermarkets he will review the fire safety position; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Fire Services Act, 1981, the proprietors, management and other persons having control over supermarkets (in common with other premises to which the public have access) are obliged to take all reasonable measures to guard against the risk of fire and to ensure as far as is reasonably practicable that people on the premises will be safe in the event of fire. Dublin Corporation is responsible for ensuring compliance with the fire safety provisions of the Act in Dublin city and county (excluding Dún Laoghaire) and has the necessary powers to inspect premises. I understand that such inspections of premises, including supermarkets, are taking place on a fairly widespread basis. Where deficiencies in fire safety standards <Col N="871" /> are identified the corporation has extensive powers under the Act to ensure that they are remedied.  For example, under section 20 it has the power, subject only to appeal to the District Court, to issue a fire safety notice which either permanently prohibits the use of a potentially dangerous building or prohibits its use unless or until certain specified requirements have been met.</P>
      <P>As regards fire safety standards, I understand that most supermarkets are of fairly recent construction and have therefore been the subject of planning control which would have extended to consideration of the fire safety aspects, including emergency fire exits.  Local authority statistical returns suggest that fires in shops and supermarkets represent just over 1 per cent of fire calls in the Dublin area and I have no reason to believe that there are any special problems in relation to fire safety in these premises.  At this stage my Department and the Fire Services Council are giving priority to regulations and a code of practice relating to fire safety in places of public assembly but I have asked the Fire Services Council to report to me on the need for and priority to be afforded to similar measures relating to fire safety in other types of premises covered by the 1981 Act.</P>
      <P>I might add that the Fire Prevention Council conducts publicity campaigns and seminars aimed at heightening public awareness of fire risks and is at present preparing two fire safety leaflets relating to retail premises.  Such work is invaluable in educating both the general public and the management of trading premises on measures to be taken to guard against the outbreak of fire.</P>

      <P>Compensation for loss of office by established civil servants is paid out of Voted Moneys.  Payments are made from the Superannuation Vote.  In the case of the former Department of Posts and Telegraphs, such compensation was borne by the superannuation subhead of <Col N="873" /> the Vote for that Department and continuing payments are borne by An Post or Bord Telecom Éireann as appropriate.</P>
      <P>Since the enactment of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1963, which amended the previous legislative provsions, such compensation arose as follows:</P>
      <P>43 Social Welfare staff arising from a reorganisation;</P>
      <P>20 members of the staff of the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, arising from the transfer of the hospital to the Eastern Health Board;</P>

    <P>In 1979 An Bord Iascaigh Mhara sold their interest in Killybegs boatyard to a <Col N="874" /> private company by whom the conditions of sale were fully complied with apart from repayment of loan instalments in recent years.  The board has recently reacquired possession of the yard and I understand they propose to offer it for sale or lease by public advertisement.  I am not aware that unauthorised sales of machinery have taken place from the yard.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a person have at least 26 contributions, paid or credited, in the governing contribution year.  The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 16 January 1984 and had a record of 20 paid contributions in the governing contribution year 6 April 1982 to 5 April 1983. Inquiries were undertaken to ascertain if credited contributions were due in respect of any period during the contribution year but as none were due he did not satisfy the contribution condition for unemployment benefit and he was advised accordingly.  He claimed unemployment assistance on 12 April 1984, and his claim has been referred to a social welfare officer for inquiries into his means.

The person concerned made a claim to unemployment benefit on 5 January 1984.  Her claim was disallowed on the grounds that she was not available for work and she was notified accordingly.  She recently appealed against the disallowance of her unemployment benefit claim and arrangements are being made to have her case heard by an appeals officer at the earliest opportunity.  Her entitlement to unemployment benefit will be reviewed in the light of his decision.</P>

      <P>Payment of disability benefit to the person concerned was disallowed from 19 March 1984 following examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work. He appealed against the disallowance and in connection with his appeal arrangements were made to have him examined by a different medical referee on 24 May 1984.  His entitlement to further payment of disability benefit will be reviewed in the light of the medical referee's report following this examination.</P>

Pay-related benefit for the period from 29 February 1984 to 1 May 1984 was issued on 11 May 1984. The delay in issuing payment of this benefit was caused by an administrative error.  Further payment of benefit will issue on receipt of medical certificates in the Department which should be submitted at weekly intervals while he remains incapable of work.</P>

      <P>According to the Department's records the person concerned was last employed on 22 December 1983.

Provision for these extra amounts was included in the Supplementary Estimate for Social Welfare passed by the Dáil in December 1983.

      <P>Children's allowance at the rate of £11.25 per month was awarded in respect of the child from July 1983.

      <P>The person concerned has been in receipt of disability benefit since 20 June 1983 and payment is being made at regular weekly intervals.</P>
      <P>Invalidity pension is payable in place of disability benefit to insured persons who satisfy the contribution conditions and who are permanently incapable of work.  In order that a person may be considered permanently incapable of work, it is necessary for him to, <i>inter alia,</i> have been continuously incapable of work for a period of one year.  Therefore, the earliest date on which the claimant can qualify for invalidity pension is 20 June 1984.  In addition it is necessary to have him examined by a medical referee for an opinion as to his future capacity for work.  Such an examination has been arranged for 22 May 1984.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned did not qualify for the full contributory widow's pension under Irish legislation because her husband did not have at least 156 paid insurance contributions in this country since his date of entry into insurance. Her husband also had an insurance record in the United Kingdom and, under the provisions of EEC Regulations, she qualified for both United Kingdom widow's benefit and an Irish pro-rata widow's contributory pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current weekly rate of United <Col N="916" /> Kingdom widow's benefit of £34.32 sterling amounts to approximately IR £42.90 and when added to the Irish pro-rata pension of £3.29 per week gives a total of approximately £46.19, subject to exchange fluctuations from week to week.  This figure exceeds the maximum rate of contributory widow's pension payable solely under Irish legislation to a widow under 66 with no children, viz. £40.60 per week.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed injury benefit from 14 February 1984 in respect of an incapacity which he attributed to an accident at work on 21 September 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pending the completion of investigations he was allowed disability benefit on an interim basis and pay-related benefit was also awarded.  Payments issued regularly in respect of the period to 16 April. The person concerned had also made a claim for disablement benefit and in connection with this claim he was requested to attend for examination by a medical referee on 12 April 1984 in order that an assessment could be made of his degree of disablement.  Inadvertently another examination in connection with his disability benefit payments was arranged for the previous day.  He attended this examination and was found to be incapable of work.  However, he did not attend for examination on the followlarl <Col N="917" /> ing day and in error his disability benefit was suspended.</P>
    <P>Payments have been restored and all disability benefit and pay-related benefit in respect of medical certificates received to date has been paid.

Injury benefit over and above the disability benefit already paid has been issued.  A further medical examination has been arranged for 16 May in connection with his claim to disablement benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>For some time past the pigmeat industry has been experiencing difficult conditions because of high feed costs and weak markets. Recently an industry arrangement for stabilising export market returns was terminated and this has operated to offset the effect of an emerging recovery on the export market.  This arrangement was, however, a voluntary one involving the bulk of the industry and the State was not involved.</P>
      <P>Control of premises slaughtering pigs for the home market only rests with local authorities so far as hygiene standards and veterinary inspection are concerned. It is not possible to compel the proprietors of such premises to participate in any industry arrangement to facilitate orderly marketing.  In view, however, of the benefits of such marketing to all sectors of the industry it is to be hoped that the proprietors of those premises will reconsider their attitude and that current differences within the industry will be resolved as quickly as possible.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Candidates for an Garda Síochána who qualify at the competitive interview conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners are placed in order of merit by the commissioners and are considered for appointment in that order. The next stage in the recruitment procedure is the medical examination and, where appropriate, oral Irish testing of those candidates who obtain sufficiently high places at the competitive interview to be considered for appointment.  In addition, under the terms of the Garda Síochána (Appointments) Regulations, the Garda Commissioner must be satisfied as to a candidate's general suitability for appointment to the Force.</P>

    <P>Candidates who do not meet the medical requirements are, in general, given an opportunity to apply to undergo a further medical examination within 12 months.  Accordingly, it could happen that a candidate placed, say, 50th in the order of merit would be appointed following <Col N="929" /> a second medical examination at a later stage than a candidate who obtained, say, 100th place in the order of merit and who was successful at his first medical examination.
