      <P>In fairness to our spokesman on Social Welfare, the first time he saw this Bill was when it was delivered by a senior official of the Department of Social Welfare to his home at 10 o'clock on Saturday night. The Fianna Fáil Front Bench did not see the Bill until yesterday.  We have not had a party meeting since then and it is a very unsatisfactory way of dealing with it. Unfortunately, the treatment is usual with regard to major Bills and I hope that when the Finance Bill is introduced shortly adequate time will be given to study it rather than stating that the Bill has to be through the House within four or five days.</P>

    <Title>Social Welfare Bill, 1984: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2114" /> The main purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the various increases in social welfare payments which were announced in the budget.  The Bill also contains provisions for the introduction of a new family income supplement scheme as well as for a number of other changes in social welfare schemes.  The contents of the Bill are explained in the accompanying memorandum and I trust that this has helped Deputies in their consideration of the various measures proposed.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides for an increase of 7 per cent in rates of social insurance and social assistance from the beginning of July next, with consequential increases in rates of occupational injuries benefits. Children's allowances, likewise, will be increased by 7 per cent from August. When this Government came into office they gave a firm commitment, despite the gravity of the recession and its impact on social welfare expenditure, to endeavour to maintain the living standards of people who depend on social welfare for their needs.</P>
    <P>The increase in flat-rate payments this year, as well as those in 1983, will ensure that this policy is being implemented within the most severe limitations of Exchequer resources.  The real value of pensions, benefits and allowances will be maintained until well into 1985 and, in fact, overall expenditure on social welfare will rise by over 13 per cent in 1984 relative to 1983.  Included in this expenditure is a provision of some £65.5 million for the cost of rates increases this year. This significant extra cost, which is essential to maintain the value of social welfare services, is being fully borne by the Exchequer.  PRSI contributors &mdash; employees and employers &mdash; will not be asked to make any direct extra contribution to social insurance this year. There is a small increase on the occupational injuries contribution for employers which I will refer to later.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words about public attitudes to social welfare provision. In recessionary times, there is a well orchestrated campaign to divert the resources needed for social support to what some people might consider to be more `productive' use in the economy. <Col N="2115" /> Indeed, social welfare recipients are less well placed to plead their case than other more vocal groups in society.  There is a tendency on the part of some people, who are usually relatively well off, to lay the blame for the country's financial ills at the door of the underprivileged and the poor.  We hear a lot about the unfair burden of tax but very little about the acute problems of people trying to bring up their families on low incomes.</P>
    <P>In recent years the bulk of the working population have come to appreciate that unemployment could happen to them. Yet a section of the population is still reluctant to see money go to people without work.  There is a superficial suspicion that some unemployed people could get a job if they really wanted to, that some are living on the backs of other people. There are also occasional allegations that large numbers of people are receiving benefits while at the same time working in the &ldquo;black economy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Ill-informed comment on these lines is extremely damaging for popular support and willingness to subscribe to social security.  My Department have taken reasonable and effective steps to ensure that social welfare funds are not misused by a minority at the expense of the vast majority in genuine need and of the working population who provide the benefits through PRSI contributions and general taxation.  In this connection, I would like to commend the trade union movement and the voluntary organisations for their unselfish efforts over the years in defending and publicising the legitimate rights of the people who are victims, through no fault of their own, of our economic and social systems.  In this context also I must again stress that the single most important incentive to work is the prospect of employment not reductions in unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>It is a Government's duty on behalf of the community to give the most deprived sections of the population the priority they are entitled to in any recession. Despite the difficulties of the current economic and financial situation this Government will not allow the weaker sections of our community who are <Col N="2116" /> dependent on social welfare to suffer a drop in the purchasing power of their incomes.</P>
    <P>We are now hopefully facing into a period of economic growth and moderate inflation, but even in that more optimistic context the scale of social welfare spending presents a daunting challenge to any Government to maintain and improve the living standards of recipients.  This challenge is compounded by the need to consider the capacity of the community at large to meet the cost of social welfare support.  Gross expenditure on social welfare in 1984 will amount to £2,156 million, or nearly £6 million each day of the year.  This enormous sum represents a commitment to social welfare of almost exactly £1,000 a year by every man and woman in the labour force.</P>
    <P>It is important to put on the record that the recipients of transfer payments on the scale I have outlined should not in any way feel apologetic for their inability to support themselves.  The vast majority of recipients have over the years made substantial contributions as taxpayers and insured persons and they have, accordingly, a right to income maintenance payments from the State.  I believe it is also important to remember that the money transferred to people in need has an economic, as well as a social, value.  Unlike some other sections of the community, social welfare recipients spend nearly all of their income on basic goods and services, the necessities of life, Their money is spent immediately on receipt and is circulated largely within the domestic economy, creating additional economic demand and, indeed, making a significant contribution towards sustaining Irish jobs.  Social welfare recipients also make their own contribution to the Exchequer through direct and indirect taxes.  Those that choose to criticise what they see as excessive levels of social support should be mindful of the economic worth of social services, as well as the merit of increased community well-being that results from the redistribution of resources in this way.</P>
    <P>Part of the large increase in social welfare expenditure this year is due to the growing burden of unemployment. <Col N="2117" /> Unemployment expenditure will amount to about £580 million this year, equivalent to over a quarter of all expenditure on social welfare.</P>
    <P>The scale of support needed, however large, cannot be judged on mere expenditure figures.  The amount of personal hardship, waste of human skills and, indeed, the social upheaval caused by unemployment is a truer, and more disturbing, measure of the real effects of this serious problem.</P>
    <P>The Government place, as they must do, a major priority on action to correct the employment situation.  My most immediate responsibility, however, is to ensure that the personal hardship experienced by all those who are unemployed, but particularly by those whose unemployment has been prolonged, is tackled and reduced through effective social welfare support.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the special 5 per cent increase which I introduced last October for people in receipt of unemployment assistance who have been unemployed for 15 months or more.  I am glad to say that the Government have managed to provide a special 8 per cent increase for this group from the beginning of next July.  The aggregate increase in the rates of payment for the long-term unemployed next July will amount to 13.5 per cent relative to July 1983.  About 75,000 people and their 164,000 dependants will gain extra support through this increase in the long-term unemployment assistance rates.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the effect of the increases on individual payments. The increases in social insurance and occupational injuries benefits are provided in section 3 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>A contributory old age pensioner under 80 years of age will receive an additional £3.15 a week bringing his rate of payment to £48.25 a week.  If he is married with a wife under age 66 he will get a total increase of £5.15 bringing the pension to £79.05 a week.  A married couple both over pensionable age will get £84.25 compared with £78.75 at present. Higher increases are paid for pensioners over 80.  Additional payments are also made for persons living alone.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2118" /> The personal rate of widow's contributory pension is being increased by £2.85 a week to £43.45.  Widows over 66 receive higher payments.  A widow with, for example, three dependent children will receive £80.70 a week which is an increase of £5.30.</P>
    <P>The personal rate of invalidity pension goes up from £39.75 to £42.55 for a person under pensionable age and a married couple with two children will receive £90.75, an increase of £5.95.</P>
    <P>A person in receipt of disability or unemployment benefit will have a new personal rate of £37.25 a week, an increase of £2.45.  Where the recipient is married the increase will be £4.05 a week. Maternity allowance is also being increased to £37.25.</P>
    <P>Practice in other countries is one of the bench marks against which the standard of social welfare provision here can be evaluated.  Deputies will be interested to know that the rates of social insurance benefits in this country can be compared favourably with those payable in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  For example, the standard rate of unemployment benefit in the United Kingdom is now £27.05 sterling for a single person and £43.75 for a married couple.  These payments, at current exchange rates, are equivalent to £33.41 and £54.04 in Irish money terms.  The corresponding Irish payments from July are £37.25 and £61.40.  Also, the United Kingdom unemployment and sickness benefits are flat-rates only, the earnings-related supplement having been withdrawn in 1982. Another difference is that the duration of unemployment benefit is 15 months in this country as against 12 months in Britain and Northern Ireland.  The basic rate of retirement pension in the UK is £34.65 sterling equivalent to £42.80 in Irish currency compared with the new Irish retirement pension of £48.25 from July next.</P>
    <P>The new rates of social assistance payments are provided in section 4 of the Bill.  The maximum personal rate of non-contributory old age pension for a pensioner under 80 years of age goes from £38.60 a week at present to £41.30 a week.  It will go up to £44.30 for persons aged 80 or over.  The overall maximum <Col N="2119" /> payment for a pensioner under 80 with a dependent spouse under 66 will increase by £4.05 to £62.05.  The allowance payable in respect of a prescribed relative giving full-time care and attention to an incapacitated pensioner is being raised to £23.10.</P>
    <P>Widows receiving non-contributory widow's pensions at the present rate of £37.85 will get an increase of £2.65 a week.  A widow with two dependent children will get £62.65, an increase of £4.10 a week.  Similar increases will apply to deserted wives, unmarried mothers and prisoners' wives.</P>
    <P>Those receiving short-duration unemployment assistance in urban areas will get an increase of £2 a week in their maximum personal rate.  In rural areas the increase will be £1.95 a week.  There are also increases in respect of dependants. An applicant in an urban area who has a wife and two dependent children will get an increase of £4.50 a week on the present rate of £65.15.  The special rates of unemployment assistance payable to smallholders in certain areas with land under £20 valuation whose means are still assessed by reference to land valuation are being maintained at their existing levels.  Deputies will be aware that the system of assessment of means on the basis of land valuation is being phased out.</P>
    <P>The rates of unemployment assistance for long-duration recipients of unemployment assistance are higher.  For example, a man and wife with two children in an urban area will get £73.90 which is £4.25 more than the corresponding short-duration rate.</P>
    <P>The maximum rate of supplementary welfare allowance for a married couple goes from £48.35 to £51.70 with additional payments for children.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that the standard cash payments to social welfare recipients are in many cases supplemented by the provision of various non-cash benefits.  All pensioners over age 66 are entitled to free travel and in addition they may qualify for fuel vouchers.  For pensioners living alone, there is free electricity, free telephone rental and free TV licence.  All <Col N="2120" /> of these services add considerably to the value of welfare support for the aged and they automatically retain their value in the face of increases in the prices of the services provided.  They are also free of income tax.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill makes a technical amendment to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, to allow for certain expenses in relation to the administration of the social insurance and occupational injuries schemes to be paid to An Post rather than to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs as was formerly the case.</P>
    <P>I now come to section 6 of the Bill. Expenditure out of the Occupational Injuries Fund is met entirely by employer contributions and by fund investments. In order to maintain the solvency of the fund, the rate of employer contribution is being increased by 0.1 per cent to 0.4 per cent of employees reckonable earnings, subject to the £13,000 ceiling.  The special rate of occupational injuries contribution payable in respect of certain public servants is being correspondingly increased.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a general comment here in relation to employer support for social insurance.  There has been criticism recently about the extent to which employer PRSI contributions add unduly to overall labour costs.  It is important to remember, however, that employer contributions to social insurance reflect a fundamental purpose of the welfare system. This purpose is to provide comprehensive occupational protection for workers and their families and to ensure the widest community support for people who cannot meet their needs through their own resources.  Contributions by employers are very much an integral part of the welfare system, reflecting their social obligations as part of the community. This social dimension of employer contributions should be recognised, accordingly, and the contribution system should not be seen simply as a tax which might deter employers from taking on workers.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill provides for an increase of £7 in the earnings disregard, or &ldquo;floor&rdquo;, for pay-related benefit purposes. This change will affect new claims <Col N="2121" /> only from the beginning of April next where entitlement to pay-related benefit is involved.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the pay-related benefit scheme in April 1974 a proportion of reckonable earnings has always been disregarded in calculating the amount of pay-related benefit payable in addition to disability, unemployment, maternity and injury benefits.  In 1974 this disregard was £14, over twice the prevailing rate of flat-rate benefit. The floor was not increased until 1981, even though the level of flat-rate benefit rose significantly in that time.</P>
    <P>The latest increase in the floor continues the policy that has applied over the last three years of progressively raising its level.  However, if the floor had been maintained at the same relation to the flat-rate benefit as it had in April 1974, it would now stand at £74 instead of the £43 proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill provides for the making of regulations to enable pay-related benefit payable with unemployment benefit to be paid in a lump sum in connection with the Enterprise Allowance Scheme.  The Enterprise Allowance Scheme was introduced by the Government at the end of last year to provide financial support for unemployed people who wished to start up their own business. As an alternative to unemployment payments, people who qualify under the scheme can receive a weekly allowance of £30 if single, or £50 if they are married. There has been a very encouraging response to this scheme by unemployed people who are prepared to set up their own business to secure their future.  The scheme is administered by the Department of Labour.</P>
    <P>To increase the flexibility of State support under this scheme, the Government have decided that any pay-related benefit to which scheme applicants would be entitled if they had remained unemployed can now be paid to them as a lump-sum.  This lump-sum will be equivalent to the amount of pay-related benefit that an applicant would otherwise have received in respect of the unexpired portion of the relevant period of interruption of employment subject to a maximum of <Col N="2122" /> 26 weeks.  The lump-sum should provide a useful extra capital float at the start of a business, when credit can often be difficult to obtain.</P>
    <P>The current unemployment situation demands that as much flexibility as possible be provided through State intervention and support.  It is the international experience that there is no one answer to reducing unemployment, but rather that a range of measures be available, which suit individual needs and situations.  It is the Government's task to ensure that these measures are provided in an effective and responsive way, while not stifling the economic growth that is necessary for our longer-term prosperity.  I believe that the Enterprise Allowance Scheme, and the improvements to it contained in this Bill, is an important input to the alleviation of our unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>Under section 9 of the Bill the assessment of the income from the leasing of land for long periods is being changed. For means assessment purposes at present, the capital value of land is used where it is being leased for a number of years.  The land in such cases is deemed not to be personally used or enjoyed by the owner.  On the other hand, land let on a short-term basis &mdash; for example, the conacre or 11-month system &mdash; is taken to remain in the occupation and use of the owner and means for pension and other purposes are calculated on the basis of the profits from the letting.  The existing methods of assessing means favour persons engaged in short-term lettings of their land.  The adverse effect of a long-term leasing arrangement on subsequent social assistance entitlement can often discourage farmers &mdash; particularly more elderly land-owners &mdash; from considering the long-term option rather than the less efficient 11-month system.  This can in turn hinder the access to land of younger and possibly more progressive farmers.</P>
    <P>The Government are anxious to encourage greater  of land leasing as part of their land policy in relation to farming and section 9 of the Bill provides accordingly that where farm land has been leased with the approval of the Land Commission the lessor's means for social assistance purposes will be calculated by <Col N="2123" /> reference to the profits from the lease rather than to the capital value of the holding.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the 7 per cent increase in rates of children's allowances which will apply from the beginning of next August.  Sections 10 and 11 of the Bill make a couple of minor changes to the scheme itself. At present, children's allowance in respect of a child resident outside the State can be paid to the father while he is working abroad for the Government, the State, or an international organisation.  Section 10 extends this provision to a qualified person other than the father &mdash; in other words, the mother.</P>
    <P>Section 11 extends the validity of the orders in children's allowance books from three to six months.  This measure will reduce the amount of payable orders issued by my Department in respect of children's allowance book orders which become out of date.</P>
    <P>Following a recommendation in the Report on the Inquiry into the Cost and Methods of Providing Motor Insurance the Government have decided that the amount of disability benefit, associated pay-related benefit or invalidity pension payable for up to a period of five years to a person arising from injuries received as the result of a road traffic accident shall be taken into account in assessing damages for those injuries.  Section 12 of the Bill makes provision for this in line with similar arrangements which already exist in relation to occupational injuries benefits.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the new scheme which is being provided for in Part 3 of this Bill.  The Family Income Supplement Scheme is designed to provide cash support for employees on low earnings with families.</P>
    <P>In many cases such workers may be only marginally better off than if they were claiming disability or unemployment benefits.  This situation arises partly from the structure of the benefit schemes themselves, which take account of family size, whereas earnings are paid regardless of marital or family status.  It also arises through the significant real increases that <Col N="2124" /> have occurred in recent years in rates of benefit relative to net earnings.  Even though workers on low earnings are often exempted from income tax or eligible for marginal relief, the so-called &ldquo;poverty-trap&rdquo; can be such as to reduce the incentive to work in some cases.</P>
    <P>Apart from the poverty-trap consideration, I believe that it is important to redistribute resources towards the lower-paid by direct income support so that all sections of the community share to the greatest extent possible in the gradual improvement in our national prosperity. The capacity of the income tax system to achieve the level of redistribution and equity which the Government consider to be desirable is limited to some extent by its structure and the nature of tax allowances.  Direct cash support has the advantage of being tailored to suit individual situations as well as providing more clearly-identifiable State assistance for the pressures that can arise through living on low incomes.</P>
    <P>Sections 13 to 17 provide for the introduction of the family income supplement scheme and for consequential amendments to the social welfare code.  The general details of the scheme are as follows. Weekly payments will be made to families with children where one or more parent is in full-time paid employment and where the income of the family is less than a specified amount.  This amount will vary according to the number of children in the family.  The supplement will be calculated as one-quarter of the difference between the family's actual income and the appropriate upper level of weekly income for the family size in question.  If the family income is below a specified level then the full appropriate supplement will be payable.</P>
    <P>The maximum family earnings up to which a supplement will be payable will be £95 in the case of a one-child family. An additional £15 earnings will be allowed for each subsequent child up to the fifth.  At this family size, the maximum earnings allowable will be £155 a week.  As this level of earnings will correspond to average male earnings in the transportable goods industries this year, I do not consider it appropriate to supplement incomes above this level. <Col N="2125" /> Accordingly, families with more than five children will all be assessed according to the income limits for a five-child family. Similarly, the lower income limits will vary from £63 in the case of a one-child family to £95 a week in the case of families with five or more children.  The maximum family income supplement payable where earnings are at or below these limits will range from £8 to £15 a week, depending on family size.</P>
    <P>Once the family entitlement has been determined, payment of the supplement will normally be made for 52 weeks before review.  It will be payable to the principal wage earner in the family and the supplement will not be subject to income tax or PRSI.  Section 15 of the Bill provides for the making of regulations to suspend payment of the supplement where the recipient ceases to work and draws unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, disability benefit or retirement pension.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the new scheme will be introduced from the beginning of November 1984.  It will be administered centrally by my Department.  The scheme will be of benefit to some 35,000 families, at a cost to the Exchequer of £2.2 million in 1984 and £13 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>I have outlined these details of the proposed scheme to familiarise Deputies with the form and scale of individual support involved.  My Department will of course be fully publicising the family income supplement scheme in due course.  I do not claim that the scheme provided for in this Bill will solve all the problems faced by workers trying to provide for their families on low earnings. However, I consider that the family income supplement will provide a significant level of support for a section of the community whose needs could not be catered for adequately within the scope of the existing social welfare system or the taxation system as currently structured.</P>
    <P>Part 4 of the Bill, covering sections 18 to 30, provides for the abolition of old age pension committees and the transfer of their funciton in deciding pension entitlement to deciding officers in my <Col N="2126" /> Department.  Some consequential provisions are also included.  The Old Age Pension Committees were first set up under the Old Age Pensions Act, 1908.  They are appointed by county councils and county borough and borough councils to determine individual entitlement to old age, non-contributory, pensions.  There are currently about 355 committees and sub-committees around the country.</P>
    <P>Under the present system, each old age pension claim is investigated by a social welfare officer whose report to the old age pension committee, or sub-committee, shows the applicant's means from all sources and includes a recommendation as to the amount of pension entitlement in accordance with the relevant legislation. The claim must then await the next meeting of the committee for consideration.</P>
    <P>The committees are voluntary and part-time and are required to meet once a month.  Claims must await a meeting for consideration, often for longer periods than a month, frequently as much as three months.  The committees, therefore, delay rather than expedite decisions. To counteract this problem, provision was made in 1978 to enable pensions recommended by the social welfare officer to be put into payment pending the committees' decisions.  From the point of view of such claimants, therefore, the committees are totally irrelevant; the remainder, namely those not entitled to pension for one reason or another, must still wait until the committees meet to learn the outcome of their claims.  There is, in fact, no guarantee that a claim will be decided at a particular meeting as decisions are sometimes deferred from meeting to meeting.</P>
    <P>Committees may cause further delays and bring the whole adjudication process into disrepute when they award pensions which are not payable or which are clearly higher than those payable under the Acts or Regulations.  This is a frequent occurence which necessitates appeals by social welfare officers against such decisions.  These appeals are decided by statutorily appointed appeals officers.</P>
    <P>What is now being provided for in this <Col N="2127" /> part of the Bill is that applications for old age non-contributory pensions would go through the same adjudication process as for other social welfare benefits and assistance claims.  Applications will in future be decided by deciding officers &mdash; civil servants so appointed by the Minister of the day.  The decision of these officers will also be subject to the statutory right of appeal to an appeals officer.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I would like to pay tribute to the work of the local pension committees in fulfilling their statutory duties down through the years.  The fact that I might not agree with the basic policy under which the committees were established and operated does not take from my appreciation of the contribution, commitment and dedication which individual voluntary members have brought to their work.</P>
    <P>Section 19 of the Bill provides for the consequential abolition of the post of clerk to the old age pension committee or sub-committee and for the provision of appropriate compensation to the clerks in line with Civil Service practice.  My remarks about the dedication and commitment of the committees apply with equal validity to the work of clerks to those committees over the years.  Their role in co-ordinating the work of committees and in liaising with Department officials has ensured that the system of adjudication worked as efficiently as it could within the constraints which it faced.</P>
    <P>Section 20 to 28 of the Bill make necessary consequential amendments to relevant sections of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981.  It is my intention to bring these provisions into operation by regulation in the near future.</P>
    <P>I referred at the start to the current magnitude of social welfare expenditure. It is the quality rather than the quantity of expenditure which is of importance, particularly in the social welfare area, where even marginal changes in provision can have a significant effect on people's lives and livelihood.  I believe that the combination of measures provided for in this Bill refine the social <Col N="2128" /> welfare system while maintaining the level of support and improving both the scope of coverage and effectiveness of delivery.</P>
    <P>I think it is an indication of the commitment of the Government to the support of social welfare recipients that the resources necessary to finance the improvements in this Bill have been provided, without undue extra sacrifice being asked of other sections of the community.</P>
    <P>Before finishing, I would like to refer to two other developments in social welfare this year.  The first relates to the provision in the Estimates of £0.5 million for various voluntary organisations who do invaluable work in giving individual social service.  A similar amount was given to such organisations last year, and successfully funded a number of once-off projects in the social welfare area.  I will be allocating this year's funds in due course.</P>
    <P>The second development relates to the introduction of measures necessary to ensure equality of treatment between men and women in the social welfare code within the terms of the EEC Directive on this matter.  I intend to bring legislation on this issue before the House later this year with a view to having the necessary provisions implemented before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I should like to put on record my appreciation, and thanks &mdash; I am sure on behalf of all Members but particularly on behalf of the Government &mdash; to the staff of the Department of Social Welfare.  In the last 12 months they worked under enormous pressures with major unemployment-related problems facing them every day in the week at central and local level, and did outstanding work. They have been subjected, mainly in relation to the smallholders' allowance &mdash; particularly a number of officials in the west of Ireland &mdash; to wholly unwarranted criticism of a most unfortunate nature.  I have repudiated that criticism which came from some Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The staff of the Department of Social Welfare have an enormous burden to bear.  They are constrained enormously by the operations of <Col N="2129" /> the public service staff embargo and other necessary measures in relation to public service employment.  In spite of that they have discharged their duties and work commitments with enormous dedication. I should like to thank the secretary, assistant secretaries, principal officers, and all staff of other grades for the co-operation I received during the last very difficult 12 months.  I expect I will get the same co-operation in the implementation of the terms of the Bill.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to agree with the sentiments expressed by the Chief Whip of our party, Deputy Bertie Ahern, about the speed with which the Bill was brought before the House.  As the Minister stated in his opening remarks the main purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the various increases in social welfare payments announced in the budget.  We had the budget on 25 January, some seven weeks ago.  The Bill before the House is important because it affects very many people and it should be available to all Members of the House to give them an opportunity to study it.  If this Government are in office next year I ask the Minister to have the Bill available soon after the budget.</P>
      <P>What is proposed in the Bill before the House will cause more serious problems for the poor, the sick, the unemployed and the other under-privileged sections of the community.  The Government appear to have identified the problems but have done nothing about them.  In his Budget Statement the Minister for Finance said:</P>
      <P>The Government came to office with a commitment to keep short-term social welfare benefits in line with increases in the take-home pay of workers and to maintain the living standards of other weekly welfare recipients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that the Government had more than met this commitment.  Obviously their commitment on coming to office was a legitimate one but it has not been met.  The Programme for Government also guaranteed <Col N="2130" /> that short-term benefits would keep abreast of inflation and in line with the take-home pay of those in employment. However, that was not done last year and it is not being done this year.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of the social policy of any government should be to create employment but this Government have failed singularly on that issue.  Secondly, the Government should endeavour to meet the needs of the most vulnerable in society.  The Government have failed in that for the second year in succession. This year the Government are offering a 7 per cent increase to those dependent on social welfare benefits for their existence. Last year they offered 12 per cent to long-term recipients of social welfare benefits and 10 per cent to short-term recipients.  In discussing the Bill last year dealing with social welfare payments the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I regret very much that in present financial circumstances it is not possible to provide a significant real improvement in the level of social welfare payments.  I fully appreciate that many persons dependent on social welfare incomes &mdash; the sick, the unemployed, the widowed and the retired &mdash; are finding it extremely difficult to make ends meet in this severe and prolonged recession.  It is unfortunate at a time like this, when the need for income maintenance services, particularly unemployment benefits, is greatest that the State's ability to make an adequate response is limited because of the critical position of the public finances.  However, I can assure Members of the House that as soon as circumstances permit, hopefully by next year's budget, it is my firm intention to secure further real improvements in social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>We come to the 1984 budget and we see what the Government offer &mdash; 7 per cent for nine months of this year.  Last year the Government introduced a system that they would pay benefits for only nine months of the year.  That reduces the value of 7 per cent and makes it 5¼ per cent over a 12-month period.  That is what is being offered to social welfare recipients. <Col N="2131" /> When one adds the 10 per cent last year and the 7 per cent this year and takes it over two years, it does not compare with the 25 per cent given in the previous year by a Fianna Fáil Government nor does it compare with what was given in the two years previous to that.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a comparison with pensions in the UK and in Northern Ireland.  While we are pleased that our pensions compare favourably in terms of money, it is important that we look at the cost of essential services.  This morning the Minister spoke of the advantage to the economy of social welfare payments because they are spent on the necessities of life but if the Minister were to make a comparison with regard to the price of some of the necessities of life here and in the North of Ireland he would find a considerable difference.  In addition, the performance of this Government has aggravated the situation.  As the Chair and I know in our constituency, the action of the Government in increasing the price of petrol by 35p in their first month in office encouraged many people to cross the Border to buy petrol.  Inevitably, these people have also bought other goods north of the Border.  I do not think the Minister can absolve himself or the Government of their responsibilities to the under-privileged here by making comparisons £ for £ with what is available in other countries in Europe.</P>
    <P>An increase of 7 per cent in children's allowance will be granted this year from 7 August; it will not be available even for a full eight months in the year.  That percentage represents 20p per week or, spread over a full year, 14p per week. That is the increase the Government are giving to families.  Then the Minister for Finance comes in here and tells us that the Government have more than met their commitment.</P>
    <P>Last year there was no increase in children's allowance and thus the 7 per cent is the only increase in two years.  Last year was the first time for many years that a Government did not give an increase in children's allowances.  There was no double allowance for child dependents of social welfare recipients <Col N="2132" /> last September.  This had been given in the previous year to help parents to get their children back to school.  There was no double allowance at Christmas for the children of short-term recipients of social welfare benefits.  People on unemployment assistance are probably the worst off sector at the moment.</P>
    <P>There have been massive charges for the use of school buses.  The family income supplement will not apply where there are more than five children.  There will be an imposition of 8 per cent in respect of VAT on clothes for children over ten years of age.  It is reasonable to say that the Government since they came to office have been particularly hard on children and on families.  The Government tell us they are awarding a 7 per cent increase in children's allowance, not effective until 7 August, whereas formerly all such benefits were paid at the beginning of April.  I am surprised that the Government would try to defend that policy and say they have discharged their obligation to the less well-off sections of our community.</P>
    <P>Section 6 increases the contributions to the occupational injury fund and, along with the increase already announced to the redundancy fund, adds another ½ per cent to PRSI contributions.  In itself this will be an added burden on employers who have complained over the years that they are having difficulty in meeting their commitments.  The philosophy in regard to the creation of jobs is one that should be considered when the Government decided to increase the PRSI contribution. Employment should be the prime economic and social policy of the Government.  Unfortunately the Government have failed miserably in that regard. Unemployment increased by 28,000 last year and the Government expect it to increase by 30,000 this year.  That shows a lack of confidence in their own policy. We have 216,000 unemployed and 66,000 are under 25 years of age.  Unemployment is eating away at the whole fabric of our society.</P>
    <P>The Government should be looking seriously at the problem.  They should be doing something positive about the problem. The Minister's responsibility is to <Col N="2133" /> ensure that those who are unfortunate enough to lose their jobs through no fault of their own are properly looked after by the State.  The Minister recognises that in his opening speech but he has done nothing to help that section because this 7 per cent increase will make it quite impossible for very many of these people to meet their commitments.  The Minister talked about the £500,000 which the Government have allocated to voluntary bodies. Perhaps they might consider allocating another £500,000 to voluntary bodies like the social services councils, the St. Vincent de Paul Society and other societies working on behalf of the poorer sections.  There is absolutely no doubt that despite the increases awarded last year and again this year more and more people will have to look elsewhere for their means of survival, particularly those with large families.  The cost of food, the cost of services, the 8 per cent on clothes will all affect these people and many who were in good employment and have lost their jobs as a result of the Government's economic policy, many who were able to meet their commitments, now find they can no longer do so.  One has only to ask any local authority about the situation in relation to the repayment of loans under the SDA to be told that more and more people are unable to meet their commitments. The Government offer them 7 per cent or, if they are more than 15 months unemployed, 8 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the situation in which we find ourselves the answer is obviously to create jobs as well as protecting those who are in employment.  That will remove a great deal of the poverty and the personal frustration and altogether create a more healthy society.  The increases given of £2 and £3 this year is not a reasonable increase.  If it were a reasonable increase it would be at least £8 or £9 per week.  A married man with two children gets £68.15 if he is unemployed in a rural area.</P>
    <P>On the question of unemployment assistance I agree with the Minister in what he said about the officials of his Department.  I had the honour to work in that Department before the change of Government and I could not praise too highly the work and dedication of the <Col N="2134" /> public servants there and also the public servants working out in the field.  It is important to remember that the public servants working outside, particularly in relation to the small farmers' unemployment assistance, are carrying out the direction of the Minister.  The Minister said he rejected the criticism of his officials and I would point out that the most severe criticism and the harshest criticism has come from Members on his side of the House.  A west of Ireland Senator and members of the Fine Gael Party on a number of occasions recently appealed to the Minister to do something about the small farmers but nothing has been done. Apart from the low rate of payment there are unacceptable delays in the assessment and administration of the social welfare assistance scheme particularly the UA scheme.  There are delays of three and four months and even longer.  If there is a shortage of staff the Minister should ensure sufficient staff are recruited so that people are paid their unemployment assistance as a matter of urgency.  A reasonable period would be two or three weeks after applying for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>Many people are unemployed through no fault of their own.  Many of them coming on to the labour exchange do not have their insurance contributions and have to apply for assistance rather than benefit.  Many do not have anywhere to turn to.  I would ask the Minister to examine the situation in each health board area to find out how many people are not receiving unemployment assistance and supplementary allowance.  It appears to me that when people look for supplementary allowance to which they are entitled the community welfare officer checks with the Department of Social Welfare and finds they may not be paid unemployment assistance because there is a suspicion they are working.  The health board then will not pay them supplementary allowance.  I would like the Minister to look at that and see how many families there are who have no income whatsoever because they are not receiving supplementary allowance on the say-so of the social welfare Department <Col N="2135" /> and not as a result of the community welfare officer's own investigation.</P>
    <P>The problem of the long-term unemployed is probably the biggest problem. Those who are short-term unemployed or on short-term disability are able to cope with the situation but those who are long-term unemployed are in a very, very serious position in trying to meet their commitments.  The NESC in their report No. 62 had this to say:</P>
    <P>The council is concerned that a substantial minority of long-term recipients are dependent upon incomes which are clearly intended for subsistence in the short term and recommend that the question of providing more adequately for the needs of the long-term unemployed be given urgent consideration.</P>
    <P>To give the long-term unemployed 1 per cent more than everybody else hardly meets the need particularly when talking about the other 7 per cent and 8 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister has decided to increase the floor for pay-related benefit from £36 to £44 per week.  This increase of £7 is the largest in any year since pay-related benefit was introduced.  Last year the increase was £4 per week.  The Minister's argument that the Government had raised the rates in 1974 when they were only £14 per week is hardly reasonable. This £7 per week is the largest increase since the scheme was introduced.  The Minister hopes to save £2.8 million as a result of the change and I wonder if it is in order for him to save that amount which is coming from the workers, which they have paid for through their insurance contributions.</P>
    <P>The percentage limit of reckonable earnings is being reduced for disability benefit from 80 to 75, and for maternity allowance from 80 to 70, to take effect from the beginning of April.  Those beneficiaries will be allowed to earn only 75 per cent of their earnings in disability allowance and 70 per cent in maternity allowance.  That will save £380,000 in the first case and £1.1 million in maternity allowances, again at the expense of the workers.  We must question seriously why it is necessary to reduce these figures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2136" /> Last year, the waiting time for the payment of pay-related benefit was extended to 18 days.  That caused hardship for those who were short-term out of work, people who were sick and who went to hospital for a month &mdash; they did not get anything, and consequently were in difficulties about meeting their commitments. This year, the amount they will be allowed to take home has been reduced, causing still more hardship.  Recently, the Eastern Health Board announced that they had paid out more than £1 million to the ESB by way of supplementary allowances last year.  This indicates that our social welfare system is not catering for the people for whom it was intended. I agree with the paying of benefits to those who had applied for enterprise allowances but I do not agree with the Minister's statement that the lump sum will be equivalent to the amount of pay-related benefit that an applicant under the scheme would otherwise have received in respect of the unexpired portion of the relevant period of interruption of employment, subject to a maximum of 26 weeks.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill deals with a change in the means test in respect of the leasing of land.  Though we agree that farmers should be encouraged to lease land for longer periods, I ask the Minister to look at the possibility of giving the applicants the option of having their assessment made on the profits of long-term leasing or on capital value of the land, whichever is the more beneficial to the applicants.</P>
    <P>The result of last year's Social Welfare Act has created havoc among small farmers, particularly those in the counties affected by the payment of social welfare assistance under the notional system.  I question whether it was necessary to do away with that very good system which gave supplementary incomes to the poorest farmers in the land, even considering the High Court decision on which the change was based.  There is nothing in the judgment to stop the Minister from paying a direct supplement to smallholders in the west on the basis of their valuations. Because of the decision, more than 1,100 have lost supplementary allowances <Col N="2137" /> and many others have had their allowances reduced considerably.  The Government will save about £1 million on this at a time when farming is not doing well, when it is realised that farmers' incomes have been reduced.  We have only to look at some of the areas in the west, in Donegal and Galway, but particularly in Kerry.  One would not have to be a social welfare investigating officer to appreciate that those people need supplementary incomes to ensure that they will stay on the land and continue to rear families.  Many of them would not be on the land were it not for these supplementary allowances, now taken from them.</P>
    <P>It was interesting last Friday to read in <i>The Irish Times</i> that a revolt is starting in the Fine Gael back benches because of this, which has caused such a serious social and economic problem in the west. Something will have to be done to ensure that these smallholders remain on the land.  That should be the social philosophy of a Government in Ireland. In the last 20 years 200,000 people have left the land and it is important that a Government would not do anything to increase that number.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Irish Times</i> article stated that on the occasions last year when Members of the House had an opportunity to vote on that issue only one backbencher from the Government side voted against the Social Welfare Bill.  We had a Private Members' Motion here on the notional system but nobody from the Government side voted for that motion even though voting for it would not have affected the working of the Government.  This year, small farmers who are still under the notional system will not receive any increase, even the 7 per cent.  Is this reasonable?  I ask the Minister also if these people on factual assessment are found to be entitled to assistance, will that 7 per cent be given to them retrospective to the implementation of this Bill?</P>
    <P>Recently a deputation here from the ICMSA expressed concern about a number of areas and particularly about the effect of the notional system of assessment for small farmers.  They were concerned also about the various methods of <Col N="2138" /> assessment used by the different Departments of State in assessing the means of farmers.  They suggested that a major training course for social welfare officers might be appropriate because of the complexity of their work and the difficulty in assessing the various allowances and profits on the farms.  That deputation pointed out that farm incomes are being calculated by several different Government Departments each using their own criteria to identify farm income.  They gave examples of the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of Health, the Department of the Environment for education grants and the Department of Finance.  They made the point that the Department of Health have two definitions of farm income.  When assessing small farmers' entitlement to medical cards the only expenses taken into consideration are in relation to feeds and fertilisers.  The health boards do not treat as deductible outlay such items as capital expenditure on machinery, depreciation or bank interest on development loans, yet when the Department of Health calculate farm income for the purpose of liability under various income levies they allow interest paid for farming purposes as an allowable expense but exclude all forms of depreciation including capital allowance for machinery and plant, fences, roadways and buildings.</P>
    <P>The deputation pointed out that the Department of the Environment when assessing farmers' eligibility for a higher education grant define farm income as gross income less outline deductions and allowances.  They include interest paid in full, machinery and plant investment allowance, machinery and plant initial allowance, wear and tear on machinery, machinery and plant balancing allowance and farm buildings allowance.  Finally the Department of Finance when assessing a farmer's liability for income tax purposes restrict capital allowance to 30 per cent of farm profits.  Perhaps the Minister in conjunction with his colleagues in the other Departments might look at this area and make it easier for everybody, including the Departments of State, to have some unified approach to the means <Col N="2139" /> of assessing the income and profits from farming.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the Bill extends validity orders for children's allowance from three months to six months.  Why does the Minister not extend this to all social welfare pensions?  As he knows, many old age pensioners particularly go off to visit their families and they may become ill or stay the whole winter and be away from home for a long time.  It would be beneficial to them if these orders were extended in their case.</P>
    <P>We have waited a long time for the family income supplement.  It was promised in 1981 when the Coalition Government were in power.  An amount of £5 million was allocated for it in February 1983 in the budget.  That was reduced to £1 million at a famous meeting in Barrettstown in July and we were promised that it would be in full operation last December.  However, we find now that it will not come into operation until November this year.  It is interesting that when the Government are collecting money from the workers such collection takes effect from the beginning of April. In the past under Fianna Fáil Governments the pay-outs were made at the time but in this case it will be at the end of the year, November, before the family income supplement is introduced.  The maximum amounts of supplement are too small at £8 maximum where there is one child and £15 maximum where there are five children.  In order to get that £8 a man with a wife and one child needs to be earning less than £63 per week in full-time employment, as the Bill states.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister believe that £63 per week in full-time employment is a legitimate wage in this day and age?  Will the administration of this family income supplement encourage people to pay lower wages because there will be a supplement from the State?  Also, why is it confined to full-time employees?  What about part-time employees who have no other source of income?  What about the self-employed many of whom are on very low incomes?  Do they not qualify for this benefit?  Where does the Minister get the figure of £95 which he uses in the calculator <Col N="2140" /> and then £15 per child?  Why is the amount of the supplement only 25 per cent of the difference?  Why not make it 50 per cent of the difference and give something worthwhile to the families who qualify for it?  What is the view of the trade union movement about persons who are receiving on full-time employment £63 per week gross?  We would object to this provision being confined to families of five children.  A man who has eight or nine children surely is in a more serious position in meeting his commitments and there is absolutely no reason why the extra money for the extra children should not be paid to him, thus increasing the maximum weekly supplement that would be payable to him.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister if he has any idea of the cost of the administration of this scheme.  He told us that it was administered centrally from his Department.  The applicants would have to be investigated, and presumably that would be done through the social welfare officers.  Must another large bureaucracy be set up to administer this scheme?  Will this money be taxed?  Will it be taxable?  Will it create an anomaly with two families of the same size living side by side, one earning an income and paying tax on the whole lot while the other family are earning an income and getting this supplement which will bring them up to the level of their neighbours and not paying tax on the supplement?  Why is a condition of this scheme that the allowance must be paid to the wage earner, the employee? Why not make it optional to pay it to the spouse if the employee so wishes?  If it is the man who is receiving it why not pay it to his wife if he so wishes?  Could the Minister not find an easier and less costly way of ensuring that there will be a supplement for those on very low wages?</P>
    <P>For example, PRSI payments could be abolished in the case of everybody with an annual income under £5,000.  Would that not have much the same effect and have the Government considered this? We support the principle of paying a supplement to the less well off in our society and in this case to those working for low wages, but this scheme is cumbersome, <Col N="2141" /> would be difficult to administer and the amount payable is much too low.  The maximum weekly amount payable to a family with one child is £8.  Compare that with the Government wanting to give £9.60 three or four years ago.  One wonders if they realise the massive increase in the cost of living which has taken place since then.  I ask the Minister to look for a more simple system with the same effect.  This scheme will not commence until November of this year, which is a miserly approach on the part of the Government.  It should have been paid from April, or even from July when other benefits are being paid.</P>
    <P>This morning the Minister told us that 35,000 families would benefit.  Surely it is an indictment of our society that 35,000 families earn wages low enough to qualify for this supplement.  While we support the supplement to the workers, nevertheless we do not want to take away from the fact that the worst off members of our community are those unemployed for a long period, particularly those who through no fault of their own found themselves out of work and unable to meet their commitments.  As a result of this Social Welfare Bill they will find their situation to be much worse.</P>
    <P>We have no objection to the abolition of old age pension committees.  Apart from the points mentioned by the Minister, most people living in the country did not like the idea of going before a local committee.  They preferred to keep their business confidential and did not like it discussed before an open committee. The local elections should have been held this year and these committees were appointed by the local authorities.  Perhaps the Minister might decide to retain the commitees until the local elections are held.  Had the local elections been held next June it would have been possible not to re-appoint these committees. Another point is the compensation for the clerks of those committees, who have served the committees very well over the years.  I ask the Minister to re-examine the compensation being offered.</P>
    <P>With regard to the supplementary social welfare allowance, last year provision was made in the Social Welfare <Col N="2142" /> Bill whereby the Government would alleviate the burden of portion of the charge on the local authorities.  This year some local authorities failed to discharge their statutory obligation, making no allocation whatsoever for the supplementary allowance scheme.  It is long past time when a direct transfer of funds, approximately £25 million, should be made from the Department of the Environment to the Department of Social Welfare.  This would take the entire supplementary allowance financing out of the hands of both local authorities and health boards. The local authorities are unable to meet their commitments, being almost bankrupt because of present Government policy and the health boards are not receiving their allocation from the local authorities.  A direct transfer from one Department to the other to cater for this scheme would be much simpler.</P>
    <P>The Minister has promised a review of the national fuel scheme.  This is a matter of fundamental importance to those about whom we are speaking here, those on social welfare benefits and assistance and particularly the unemployed.  Why for the first year since the introduction of this scheme was a paragraph inserted in the letter which went out to the chief executive officers of the health boards stating that persons on short-term social welfare benefits &mdash; for example, unemployment and disability benefits and unemployment assistance &mdash; are excluded from the scheme?  This gives no discretion whatsoever to the health boards, the community welfare officers or the superintendent community welfare officer to give free fuel vouchers to persons receiving unemployment assistance, which vouchers they had received in previous years.  This year, if you are on unemployment assistance, no matter what your circumstances you are not entitled to free fuel vouchers.  This is happening at a time when everyone recognises that these people are worse off than ever and when their social welfare income was increased by 10 per cent last year and 7 per cent this year, compared with 25 per cent in each of the previous three years.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that the Minister has <Col N="2143" /> not brought forward legislation on foot of the EEC directive to give equality to women workers.  I hope that he will bring in and implement this legislation and not wait until the last possible date under this directive.  I hope that he will make that gesture to ensure equality between the women and men in our work force.</P>
    <P>There is no word in the Bill of the national pension plan promised by the Government in their Joint Programme for Government.  The Minister has mentioned the advantages of free television, free travel, free electricity supply and other benefits which pensioners and those on long term sickness benefit have. However, it is important to recognise that all these schemes were brought about by a Fianna Fáil Government.  That is one of the big differences between the Coalition's negative approach to social policy and the imaginative approach of Fianna Fáil.  The Minister could without much cost allow a free colour television licence rather than one for a black and white set. That would improve the quality of these peoples lives.</P>
    <P>Last year one Member from the opposite side of the House voted against the Social Welfare Bill.  If there is any logic or consistency there, I expect that many of his colleagues will follow him this time into the lobbies, to vote against a Bill which will do absolutely nothing for those less privileged in our society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry but I do not propose to oblige Deputy O'Hanlon, or take him up on his final offer and trust that he will not be too disappointed. Deputy O'Hanlon's submission was constructive but there is difficulty in reconciling the two views put forward by speakers generally from the opposite side.  On the one hand, there is a call for further increases in all types of benefit and comparisons are made with similar payments in the UK.  We must keep in mind at all times that somebody has to pay for those benefits.  Unless we want an increase in taxation to allow for such proposed increases we should not make such proposals. Deputy O'Hanlon referred to the small farmers' assistance, and the abolition <Col N="2144" /> of the notional system.  I have registered my antipathy towards the entire concept of those payments but I do not see anything wrong with making the money available.  That is a very desirable thing but the money should be made available to those people by incentive rather than by disincentive, as has applied for a long time.  The most important factor to remember is that people living in disadvantaged areas who cannot eke out an existence from their small holdings should be given assistance.  The underlying factor in that acceptance must be that it should be changed to incentive and support for effort rather than the assistance which has operated down the years.  Anybody who knows what that system has done to certain parts of the country recognises that it has undermined the pride and self-sufficiency of any of the people who have been in receipt of such payments over a long period.</P>
      <P>When we look at this Social Welfare Bill and we take into account the fact that £2,156 million gross is to be expended in the current year it gives an indication of the magnitude of the social welfare system. When we consider that it costs £6 million each day taxpayers can assess the situation and ask themselves where their money is going and whether they are paying too much tax.  It is time for them to recognise that many people have not jobs and there are quite a number of people who are elderly or disabled and have various other needs which require them to receive social welfare payments. It is time for all of us to recognise that a large amount of our taxation goes in this direction.  It is right that that should happen because otherwise people who are receiving social welfare payments would suffer great hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that the gross expenditure on unemployment in the current year is £580 million, a very considerable sum.  When we consider that 60,000 young people are in receipt of social welfare assistance or benefit we begin to come to grips with the vast problem which confronts everybody. We have to recognise that as long as we have a problem like that we will have high taxation and a very obvious <Col N="2145" /> need for social welfare benefits to offset hardship.  While everybody would have liked to see a greater increase being given to social welfare benefit and assistance recipients one must realise that if one goes down that road one has to accept that somebody has to pay for it.  If you increase taxation in order to pay for it you must accept that you have to increase inflation and cause further problems. You have then a snowballing situation, which will increase rather than decrease with the passage of time and instead of resolving problems we will create larger ones.  In relation to an increase in inflation we should realise that there has been no increase this year in employers' or employees' contributions.</P>
    <P>Many people who are working are asking whether it is more beneficial from their point of view to be employed or unemployed.  There are two sides to that story.  There is the case of the unfortunate people, who, through no fault of their own, find themselves without jobs and have to rely on the social welfare system in order to exist and rear their families. I fully accept that we have a social responsibility to cater for those people.  There is also the point of view of the worker who receives a low wage.  Many of those people come to public representatives and point out instances where they feel they would be better off unemployed, particularly if they have to travel any distance to work and involve themselves in PAYE, PRSI and make a fairly substantial contribution to the system.  They feel they are being penalised and they do not receive remuneration commensurate with their efforts.  I can understand how those people feel but I also have to keep in mind that the people who are now employed and who feel that way should accept that perhaps some time in the future they also might be unemployed particularly in a recessionary situation like we have at the moment.  We have to be able to explain to such people that there is a need for the social welfare support we have and that any of us might have to apply for such asistance at some stage in our lives.  An incentive should be given to those who have jobs and who wish to continue working.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2146" /> We have heard quite a lot of talk about the assessment of various benefits and assistance.  The only comment I have to make about that is that there have been a number of instances recently of people who have been cut off from social welfare assistance or benefit and quite a period has elapsed before eligibility was determined. Those people can apply for supplementary benefit &mdash; this goes back to what Deputy O'Hanlon said &mdash; which is a safeguard.  Quite a number of people have been cut off from benefit for five, six or seven weeks pending the outcome of the investigation who feel they have been discriminated against by being so narrowly excluded from the system.  I feel it would be better, if, instead of cutting them off from the system, during which period they have to receive supplementary benefit their case was investigated first and informed of the outcome in case they wanted to appeal and possibly prevent hardship which could be caused in certain cases.</P>
    <P>With regard to contributions, deductions from employers and employees, the incentive to work, the black economy and so on, the employer who wishes to take on a person for a short period, perhaps a householder who wishes a tradesman to carry out some improvements to the house could under an old system some years ago deduct social welfare by way of insurance stamp and it was quite simple to bring deductions up to date very quickly.  This applied particularly to short-term employment.  Nowadays, the system is so complicated and bureaucracy-ridden that if such a job were to be undertaken by an employee he finds it much more beneficial not to participate in the official system; he finds it easier to offer a price far below that charged by legitimate tradesmen.  At the same time, he could be drawing unemployment benefit.  It would be far better if, as Deputy O'Hanlon said, the system could be simplified.  A potential employee should be allowed to have a certificate of his status which could be brought up to date during the time he is employed.  It would be much simpler from the point of view of the employer <Col N="2147" /> and employee and would discourage the black economy.</P>
    <P>I welcome the enterprise allowance scheme mentioned by the Minister.  It is innovative and gives unemployed people a chance to use their initiative to get back into the mainstream of business while at the same time getting some help which was not available heretofore.  However, if the payment of lump sums is not very carefully administered, an unfortunate person who had been employed for most of his or her life and suddenly received a lump sum to help set up a business could spend it before starting the business and the family could not get any other assistance as a result of getting the lump sum.</P>
    <P>I hope land leasing will encourage the leasing of land to young people and that there are sufficient incentives to those who wish to opt out of operating their farms on a commercial basis to hand them over to young people.</P>
    <P>The concept of the family income supplement is good because it has been brought to our attention recently that there are breadwinners in employment who are not receiving a realistic income on which they and their families can exist and where there is a need for improvement in their position.  I think the thrust of Deputy O'Hanlon's argument in this regard was that while it was welcome and acceptable it could mean the introduction of another bureaucratic system which would cost money to administer and which could become extremely unwieldy and inefficient.  It would also be uneconomic from the point of view of central administrators.  The concept of improving the position of people in low income brackets needs to be looked at.  Undoubtedly they need assistance, but at the same time we should examine the net benefits. If that involves the introduction of a whole new bureaucracy in relation to investigation and duplication of effort on the part of the Government, then it would be counterproductive.  There is a growing tendency for the Government to become too deeply involved in the everyday affairs of family life in general.  If that is done to a great extent you are involved <Col N="2148" /> in the payment to administrators which is unnecessary if another means could be found, such as a reduction in PRSI.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to the abolition of the old age pensions committees. I should like to pay tribute to the people who organised and sat on those committees over the years.  They did a very good job in the sense that they brought local knowledge to bear on many of the cases with which they dealt.  Of course, there was reluctance on the part of many applicants for old age pensions to have their cases discussed by people who were known to them and I can understand their feelings in that regard.  However, it brought an element of compassion and local knowledge to the assessment system which had a certain advantage.  I hope under the new system that the same sympathetic appraisal is given to such cases and that the guidelines should be accepted as such and not as strict rules and regulations.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned pension committees which operate properly and efficiently but there are some committees which have not met or operated for many years, yet decisions are emanating from them every week.  This is rather peculiar, to say the least.  It is time that somebody considered abolishing them because they were never intended to operate in that way.</P>
    <P>There has been reference to criticism by some Members on this side of the House regarding investigations into entitlement to unemployment assistance etc. The Minister seemed to refute such allegations in his speech.  I should like to think that the people who raised questions on this matter are responsible and would scarcely go out of their way to create acrimony unless they had some doubts as to the way the system was operating.  The vast majority of investigating officers go about their business in a forthright, sympathetic, friendly and efficient fashion.  I am not one of those who raise questions on this matter but I recognise that there must have been some reason for objections raised by some people on this side.  Reference was made to Fine Gael backbenchers.  I would ask the Minister to keep that point in mind.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2149" /> Regarding the payment of supplementary benefits, it has been said that it would be better to have a centralised system under the control of the Department of Social Welfare rather than involve local authorities and health boards.  I would be in general agreement on that point.  However, the system operated by the health boards with assistance from the local authorities is not all that bad in that it brings a local element to the investigation of each case.  There is a fear among applicants for assistance that there is some central office which is totally and absolutely impersonal and does not necessarily take full account of their case. They feel that the person visiting them from this office is a threat and very often they have difficulty in co-operating with these officers.  In the case of the health boards, the people who carry out the investigation are usually known to the applicants and have a background knowledge of the case before they ask them any questions or go to visit them.  It is always valuable to have people carrying out an investigation who have this background knowledge and are reasonably well known to the applicants.  I mention this by way of a rider to some of the comments made by the Minister and Deputy O'Hanlon.  I am a member of a health board and the investigating officers there have done a reasonably good job despite the present difficulties.</P>
    <P>In times of financial stringency and economic recession it is the duty of Government to cater for those who are unable to cope financially, those who are less fortunate and less well off than the rest of us.  It is the responsibility of Government to set out the guidelines for undertaking that task and to raise the necessary revenue.  It is also the responsibility of Government and of politicians to explain to the general public the reasons they, the public, have to pay by way of taxation or otherwise for the services being made available to the unfortunate who are unemployed, disabled or in mental institutions.  These are the underprivileged who are not capable of looking after themselves.  We all have a social responsibility which we must accept.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>Our spokesman, Deputy O'Hanlon, made a very comprehensive speech touching on practically all the services operated by the Department of Social Welfare.  I must voice my objection regarding the manner in which this Bill is being rushed through without ample notice having being given to Members that it would be taken this morning.  A Social Welfare Bill is always very important and Deputies are usually rushing in to make their contributions.  Such contributions have always been of great assistance to the Minister responsible for administering these services.  I protest strongly at the manner in which the Bill is being taken this year because we are rushing through the Minister's brief and trying to pick out things here and there in an effort to improve the social welfare structure.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister did not mention the need for a complete restructuring of social welfare services. Every budget introduces some changes in social welfare and we now have a patchwork of legislation, vulnerable to all kinds of abuses and fast becoming of little benefit to those for whom it was intended.  One has only to read the Order Paper to see the large number of questions on social welfare.  The number of questions for written reply shows beyond doubt that the Government of the day must give serious consideration to a completely new structure with more efficiency and a reduction in the cost of administration.  For many years I have been outlining defects in social welfare. While one must sympathise with the Minister and with his officials because of the many anomalies that exist in the social welfare system, the time has come for the Minister to appoint a committee to consider the whole structure of the system. It may be said that at a time of so much unemployment, it would not be appropriate to proceed with such a review but a serious effort should be made to formulate a new structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the abolition of the pensions committee system.  I have been advocating such abolition for a long time.  It was a dreadful situation that payment of <Col N="2151" /> non-contributory old age or widows' pensions could be held up for months because of the committee not meeting to sanction payment.  Apart from that, I always regarded the committee system as an infringement on the privacy of the applicant is that a number of council members were aware of the private income and so on of applicants.  Consequently, I am very glad that the Minister has seen fit to discontinue that system.  In saying that I am not taking from the committees in any way.  I was a member of one of them but I was always very much aware of the unsatisfactory nature of the system.</P>
    <P>At a time when our young people are experiencing so much difficulty in obtaining employment there is a situation in respect of unemployment assistance that I should like to bring to the attention of the Minister.  I am referring to a situation in which a young person of over 18 who is in receipt of unemployment assistance but who enrols for some educational course in the afternoons is thereby considered automatically not to be eligible for the assistance.  I know of many young people who left school without credits and who were on the dole queues for up to two years but who were no longer considered eligible for assistance on informing their local labour exchange that they had enrolled for an educational course.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot of empty talk these days about drugs, vandalism, bugging, breakins and so on, but we must realise that one of the most important aspects in a young person's development is that he be occupied at all times, whether he be in employment, involved in some community work or making an effort to improve his education.  I agree totally with the Minister about young people taking an interest in community work but I should like him to take some action in regard to the anomaly I have outlined in regard to ineligibility for unemployment assistance on the basis that one is pursuing a course in education.  I know many young people who instead of walking the streets are anxious to improve themselves by way of attending educational courses in the <Col N="2152" /> afternoons but who at the same time are prepared to take up employment should the opportunity arise.</P>
    <P>Last year's budget included provision for a family income supplement for lower paid workers.  The scheme was scheduled to come into operation in October 1983 but it was postponed until December and was not introduced then either.  Last year it was estimated that about 20,000 families would benefit from the scheme but we are told now that the number this year is likely to be 35,000.  One wonders how the scheme is to be administered.  We should not have a situation in which we spend so much on the administration of a scheme as to deprive people who are in need.  Therefore, in so far as this new scheme is concerned I should like the Minister to give us some definite information on that aspect.  When we talk of the lower income families, we must ask about the part-time worker.  He is not entitled to the supplement.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a case for those who, to my mind, are the real poor.  They are the young married couples with mortgages. They had the initiative to build their own homes rather than being a burden on the local authorities or the State. They now find themselves in the queue for the dole, and we talk about supplementing lower incomes.  Thousands of those people are fighting frantically to preserve their homes.  As the Minister knows, this is not a good time to sell a house.  Those people would have to sacrifice their homes and accept practically half what it cost to build them.</P>
    <P>The structure of social welfare was designed mainly to help such people at a time of need.  What are we doing for those people who spent the last penny of their savings to build their own homes? This category of people should be included in those entitled to have their incomes supplemented.  The local authorities are doing their utmost to help such people.  A man comes home with around £65 in social welfare assistance.  Out of that he has to pay something in the region of £27 to £30 on his housing loan.  The Minister should consider the plight of those people.  I have been told that about one third of the people attending our <Col N="2153" /> hospitals have social problems.  Young married couples are in desperate need of help to keep a roof over their heads.  This is why I said at the outset that we should talk about structures which were designed mainly to help those in need. We hear talk about abuses.  We all know what is going on, but it is due mainly to the structures which are open to abuse.</P>
    <P>I am making a very special appeal to the Minister on behalf of those young married couples.  No public representative can deny that such people are coming to their clinics.  I have visited them in their homes.  They were deprived of electricity. They were living on bread and butter.  They are the real poor.  What are we doing to help them?  I ask the Minister of State to convey my remarks to the Minister in the hope that something very positive will be done for them.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to equal treatment for men and women under the social welfare code.  He said he hopes to introduce legislation this year.  We must assume that the EEC directive will not be implemented until late in 1985.  When the Minister is replying I hope he will be able to tell us something more definite about this matter.  I cannot see the directive being implemented until late 1985 or perhaps 1986.</P>
    <P>I want to touch on a number of other points.  There was no indication in the budget that the allowances for the care of severely handicapped children would be increased.  The Minister did not refer to this aspect.  They are entitled to the 7 per cent increase.  Some clarification is needed here.  The current maximum allowance is £62 per month and with a 7 per cent increase it would be around £66 per month.  When the Minister is replying he might give us some information on that.</P>
    <P>The next point relates to the death grant.  It has been said that it is more costly now to die than to live.  Nothing has been done in this respect.  One has only to see an undertaker's account to understand the problem.  This is worthy of consideration because it has caused a great deal of hardship to families especially when they were responsible for the <Col N="2154" /> burial arrangements of an old relative.  I hope the Minister will look at that.</P>
    <P>I welcome any money given to the voluntary organisations especially those involved in community work.  Never before was so much work needed to endeavour to lighten the hardship suffered by many families.  Whatever money is spent in this area will have my wholehearted support.  With massive unemployment, early retirement and so on, the work done by voluntary bodies and community associations is essential.  I hope people who unfortunately have to walk the streets because they are unemployed will direct some of their time and energy to promoting voluntary work in their own areas.  It is so important now because, irrespective of what is said here today or what Minister tries to take credit for any increases given, we have still to deal with a tremendous amount of poverty. I have never seen so much poverty. Any help that can be given to promoting voluntary community effort would be welcome.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision dealing with land leasing.  As an agricultural country we must welcome any incentive given to farmers to hand over their land to younger people.  Unfortunately there is a lot of land lying idle.  That land, if it was properly utilised, would help create employment.  There is little point in such land being left idle.  I welcome the provision to help farmers, particularly elderly people, hand over their land.  I should like to emphasise the importance of examining the outdated structure that exists.  The system was introduced at a time when the country did not face so many problems.  We must meet different challenges today and, consequently, there is a need for new ideas.  Everybody should be asked to contribute to the social welfare system.  It would be possible then to prepare new structures that would not be open to so many abuses. The Minister and his officials should consider the introduction of a complete new social welfare structure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Fennell) Nuala Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>We are <Col N="2155" /> debating a Bill which provides for increased rates of payments in social insurance, social assistance and insurance allowances.  The sections dealing with social assistance are the ones which evoke perhaps the greatest concern and compassion among all Members.  I respectfully suggest to Deputy Wyse that, whatever the difficulties or stresses the community are suffering at present and however great we all may feel about them, it would be hypocritical for him or any Member of his party to suggest that this is something that has emerged only in the last 18 months or so.  The neglectful economic policies of his party in Government have contributed to the unsatisfactory position we face now.  I challenge any Member of the Opposition to put his or her hand on their hearts and say that they did not have anything to do with this.  They must share a large proportion of the responsibility for the present state of our economy.</P>
      <P>At present there seems to be thinking prevailing among some people that the money paid out in assistance should somehow be cut back and saved or used for more useful or productive purposes. It is surprising the fora or meetings where this kind of thinking emerges.  That causes some concern because those who are on assistance have great need and the assistance payments are the only thing between them and poverty.  I would like to think that they could be given out in a generous spirit.  In fact, it is those who are at work and paying taxes &mdash; the Government and the Department paying out on their behalf &mdash; who are paying this money to the people in need.  I would like to see more generosity and understanding of the needs of such people with unemployment so high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to statistics, up to last December there were approximately 725,000 people on assistance against a total labour force of 1.2 million.  In effect that means that the 1.2 million people with jobs and paying PRSI and taxes, not a very big number, were supporting the payments and requirements under the social insurance and assistance schemes. The point to be realised is that none of <Col N="2156" /> us knows when those we know &mdash; neighbours, friends or relatives &mdash; will change from one group of statistics to another. It is important to uphold the rights of people to assistance or benefits to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>I am happy that the Minister in his speech gave an outline of the family income supplement scheme and that it is to be introduced with effect from 1 September. That scheme will help to redress the position that has developed in recent years whereby some workers with dependants are only marginally better off than if they were on benefit.  That can arise principally because earnings, unlike social welfare entitlements, do not generally take dependants into account. Where such a situation exists there can often be very little incentive to take up low paying employment.  One of the main objectives of the family income supplement scheme is to restore this incentive. Such a scheme also recognises the fact that poverty is not confined to families where there is no one at work.  We know from statistical data that there is a significant minority of families with a parent at work who are in the poorest groups and hence the instance of poverty is directly related to family size.  Recent data informs us that, while one in ten families with one child are poor, one in three families with four or more children are in the poorest group.  The family income supplement scheme, by relating payment to family size and by limiting entitlement only to those households with children, will help improve the relative position of some of our poorest families.  The fact that the supplement will be paid for a specific period of one year, together with the important point that there will be no general ceiling on qualifications but rather an individual assessment, means that low earners have the assurance of an uninterrupted reasonable level of income for at least one full year.  That scheme is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the issue of the children's allowance scheme.  In the course of my contribution to the budget debate I welcomed the fact that, contrary to rumour, the payment was not taxed and that there was no suggestion <Col N="2157" /> that it might be subject to a means test. The scheme is important in that it is the only payment by the State directly to mothers.  It could be said that it recognises the importance of their work in raising children in the home.  While I am glad it has been maintained and will be increased in line with expected cost of living increases, I would not suggest that the payment as it is recognises the value of the woman's work in the home.  It recognises the importance of the work the mother does but in terms of the amount it does not come anywhere near compensating or recognising from the financial point of view what a mother at home should be paid, if we could afford to pay such workers.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increases provided for in the Bill especially as in recent years the value of child tax allowances and children's allowances have declined in real terms.  Despite the fact that we probably have the highest birth rate in Europe and have the largest number of women working in the home, the proportion of national income spent on children's allowances is low.  However, it gives official recognition to the fact that there are very high costs associated with child raising and that, without some effort on the part of the State to redistribute resources, many families would find life almost impossible.  The State, and thereby society, recognises it has a responsibility in this area.  Naturally women would prefer if that responsibility were more substantially recognised but this is not likely given our present economic restraints.  I am glad to see that the irritating, if relatively minor, anomaly in the children's allowances scheme has been eliminated to equalise the entitlement for officers who work outside the country in certain categories in the service of the Government. When I inquired I was told this was due to our laws on domicile, where a mother working abroad in one of the categories described could not claim children's allowances.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Bill will extend the validity of the children's allowances orders from three months to six months. This will give the parent more flexibility in using the allowance.  For instance, if a <Col N="2158" /> mother wanted to save the children's allowances up to now this was not open to her because the allowances had to be cashed within three months.  It was a disincentive if a parent wanted to save for holidays, for Christmas or for a time of major expense such as a First Communion.</P>
    <P>I have referred before to the form necessary for completion in respect of children's allowances.  I have made a submission to the Minister for Social Welfare regarding this matter, as I have done with other Ministers.  The form totally ignores the fact that a mother could have an occupation.  There are sections on the form to state the father's Christian name, occupation, address and so on but the form does not suggest that the mother might have an occupation.  It is important that we update our forms to take account of the reality of life.</P>
    <P>I am quite happy to reply to the question put by Deputy Wyse about the elimination of discrimination against women in the social welfare code.  The Minister said he intended to bring in legislation later in the year to give equal treatment to men and women in the social welfare code within the terms of the EEC directive. The requirement of that directive is that it should be introduced by the end of 1984.  I am assured that this legislation will come before the House later this year with a view to having the necessary provisions implemented before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>A matter that has been highlighted recently in the press has been the maternity allowance scheme and I should like to take this opportunity to clear up some misunderstandings about this matter. The Bill provides for a change in the maternity allowance scheme for women in employment.  At present it provides for the payment of 80 per cent of reckonable earnings in the relevant year.  The proposal is to reduce the level of guaranteed payment under the scheme for women in employment from 80 per cent to 70 per cent of reckonable earnings.  It is understood that the 70 per cent refers to gross earnings.  Because of higher taxes and levies in the past few years many people were getting more on maternity <Col N="2159" /> payment than their normal take-home pay.  The original formula was somewhat out-of-date.  I should like to read an extract from a letter sent to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions by the Minister to explain the situation.  It states:</P>
    <P>On 21 December I wrote to you following publication of the 1984 estimates. In my letter I set out in some detail the background to those estimates in so far as social welfare as a whole was concerned.  In the course of the letter I also spelled out in some detail what is at issue in the proposal relating to maternity allowance.</P>
    <P>As there seems to be some misunderstanding at this stage as to the degree and extent of what is at issue, I think it is as well to outline once more the background and detail of the proposal. The purpose of the scheme was to ensure that women would be fully compensated for loss of earnings after all deductions, i.e. take home pay.  The formula devised at the time, taking account of tax and other deductions, allowed for payment of an allowance amounting to 80 per cent of reckonable weekly earnings.  It was provided in legislation that the percentage factor could be varied, up or down, having regard to such matters as movement in the annual average earnings of women and the imposition of or variation of deductions from earnings.  The scheme was introduced in April 1981 and, in the first year of the scheme, the 80 per cent factor originally provided for gave an approximate 95 per cent replacement of take home pay.  Last year, however, the continued use of the 80 per cent factor meant an effective replacement rate of take home pay of 110 per cent.  It was never the intention that the operation of the scheme should result in over-compensation in take home payments and it was for this reason that provision was made in the legislation for varying the percentage figure up or down as the situation demanded.  The matter can perhaps be best illustrated by means of a table, which I enclose, setting out replacement <Col N="2160" /> ratios in relation to various levels of wages.  You will see from the table that a 68 per cent factor would give 100 per cent replacement of take home pay this year.</P>
    <P>I think that explains the situation.  It is not as simple or as brutal as it has been portrayed.</P>
    <P>A provision that must be welcomed is the allocation of £0.5 million for various voluntary organisations.  I do not suppose there is any duplication in the allocation of this funding.  I would hope there would not be much duplication in terms of the allocation being made to organisations already funded from other sources.  I am sure this will not happen and I would support Deputy Wyse in his aspiration to have this funding used for the relief of local poverty or used in an attempt locally to create services of a voluntary nature. It has been my experience that very often a very small amount at local level can be of maximun effect.</P>
    <P>With regard to the deserted wife's allowance, there is to be an increase to something in the region of £45 or £46 per week for a woman with one child.  This particular allowance is one for which there is probably most need but it is not easy to get this allowance.  Many believe that it is extremely simple for women who are separated and not being maintained to get the deserted wife's allowance. There is today a more flexible approach than there was in the past but from representations made to my section there is reason to believe that there is extreme difficulty experienced by many women particularly those living outside the &ldquo;Pale&rdquo; area in qualifying for this allowance.</P>
    <P>One of the qualifying factors is that women are required to make a reasonable effort to trace their husbands and obtain maintenance from them for themselves and their children.  Now this is extremely difficult and it has been found that the social welfare officers and the community welfare officers have varying approaches to women in this situation.  I am not now taking a swipe at those who carry out this work because it is a very difficult job and the vast majority of the <Col N="2161" /> officials engaged in this work both in the Department and with the health boards and are doing an extremely difficult job. They have to act like social workers, but the reality of the situation is that in some areas some deserted wives are meeting with great difficulty in convincing the officers of their needs.  Great difficulty can arise when women have not yet qualified for the deserted wife's allowance and are looking for supplementary welfare.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that the training and preparation given to welfare officers in the Department and to the community welfare officers could be improved.  Every day they are meeting up with hardship cases.  They are seeing the grim side of life, experiencing the dire realities for many people, not only with deserted wives but with all the other difficult cases where people are at the end of their tether, so to speak.  These women are not working or they have financial difficulties and they end up in the health centre looking for money to tide them over.  This is social work and I think there should be some element of social work dimension included in the training for the job.  I am sure that in the selection of these officials their personalities, their characters and their approach to this type of position are all taken into account.  I know that the vast majority are kind, understanding and compassionate; but it would be desirable in this area to have the best possible people with as much training as it is possible to give them.  The social welfare officers who operate with the Department of Health are the same people who check out employers about the payment of contributions and I regard that as an extraordinary marrying of functions. I accept the problem created by the embargo, but in this area there is definitely a conflict of difficulty in having those two functions related and particularly in the implementation of the functions. They do two social jobs, one of which is largely social and the other which is purely financial.</P>
    <P>With regard to the difficulty deserted wives and children are facing at the moment, very often when a woman lives with perhaps a distant relative or in a <Col N="2162" /> house in which there could be a man with whom she could be cohabiting this tends to affect her eligibility.  Here again representations have been made to me that women have been forced to abandon a home in which there would be emotional support and companionship and live alone because the qualifying factor would be affected since she could be judged to be cohabiting.  Cohabiting in this context does not necessarily mean a sexual relationship. It is cohabiting in the sense of living in a combined domestic arrangement. This situation does militate against women at a particularly difficult time.  It is something on which I would like to see some easing up.  It would be a pleasure to all of us if we could discuss this Bill in terms of the financial increases for those in greatest need, namely, those on social assistance.  There seems to be a stigma attached to these.  This is quite unfair.</P>

The building included two other premises in addition to those occupied by <i>Militant Irish Monthly</i> and the gardaí similarly verified that the wanted person was not in either of them, though as one of them is a shop open to the public it was possible for the gardaí to make the check there without formality.</P>
      <P>The decision to search the building was an operational Garda matter based on a professional Garda assessment as to the action that needed to be taken on foot of the available information.  I am not involved in operational Garda matters and I do not consider that it would be appropriate for me to comment on the action that was taken.</P>

There would be an estimated cost for the Mountjoy Prison operation as well as the cost of overtime in the Ballinamore <Col N="2173" /> operation.  As regards protest marches in Dublin, individual figures are not kept. I agree that there is interference with trading in the city centre if large protest marches take place but in a democratic society there must be a free right to protest.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> A Renault 4L car equipped with radio was allocated to Ardee station on 29 June 1983 to replace an Avenger patrol car which had been withdrawn from service. The Garda authorities consider the car is adequate to meet the present needs of the area.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> This question does not have anything to do with divisional task forces.  As I said before, divisional task forces have not been disbanded; they were integrated with the Special Branch in particular divisions.  There are approximately the same number of Special Branch people, carrying the same armaments, as previously.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is the practice for the Revenue Commissioners to put discovered smugglers of controlled drugs in the charge of members of the Garda Síochána for any further action. The Garda have had specific training in the Border divisions.  For example, 22 superintendents, 17 inspectors, 18 sergeants and 62 gardaí in the Border divisions have had particular training in anti-drugs work designed to ensure that participants would be fully informed of the various aspects of drug abuse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are 700 Customs and Excise officers available?  Is he also aware that using these officers as a back-up service for the Garda squad would be an ideal arrangement to intercept drugs at the point of import?  Because very few drugs are grown in this country the majority have to be imported and must come through the areas controlled by these officers. Since this is an ideal method, would he take another look at his policy and recognise the fact that these officers could help cut down on the availability of drugs here?  Would he ask his Government to give a clear policy commitment that they will involve the Customs and Excise officers in this area?  If he does that he will see that great benefit will come from it.</P>

I have said that the enforcement of controls on the importation of any goods or articles, including drugs, is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  I cannot see why the Deputy would call on me to make it a matter for the Revenue Commissioners when I have already said that it is a matter for them.  I have also said that the Garda authorities have no evidence to suggest <Col N="2179" /> that drugs are being illegally imported from the North to any significant extent.

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will outline in view of his statement in the course of the recent Dáil debate on security on 24 January 1984 that he does not hold out much hope of providing separate air support for the Garda in the near future, his policy in relation to the provision of an air arm and helicopter wing for the Garda.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> As I indicated in the statement referred to, I have arranged for discussions with the Army authorities to see what in the short term the Air Corps can accord to the Garda by way of additional aerial support.</P>
      <P>In view of the experience which the Air Corps have of operating and maintaining helicopters and having regard to the considerable financial outlay that would be required to provide the Garda with even one or two helicopters of their own, I do not think it realistic at the present time that we should depart from the current arrangements whereby the Air Corps provide this back-up service for the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that the Garda have found in their studies and inquiries in this area in recent years that helicopters would facilitate their work greatly, especially in dealing with major armed robberies and the movement of subversives, as well as in towns outside Dublin and in perimeter areas?  The Garda have found that this would be a particularly useful facility for them.  Would the Minister not agree that they should be provided with a helicopter wing, however small, with back-up from the Army where appropriate?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> After the murders of Detective Garda Morley and Garda Byrne at Ballaghadereen on 7 July 1980 the then Taoiseach directed the Garda Commissioner to prepare a plan <Col N="2181" /> for dealing with serious crime, particularly armed robberies.  The Garda Commissioner's plan to deal with the prevention and detection of serious crime recommended that the Garda should have their own helicopter service. Deputy Woods was a member of the Government who did not implement that recommendation.  The only movement towards its implementation was that a number of foreign trips were undertaken and a total amount of £1,000 was provided in the Estimates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister please try to refrain from misleading the media and everyone else in this respect?  Would he not agree that the normal procedure until the final decision is made about the type and nature of this equipment is to provide a sum under such a heading so that the Government of the day can allocate the appropriate amount when the decision is made?  Would he agree that he has now removed this sum, thereby taking away all possibility of going ahead with the helicopter service?  In any event, he has told us he will not do it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>Community policing can mean different things to different people but I assume that the Deputies have in mind the community or neighbourhood policing system known as Neighbourhood Watch about which there has been some recent publicity.</P>
      <P>This system is essentially a network of public spirited people who observe what is going on in their own neighbourhood and report suspicious or unusual happenings to the Garda.  In simple terms the civilian becomes the `eyes and ears' of the Force with a view to counteracting the activities of the criminal and the vandal. Street patrolling, with the inherent dangers of vigilantism, has no part to play in this system of neighbourhood protection.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities, with the cooperation of the local communities, are in the process of setting up the system on a pilot basis in the Finglas and Inner City areas.  The system has also been explained to residents' associations in several other areas.  The Garda authorities hope that the response from the public will be such that it will be possible in due course to establish Neighbourhood Watch throughout the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of additional <Col N="2183" /> gardaí for Finglas, the precise arrangements for policing particular areas are a matter for the Garda authorities. There has been a substantial increase in Garda strength in the Finglas area over the past few years and the Garda authorities are of the view that the increased strength should be sufficient to cater for the introduction of Neighbourhood Watch in the area.</P>
    <P>I am further informed that the system will be monitored locally in any area where it is introduced and the police needs of those areas will be kept under review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says he presumes we are talking about Neighbourhood Watch but this is only a small part of the community policing area and the question relates to community policing generally &mdash; the provision of police on the beat, the availability of gardaí on foot patrol in a community area on whatever basis is necessary round the clock.  Would the Minister say what his plans are in terms of a reorientation of the deployment and operation of gardaí in relation to communities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Community policing obviously means different things to different people.  I have previously informed the House and Deputy Woods that it is the policy of the Garda Commissioner, which I support, that the maximum number of gardaí should be in uniform on the beat in our cities and towns and that there should be close contact between individuals and gardaí on the beat.  There is evidence of this change in policy in Dublin and other major cities where a higher proportion of gardaí are to be seen on the beat than before.  This process is aided by the fact that many new recruits are now coming from training in Templemore and a high proportion of them are being allocated to the Dublin metropolitan area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister says about the increase in numbers and both sides of the House have been committed to this policy.  Can those communities <Col N="2184" /> which have not been given additional gardaí on the beat have any hope of community policing as a reality in their areas?  We have recently been given figures to the effect that only an additional 62 Garda members will be appointed for the rest of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I do not think that community watch or formulated schemes of community policing should be imposed on communities.  The initiative should come from the communities and the Garda should be willing to co-operate with them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the success of the community watch idea depends on the ability of the Garda to respond to reports made to them by people in the area?  If there is considered to be a need in the Finglas area for additional gardaí to assist the community watch, would the Minister be prepared to allow the necessary arrangements to be made to so provide?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Garda strength at Finglas station has been increased substantially in recent years. For example, at 31 December 1981 it comprised one detective-sergeant, seven sergeants, four detective-gardaí and 34 gardaí making a total of 46 while on 27 February 1984 the figures were, one detective-sergeant, eight sergeants, four detective-gardaí and 46 gardaí making a total of 59.  That represents an increase of 13 gardaí in the area in that time. However, the situation will be kept under review and gardaí will be allocated by the Commissioner to the areas in which he considers there is the most need for them.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I have to say again in relation to this matter what has already been stated a number of times by previous Ministers for Justice.  This report is a confidential document which was commissioned for the benefit and advice of those responsible for the management and guidance of the Garda Síochána.  Much of what it contains is based on information provided by many individuals on the clear understanding that the resulting report would not be published.  It is not proposed now, nor was it ever intended, to publish this report.  Apart from the basic obligation to live up to the commitments in regard to confidentiality that were given, the decision not to publish is in full accord with the practice that has obtained in relation to such reports not only in the public sector but in the semi-State and private sectors as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the question of honouring confidentiality undertakings, which is of paramount importance, the publication of anything in the nature of a summary of findings presents major difficulties. The report is a very long and detailed one, dealing with a wide spectrum of <Col N="2186" /> Garda organisational, administrative and other matters and contains a great deal of factual material, analysis and comment in addition to actual findings.  The publication of findings out of context of the material and considerations which led to them could not be an adequate representation of what the report contains and could indeed be seriously misleading. This would almost certainly lead to calls for further elaboration and in turn to further demands that the complete report be published.  I am satisfied that this is a situation that is best avoided and that the proper stance to adopt is the one that has been maintained all along &mdash; the report is a totally confidential document, commissioned by and written only for those with responsibility for Garda management, and it should remain so.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to infer, as some people do, that the non-publication of this report means that nothing has been done in relation to it.  Regularly the accusation is made that this report has been rejected or ignored or, to quote the popular phrase, &ldquo;left to gather dust on a shelf in the Department of Justice&rdquo;.  This is not the case.  The nature of the document is such that it is not appropriate to talk in terms of accepting or rejecting it.  Its contents have been and continue to be a source of advice and assistance to management in arriving at decisions relating to the general management and organisation of the Force.</P>
    <P>In fact the findings of the report have been fully taken into account in connection with the introduction in recent years of wide-ranging improvements in the management and organisation of the Force.  In this connection I can mention the provision of the Garda College, the strengthening of the senior management structure by the establishment of additional assistant commissioner posts, the introduction of a new Garda promotion scheme, and the extension of the policy of civilianisation.  The new rural policing scheme which is being tried out in a number of pilot areas is also broadly based on recommendations in this report.  I should like to think that what I have said on this matter will finally put an end to calls for publication of this report and to speculation <Col N="2187" /> that the decision not to publish it deprives the Garda Síochána of some advantage or is based on some ulterior motive.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that in their report, the Conroy Commission indicated that there was a need for a very serious reorganisation of the Garda and urged that an examination be undertaken by appropriately qualified people into the role, organisation and personnel policy of the Force with particular reference to the relationship of the Force with the Department of Justice on the basis that there was evidence of an unclear definition of roles as between the Department and the Garda?  Since the study in question was undertaken following the publication of the Conroy Commission report, would the Minister not consider that the public are entitled to have some indication of the direction the Department are going in that respect especially since the Garda Representative Association said recently they are awaiting some action in relation to the report and that they consider that disappointment at the lack of delegation has permeated the Force?  They claim that they have not noticed any change since the commission identified the problems.  In these circumstances, would the Minister not consider it important that a fundamental reorganisation be undertaken?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The report of the management consultants, Messrs.  Stokes, Kennedy, Crowley and Company was commissioned in April 1975 and was for the purpose of carrying out a consultancy project for the Garda. The report was finalised by August 1978 at which time the party of which the Deputy is a member were in power.  They had plenty of opportunity to publish the report should they have so wished but for the very reasons I have outlined they took exactly the same attitude as I have taken.  This was only proper since people who gave evidence to those compiling the report did so on the basis that it would not be published.  However, that is not to say that the advice outlined in the report <Col N="2188" /> has not been taken into account.  As I mentioned at the end of my reply, the advice has been taken into account in a number of major policy areas.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> As a result of the monitoring of expenditure on the Garda Síochána in 1983, it was possible to identify headings under which savings were likely to arise and to ensure that these funds were reallocated to other services provided for in the Garda Síochána Vote, thereby making the best possible use of the available resources. At the same time it was possible to ensure that overall expenditure did not exceed the provision in the Garda Vote.  In the event, total expenditure amounted to £203.99 million and was thus right on <Col N="2190" /> target, being within less than 1 per cent of the voted provision of £205.41 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I am aware of the demand, but it need not necessarily have the effect which the Deputy suggests.  As soon as people are taken off the beat to man a station, there are fewer gardaí available on the beat, even though there are more gardaí available within the station to provide an answering service to members of the public.</P>

The provision of a communications system under the new radio network with the use of the Green Man we talked about yesterday will provide ready access for members of the public through this medium from stations which are not manned at a particular <Col N="2192" /> time to a central station.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the massive increase in the population in Leixlip in the past ten or 15 years, and taking into account the fact that the original population in the region of 700 to 800 has now reached 12,000 to 14,000, would it not be advisable for the Minister to give serious consideration to providing a Garda station in Leixlip and thereby alleviating some of the burden placed on the officers in the Lucan station which is two miles away?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): The present arrangement is that the Leixlip area is policed from the station in Lucan.  In 1971 the census showed that the population <Col N="2193" /> in Leixlip was 2,414.  The Garda estimate the current population at approximately 10,000.  There has been some improvement because the Lucan station policed an area with a population of approximately 2,370 which is now being policed from Ronaldstown station. There are more gardaí available for the Leixlip area.  I take the Deputy's general point that areas which expand in population with such rapidity must be kept under constant review to ensure that the best possible policing arrangements are made.</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): The Deputy has pointed to a particular difficulty in operational matters.  I could not do the mental arithmetic required at the moment.  In general, if you open a small Garda station in a community you would <Col N="2194" /> need a garda sergeant, a garda and somebody on communications, that is, three people in the station.  It would probably take something like 12, 13 or 14 to keep the three there for 24 hours a day seven days a week.  I presume the point the Deputy is making is that with a roster system you would need a very large number since policing is a 24 hour a day seven days a week job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): In the normal course I would not be prepared to make any comment on a disciplinary matter because, under the regulations, that is something for the Commissioner to deal with &mdash; as he has in fact been doing in this case without reference to me.  However, in view of the assertions made in the text of the question, some limited comment is called for especially against the background of certain comments which the Deputy is reported as having made to political correspondents concerning his reasons for putting down the question.</P>
      <P>What I propose to say is based on information supplied by the Garda authorities and is factual.  The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot become involved in any expression of opinion on the merits of the issues to be investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, although the statutory regulations use the word &ldquo;investigation&rdquo; to <Col N="2195" /> describe the action to which the question refers, what is involved is a formal procedure and it is standard practice, and not abnormal as the Deputy appears to have thought, for this to be preceded by a less formal investigation.  Second, more members than one are involved.  Third, as may be deduced from the fact that more members than one are involved, the investigation will cover a number of matters and I am informed that there will be no question of the member concerned being liable to be held to have been in breach of discipline in respect of any allegation on which he was acquitted in court.</P>
    <P>I am informed that information about the disciplinary investigations is not released officially to the communications media.  If the Deputy means to imply that in this case information was supplied by somebody in Garda management through some unofficial channel, I would request that he forward whatever evidence he has to the Garda authorities so that it may be checked.</P>

      <P>I will take the last part of the answer first.  If, as the question says, on Monday 14 February 1984 the member was informed and the papers were informed the following morning and had full information, it is a question for the Minister.  I want him to let us know how that can happen with such rapidity.  That is the only evidence I have.  Is the Minister aware that the member concerned first heard of the criminal proceedings against him in an announcement apparently from an official Garda source on the 9 p.m. news in March 1983?  True to form the next day <i>The Irish Press</i> and the <i>Irish Independent</i> had a full account of the matter.  The Minister must agree that this indicates an orchestration of the media in relation to this case which is particularly disturbing and which we have to question the Minister about.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am not aware of what the Deputy has suggested. I was under the impression that the Deputy had some information which he might be able to communicate to the Garda authorities so that they could have the matter checked out.  The essential point to remember is that I have been informed by the Garda authorities that there will be no question of the member concerned being liable to be held to have been in breach of discipline in respect of any allegation on which he was acquitted in court.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that the alleged disciplinary offences as stated included a number of those alleged offences for which the Garda member had already been tried in court including one which was the allegation of running away on being arrested, which was exactly the same as one of the alleged offences considered in the indictment at the time?  It is only today that the Minister is telling us this and I am sure the member concerned will be glad to hear that from the Minister.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Matters of discipline in the Garda Siochána are for the Commissioner to deal with.  As I said in my reply to the original question although the statutory regulations used the word &ldquo;investigation&rdquo; to describe the action to which the question refers, what is involved is a formal procedure and it is standard practice, and not abnormal, as the Deputy appears to have thought, for this to be preceded by a less formal investigation. What I am saying to the Deputy is that there will be no question of the member concerned being liable to being held to have been in breach of discipline in respect of any allegation on which he was acquitted in the court.  In reply to the general point the Deputy has made I should like to say that there are situations where members of the Force are acquitted on specific items in court but there are other outstanding disciplinary matters which are a matter for the Garda authorities to proceed with.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the Bank of Ireland is engaged in purchasing shares in the Irish Civil Service Building Society.  As I indicated to the Deputy in answer to a Private Notice Question on 6 March, the question of the possible acquisition by the bank of a controlling interest in the society is still under consideration by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give any indication as to when the Government will finish the consideration stage and come to a conclusion in view of the fact that the bank have now acquired what represents 15.6 per cent of the investment shares in this building society which is not, of course, mutualised?  In view of the fact that a bank, or any other group other than a building society is free to bid &mdash; any one of the building societies required the Minister's consent &mdash; will the Minister not recognise that there is, to say the least of it, an inequity and, perhaps, the risk of a distortion or monopoly arising if a decision is not taken soon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say exactly when the Government will make a decision on the matter.  A decision on the matter to the extent that it requires a Government <Col N="2199" /> decision will not be delayed for any longer than is absolutely necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that pending that decision a number of courses of action are open to the Minister, or the Government &mdash; for instance, to give consent to any one or other of the building societies to make a bid, something they cannot do without the Minister's consent, or look to the provisions under the Mergers and Monopolies Act, or to consider amending the 1976 legislation in respect of which exceptional arrangements were provided for the Irish Civil Service Building Society which allowed this bid from outside the building society now &mdash; which would suggest that action should be taken now after the consideration he mentioned two weeks ago in the House?  Will the Minister not acknowledge that in the absence of that there is a risk that further shares may be acquired and that the confidence in this building society, or others, could for one reason or another be affected by developments outside their control?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to tell the Deputy that what he has described as options, the different paths that are open arising from the provisions of the building society legislation, and Mergers and Monopolies Act, are all part of the considerations in which the Government are engaged.  I do not see them as being matters which would require a decision to be made before they could be considered. They are all part of what we are considering in order to arrive at the correct decision in this case.  I indicated to the Deputy last week what my concerns are in relation to this.  I should like to ask the Deputy not to jump too quickly into the area of discussing what the effects of different courses of action might be on the level of confidence in any one or other of the building societies.  I do not think that is the point that is at issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

      <P>Will the Minister agree that the Building Societies Act, 1976, in particular section 22 (7), was introduced specifically to protect the position in the <Col N="2200" /> Irish Civil Service Building Society and to enable them to carry on holding these shares?  Will the Minister agree that the Bank of Ireland by being allowed to purchase part of these shares, has eroded the rights of individuals to purchase the shares and that they have set the buying standards which ordinary investors in building societies could not afford to pay for them?  Will the Minister agree that the purchase of these shares on two occasions by the Bank of Ireland has set a precedent whereby financial institutions can buy these shares and direct and take over another financial institution?  Will the Minister agree that the 1976 Act was passed to protect the ICBS and that he, and the Government, should take immediate action to ensure that a financial institution like the Bank of Ireland cannot take over any other financial institution by buying out shares because there are no voting rights available on this type of purchase?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The particular provision in the 1976 Act to which the Deputy has referred was kept there by the House in recognition of the constitution of that society.  I do not accept that any precedent has been created since that time. The shares of that society have been quoted on the market and anybody who wishes to do so has been free to make an offer to buy any of those shares.  No precedent has been created in the sense of trading in shares.  That is not something that happened today or yesterday, it has been there since 1976 and even before that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the Bank of Ireland already have a monopoly of the building society situation because they are the only named associated bank that building societies can invest surplus funds in, apart from Government stocks and gilts?  Will the Minister agree that the fact that the Bank of Ireland are purchasing shares of another building society who got special exemption in the 1976 Act is leading to a position where overall monopoly control will be available to one banking institution <Col N="2201" /> of the building society business? Will the Minister agree that it is urgent that he should take action on this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see that the type of situation the Deputy has described could properly be considered to be a monopoly by any one institution of the building society situation, as he called it, in the country.  I cannot see anything in what the Deputy has said that could honestly be described as a monopoly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the fact that building societies are not in a position to bid unless they have the Minister's consent, is there not the risk of monopoly there?  Is the Minister not aware that shares with a nominal value of £1 are being acquired by the Bank of Ireland at £17.50 per share?  In view of that, and also in view of what Deputy Treacy has said, will the Minister assure us that before this matter is determined he will report back to the House on the outcome of the consideration that has been underway for some time to ensure the principle of mutualisation which is the characteristic of the building societies and the purpose of their regulations and the relevant legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said to the Deputy, both today and last week, what are my concerns and those of the Government in the matter and the importance we attach to ensuring that whatever course of action is ultimately followed it will not have an adverse effect on the supply of finance for house building, on the housing programme generally or on the situation of those people who have loans from this particular building society.  That concern is what has led us to consider deeply all the matters and the different legislative options that may be open, as described by the Deputy.  With regard to reporting back to the House, that would depend on the kind of decision taken.</P>

Once again I say to the Government it is about time they came to terms with their situation and stopped blaming previous Governments because of their own inability to cope.</P>
      <P>Earlier the Minister for Social Welfare stated that the real value of pensions and benefits would be maintained.  Last year in the budget an increase of 12 per cent and 10 per cent was given but this year the increase is only 7 per cent and this will not come into operation until July 1984.  How then can the Minister say the real value of pensions and benefits are being maintained?  Does he not realise that the situation of many families since this time last year has become much worse because of the ever-increasing unemployment figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister appeared to be making rather a big thing about public attitudes to social welfare provisions.  He gave the <Col N="2232" /> impression that people want the resources needed for social support to be diverted to, as he said, more productive use of the economy.  He should well know that it is fear in the community that is causing this problem, the fear of incapacity to meet the cost of social welfare benefits.  There are now almost as many unemployed as there are in the labour force.  Those of us who are working will need to find £2,156 million this year.  That is the gross expenditure on social welfare. That represents £6 million per day or almost £1,000 a year for every man and woman in the labour force.  Is it any wonder that the people who are in employment are worrying about their capacity to sustain and support those on social welfare?</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that those on social welfare should not in any way be apologetic because they need support.  I do not think anybody is apologetic. People are angry.  They are depressed. They see themselves in the situation in which they will be on social assistance for the rest of their lives.  They see no jobs. They are not apologetic.  They are angry and young people are becoming more angry by the minute.  Has the Minister and his colleagues talked to the people recently?  How many of them have tried to find out from families what the situation is?  Do they realise that in some households in this city the father is redundant and there are two or three young people under the age of 25 also unemployed and all trying to exist on social assistance?  Some of those who are unemployed actually cannot get social assistance. There are parents at the moment trying to clothe, feed and keep in pocket-money children between the ages of 17 and 25 who are getting nothing at all, no money of any kind from any source.  Is it any wonder these young people are depressed?  Is it any wonder they are losing all hope in democracy and in this country?</P>
    <P>Much has been said, particularly by the Fine Gael Party, about the woman in the home, and in their manifesto of 1981 they made a very big point about this.  At that time they were pretending to give the woman in the home some money for herself <Col N="2233" /> in the form of £9.60p but that never happened.  In my opinion it could never have been implemented.  It was a bad idea but women got the impression they would get something.  Now we have the family income supplement.  We heard about this a considerable time ago but we will have to wait until the end of the year to see it implemented.  One has to be earning less than £63 a week.  One has to be working.  One has to have so many children in order to get a certain amount of money.  I wonder why this family income supplement is not being paid directly to the wife?  Is it going to be paid to the husband or can the wife get that money?  This is very important in my opinion.  Why is it being paid to the wage earner who is normally the man?  Surely it should be the woman who should be paid.  She should be recognised and paid something for herself.  I welcome this family income supplement, since something is better than nothing, but when are this Government going to give free dental and optical treatment to the woman in the home, to her husband and to her children?  To me that would be a better approach.</P>
    <P>I come now to the position of the widow.  Apparently this family income supplement will not be paid to a widow with dependent children.  A widow with three dependent children will from next July, get £80.72 per week.  The widow is doing the job of both mother and father. She is entitled to support from the State and I believe she should be treated in the same way as a married couple while she is trying to house, clothe, feed, educate and generally look after her children.  But she will not get any part of this family income supplement.  Is she not a family? Is she not entitled to be regarded as the breadwinner of the family?  Actually a widow who tries to earn a little more by doing part-time work is taxed.  Widows should be entitled to do part-time work to supplement their income without being taxed.</P>
    <P>Increased children's allowances will come into operation in August next.  The vast sum in this case is exactly 20p per week extra.  That is the figure if it is over a nine-month period.  It will probably be <Col N="2234" /> over a 12-month period which will result in reducing it to 14p a week.  We have 14p a week in the case of children's allowances and 8 per cent VAT on clothes. How could any Government come in here and present this House with that kind of budget?  Do they take into consideration at all the very grave circumstances in which many families find themselves not because of unemployment but because of the number of teenage children living at home who cannot find jobs?  Imagine the situation of a woman with her husband unemployed, a couple of teenage children and one or two younger children around 10 and 11 years of age, trying to clothe a child for confirmation.  Does anybody realise how much it costs now to clothe a child for confirmation?  That woman struggles to put a few pounds together, possibly from the children's allowances, to buy that confirmation outfit but now she will have to pay 8 per cent VAT as well on that outfit.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Women's Affairs referred this morning to a flaw in the children's allowances which has now been rectified. Where the father is living abroad the allowance can now be paid to another person and that includes the mother.  She mentioned the law of domicile. I was very annoyed when I heard the Minister mention the law of domicile. I admire her but she has been in Government now for 14 or 15 months.  Why did she not take steps to change the law of domicile?  That was one of the things she said she would do.  I do not like saying this but I regard this ministry for Women's Affairs as sheer window dressing. No legislation has been brought before the House from that ministry.  We have been waiting now since 1982 and nothing at all has happened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no harm to nudge the Minister into doing something.  The Minister for Social Welfare said that pensions and benefits here were on a par with England and Northern Ireland.  That may <Col N="2235" /> be so moneywise.  Has he any idea of the difference in the cost of living between this country and England and Northern Ireland?  Has he ever seen the differences that exist in prices?  There is no point in having pensions and social assistance on a par with another country when your cost of living is so much greater.  I am very disappointed that in this year's budget and in the Social Welfare Bill social assistance has not been increased, as we did the last year we were in office, by 25 per cent.  Children's allowances were not increased at all last year and this year they are increased by 7 per cent. That is 17 per cent over a two year period compared with 25 per cent which we gave in one year.</P>
      <P>This all gets back to the fact that social assistance will become an increasingly difficult problem if we do not create more work for people.  The situation becomes critical when there are almost as many people unemployed as there are working. The situation will get much worse unless the Government create jobs.  The Minister said this morning that the social code would be equalised by the end of the year following the EEC directive.  The Minister committed himself this morning to equality for men and women in the social code before the end of the year.  I hope he will not try to push it away next September or October and put it on the long finger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very sad case was mentioned on a radio programme a couple of weeks ago of a married woman with two children who was the breadwinner of the family because her husband is still studying.  She was working and providing for her two children and her husband as well as looking after her home.  She became unemployed and, as any person in the household looking after financial matters would do, she tried to get social welfare assistance for her husband and her two children but she was not entitled to it. The Minister cannot wait until the end of the year to bring about equality in the social code for men and women.  He should bring in a Bill immediately to bring that about.  Am I correct in believing that we have 15 minutes?  I was <Col N="2236" /> informed we are only allowed 15 minutes each.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Pattison) Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Pattison)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill before the House is to give effect to the proposals in the budget relating to social welfare.  It also includes a number of provisions with the intention of improving the administrative arrangements for a number of schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is customary at budget time to review generally the position relating to social welfare with a view to ensuring that those who are in need of help from the schemes of social insurance and assistance will be provided for adequately.  There has been a steadily increasing demand in the services provided by my Department because of continuing stagnation in economic activity.  The result is that the cost of the services administered by the <Col N="2237" /> Department of Social Welfare has risen steeply and financing these services is now a serious problem.  In 1983 overall expenditure by the Department of Social Welfare amounted to £1,907 million of which the Exchequer contributed over £1,093 million.  In 1984 it is estimated that overall expenditure will be about £2,156 million &mdash; an increase of 13 per cent &mdash; of which the Exchequer will contribute £1,254 million.  This is after allowing for the budget provisions.</P>
    <P>These are very large amounts of money and the question of finding the necessary finance is a difficult problem.  Of particular concern is the unemployment situation, the numbers of whom continue to increase disturbingly.  This time four years ago in 1980 the live register showed over 92,300 people unemployed.  The live register figure published at the end of February 1984 showed 215,500 people unemployed &mdash; a two-and-a-half fold increase in the four years.  The result is that in 1984 it is estimated that £579 million will be spent on payments to the unemployed.  This will represent nearly 27 per cent of total social welfare expenditure.  However, within the limitations of the current economic situation, the Government have arranged to provide increases from next July of 8 per cent in unemployment assistance for the long-term unemployed and 7 per cent for all other recipients of weekly social welfare payments.  Rates of children's allowances will be increased by 7 per cent from the beginning of August.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the increases provided for in this Bill will be sufficient to maintain the value of payments to those who depend on social welfare between mid-1984 and mid-1985.  Taken together with the increases of 10 per cent to 12 per cent provided last year, social welfare recipients will probably be unique among all sections of the community in fully maintaining their living standards between 1983 and 1985.</P>
    <P>The extra increase for the long-term unemployed is particularly welcome. This increase, following the special 5 per cent increase provided for this group last October, gives the long-term unemployed <Col N="2238" /> an aggregate increase of 13½ per cent in rates of support relative to July 1983.  Part of the problem of unemployment is the increasing duration people are having to spend without work and their own income.  The particular hardships associated with prolonged unemployment are well documented.  The extra support provided in this Bill for such people marks a recognition by the Government of this hardship and the need for the special extra measures to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The cost of the various increases in rates and other improvements will amount to £68 million in 1984, equivalent to nearly £148 million in a full year.  This enormous additional expenditure is on top of an additional net £181 million extra being provided for social welfare this year relative to 1983, representing the full year cost of last year's increases and the growing number of people depending on social welfare in one form or another.</P>
    <P>Expenditure of this scale indicates the strong commitment by this Government to providing significant extra support to the most needy sections of our community. This extra support includes not only the increased rates I have mentioned but also the retention of food subsidies and the introduction of a family income supplement scheme for low-paid workers.  It is worth bearing in mind that these measures have been introduced or retained without any increase in rates of pay-related social insurance contributions for workers.  Effectively, therefore, the Government have redistributed a significant proportion of the expected slight up-swing in national prosperity this year towards those who would otherwise be least well-placed to gain from it.</P>
    <P>However, in discussing a commitment to social welfare it is right to look at the basic adequacy of social welfare support and not just the indexation of that support by reference to increased living costs.  Since the Department of Social Welfare was set up there has been a continuing development of schemes and services.  Contributory old age pensions, retirement pension, invalidity pensions, death grants, deserted wife's benefit, allowances for prisoners' wives, unmarried <Col N="2239" /> mothers and single women have been introduced.  The latest scheme provided for in this Bill is the family income supplement.</P>
    <P>The stage has, accordingly, now been reached where all of the generally recognised contingencies have been covered. This is reflected in the increasing amount of expenditure on the various schemes which the Department of Social Welfare administer.  As a percentage of GNP it represents an increase from 8.8 per cent to 14 per cent in the last 10 years.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, one hears frequent criticism of the present position.  On the one hand there has been a deal of criticism to the effect that social welfare benefits are too lavish, that the incentive to work is diminished and that the system is open to abuse and exploitation of one kind or another.  On the other hand, there is widespread criticism of the inadequacy of the range and level of benefits and their ability to cope with the needs of those who must, through no fault of their own, rely on the services.  These are two very contrasting attitudes but what do they prove?</P>
    <P>It is undoubtedly necessary at the present time and in the foreseeable future to exercise a greater degree of control on public expenditure than has been the practice in the past.  What may well now be of paramount importance is the effectiveness and quality of the services we are providing.  It may be a question of ensuring that what we are spending is spent to the best effect and that waste in expenditure is eliminated.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Social Welfare which was established in August 1983 has, as one of its main tasks, a review of the scope and adequacy of the social welfare system.  It is concerning itself in part with the relationship between the amounts of social welfare support received, together with support from related social services and the cost of living which recipients face.</P>
    <P>The role of redistribution through the social welfare system as a means of tackling and removing poverty is fundamental to this examination.  The issue of poverty is still a real one today in spite of developments <Col N="2240" /> in social welfare support.  Poverty, at least in its relative sense, is not confined to any one area or stratum of society; unemployment has reached into every sector and grade and has brought with it complete dependance on social welfare for the household involved.  I await, not just with academic interest, the findings of the Commission on Social Welfare which is due to report within two years because social welfare needs to be effectively directed at poverty as well as maintaining living standards.</P>
    <P>The interaction between benefit levels and the earnings they replace is an issue which the Commission is also examining. Two measures in this Bill provide for changes in the social welfare code.  The first is the continuing periodic adjustment in the floor or earnings disregard to take account of increases in flat-rate benefits provided for in section 7 of the Bill.  This adjustment, bringing the pay-related floor to £43 from £36 of reckonable earnings, contributes to maintaining total benefits at a reasonable level relative to the normal working income they replace while sick or unemployed.</P>
    <P>The second, more fundamental, measure introduced in the Bill is the provision for a family income supplement scheme. This scheme is designed to direct specific support to families on low earnings in proportion to the size of family and the actual family income.  The fact that 35,000 families are estimated to be in need of supplementation of this kind shows not only the extent of almost subsistence earnings but also the extent of the poverty trap that can be created for such workers through the structure of the social welfare and tax systems.</P>
    <P>This supplement scheme will make a useful contribution to families in this position directly focused on their particular situation.  Much work needs to be done on fully integrating the tax and transfer systems in this country and ensuring the most effective and desirable redistribution of resources to those in relative need.  The family income supplement, together with the indexation of rates for social welfare recipients, will help to maintain progress in this area.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I should like to mention <Col N="2241" /> two improvements which are not referred to in the Bill.  The first concerns the free travel scheme.  Under existing arrangements certain categories of disabled people attending full-time, long-term rehabilitation courses may travel free during peak hours &mdash; this is an exception to the general rule which restricts free travel to off-peak periods.  In order to deal with anomalies which have come to light, it is proposed to extend the unrestricted free travel concession for rehabilitation purposes to all blind persons, social welfare invalidity pensioners and recipients of British or Northern Ireland invalidity pension or benefit.</P>
    <P>The other improvement is in the free telephone rental scheme which is available to certain categories of social welfare recipients living alone.  Under the scheme the presence of even a young child in the household automatically disqualifies a claimant.  I am glad to say that this disqualification will be abolished in respect of children under 15 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Before dealing with the detail of the Bill it should be stressed that the time available to the House to discuss the Bill is too short and serious questions must be raised about the reasons for introducing it at such a late stage and in such a hurry.  The Minister has introduced a Bill which, for a member of the Labour Party, should be a matter of shame for himself and his party.  It makes no real attempt to tackle the question of poverty in Irish society.  It has a number of cosmetic bits and pieces in it which do nothing to radically alter the concept and operation of the social welfare code.  In his speech the Minister attempted to distance himself from a number of his Government colleagues when he spoke about people who were demanding that social welfare be reduced to increase the so-called incentive to work.  He would have been more credible if he had introduced some realistic increases in social welfare benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister tried to draw comparisons between the levels of social welfare benefits in this State and those available in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom. True enough, the figures show a <Col N="2242" /> few pounds difference between Ireland and the United Kingdom but he failed to draw any comparison between the levels of the cost of living in the two areas; he failed to draw attention to the difference in the inflation rates and effectively he tried to pull the wool over our eyes by implying that our social welfare recipients were better off than those in the United Kingdom or Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>For instance, we are asked to accept that an increase of 80p per month in children's allowances, which the Minister of State for Women's Affairs admits have lost value over the last few years, is realistic in this day and age.  We are asked to accept that a 7 per cent increase in some social welfare benefits is acceptable when our inflation rate is running at 10 per cent.  We are asked to accept that these increases will be available only from July when the cost of living is rising even at this moment.  We are asked to accept the family income supplement, which will be introduced in November 1984.  It was trumpeted as one of the great advances in our social welfare code.</P>
    <P>There is a need to talk about where precisely our social welfare system is going.  It is generally accepted that there is a need for a totally new approach to the whole question of social welfare.  For that reason I welcome the establishment of the Social Welfare Commission but I am not very satisfied that we will have to wait two years for the results of that commission.  As an earnest of our wish to have changes in the code, we have made a very substantial submission to the commission on how we would like to see the code developing.  One of the primary needs in the social welfare code is the simplification of the benefits available but, apart from that, there must be a clear definition of what the objectives of our social system are.  One of the basic objectives of our system must be to complement those of our economic policy and to help tackle the causes of poverty and hardship in society.  Our present system aims entirely at trying to ameliorate the worst effects of poverty in society and makes no real attempt to see how this poverty could be eliminated.</P>
    <P>The idea we favour in relation to a <Col N="2243" /> reform of the social welfare system would be the adoption of a system based on the suggestions in NESC Report No. 37, which referred to integrated approaches to personal taxes and transfers.  This is described as the individual grant and tax scheme.  That system has the seeds of providing a genuine reform of the scheme and would provide everyone in the State with a basic income, whether working, unemployed or a dependent.  It would also ensure the inclusion in the scheme of persons who are self-employed or who at present are outside the tax code.  There would be an incentive in the scheme to ensure that those who for one reason or another are anxious to avoid coming into the tax system would be encouraged to become part of it because there would be benefits along the way if they were to get sick or were unable to work.</P>
    <P>As administered at present our system demeans many people.  The whole approach goes back to the poor law system when it was regarded as a punishment and humiliation to have to ask for assistance because of ill health or being unable to work.  Unfortunately, elements of that approach still prevail in our social welfare code.  Every person is entitled to be treated with dignity and as a human being but unfortunately instructions are going out to various sections of our social welfare system which require people working in the system to demean and belittle other people, sending them from one office to another in order to ensure that as little money as possible is paid out.  That kind of approach has to stop, but it is symptomatic of the system which has developed over the years in an <i>ad hoc</i> way.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement proposed in this Bill is the wrong way to approach the question of providing a basic adequate income for all families.  In the absence of bringing in legislation to provide for a statutory minimum wage, it can only be viewed as an attempt to subsidise employers who pay low wages. The facts of life are that most people are on low pay because the job is not organised by trade unions.  This is, for many reasons, perhaps because of the type of <Col N="2244" /> work involved or because there is such a small number of people involved that it is not organisable.  I feel very strongly that this family income supplement is the wrong way to go about providing basic incomes for those on low pay.  If it were to be introduced at all it would be better if it had been introduced in tandem with legislation for a basic minimum wage. None of the speakers so far has referred to that angle.</P>

      <P>I will be concluding as soon as possible.  I am not prone to being long-winded but I would like to make the point that all these arrangements are made between the Coalition parties and Fianna Fáil, and we are never consulted about them.  I do not believe it is an order of the House but simply an agreement between the Whips.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I will co-operate as far as I can but I am sure I will not be out of order if I exceed my time by a minute or two.  I am arguing that the family income supplement without the introduction of legislation for a basic minimum wage will be in the long run simply another subsidy to the private sector, maintaining a situation where employers will pay slave wages where they can get away with it. The scheme as it stands will have only a marginal impact on those in poor circumstances. A family with one child would have to be earning less than £63 a week to qualify for the maximum payment of £8 per week, while a family with five or more children would have to be earning less than £95 per week to qualify for a maximum weekly payment of £15 per week.  There must be very few families in that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would seem from the explanatory memorandum that the scheme will not <Col N="2245" /> apply to part-time workers, single parent families, families where a separation has occurred and husband and wife are living apart or where there is a common law relationship and children are involved.  I will ask the Minister to clarify whether those categories are excluded.  If not, he might explain how they will be covered under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Several speakers referred to maternity benefit and the Minister of State responsible for women's affairs tried to argue that reductions in benefit would only affect those bringing home 110 per cent of income received when they were working. The Minister is being slightly misleading in that maternity benefit was introduced only three years ago following a long battle and the process of whittling it away has now started.  It is a sign of the failure of this Government to consider the overall impact on everyone, not just the mathematical average person to whom most benefits are geared.  These cuts will have real effects on real people. If the Minister examined the cuts in maternity benefit in that light she might be able to tell us how many people will be losing money as a result.</P>
    <P>Apart from the structuring of the social welfare code in the long term, there are matters which need urgent attention such as the rights of part-time workers and the question of the distinction between long-term and short-term benefits. Unemployment benefit is classified as short term but it is actually a long-term benefit given the nature of economic problems.  There is the question of the operation of the fuel scheme, as well as the problem of the homeless and the operation of the appeals system.  That system is being abused because people are being arbitrarily cut off from benefit and forced to appeal in order to recover it.  There is also the question of unemployment assistance and how the scheme is applied to young people.  I recently tabled some questions about young people up to 25 years of age who because they are living at home are effectively expected to live on thin air.</P>
    <P>There is the question of the handicapped and the disabled and the manner in which they are being virtually ignored, <Col N="2246" /> according to a magazine dealing with social welfare.  There is no indication in this Bill that allowances for the care of severely handicapped children will be increased this year.  The mobility allowance is not being increased.  There is a degree of cynicism in the approach adopted in this Bill.  It is a cosmetic exercise to make it appear as if increases are being given and things are being improved but when we examine how it will affect people we realise that they will be worse off in the long run.</P>
    <P>The Minister should turn his attention to the area of information for people applying for social welfare benefits.  It would be useful if the Minister made it a practice that when people apply for, say, unemployment benefit they should be told what other benefits might be available. Most Deputies have constituents coming to them who are not aware of their entitlements and who may have failed to claim benefits over a number of years.  Information would help to alleviate anxiety among many people.  I get the impression from the way the system operates that there is an instruction that people should be kept in the dark about their entitlements in case there would be an increase in benefits paid out.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that he intends to introduce legislation at the end of this year to eliminate sex discrimination in the social welfare code within the terms of the EEC directive.  It is significant that he continually refers to this directive and to the fact that the legislation will be within its terms.  They are quite narrow and will not enable wives to claim optical or dental benefit on the basis of their husbands' insurance payments.  It is important to realise that if the legislation is introduced strictly within the terms of the EEC directive many low-income families will lose benefit because of the way in which dependency is defined in our social welfare code.  I would argue strongly that legislation which deals purely in terms of the EEC directive will result in hardship for many people.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to look again at the Social Welfare Bill and to bring in some real changes, boosting the 7 per cent increase at least up to the inflation <Col N="2247" /> rate.  He should not try to cod the House by making spurious comparisons between our levels of social welfare payments and those in Great Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that in the current year £2,156 million will be spent on social welfare is both an indictment of all Governments to date and a very serious challenge to this Government because the necessity for having to pay such a high level of social welfare calls into question the actions, the philosophy, the will and the commitment of Government to deal with the situation.  It would be much easier for the Minister to be able to come here and indicate that a much smaller amount of social welfare payments were required and that the Government of the day were in a position to meet with much greater effect the unemployment situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consolidation some years ago of the Social Welfare Acts was an improvement on a situation which had led to some very serious confusion and to a lack of comprehension among many people in regard to the social welfare code.  The Consolidation Act to a great extent was responsible for bringing about a situation of the non-overlapping of schemes.  One of the criticisms which has been raised here frequently down through the years, and which came to a head again recently, related to the decision of the Supreme Court in July 1982 that the poor law valuation system was unconstitutional in so far as the collection of rates was concerned; but the judgment did not go on to state that, as a consequence of that, social welfare benefits could not be paid to smallholders in the 12 western counties. In other words, the Supreme Court left us in a state of confusion as to the legality of paying out money on the basis of PLV.  The Department were advised that that in itself would be illegal and that they should amend the Act.  This has caused a great deal of tension, both social and political, among those who were formerly recipients of that money.  The notional system was introduced in 1965. By 1976, 31,000 people were receiving social welfare benefits on the basis of that <Col N="2248" /> system; but it was deemed not to be a good system because it involved three different schemes and three different rates of payments.</P>
    <P>The Opposition are trying to claim that the scheme was changed by this Government by way of a money-saving exercise. That sort of attack is typical of the Opposition. It is not the intention of the Government to save money by the change to the factual system.  The High Court decision in regard to the unconstitutionality of the PLV system was not challenged by Fianna Fáil despite their professed concern for the smallholders concerned.</P>
    <P>The methods by which social welfare officers undertake their work have been criticised from all sides of the House.  I hold no brief for these people; but, in so far as I have had dealings with social welfare officers, I have always found them to be competent, accessible and prepared to talk about individual cases of constituents who had approached me. Apparently, the experience of some other people in the House has not been similar and there have been difficulties in relation to some social welfare officers. This raises the question of the need to change the method of assessment of smallholders and of the treatment they receive when social welfare officers visit them with a view to reviewing their situation.</P>
    <P>The provision whereby a smallholder signs on for unemployment assistance so that he may avail of this so-called extra bonus to help him increase agricultural output has not been the case to any great extent.  The use of the money for reclamation work or for the purchase of machinery or of extra stock is a disincentive in so far as continuity of payment is concerned.  One recalls in this context arguments put forward in the past by a former Minister for the Gaeltacht who subsequently became Master of the High Court, Mr. Patrick Lindsay.  It was his contention that these payments should be given by way of a bonus or an incentive rather than merely being paid out for nothing, in which case they are a disincentive. Indeed, Mr. Lindsay lost an election on one occasion as a result of his <Col N="2249" /> honesty in dealing with a client in terms of the small farmers unemployment assistance.  It was said at the time that the problems of small farmers could not be solved by giving them small tractors.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a lack of understanding of the rural mentality on the part of many social welfare officers.  Some of these officers are from the 12 western counties area and these would have an understanding of the situation but there are others who are not in the same position. The Minister should allow for the making available to a farmer of notice that his case was about to be reviewed. This would not mean that a farmer who had received such notice would be at home on the day the officer called, because a farmer is not in the same category as an unemployed person in an urban area who is signing regularly on the live register.  The farmer might be working on one of the small fragmentations of the land he owns.</P>
    <P>In addition, the allowances payable should be clarified and the clarification available at every local employment exchange.  In this way the recipients of smallholders assistance could see for themselves what they are entitled to claim against.  In those circumstances they would ensure within a short time that various receipts and details of expenses incurred in the running of their farms would be made available.  It is not satisfactory that a recipient of this assistance merely receives a two-line statement from a social welfare officer indicating that the level of income in question is in excess of a certain figure without there being clarification as to how the figure has been arrived at.  The people concerned should be entitled to a breakdown of the figure arrived at in respect of a review being undertaken.</P>
    <P>I contend that there should be an allowance in respect of a car that is used in connection with the running of a small farm.  Cars are no longer a luxury and many farmers need to have cars as well as tractors.  It may well be that in the ordinary course of running farms, farmers have to travel in order to engage the services of a vet or to collect spare parts for machinery or to collect feedstuffs.  For <Col N="2250" /> such journeys they may use their cars instead of the rather slow tractor.  The AA have indicated that the average cost of running a car is £65 per week.  If a proportion of the running costs of a car could be deemed as expenses in so far as recipients of the smallholders unemployment assistance is concerned, the difficult situation in which they find themselves could be greatly alleviated.  These people should be in a position to check the basis on which assessments in respect of them are made so that they may be aware that the figure has not merely been pulled out of the air by a social welfare officer.</P>
    <P>The fact that many social welfare officers arrive in rural Ireland in a taxi unannounced, or without advance notice, calls into question the expenses involved.  It would be much better if a notice were sent to a farmer saying that a social welfare officer would call on him on a particular date and asking him to have his facts ready in relation to his factual assessment so that everything would be above board. Some farmers might have had two or three holdings of land left to them by a grandmother or a grand-aunt.  They understand whether or not they are getting the proper amount.</P>
    <P>I have a letter from a constituent who arrived back from England some years ago.  He was getting £20.10.  The pension officer arrived and took £11.30 from him. He appealed and he got back £3.20.  He now has something like £14 a week.  He lives with his brother on a farm of land owned entirely by his brother.  That amount of money would not even buy the tobacco plug he uses every day.  Clarification of expenses in terms of a smallholder or recipient is very important. These people will be satisfied if they are seen to get fair play from the social welfare officers who come out to see them. There should be no need for social welfare officers to arrive unannounced in a taxi paid for at the appropriate rate to carry out a review for a person who might not even be present.  Most of the recipients are prepared to be above board with the Department if they understand that the claims they put in against the usage of their farms can be allowed.</P>
    <P>The present system has led to a great <Col N="2251" /> deal of disincentive, and it calls into question the whole philosophy behind these kind of payments.  I said in the House previously that there is a need in rural Ireland to ensure that moneys paid out are used as an incentive, an advantage and a bonus.  In any rural parish where assistance is paid to smallholders there are always cases where land has to be reclaimed or drained, where fences need to be replaced or gate posts need to be hung.  ACOT provide a professional service to carry out farm plans in relation to farm development.</P>
    <P>It would be well worthwhile for the Department of Social Welfare to consult with ACOT, take a pilot area and carry out a full farm development plan on each smallholder's holding in the parish and arrange for recipients of smallholders' assistance to give at least two or three days per week to the development of the agricultural potential in their own parish. They would be working for their neighbours on a co-operative basis.  The payments would be worthwhile and they would be putting back into the top nine inches of our soil the basis for increased agricultural output.  If a recipient knew he would have ten or 12 workers for three days a week for six weeks to carry out his farm plan, he would be more than willing to adopt that strategy.  The Department should consult with ACOT and the Department of Agriculture in that regard.</P>
    <P>I have had quite a few meetings with widows' associations.  Many widows cannot travel to visit their families or friends after the trauma of the husband's death. They have made the case repeatedly that they should be allowed access to free travel four, five or six times a year to visit their relatives or friends.  This would not cost the Department a great deal but it would have a social value and a personal value to these people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with other speakers that this must be the only Parliament in the world where time is rationed to this extent, especially when we are discussing such important matters.  This is a situation which we as elected parliamentarians <Col N="2252" /> should not allow to continue.  I will not endeavour to cover all of the Minister's speech or all that is in the legislation before us.  In the hope of impressing on the Minister the seriousness and the sincerity of what I say, I will dwell on one point.</P>
      <P>The Minister said there is a tendency on the part of some people who are usually relatively well off to lay the blame for the country's financial ills at the door of the underprivileged and the poor.  I say quite honestly and unashamedly and happily that I am relatively well off.  I am sure I speak for thousands and thousands of people who are in the same position when I say I resent the Minister's statement. This is another example of the capacity of the Government to use words as an excuse for their inaction.</P>
      <P>The Minister also said it is the Government's duty on behalf of the community to give the most deprived sections of the population the priority they are entitled to in any recession.  Who objects to that? My objection is that he is not doing it. Deputy Flanagan will speak later.  I do not presume to speak for him.  When the Minister said that about the relatively well off he was not speaking about anybody in my party.  Deputy De Rossa has indicated that he was not talking about either of the two representatives of his party.  Is the Minister speaking for his own party or for the Fine Gael Party?  He has an obligation to inform the House if that is so.</P>
      <P>I will now endeavour to indicate to him how he is failing himself, failing the Labour Party and failing the Government. On his own words he stands condemned. There is no more important unit in this community, or in any community in the civilised world, than the natural and traditional family unit.  In recent times there have been departures from it and society has had its casualties.  We are all concerned for anybody who is so affected and so afflicted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Down through the ages the ideal family unit has been the unit where the lady or the mother is happy to stay at home and act with her husband as guardian, protector, educator, doctor, nurse, psychologist, psychiatrist and counsellor.  She is <Col N="2253" /> prepared and happy to act in that role in respect of her offspring.  That is the ideal unit socially, economically and in every way.  Even judging it solely from the point of view of economics and the money saved to the community by there being less need for the institutions which have to be established because of the absence of that ideal situation, it is wise for any Government to recognise the role of that lady.</P>
    <P>Traditionally it has been accepted among that group of ladies that the State's recognition of their role manifests itself annually in what is called children's allowances.  We know that, even in respect of the family or the house where the amount of money is not all that vital, the lady of the house has traditionally accepted it as the State's recognition of her or the State's regard for her children. What is the regard of the Minister and his Minister of State?  He told us he accepts that there has been significant extra support for people in need of money.  No Member will deny that the area where there is greatest need for money is in the family unit where there are up to five children.  What is the recognition for this and what has the Minister given to us after his great battling against all the people who would say that that area is provided for already?  What is provided in the legislation as recognition of that poverty, recognition of the role of the lady, is 2p per day per child. Any self-respecting child would not stoop down to pick up such an amount in the day that is in it.  I do not think that he or she would have the courage to go into a shop with 2p.  They will not get anything for that amount.  That amount is the result of the great fight the Minister has had to make against the unidentified opposition he has encountered in making the case for the people who are poor, the people who are the backbone of the society and who by their efforts relieve the State of the expenditure of millions in other areas.</P>
    <P>If I did not do anything more in the few minutes available to me than to repeat this matter I would be serving, better than anything else, to indicate how <Col N="2254" /> hypocritical the Government are in respect of what they say as against what they are doing.  The Bill contains the most insulting commentary on the thousands of women who interpret their role in the way I have indicated and who would be happy in doing that but who, like all others, are anxious for some recognition by the State of the part they play, especially at a time when costs have mounted. Bus fares alone in any house where children must use public transport to get to school have increased by a lot more than is provided by the Minister.  What encouragement is that?  If the Minister is now in pursuit of what is called family planning, if the Minister wants to discourage ladies from engaging in what has been the traditional role of many ladies here, he should say so.  If the Minister wants to introduce what might be regarded as institutionalised contraception, if he wants to introduce contraception by insult, he should tell us; but he should not tell us tomorrow of his interest in the family, family planning or of his recognition of the role of the lady who has to stay at home.  I know that all ladies do not see their role in that fashion, and that is their right and entitlement.</P>
    <P>However, that does not get away from the fact that many women see their role in the traditional manner.  They should be encouraged because of the vital role they play.  I have no doubt that they would welcome such encouragement but not the insult that is being given to them under the Bill.  It adds injury to insult when we expect them to be enthusiastic about what we claim we are doing.  Let us tell them that what we are saying is: &ldquo;Madam, in respect of the miscellany of important duties you are performing for your children, society and the nation, it is the opinion of our Government that you are entitled to 2p per day per child and we hope you will be thrifty and save some money out of it, that you will not be distorting our economy by indulging in anything that would be disadvantageous to the State&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The other side of that coin &mdash; at this stage I regret the constraints that are on us when discussing such a vital matter &mdash; arises from the case of the lady who <Col N="2255" /> because of economic conditions is forced out of the house.  I am referring to the lady who may have been living in Tallaght and moves to Finglas and as a result loses her employment which was necessary to assist her husband in the payment of their rent.  That lady may move to a purchase house in some other part of the city.  Her employment may be disrupted and she may have had a baby.  After six months she may arrange with her sister, her mother or some other person to protect the child and may offer herself for reemployment. That lady will be told at the local employment exchange that she is not available for work, even if she has a letter such as one which I sent to the Minister for Labour asking him to place a lady in employment, to which there was a reply to the effect that the Minister was sorry there was no employment for her. The Minister for Social Welfare tells her she is not available for work and as a result she cannot get her entitlements. On the other hand, if she was in the teaching profession she would be forced back to work because it suits, notwithstanding that her baby would be only a few months old.  The other lady, having spent money travelling to the centre of the city to sign on weekly, will be told: &ldquo;No, you have a baby at home and in our opinion, although we know you are physically fit, anxious to work and have commitments in respect of your loan repayments, you are not available for work&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister who has such an interest in and regard for the poorer sections, the Minister who is fearful of those who would attack him because of how he might be easing their burden, tell us in reply why he thinks an increase of 2p per day in respect of children is sufficient? Will he tell us why it is that a lady who is forced to go to the employment exchange is told that she is not available for work although a lady who is a teacher by profession is required to return to work when her child is, at the maximum, two months old?</P>

      <P>In the time available to discuss this Bill it is hardly possible to deal with all the points one would like to raise in relation to social welfare <Col N="2256" /> services.  At the outset, I wish to express a word of thanks and appreciation to the staff in the office of the Secretary of the Department of Social Welfare for what I consider to be a good service.  They have shown a high standard of efficiency and a word of thanks is not out of place on an occasion like this.</P>
      <P>Although the Opposition, and perhaps some Government Deputies, may be inclined to find fault with some of the measures outlined in the Bill, at least it is a step in the right direction and that is welcome.  There is one provision I welcome in particular, namely, the abolition of the old age pensions committees.  They have long outlived their usefulness.  I have always thought it was humiliating and degrading for old people to be summoned before their neighbours in order to give an account of their means and the means of other members of their families. These matters are private and should be confidential.  I am very glad the committees are being abolished.</P>
      <P>It is the duty of any Government to look after the poor.  It was once said that a country that cannot look after its poor will not be able to defend its rich.  These words were spoken long ago but they are relevant to the country at the moment. There are very poor people here but I am glad to see despite the cutbacks and the various reductions in services that steps have been taken to ensure there are no disastrous cutbacks in social welfare.  The State has a duty to protect the poor, particularly the old and the sick.  It also has an obligation to provide for the handicapped and the disabled.</P>
      <P>Since the foundation of the State I do not think any Government have tackled seriously the problem of poverty.  At the moment there are 215,500 unemployed and it is obvious that the families concerned find it very difficult to maintain proper living standards.  It is amazing the way unemployment casts a great shadow of depression over any household.  The members of the family suffer a loss of identity and the wage-earner suffers a loss of dignity.  A Government cannot progress in other areas if they do not ensure that people are left with a sense of dignity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2257" /> There are approximately 7,000 unemployed people in my constituency and in many cases they have suffered because of delays in welfare payments.  Sometimes they have waited for 10 or 12 weeks for payment of unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit.  I have often wondered why the Department cannot devise some scheme to make payments without having long delays for investigation.  With regard to unemployment assistance, for people in part of my constituency their files have to go to Kilkenny and then to Dublin before a decision is made.  In another part of my constituency the files of the people concerned are sent to Athlone and then on to Dublin.</P>
    <P>When a doctor certifies a person as unfit for work, it is wrong that that person should be examined by a referee who is not a member of the medical profession. He should not be in a position to decide whether a person is ill.  I have known a number of people in my constituency whose sickness benefit has been cut off even though they obtained the necessary medical certificates from their doctors.  I know the people concerned and they were hardly able to attend at the doctors' clinic to get the certificates but because of a referee's decision they were deprived of their benefits.  What has happened has been a disgrace.  There should be some new system where a doctor's certificate will be considered by the medical section of the Department.  A lay person should not have the right to determine whether the medical condition of the applicant is satisfactory.  That is a matter for the doctor.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase of 8 per cent in unemployment assistance but I realise it will not do very much to enable people to keep body and soul together.  I welcome the increase of 7 per cent in respect of children's allowances.  I wonder whether Government will tackle seriously the whole question of helping families so that it will be seen clearly that the State recognises its duty and responsibility. We read a lot about broken homes and broken marriages.  We read about the loud mouths who are advocating divorce as a means of dealing with the <Col N="2258" /> problem.  The matter could be dealt with properly if we had the proper children's allowances and family allowances.</P>
    <P>In this debate there have been references to the way mothers of families have been treated.  The mother is the principal teacher in the home.  Not alone is she the cook and the dietitian but she is also the teacher.  I am satisfied that mothers must get special recognition and allowance because of the importance of their duties in the family.</P>
    <P>From time to time we hear and we read letters in the papers arguing that wives should not be working while their husbands are in permanent, gainful employment. I know from personal experience meeting constituents that it is not possible for married people, particularly for young married people, to meet their overheads because of the heavy cost today of running a home.  Indeed I am alarmed at the extraordinary repayments these people have to meet by way of mortgages.  It is economic circumstances which drive these people out to work. They are not going out because they want to leave their homes and their families. It is because they must work in order to keep their heads above water.  I trust the Government will look at this whole situation in a more sympathetic manner.</P>
    <P>I welcome this supplementary family allowance.  I admit it only scratches the surface when we remember that most families consist of four, five or six which means that with 35,000 families there are no fewer than 140,000 mouths ready to devour the benefits of this supplementary allowance.  I admit this is a step in the right direction but, as I say, there is a long way to go.</P>
    <P>In regard to the small farmers and the payment of unemployment assistance it is wrong that small farmers should be cut off without being told the reason why.  I know numerous small farmers where the welfare officers decided their incomes were sufficient and therefore they should not be in receipt of small farmers unemployment assistance.  I would be glad if the Minister would ensure the introduction of a new regulation whereby every small farmer who is cut off will be given the reason why and shown from whence <Col N="2259" /> his invisible income comes.  The present situation is all wrong and I would impress upon the Minister and the Civil Service heads of his Department that they should change the system forthwith.  In every case where a small farmer's allowance is cut off or drastically reduced he should be given a note advising him of the source whereby the social welfare officer arrived at his income.  I certainly could not find it and the applicant could not find it.  The present situation is all wrong.</P>
    <P>I hope we will see the day when there will be comprehensive legislation dealing with the whole question of the family. Top priority of any Government should be job creation.  The OECD countries have been asked by the economic section of that body to give a lead in the provision of employment.  I would appeal to the Government to leave aside other problems, grave though they may be, and tackle the problem of unemployment and job creation.  That is the target towards which all our energies should be directed. That is what will give our young people something to live for and some hope for the future.</P>
    <P>There are other problems but we could face disaster if the problem of unemployment is not tackled.  We need comprehensive legislation to provide adequately and fully for every child.  The State has a duty to look after its citizens and I trust because of that all those involved will deal with this matter as a top priority.  I would have liked the allowances to be greater to offset inflation but I suppose we must be grateful for small mercies.</P>

      <P>What is causing most of the problems which have been adverted to by earlier speakers is the decision on the PLV taken in the court and now being implemented by the Department of Social Welfare.  In my constituency as in other constituencies the position now is that most of those in receipt of smallholders' assistance have either had that assistance totally withdrawn or reduced.  In most instances these cases are under appeal and one only has to look at the Order Paper to realise the particular difficulties most Deputies are encountering in their daily work within their constituencies.  I believe sufficient training is not given to social welfare officers who have to go out and assess the income or earnings of a small holder. Is there any proposal within the Department to provide some kind of formal or informal training for these social welfare officers who are now asked to do something they did not have to do before?  It is not fair to ask an ordinary lay person who does not for the most part have a particular interest in farming or might not be able to assess farm incomes to go out and assess them now in relation to small holders' assistance and so I would like to encourage some kind of training for those social welfare officers involved in this work.</P>
      <P>In most cases hitherto where small holders' assistance or indeed assistance of any kind was withdrawn the person affected could have recourse to the local health board for supplementary welfare allowance.  In most instances in my constituency where applicants apply for the supplementary welfare allowance I believe there is some type of automatic exchange between the welfare officer and the social welfare officer and where there is a doubt on the part of the social welfare officer that the person may be working or the case is under appeal, there is a suggestion now that the supplementary welfare allowance should not be granted. That is wrong.  It is something which should be looked at and some proper system should be devised as between the Department and the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2261" /> I am totally opposed to the system that operates where young people in particular, and they form the largest number of our unemployed, have to go to a central location to sign on.  I am talking about the large urban areas.  Those of us who were involved in the recent by-election in Dublin Central saw the atrocious conditions at the two central offices, atrocious conditions not just for those signing on but also for the employees of the Department. There is something wrong in asking a young person to join a long queue for several hours on so many days a week either to sign on or to collect his or her money.  There we have a perfect situation for either an illegal organisation or for drug pushers, about whom we hear so much, to take advantage of, and we should not encourage that.  The indications are that crime is increasing in the larger urban areas and I think the system of signing on for social welfare has a great deal to do with that.</P>
    <P>With regard to married women, I was glad to hear so many of my male colleagues express their particular concern about women.  It is unfortunate in a speech which took up 20 pages of foolscap this morning that all the Minister was able to tell us in relation to the EEC directive, which is supposed to come into operation this year, was in six-and-a-half lines.  When he spoke about that he said:</P>
    <P>The second development relates to the introduction of measures necessary to ensure equality of treatment between men and women in the social welfare code within the terms of the EEC directive on this matter.  I intend to bring legislation on this issue before the House later this year with a view to having the necessary provisions implemented before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>When asked in a Parliamentary Question on Thursday, 17 November last, the cost involved in doing this the Minister mentioned a cost of £15 million in a full year. He made a very interesting observation when he stated that the cost involved would depend on the time within which this directive was implemented and there <Col N="2262" /> would not necessarily be a cost of £15 if it did not include the full year of 1984.  It appears to me now from the Minister's speech this morning that there is some suggestion that perhaps the directive may not be implemented until the very last day, 31 December next, and once again we will be dragged before the EEC Commission for being in contravention of the implementation of the directive.  This is something we should avoid at all costs.</P>
    <P>In relation to married women I have a similar situation in my constitutency to that of Deputy Tunney.  It is unfortunate because a women is married, has a child and decides after a period of six months or a year to sign on the register again and look for employment that she is not considered for employment.  I have several cases which I have taken up with the Minister and his predecessor where evidence has been produced from employers, prospective employers, and where the people involved are registered with Manpower and when a women applies for social welfare, because she is married and has a number of children or even one child at home, she is not considered available for work.  That is a scandal.  I hope the Minister of State and the Minister are looking at this.  We all have situations like this &mdash; I am sure the Minister of State has them in his constituency &mdash; where many married women are very anxious to go back to work after a number of years at home but they are not considered for unemployment benefit because they are not available for work.</P>
    <P>I raised the maternity allowance in a Parliamentary Question and when the Estimate for Social Welfare was being discussed.  I want to refer to those mothers who consciously decide to nurse their babies.  Most of them decide to do that for a period of six months or some other period and after the relevant number of weeks is up for their maternity allowance they go to sign on for unemployment benefit.  We know that, in order to qualify for unemployment benefit or assistance, one has to be available and actively seeking work.  While these mothers are available for work they cannot take up work by reason of their circumstances because the facilities to look <Col N="2263" /> after babies, creches and day care facilities, are not available.  The Department of Social Welfare, despite this, will state that the person is not entitled to unemployment benefit when the maternity allowance or benefit runs out.  I asked the Minister of State and the Minister on two previous occasions to look at this.  The Department of Health and other Departments have encouraged mothers to nurse their babies but when they do this they are penalised.  I would like to ask the Minister of State at present in the House to pass this on to the Department of Social Welfare to have it looked at now.</P>
    <P>With regard to the processing of claims for various social welfare benefits, all of us find within our constituencies that the branch managers do not have enough control over the destiny of the applicants in their particular areas.  Deputy Flanagan made a very telling point when he described the situation in his constituency. The situation is rather similar in mine as well as in everybody else's constituency. I am not just critical of the officials in the Department of Social Welfare. I am more critical of those who manage the Department, the Ministers in particular, when I say that there is more concentration within the Department on control rather than on the provision of services.  There should be far more emphasis on the provision of a good service for all the people who badly need a service from social welfare rather than on control.  When a person applies for social welfare benefit there should be some system of automatic payment and then a check system which would balance at the end of one month or two months. You would then very quickly get rid of the abuses that take place within the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>I want to talk about unemployment assistance levels because I raised this matter before in the House.  The board and lodging element bugs me because I feel it is an insult, when young people who live at home with their fathers and mothers and cannot get a job, sign on, to offer them 30p a week, as has happened in the case of a number of people I have got on to the Department about or £1 as <Col N="2264" /> has happened in several instances in my constituency.  It is an insult to able bodied young people who are actively seeking a job but who because of the huge unemployment levels cannot get one, because those young people are living at home with their parents, to judge that they are only entitled to 30p or £1 a week.</P>
    <P>I want to talk about the whole question of abuses of the system, because it keeps coming up at political meetings and public meetings and we are told about the huge abuses of the system.  When you ask people to produce evidence they very often cannot do so.  I do not believe there are huge abuses of the system.  I believe only a minority of people abuse the system. There should be a flying squad within the Department to cater for that particular event.  I feel very strongly that the maintenance of jobs at the present time is more important than the provision of new jobs.  In local authorities, in particular, where we have huge redundancies many of them along the western seaboard, there should be some system of a transfer of resources from the Department of Social Welfare to other Departments, in this instance the Department of the Environment, to avoid that.</P>
    <P>I was told in a letter from the Minister for Finance a few weeks ago that this could not be considered under any circumstances because it would put the whole financial arrangements of the Government and the State into chaos and there would have to be extensive legislation to deal with the transfer of resources.  Strangely enough, a week later I was told at a deputation with the Minister for Labour that the Government had set up a sub-committee of the Cabinet to examine the transfer of resources. I find it difficult to understand how the Minister in charge of our finances tells me one thing in a letter and his colleague who, presumably sits at the same Cabinet table, tells me the opposite a week later. I wonder if there is a Cabinet sub-committee in existence.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us what stage it has reached in its deliberations.</P>
    <P>Children's allowances in every budget come up for scrutiny and attack at budget time.  I would like to remind the Minister <Col N="2265" /> that the Women's Rights Committee of which I am chairman, made a recommendation that the established system for the payment of children's allowances should not be interfered with until the committee had time to examine the whole system of the transfer of payments to women in the home and perhaps recommend a better system.  I hope the Minister will keep that in mind when he comes to deliberate the budget provisions for next year.  The payment of children's allowances is the only direct payment made to women in the home so we should encourage the greatest possible amount of an increase in children's allowances.  I could not accept Deputy Flanagan's suggestion that even small increases are acceptable in this day and age.  I read with a certain amount of amusement the Minister's comment when he said that when this Government came into office they gave a firm commitment, despite the gravity of the recession and its impact on social welfare expenditure, to endeavour to maintain the living standards of people who depend on social welfare.  There is a lot of that kind of talk in various places in the Minister's speech.  This tends to give rise to a philosophy within the Government that if you say the right thing often enough people begin to believe you are doing it.  In actual fact what is happening in this Bill is that the Minister is saying the right thing but he is going on to do what he feels like doing. That is not particularly effective or acceptable.</P>
    <P>The disability benefit is the last point I will have time to make.  I agree very strongly with the previous speaker in relation to the position of the medical referee.  We all have experience of the local GP of the individual who is in receipt of disability benefit or sickness benefit, recommending that the person is unfit for work and the consultant the person is attending in the hospital recommends that the person is unfit for work but a medical referee can come from Dublin and say; &ldquo;I am sorry I do not accept the advice of the consultant and I am saying you are available for work and can no longer draw disability benefit.&rdquo; What kind of medical training have the <Col N="2266" /> medical referees?  The Minister might let us know if he has any proposals relating to training.  Are medical referees sufficiently trained to say: &ldquo;I cannot accept the clinical evidence of the consultant or orthopaedic surgeon&rdquo;?  The decision made by a doctor or consultant regarding the disability of a person should be accepted by the medical referees in the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I have spoken about the EEC directive on equality.  I wonder if we will have a special sitting during the Easter recess to bring that in.  I hope we will not.  When the Minister said it would come in shortly I hope he means right now.  It is important that this directive is implemented immediately. We agree that the family income supplement is good but I object to the statment made by the Minister that it will be payable to the principal wage earner in the family.  We have often spoken about the head of the household and the principal wage earner.  I hope we are not going back to that Stone Age where the principal wage earner was taken to mean the male.  If it is a family income supplement, let us pay it to the family and not differentiate between husband and wife.</P>
    <P>There are many other areas I should like to have spoken on.  I hope the Minister will take the points I have made into consideration and that on Committee Stage we can have an opportunity to discuss them in detail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's approach to the problems confronting the aged, unemployed and the less well-off sections of society.  He has shown by his commitment to this section of the community his understanding of the many problems which exist in our society.  The introduction of the new family income supplement is a step in the right direction. The scheme is designed to maintain an incentive to work by providing cash support for workers with families who are in receipt of low incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A married worker with three children earning £85 per week will get a supplement of £10 per week and a married worker with four children will get a supplement of £13.75 per week.  The supplements will not be subject to income tax <Col N="2267" /> or pay-related social insurance contributions. It is gratifying to note that there are 35,000 families who will benefit from the scheme.  I know that it is only 10 per cent this year; but, as economic recovery progresses, perhaps the Minister will increase it to 50 per cent next year and, if possible, 75 per cent the following year. It is an incentive to people to keep their jobs and not rely on unemployment assistance to rear their families.</P>
    <P>I welcome the change in the means test in section 9 of the Bill which provides for a change in the rules in assessing incomes for social assistance purposes.  In the case of leased land, it is gratifying to note that the Minister has made arrangements whereby the means of the lessor will be calculated not by reference to the capital value of the holding but on the basis of the profits from the lease.  This is a worthwhile change as far as applicants for the old age pension are concerned.  I was always of the opinion that the capital value of the holding should not be taken into consideration.  The only item that should be taken into consideration is the amount of money received from renting the farm.</P>
    <P>As regards unemployment assistance for small farmers along the western seaboard from Cork to Donegal, it is clear that many anomalies exist.  I am not happy with the way revision of incomes is carried out.  We all know what led to this situation.  It was the decision of the High Court to uphold an application brought before it that the land valuation system was unconstitutional.  There was no alternative but to have a factual assessment of the income of those drawing unemployment assistance.  I dislike the system of investigation carried out by social welfare officers, who more often than not appear out of the blue at the farmer's yard in a chauffeur driven car without prior notice and instantly proceed to investigate his income without giving him a chance to outline his full expenditure.  The Department of Social Welfare should forward guidelines together with a form at least two weeks before an investigating officer calls on him.  On one side of the form he could <Col N="2268" /> fill in particulars of his income and on the other side particulars of his expenditure. Surely this is not too much to ask of the Department.</P>
    <P>It is only right that small farmers who are being deprived of unemployment assistance, particularly along the western seaboard, should have an opportunity to put the facts before an investigating officer before a decision is made.  I have often seen investigating officers arriving at a farmer's door and asking there and then for a record of what money he has received from the creamery.  Many of those officers do not explain that the farmer could claim for many other things. Electricity costs and the cost of running a motor car should be taken into account because if a farmer wants to call a veterinarian late at night he may have to drive three or five miles to the nearest telephone.  All these matters should be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Social welfare officers should be more flexible as far as the small farmer is concerned. A revamping of the appeals forms is also necessary.  The present appeals form a farmer gets when he is disqualified from unemployment assistance is no bigger than an ordinary envelope. This is disgraceful.  Farmers with uneconomic holdings cannot be expected to live on fresh air and cold water.  They are the basic fabric of our society along the western seaboard.  They must be given a chance to rear their families.  They have contributed to preserving life in rural areas.  Our towns and villages would no longer exist if these families were not there.  Successive Governments should have ensured that every assistance was given to the people in the west.</P>
    <P>Anomalies exist in determining eligibility for non-contributory old age pensions. Take a farmer with one son and two daughters.  He can legally transfer his holding to his son, but if he wishes to give his daughters a couple of thousand pounds each to go towards the purchase of a home, he cannot do that under the present old-age pension regulations.  This is discrimination.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay a tribute to the members of old age pension committees who gave their time free to the Department. <Col N="2269" /> They deserve the highest praise, but these committees have outlived their usefulness.  Most of their decisions were overruled by the investigating and appeals officers.</P>
    <P>Claimants for unemployment benefit should be treated with more flexibility.  If they are registered with Manpower and can provide proof to the investigating officer that they cannot get suitable employment, they should be considered for unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>As regards redundancy payments, is the incentive too great to close firms and pay vast sums of redundancy money to workers?  What incentive is there to work if people can foresee a golden handshake of £30,000 or £40,000 if their firm closes? If redundancy money was not available perhaps fewer firms would close.</P>
    <P>Many married women with their children have to vacate their homes through no fault of their own &mdash; perhaps on cruelty grounds.  Those women should be entitled to the deserted wife's allowance and their cases should be treated sympathetically, provided they can prove they cannot live in the family home on hardship grounds.</P>
    <P>I would like to see more decentralisation of power from Dublin to regional centres such as Cork, Waterford, Limerick, Galway and Letterkenny. Head offices in those areas should decide on applications for social welfare benefits of all descriptions.  It should not be necessary to send these applications to Dublin where there may be 500,000 claims being processed.  I hope the Minister will bear these points in mind.  I will be looking forward to hearing what he has to say to my suggestions on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMorley" hpid="Mr. Morley Mr. Morley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morley</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the commitment the parties in Government gave to the social welfare section of the community that they would maintain their living standards despite any impact the recession would have on the economy, the increases in allowances and benefits provided in this Bill are meagre.  Because they are increases, however small, I am sure they will be welcomed.  I welcome them and the introduction of the family <Col N="2270" /> income supplement.  I also welcome section 8, which provides for the payment of pay-related and unemployment benefit in a lump sum to a person accepted in the enterprise allowance scheme.  The limit set on the number of people who would be accepted under this scheme had to be raised because the number applying had exceeded the original limit by three times.  I regard this as a step in the right direction because it should assist people to become self-employed and so ease the burden on the taxpayers.</P>
      <P>I want to refer now to the small farmers' dole because a serious injustice has been done to that section of the community over the last year.  This scheme has come in for a lot of ill-informed criticism. A farmer trying to raise a family on ten or 12 acres of often questionable quality land could not succeed without some assistance or off-farm employment. This scheme was introduced in the thirties but in the fifties a notional assessment was introduced.  The thinking behind that was much the same as the thinking behind the employment incentive scheme.  It allowed the smallholder to put his land into full production without the fear that the stable element in his income &mdash; the unemployment assistance &mdash; would be interfered with.  The notional system provides for the assessment of his income on his PLV multiplied by a certain multiple. Because of the court decision the payment of this allowance was no longer possible, or so the Government said, but I do not think anything in that decision compelled the Government to abandon the notional system.  While it referred to the collection of taxes, it did not say the PLV could not be used as a rough guideline for the disbursement of benefits or allowances.  Even if this had to be done, there was no need to proceed immediately and have the re-assessment carried out with such haste.</P>
      <P>Last year the Minister said that the process of re-assessment would be carried out on a gradual basis as cases came up in the normal way for re-investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We heard recently in reply to a question that 4,000 farmers were reassessed in a six-month period, whereas the original <Col N="2271" /> intention was that the 14,000 farmers receiving that benefit would be assessed over a three-year period.  In order to have this reassessment carried out a large number of extra personnel were drafted into the disadvantaged areas where there are by far the greatest number of recipients. Under pressure from the Government and the Minister these officers had to mount an all-out drive to have all claims reviewed in the shortest possible time.  I believe a grave injustice was done due to the rush with which all claims had to be factually assessed.  The rush did not allow sufficient attention to be given in many cases to the total circumstances of the claimant and his family and sufficient time was not given to the farmer to prepare his case and provide ample documentation in support of his claims for overheads and expenses.  In many cases a deaf ear was turned to what should be regarded as quite legitimate expenses.</P>
    <P>I know of no claims that were increased following reassessment and the vast majority of people reassessed faced drastic reductions in their weekly allowance while many had the allowance withdrawn altogether.  That was very harsh treatment by the Government of this section and totally unwarranted.  So embarrassed by the ruthlessness of the procedure were the spokesmen of one of the Government parties in my constituency that they were driven to distraction to explain and justify it to their own supporters. I literally mean they were driven to distraction because this is the only way I could account for the assertion by Senator Higgins that all the social welfare officers in County Mayo were Fianna Fáil agents determined to undermine the Government by embarking on an all-out drive to deprive the small farm community in Mayo of their unemployment assistance.  Never was such an outlandish explanation given for any procedure or occurrence since Nero blamed the Christians for burning Rome.</P>
    <P>The small farmers of Mayo and elsewhere are not imbeciles and they know well that the officers in question were only carrying out their job and <Col N="2272" /> doing their duty on the instructions of their superiors.  They were acting on the orders of the Minister and the Government and it is this Government who are responsible for drastic dole cuts and the withdrawal of dole during the past year. This was done because of the interpretation of the court decision, the Government interpreting it as prohibiting them from using the poor law valuation as a guideline for the payment of unemployment assistance.  Even if that were true, it was not necessary to proceed with such speed and severity in having this review carried out.  It could have been carried out in the normal way, as the Minister promised, as cases came up for review.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the necessity nowadays for more training of social welfare officers and I believe that should be done.  In many cases social welfare officers were drafted in from outside areas.  They were relatively inexperienced and many had no previous experience of dealing with the farming community.  Because of the pressure to have these reassessments carried out as speedily as possible they were not able to give the usual time and attention to all cases.</P>
    <P>I wish to make it perfectly clear that I am not making a case for condoning abuses of social welfare or small farmers' dole.  It has come in for a lot of ill-informed criticism.  One of those criticisms was that people were receiving assistance who were not entitled to it.  If they did not need it, it was up to the Minister to bring in new regulations and to reclassify those who would be entitled to it.  It was also claimed that people were abusing the system and claiming assistance under false pretences.  If this were the case there should have been a tightening of the regulations to enable social welfare officers to tackle these abuses.</P>
    <P>Many thousands of families along the west coast and elsewhere are living on very small farms and trying to rear a family and they are patently entitled to social welfare benefit.  They are just as entitled to it as urban dwellers and are entitled to have their claims processed fairly, free from harassment and in a manner which allows them to retain their <Col N="2273" /> dignity and human respect.  This has not been happening since the abolition of the notional system of assessment.  I am asking the Minister to ensure that this principle will be adhered to in the carrying out of assessments and reassessments of applicants for small farmers' dole.  Secondly, reasonable expenses should be allowed in all cases.  Thirdly, applicants should be informed by the Department of expenses which will be allowable. Fourthly, an allowance should be made for family educational expenses due to the escalation of these expenses in recent times, particularly in rural areas with transport costs etc.  Fifthly, applicants' appeals against disallowance of unemployment assistance or dole should be dealt with in a reasonable time, say within a month.  Lastly, applicants should be furnished with copies of a social welfare officer's assessment which would influence the decision on a claim.  I look to the Minister to have these things done.  This section of the community is as entitled to even-handed treatment as any other section. There are many families who require small farmers' dole and they should be allowed to claim it without any loss of human respect or dignity.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the old age pension committees.  Time has overtaken them but they have served their country and their communities well, as have the secretaries who worked with them over the years.  They put a human face on social welfare legislation in its introductory years.  Reference has been made to the necessity for the decentralisation of the Department of Social Welfare and I totally agree.  If we had a little more decentralisation of control and authority as well as of offices, without necessarily resurrecting committees, we would perhaps succeed in putting a more human face on social welfare legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot think of any other Estimate that would have such effect on the lives of ordinary people than has the Social Welfare Estimate.  There is hardly a family who have not some business with this Department.  The Estimate for Social Welfare for this year is more than £2,000 million.  So, whether <Col N="2274" /> one is a social welfare recipient or a contributor to the Exchequer, one will be interested in some way in this Estimate and in this Bill.</P>
      <P>There has been much reference of late to abuses of the social welfare system.  In common with other Members of the House I would not tolerate any abuse of the system.  But if there are such abuses one might remark that at least the money being received in this way is not being lost to the Exchequer but is being invested in the economy again, because the people concerned use the money to buy goods and services.  There are far more serious abuses in other sectors than is the case in respect of social welfare. Very often, for instance, when taxes are evaded the money involved is taken out of the economy and invested abroad.  At least money that may be got wrongfully from the Department of Social Welfare will be spent within the economy and may even help to provide jobs.</P>
      <P>We are living in difficult times but the Bill makes adequate provision for social welfare recipients.  The increase in payments this year is 7 per cent and, taking this with the 10 per cent increase which was paid from June last year and the 5 per cent increase that was paid from October, social welfare payments are just about keeping pace with inflation.  Of course we would all like to have a situation in which more could be paid to those who depend on social welfare, but when times are better and when the economy is on the upturn we should be able to improve the lot of these people.  We as elected representatives find that the greatest proportion of problems we are asked to deal with in our constituencies relate to social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to decentralisation.  I should like to see a situation in which there would be social welfare advice centres throughout the country which would be staffed by people who were thoroughly briefed in the whole area of social welfare.  I am not suggesting that we could afford to provide such an office in every parish but perhaps we could have one to every few parishes.  In this way people seeking information as to pensions, children's allowances, unemployment <Col N="2275" /> benefits or any other benefits could receive locally all the information they require.  People are not aware of their rights and do not know how to go about ascertaining what they are.  A person who has a query will go to one office where he will get only limited information. He may then go to another office and eventually he will go to his public representative in an effort to have the problem sorted out.</P>
    <P>Another problem that we come across frequently is that of delays in social welfare payments.  It is not unusual for a person to have to wait for up to six or even nine months from the time of applying for an old age pension to the time benefit eventually comes through.  I am asking the Minister to consider this aspect with a view to ascertaining if anything can be done to speed up the process.  I note that the old age pension committees are being discontinued.  These committees, which were established first more than 70 years ago, have played an important role in the community but I agree with the Minister when he says that in some cases they cause delays to occur.  I hope that the change will help to speed up payment of old age pensions and other benefits.  We all know cases in which people coming off invalidity benefits or unemployment benefit have to wait a long time, perhaps up to three months, before unemployment assistance is paid. It is one of the frustrating aspects of the social welfare system that these delays occur.  The Minister should give his attention to trying to streamline the situation.</P>
    <P>All those who have spoken today have referred to the small farmers dole.  What is happening in this regard in the west of Ireland at present is of much concern to the recipients of this assistance.  We all appreciate that the Government has to act on foot of the decision of the Supreme Court, but nevertheless the factual assessment that is in progress is causing serious problems.  In the first instance, some of the social welfare officers who call on the farmers concerned do not understand life in the west.  A certain amount of training should be given to these people before they are sent out on this very sensitive work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2276" /> Secondly, when these officers go about the business of means testing they are inclined to concentrate on a farmer's income without having regard to his expenses.  I have had experience of many small farmers and of people whose holdings are so small that they could not be called farmers at all coming to me complaining that their unemployment assistance had been reduced by perhaps £6 or even up to £10.  Some of those people may have no more than a cow and a calf. People here have talked of small farmers whose holdings are ten, 20 or 30 acres. But in south-west Donegal in Gweedore, Glencolumbkille, The Rosses, for instance, there are people with holdings of less than ten acres, in some cases of only four or five acres, people I would refer to as crofters rather than farmers. I appeal to the Minister to have a rethink about the re-assessment that is taking place.  When a smallholder receives notification of whether his assistance is being reduced or increased as the case may be, he should be supplied also with a breakdown of the figures so that he may know how the social welfare officer arrived at his decision.  When we as public representatives are approached by people whose incomes are being reduced we do not know where to start.  There is no explanation of the figure that was arrived at.</P>
    <P>Another change I should like to see being made is that there be provision for a proper form of appeal.  The present situation is that when a farmer wishes to appeal against the decision of the social welfare officer he is provided with a very small slip of paper on which to make his appeal.  They should be given guidelines and a standard form on which there is space for filling in details of income and other expenditure.  Another factor about the appeals is that they can take anything up to six months before being finalised. Such delays can cause much hardship to a farmer who is without income for that time.</P>
    <P>I do not think that this measure was introduced in order to save money.  I understand that only about £1 million has been saved as a result of the re-assessment process that was begun on foot of <Col N="2277" /> the Supreme Court decision.  There are easier ways of saving money.</P>
    <P>There are a number of measures in the Bill that I welcome &mdash; for instance, the family income supplement, the enterprise allowance scheme and the extension of the free phone rental to people who may have someone up to 15 years of age living with them.  However, I appeal to the Minister to have regard to the assessment that is taking place in the context of the hardship that is being caused, especially to smallholders in the west.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on this Bill.  We are discussing this Bill against a background of very serious unemployment and serious deprivation in many of our large urban centres.  We have over 200,000 people unemployed and over 60,000 of them are under the age of 25 years.  It is very understandable that the interest in and commitment to the Bill is considerable. Many people are unemployed through no fault of their own.  They have to fall back on the social welfare system.  About 12 months ago when the social welfare measures were going through the House there were considerable objections to the many curtailments in the social welfare code.  It cannot be said that things have improved in the intervening 12 months. If anything they have got progressively worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must try to identify the areas where changes are needed.  Youth unemployment is a very serious problem.  There was a huge investment in education by the State and by the parents of the young people whose prospects of securing employment are virtually nil.  That is very sad for the country and for the economy. It is very sad for the parents and for the young people.  They are frustrated.  They have little or no money in their pockets and they have absolutely no prospect of getting a job.  I do not pretend that measures can be introduced which will provide an overnight solution.  We must look at the areas in our economy where employment can be created.  The skills and work talents of our young people have been <Col N="2278" /> developed in our educational institutions.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we have an across the board increase of 7 per cent which is inadequate given the cost of living and our rate of inflation.  The Minister must realise that for many families the only income coming into the home is unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance or the supplementary welfare allowance from the health board.  We all realise the calls there are on that money.  These incomes are inadequate with the result that the standard of living of many families has dropped.</P>
    <P>The concept of land leasing has been floating around for some time.  There is a belief that a great deal of agricultural land is not being put to proper use, or utilised to the maximum.  It is very hard to argue against that contention.  I subscribe to that view myself.  The role of the Minister in introducing measures to encourage land leasing will be crucial. The ownership of land is very dear to the people of Ireland and to many small farmers whether they live in congested areas or in more developed agricultural areas.</P>
    <P>The concept of the ownership of land is very dear to the people of Ireland and it is very difficult to convince them that it is for their own betterment and the betterment of the nation to make land available by way of lease to enable others to enlarge their holdings and make the land more productive.  The Minister will have to give very careful consideration to the type of measures we will have to implement in this area to make land leasing stick.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the level of PRSI which employers and employees have to bear.  This has now reached 20 per cent.  It is a positive disincentive to employers to think in terms of job creation. I ask the Minister to consider the possibility of abolishing PRSI under a certain income level.  In this Social Welfare Bill we have the new family income supplement.  It may well be that, on the one hand, families are paying PRSI and, on the other hand, are in receipt of a family income supplement to keep the wolf from the back door.  This involves <Col N="2279" /> duplication of administration.  I hope the Minister will have a look at this matter. The rate of PRSI is a positive disincentive to the creation of jobs which are sorely needed by our young people.</P>
    <P>I have had a number of complaints recently from people about correspondence with the Department of Social Welfare. Prior to this they could send their medical certificates, and so on, to the Department, but they now have to stamp the envelopes.  That facility which was provided in the past should be retained. It is unfortunate that because An Post have taken over responsibility for the postal service this facility should be discontinued.</P>
    <P>The free fuel scheme was one of the most worthwhile social welfare schemes ever introduced.  It was very useful and very beneficial to many people on confined incomes.  There has been a change in the operation of the scheme and people on unemployment benefit, disability benefit and unemployment assistance have been excluded.  That was very unfortunate. If the scheme is to be continued next year I hope the Minister will include those categories again.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that all Members who contributed to the debate dealt with small farmers' dole.  The changes that have arisen because of the abolition of the PLV, and the new method of assessment, have been the cause of great distress and anxiety among many people. To many people living on small holdings in the west, or in counties Donegal, Monaghan or Cavan, the farmers' dole was the equivalent of an economic lifeline. Income from their farms has been inadequate to maintain themselves and their families.  I am aware of many cases where the dole has been very useful. There has been a restriction on the amount that they have got and that is unfortunate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The first issue I should like to deal with is the value of increases in weekly rates of payments relative to the cost of living.  I should like to make a general point here.  The 7 per cent <Col N="2280" /> increase in rates this year, and especially the 8 per cent increase in rates for the long-term unemployed, will at least compensate for the expected rate of price increase between mid-1984 and mid-1985. It will be a very limited degree of compensation; but I should like to point out that the 10 per cent increase in short-term rates in June 1983, together with the 12 per cent for long-term pensioners and the further 5 per cent last October for the long-term unemployed, should by and large maintain the real value of payments between mid-1983 and mid-1984.  However, I am under no illusions about the extent of the increase agreed in the budget by the Government. Far be it from me to suggest that it is over-generous in any respect.</P>
      <P>The long-term unemployed have been particularly supported over the last 12 months, receiving an aggregate 13½ per cent increase since June 1983.</P>
      <P>The 25 per cent increase given in 1982 was at a time when inflation was over twice the current level.  In addition, the increase in children's allowance in 1982 was largely offset by a decrease of £95 in the child tax allowance from April 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon raised questions in regard to the administration of the Family Income Supplement scheme and expressed concern that the scheme could be administratively complicated.  I should like to point out that the proposed scheme will be administered centrally by the Department of Social Welfare.  Fully completed and properly documented applications for family income supplement accompanied by the necessary documents of verification, such as an employer's statement of recent earnings and numbers of hours normally worked per week, will be admitted to payment without the necessity for investigation by a social welfare officer.  Subject to staff availability a percentage of all claims in payment will be spot-checked.  Investigations by social welfare officers will include inquiries to ensure that there is no collusion between employees and employers on such matters as maintaining wages at an artifically low level and depending on FIS for topping-up purposes. The emphasis will be on keeping <Col N="2281" /> the scheme administratively simple subject to the need for adequate documentation in relation to claims.</P>
    <P>All FIS claims will be noted on the central record of PRSI insurance, now on computer, so that the Department will be aware of claims to disability benefit or unemployment benefit made by an FIS recipient.  It is intended that payments of the supplement will be made on similar lines as those for long-term social welfare payments, namely, by means of order books encashable weekly at post offices. Small amounts of family income supplement may be payable at less frequent intervals.  The payment arrangements will be determined by regulations which will be brought before the House in due course.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon asked why the self-employed are not included in the FIS scheme.  I should like to point out that the supplement will be confined to employees in the active labour force. Self-employed persons are not included in the scheme.  As the self-employed are not entitled to disability or unemployment benefits they are not affected by the disincentive aspect of benefit rates payable to persons with family dependants. Accordingly they are not affected by one of the main objectives of the FIS scheme. Their inclusion would also pose major problems in establishing their eligibility, including quantifying their means and hours of work.  In the case of an employed person an employer's statement can verify earnings and number of hours worked but there is no such independent evidence in the case of the self-employed. Verifying these, particular hours of work, would be difficult.  Constant investigation by social welfare officers would be necessary, a process which would be complicated and would be administratively expensive involving in particular heavy additional staffing requirements.  In any event, the self-employed, many of whom are farmers, who are on low incomes and not fully occupied may be eligible for unemployment assistance.  Such persons could if the scheme were available to them claim the supplement or unemployment assistance, whichever suited them, <Col N="2282" /> by stating they were fully occupied or on the other hand available for employment.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon understandably asked why part-time workers are not included in the scheme.  The scheme applies to persons &ldquo;engaged in remunerative full-time employment&rdquo;.  The circumstances in which a person will be regarded as being in full-time employment will be defined in the regulations I propose to make.  At present for the purposes of supplementary welfare allowance, full-time employment is taken to be employment lasting more than 30 hours and a person working more than 30 hours would normally not be entitled to supplementary welfare allowance.  It is envisaged that the FIS would apply to persons working more than 30 hours a week.  It is important that the scheme is not open to abuse by persons taking up casual employment for the purpose of qualifying for the supplement.</P>
    <P>I have also been asked why the FIS is not payable to a wife.  The FIS is intended basically as a supplement to earnings and as such the Bill provides that it is payable to whichever member of the family is employed at the time of the claim.  Part of the pressure for the introduction of the scheme related to persons who may be perceived to be in the poverty trap, a definition which is extremely difficult for any of us to define.  From that point of view it is considered reasonable that the supplement should be payable to the person concerned and in that context it is paid to the employed person and not exclusively paid to either spouse as such.</P>
    <P>The levels of income up to which FIS will be paid are £95 in the case of a one-child family, increasing by £15 for each additional child up to and including the fifth child.  These levels of weekly income were chosen after having regard to the amounts of short-term social welfare benefits which will be payable from July next. At present under the social insurance system the amount received by a person while sick or unemployed by way of flat-rate and pay-related benefits are subject to certain limits.  For example, in the case of recipients of unemployment benefit who are wholly unemployed the combined total of flat-rate benefit and pay-related <Col N="2283" /> benefit and income tax refund, if received, may not exceed 85 per cent of the current average weekly earnings. These limits were designed to ensure that the level of payments available to claimants while ill or unemployed did not constitute a disincentive to work.  The limits do not, however, apply in the case when flat-rate benefit only is payable. This may occur particularly in the case of a man with a wife and children on a low income.  It is possible, therefore, for a family breadwinner with an income corresponding to the appropriate rate of flat-rate benefit to obtain more than 85 per cent of his current average net earnings while unemployed.  The FIS scheme is designed to top up low earnings with a view to reducing this problem as far as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputies Lemass and De Rossa asked whether single parent families would qualify for family income supplement. Under the scheme payments will be made to families where one or both parents is or are engaged in full-time employment. Accordingly, where a single parent such as a widow is working and the family income, including any social welfare pension, is within the limits of the scheme, that family will qualify for payments under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wyse proposed that two family income supplements should cover the situation of young people becoming unemployed and an unemployment assistance with high mortgage repayments to meet. This is certainly a big problem at the present time and community welfare officers of health boards are finding an increasing number of people applying to them for assistance in this type of situation. It would not be possible to provide for this type of situation in the context of the FIS scheme and any special measures introduced to deal with it are likely to be very costly.  It is relatively easy to identify problems but it is a different matter to devise equitable and effective solutions to these problems within the constraints of available resources.</P>
    <P>The question of unemployment assistance for young people going on educational courses was raised and Deputy <Col N="2284" /> Wyse refered to this.  One of the conditions for unemployment assistance is that a person must be available for and genuinely seeking work.  This condition presents difficulty where people go on educational courses.  No doubt all sides would agree that full-time students should not be entitled in the normal course to unemployment assistance. Nowadays, of course, there is a great proliferation of educational courses, part-time and otherwise, and it would not be possible to set down general rules which would be applicable in all cases. Each case has to be examined on its merits but, generally speaking, if participation in the particular educational course in question would be consistent with the fulfilling of the availability condition and did not effectively prevent an unemployed person from fulfilling this condition, it would be possible for the person concerned to retain his entitlement to unemployment assistance.  In deciding on any case, the deciding officer would have regard to factors such as the duration of the course, the number of hours involved and so on.  Deputy Wyse can be assured that I am conscious of the need to give unemployed people as much opportunity as possible to use their time in a constructive manner, consistent with the fulfilment of the statutory conditions of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wyse also referred to involving the unemployed young people in community work, and in this connection measures were taken earlier this year to facilitate unemployed people taking up voluntary work with voluntary organisations and community groups.  Employment exchanges can advise unemployed young people on this matter.  I hope these measures will be effective in facilitating unemployed people, young and old, in taking up voluntary community work.</P>
    <P>On the question of assessment of means where land is leased, the purpose of the provision is to bring the assessment of means in the case of land which is leased into line with the assessment in the case of land which is let on a short-term basis such as the 11-month system.  The proposal was fully discussed with the Department of Agriculture and that <Col N="2285" /> Department are satisfied that the method of assessment now proposed will work to the advantage of persons leasing their land.  I am also satisfied that assessment on this basis of the profits is, in principle, more reasonable than assessment on the basis of capital value where leasing of land is concerned and I do not accept the need for an option of assessment on a capital value basis in this case.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon referred to the national fuel scheme.  When the national fuel scheme was introduced in 1980 the then Government provided that unemployment assistance recipients were not provided for in the scheme, which was intended to cater essentially for persons in receipt of long-term social welfare payments who are living alone.  The circular which issues to health boards before the start of the heating season is intended to outline to the health boards the general <Col N="2286" /> conditions of the scheme.  It must be explained, however, that the conditions of the scheme have not been changed since this Government took office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance demonstrated in the House last night that the Government are unaware of the seriousness of the unemployment problem in the country.  If he believes, as he claims, that there has been an easing in the unemployment trend since the Government took office, let me give him a few statistics which are authentic and <Col N="2289" /> completely contradict his claim.  The unemployment figure for November 1982 was 170,000; in February 1984 it was 216,000, an increase of approximately 26 per cent.  Within that figure the number for those under 25 in November 1982 was 50,000 and in February 1984 it was 68,000.  We have to add to this at least 20,000 additional young people who will join the workforce by the end of this June when examinations will have ended.  The statistical figures do not include announced closures such as Ford Motor Company, Youghal Carpet Yarns, Condons Concrete Works, Boland's Bakery tonight and others.  The unemployment figure for Munster at the end of February is about 61,000 or an increase of 25 per cent in the past year.  The figure for Cork county is 22,000, indicating a similar increase in the past year.  Notified redundancy figures reached a record level for 1983 of almost 30,000, an increase of about 4,000 on the previous year.  So much for easing the unemployment trend to which the Minister referred last night.</P>
      <P>The aforementioned figures are accurate and are from official records.  They belie the Minister's claim.  In order to solve a problem one must first be aware of its existence and its proportions.  The Government are obviously unaware of the seriousness of the problem and want to hear as little as possible about it.  If it was not for our motion neither the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism nor indeed any of their colleagues would be debating unemployment in the House this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must again stress that it is by far the most serious problem facing the country. Last week we failed to have the issue raised by Private Notice Question, we failed to get Government time to have it discussed and the only channel left open to us was its introduction in a Private Members' motion this week.  A limited debate of this nature is far from adequate to deal with this important subject, a subject which obviously the Government would wish to sweep under the carpet and the problem that is of the greatest concern to all our people, not only the young school leavers but all the added <Col N="2290" /> unemployed who are desperately seeking work at the present time.  What has happened to the oft mentioned National Development Corporation?  Has that been put to bed?  What has happened to the Government promises of the 1982 election campaign?  The only thing we now hear is the promised report of the planning board, the establishment of task forces, the employment of review committees. All these are no substitute for the creation of jobs and they are no substitute for establishing a climate where enterprise can flourish.</P>
    <P>The recent lay-off and short time working at Jacobs Biscuits has gone unnoticed by the Government and would not have been raised in the House without the efforts of my party colleagues last week. Surely this is the area where patriotism can play such a major part and where the Government should be out front leading a massive Buy Irish campaign, promoting the sale of Irish biscuits before foreign brands.  Greater encouragement must be given to small business enterprise, more venture capital must be made available, greater risk-taking must be encouraged and red tape must be cut.  The co-ordinating role is more necessary than ever before.</P>
    <P>Let me cite some recent cases where some high ESB charges can create difficulties in the creation of small new industry. The Government have an obligation to encourage greater co-ordination but they seem to step aside and concentrate on public relations exercises everytime unemployment is mentioned.  The role of unemployment in the Cork region continues unabated and it is hard to believe the sincerity of the Taoiseach's sentiments recently in that city because of the continued apparent lack of interest by his Ministers in vital projects affecting that region.  For a time there has not been a ferry link between Cork and the Welsh coast, a link which is vital to the economic life of the south-west region and is almost as traditional to Cork as the bells of Shandon. The efforts by ICL, Cork Harbour Commissioners, the authority responsible for the port of Swansea, Cork County Council and Cork Corporation have all been in vain because of the failure of the <Col N="2291" /> Minister for Communications to give certain guarantees that would have enabled the ferry to operate this summer.  The number directly employed in the tourist industry in Cork and in Kerry is 2,000. The industry was worth £130 million to the region last year.  The number of passengers carried by the ferry last year will now be lost to the region.  The blow to the employment situation is enormous.</P>
    <P>The uncertainty of the milk levy is placing more jobs in jeopardy and the neglect of the pig industry is severely hitting employment as well as agricultural incomes but yet the Government stand back and take no action.  The Government came to power with a list of promises which they have blatantly ignored. They have completely reneged on their commitments to the young people and no diversionary tactics by the Taoiseach or his handlers will sway the people's minds away from this failure.  Our people are entitled to the opportunity to work.  The Government must give leadership and must restore confidence and create a better development climate.  We demand that Fine Gael and Labour now put into action some of the proposals and promises we have been listening to for the past 18 months or, alternatively, step aside and hand over the reins of Government to somebody who will be concerned, to someone who would be interested in the future of the country.</P>
    <P>I understand I was refused permission to raise on the adjournment the discontinuation of the Cork ferry because it was not regarded as being the responsibility of the Minister.  I beg to differ.  The responsibility rests fairly and squarely on the shoulders of Deputy Mitchell who several weeks ago spoke out of turn and was criticised publicly by the chief executive of Irish Continental Lines for intending to make the ferry dearer &mdash; again mismanagement by a Minister.  He met representatives from Cork city and county to see what could be done to ensure that the ferry would operate.  The guarantees forthcoming were inadequate to allow the company to proceed with this link.  It is a disaster for the region and the Minister should be asked to resign.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2292" /> In Cork recently the Taoiseach indicated that his Government had a commitment to the region.  In the last 15 months there has not been any commitment. One would have thought, four weeks after his statements in Cork, that there might be a different attitude but Deputy Mitchell has just stood back. What efforts has the Minister for Foreign Affairs, a Minister from Cork who promised so much from these benches, made to save the ferry link?  What has he done about his promise to visit Detroit to stop Fords leaving Cork?  Does the Minister who is present in the House remember his comment that night on television when we appeared together?  He said his Government would ensure that Fords would not walk away from Ireland.  What progress has he or the Government made to ensure that Fords do not walk away from Cork?</P>

      <P>It is timely that we should have this debate on unemployment.  It gives an opportunity to reflect on the conclusions of the ESRI publication on employment and unemployment policy in Ireland and for a political input to be made to the debate before the National Planning Board produce their publication.  I was interested in Deputy Fitzgerald describing his efforts to have a debate of this kind.  It would be useful if we could have some discussion, perhaps not of a public nature, between Opposition and Government about how best to handle the report of the National Planning Board.  They will produce a report which will not reflect Government policy but rather their considered view about the economy.  It is important that people of varied political persuasions should be in a position to contribute to a discussion on how the challenge this information presents to politicians can best be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The solution to the unemployment problem depends on how well we can answer the following question: are the goods and services which the Irish work force have to offer on the world market more up to date, efficient and less expensive <Col N="2293" /> than those offered by our competitors? Unless we can answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to that question we will not solve the unemployment probelm.  If we believe we can create the conditions in which we can answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; we will solve the problem.</P>

      <P>The nature of work and what is demanded in the international market has changed considerably in recent years.  The traditional attitudes people had as to what constituted a job are no longer relevant.  Twenty years ago is was possible for people without any skills to obtain employment but as a result of the advance in technology such work can now be done by mechanical means or by the new information technology equipment which is replacing much of the traditional repetitive clerical work.  Unless people have skills and a high standard of education they have no chance of obtaining employment in the foreseeable future.</P>

      <P>It is a serious social injustice that so many people leave school without a formal qualification of any kind.  It is because of that that the Government have given such priority to the production of an action plan for education.  We recognise that the first step towards full employment is that people must have the necessary qualifictions. The statistical information produced by every reputable research institute which examined the problem of unemployment has shown that the more educational qualifications one has the better one's chances of obtaining employment. Rather than scoring points off one another in the House as some people are tempted to do tonight &mdash; I am surprised at the person in question&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The first piece of advice we would give to young people who wish to solve the problem of unemployment which faces them is that it is essential they get the most up-to-date education they can to enable them to compete efficiently in what is an increasingly competitive and knowledge-intensive job market. They should not leave school until they have achieved what they believe is the maximum of their educational capacity. If they left school earlier than they ought to, they should try to obtain some further education on a part-time basis.  It is through education and achieving a better standard of competence in the work force that people will have a better opportunity of obtaining employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the modern world no-one owes anyone a living.  No other country owes Ireland a living.  The Government do not owe any individual a living.  The only way <Col N="2295" /> people can make a living is if they can sell what they can do to someone who is prepared to pay for it.  The only way we can ensure that people are in that position is if they have adequate education.  The ESRI rightly pointed out that extending full-time education and raising the school leaving age to 16 rather than 15 is not sufficient to solve the problem.  We must look at opportunities for further part-time and second chance education.  We must use schools more intensively to allow adults to obtain a better standard of education if they did not achieve it while in school and provide educational opportunities for the unemployed.</P>
    <P>The most constructive thing the unemployed could do with their time is improve their educational qualifications. If they do that they have a much better chance of getting a job rather than sitting around waiting for a job in the previous type of activity in which they were engaged to re-emerge which it is unlikely to do in the present rapidly changing type of technological competition in which we are engaged.</P>
    <P>We have many advantages in this regard.  We have a younger and, generally speaking, more educated population than our competitors.  That is why we have obtained more of the United States investment than other competitive countries in Europe.  I had the pleasure of meeting a number of United States executives in the major electronic firms in California recently.  I think all the major firms were represented at a dinner I was invited to address in what is locally known as &ldquo;Silicon Valley&rdquo; near San Fransisco. I was seeking to encourage those industrialists to locate their industries in Ireland.  I told them that we had only a 10 per cent corporation profits tax, exceptionally generous capital allowances and a large European market available.</P>
    <P>I said these were the most important reasons why those industrialists should locate in Ireland.  The chairman of the proceedings, a leading figure in the world electronics industry, who has one of the most advanced industries we have in the this country, contradicted me.  He said in blunt terms that I was wrong, that these <Col N="2296" /> were not the most important things the Irish had to offer to United States or other investors.  He said the most important reason people from the electronics industry in the United States and people like him should invest in Ireland was that we had a more educated, younger and more adaptable workforce than any other country in which they might locate.  If we can build on that strength by eliminating the situation wherein one-quarter of such a potentially valuable workforce leave school without any educational qualifications, then we are laying the foundation for overcoming our unemployment problem.  We have many advantages to start with and if we can build on them we have the capacity for being a very strongly advancing country.</P>
    <P>As far as industry and employment are concerned, it is important to recognise that we have been successful in many ways.  Employment in manufacturing had been growing up to 1978.  Employment in manufacturing reached its peak in the United States in the early fifties and in Japan in the seventies, but has been declining ever since.  We have continued to grow in manufacturing output and employment, but unfortunately what is happening is that manufacturing alone is not capable of providing all the jobs. These new jobs are coming in the services sector.  If we are to survive, whether it be in services or manufacturing, we must be prepared to adopt new technology readily.</P>
    <P>Many people are inclined to resist new technology because they see it as threatening jobs but the choice is not really between new technology and protecting existing jobs.  The choice is really between adopting new technology and at least keeping some of the jobs we now have or losing them all by failing to adopt new technology and allowing competitors to take our markets from us.  Unfortunately, Irish companies are slow to do their own research and development. They tend to rely to an undue extent on State agencies to do the work for them. We have had the remarkable situation where trade unions have resisted the introduction of new technology and <Col N="2297" /> demanded payments for its introduction. The attitude should have been the opposite because any new technology guarantees their jobs much longer than would be the case if technology were not introduced. We must have a much more positive attitude to this matter.  I have taken action to deal with this matter already.</P>
    <P>I have reorganised the National Board for Science and Technology to give them a much more industry-orientated approach.  I have commissioned and received a report on the workings of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards from the National Board for Science and Technology and will be making decisions on it in the near future with a view to using the technological resources available to help develop strong companies with their own autonomous research capacity rather than trying to do all the work in the State sector.</P>
    <P>We should have a system of grants for firms to acquire technology abroad.  We do not always have to do the most original seminal research work in this country; that is done in other countries.  If we do what other countries have done, such as Japan, and shop around and obtain the best in new technology and apply it in our firms and be ahead of the competition in applying rather than originating new technology, I believe we can do much better than we are doing.  Unfortunately, what we have been doing as far as applying new technology is concerned is to bring in foreign companies.  Generally speaking, Irish companies have not been going out to bring in the technology.  By bringing in a foreign company one is engaging in what is often a more expensive way of importing technology than if we could get an Irish company to import the technology.  That must be the approach we adopt in future.</P>
    <P>I believe quality and efficiency in the market place are essential to the protection of jobs, but unfortunately absenteeism from work is still a major reason why we do not have the quality of goods we should have.  People who are not always on the job will not produce quality goods which will win orders abroad.  Delivery times will not be met if a significant portion <Col N="2298" /> of the workforce do not turn up every day on time.  In the last six to eight months on day long trips I visited industrial firms in about six counties.  In all cases I asked the firms about their absenteeism record.  I was alarmed by what I heard.  I heard that absenteeism rates were as high as 30 per cent in some firms and in many others in the 10 per cent to 15 per cent range.  People say they are worried about employment, but if they do not turn up for work they are calling into question their concern about such matters.  Irish management could do a great deal more than they are doing to improve the situation as regards absenteeism. I have decided that all firms looking for assistance from any of the State agencies under my aegis will be asked to give information about their absenteeism record because there is no point pouring money into firms to protect jobs if people are not prepared to work full-time on a five-day basis.</P>
    <P>I have also commissioned a report, which I expect to receive very soon, from a group of Ministers of State, chaired by the Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Deputy Collins, into the whole question of absenteeism.  I believe we can do a great deal to improve the quality of Irish goods in the market place. The Irish Quality Control Association have shown that dramatic gains could be made if Irish firms has well established quality control procedures.  They estimate that over £245 million is lost each year by Irish industry because of insufficient attention to the application to quality control systems and methods.  We cannot afford to be losing that type of money, basically because of management failure to apply proper quality control systems.  However, our success in beating the unemployment problem depends greatly on our ability to market our goods abroad effectively.  For example, Baileys Irish Cream and some of the other Irish cream liqueurs, have been a remarkable success in Irish-based markets' but we should not forget that in order for Baileys Irish Cream to obtain this major market share they had to spend millions of pounds all over the world, particularly the United States, developing their brand <Col N="2299" /> image.  It was not enough to produce a very good product; that resources had to step.  The bulk of their resources had to be devoted to marketing.  It must be recognised that marketing is the riskiest of all investments an industry can make.</P>
    <P>If a firm invests in plant and machinery and then goes bust, at least they have the plant and machinery to sell in order to set against their debt.  If they acquire technology abroad, a patent or something like that, and they go bust trying to apply it, at least they have the patent right to sell to someone else.  It has some asset to show.  If a firm invest in marketing and it fails they have nothing to show for the effort, nothing to sell to help defray debts incurred.  That is why marketing is the riskiest of all investments and it should probably attract the greatest degree of assistance from public funds to enable it to be applied in the interests of Irish industry and jobs.</P>
    <P>Since last December I have had responsibility for CTT and the marketing side of Irish industry and I intend to devote special attention to further resources for developing marketing. Ultimately the bulk of marketing expenditure must be met by firms themselves out of profits and they must be allowed to make adequate profits if they are to invest in marketing.  Unfortunately there is a misunderstanding of the functions of profits.  It derives from the fact that profits in Irish industry are enjoyed only by a few.  It is only the shareholders of a company and some of the directors who happen also to be shareholders who share in the profits of that company if it succeeds. Generally speaking the workforce do not share in them.  If the workforce are doing a type of work which is governed by a rate for the job throughout an entire industry they get the same wage, regardless of whether the firm in which they are working makes a profit.  That does not make sense.  Surely workers should have an incentive to increase the profitability of their industry so that it can invest in marketing, expand and employ more people and ultimately increase their income.</P>
    <P>That is why I have been strongly urging <Col N="2300" /> the idea of introducing profit-sharing schemes so that there would be a joint interest on the part of everyone in the firm in enhancing its profitability.  We must get away from looking at two sides of industry contesting with one another, the wage side and the profit side, and the question of how much should go to wages this year and how much to profits.  That is a destructive conflict, not in the interests of the ultimate growth of an industry, the creation of more employment and better incomes for the people involved. If wages could be based more on profit-sharing and less on the basis of a rate for the job regardless of whether a firm is doing well, we would have a more expanding industry, more jobs, higher wages and a better income all round.</P>
    <P>This is why I have strongly urged the examination of the concept of profit-sharing. I have asked the National Economic and Social Council to examine it and I have also written to the Confederation of Irish Industry and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to promote the concept of profit-sharing.  I have been instrumental in having introduced to the 1982 Finance Act and, hopefully, the 1984 Finance Bill major tax concessions to encourage firms to introduce profit-sharing schemes so that workers would have a stake in the industry in which they work and thus be prepared to allow profits to be made and marketing schemes to be undertaken, enabling markets to be won and new jobs to be created.</P>
    <P>I would be interested to know why the Leader of the Opposition disagreed with my statement that the answer to the problem of unemployment will depend on whether we can offer on the world market goods which are more up to date, more efficient and less expensive than those offered by our competitors.  That is the reality.  If we are to do that we must be flexible and be prepared to change from one product to another.  We must be first in the field if there is innovation, a new niche opening up in the market.  An Irish firm must be there first to supply the product rather than a firm from another country.  Flexibility is essential in this area and he have, of course, many advantages. We do not have an ageing industrial <Col N="2301" /> base such as they have in many European countries where vast quantities of capital are tied up in the steel, coal and shipbuilding industries and resources cannot be quickly changed into new forms.  We have a relatively modern industry and a young industrial workforce who can quickly change from one form of activity to another in response to changes in market demands.  The essence of success in the industrial field is our ability to change and to re-allocate resources from one activity to another.</P>
    <P>There are a number of important rigidities in our economy which make us less flexible than we should be in responding to challenges and opportunities in the world market.  It is very difficult and expensive for people to move from one job to another, yet if we want an industry which can quickly respond to new demands people should be capable of moving relatively easily from a job where there are fewer opportunities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not as adaptable as we should be because pension rights, for instance, are not easily transferable between one employment and another. There is little mobility in the housing market.  Many professions are difficult to enter and insist on qualifications which are artificial.  They insist on keeping people out in order to maintain higher incomes for those involved.  All of these inflexibilities add costs to our economy and prevent us from performing to the maximum possible extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been successful in recent times through changes in pay-related benefits in getting rid of many of the disincentives to work which existed in the past and which were a cause in part of unemployment.  There are still certain situations, as pointed out in the recent NESC report, in which people can be better off not working than working, particularly in the case of large families. This is not a major problem but it should <Col N="2302" /> be eliminated.  At all points in the income scale and in all family situations people should be better off working than not working.</P>
    <P>We must have more investment if we are to have more employment.  However, I do not believe, as seems to have been the view in the seventies, that investment alone will solve the problem.  We have seen examples of what harm can be done at great cost by misdirected investment in the wrong sectors during the seventies and previously.  Simply spending money on what is called &ldquo;investment&rdquo; does not solve anything unless the right choices are made.</P>
    <P>The Government, in so far as investment by them is concerned, have introduced schemes and programmes to ensure that investment is properly directed.  While Minister for Finance I commissioned a report on cost over-runs on major public construction projects which identified many of the reasons so many of the projects mentioned here by Deputy Fitzgerald and others have gone wrong.  Investment is being promoted in a number of other ways.</P>

      <P>Venture capital.  The Government introduced in the budget a tax provision for encouraging private investment in new manufacturing ventures. This will channel a lot of the loose money which is available, savings of one kind or another which hitherto have been channelled into non-productive areas, into forms of investment that will create work in the productive sector rather than achieving short-term gains.</P>
      <P>It is very important to develop the National Development Corporation as a new instrument for well-targeted and commercial State investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The emphasis will be on projects that can give a clear financial return within a predefined period.  The staff of the corporation should have tangible incentives to make the type of decision <Col N="2303" /> that will bring financial returns to the taxpayer.  They must concentrate their efforts on developing new ideas rather than on the management of old ones.  However, as I said earlier we cannot rely solely on manufacturing as a means of providing adequate jobs for our people.  We must rely also on services. As I have pointed out elsewhere, the position is that services are already providing more jobs here.  In the decade from 1971 to 1981 there was an increase of between 50 and 100 per cent in the number of people employed in financial services, in the professions, in recreation and in other such activities while during the same decade there was an increase of only 10 or 11 per cent in manufacturing. The major employment opportunities are in the services area.  One-third of international trade now takes place in services of one kind or another and we must be able to capture a larger share of the services industry if we are to make progress.</P>
      <P>An important service sector in the economy is that of tourism, the development of which has a major role to play in our industrial employment development. More jobs are created by each additional pound earned in tourism than in the case in other sectors of the economy.  I hope that this year there will be a 10 per cent growth in US tourism to Ireland compared with last year.  It is very important that the many modern industrial firms we have attracted here and who are earning substantial profits, while paying no more than 10 per cent in tax under the regime that will apply to the year 2,000, be encouraged to re-invest these profits here rather than elsewhere. In order to bring about that situation it is important that we have a low-cost industrial environment in which it makes sense for people to re-invest.  These multinationals are being enticed by agencies from other countries to invest in these other places but we must ensure that our environment is competitive in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>State enterprises can do much more than they are doing now to export services abroad.  The ESB have shown a very good example in this field as have <Col N="2304" /> some of the hospitals.  However, our education institutions could do more than they have been doing in this area.  I should like to see a situation in which all Government Departments and agencies would be required as a matter of course to have programmes of exporting services abroad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate concerns a very important subject.  Undoubtedly, unemployment is the biggest single tragedy affecting the lives of our people.  One would have hoped that in causing this debate to take place, the Government would have availed of the opportunity to place firmly on the record details of their plans and policies for dealing with what is a major tragedy.  This evening, when 216,000 Irish people are unemployed, there are no real prospects in so far as the speeches emanating from the Government benches in this debate are concerned. This is a very sad indictment of the Government.  It is a clear indication of their failure in the many months in which they have been in office to take advantage of the opportunities presented to them by their being in full control of the economy.  An even sadder fact is that these thousands who are not being offered any prospects for the immediate future by reason of the lack of policy on the part of the Government are to be joined by thousands more in the months ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter of greatest concern to us in Fianna Fáil is the continuing increase in unemployment, a trend that is evident from the regularly published statistics. Yet there is no indication from the Government of their having grasped the enormity of the problem.  Huge numbers of young people will be leaving school and college shortly.  They will all be seeking employment, but after 15 or 16 months in office it is a matter of great concern that the Government have not published a policy that would give hope to these young people and to all those confronted with the tragedy of unemployment. Because of this lack of initiative on the part of the Government there is a great danger of despair setting in <Col N="2305" /> among these people and that is a situation that could cause untold damage to the stability of our democrary.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances it is the duty of the Opposition to remind the Government of their responsibility, to highlight for them the stark realities of the problems confronting the nation and to demand that some action be taken to deal with these problems.  In proposing this motion we have given the Government the opportunity to put on the record their understanding of the difficulties and their proposals for dealing with them.  Unfortunately, the contributions from the Ministers who have spoken during the debate have been dismal.  Week after week we read the sad stories of closures and of increases in the unemployment figures. Another very serious situation is that many of those who have been made redundant are finding now that their pay-related benefit period is ending. Thousands more will find themselves in that position within a short time.  This situation results in a massive drop in living standards.  Parents of students are confronted with the realisation that their children will not be placed when their studies are completed.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to hear the Minister advocate the necessity for young people to continue their studies but the sad fact is that we probably have the best educated unemployed people in the world because our people have been benefitting from the improvement in education facilities. Many thousands of them have qualified from the universities and from special courses followed in the regional technical colleges, but they are not being given any opportunity to put their knowledge and skills into practice.  Therefore, it is very lame of the Minister to advocate further education as a solution to our future unemployment problems.  There would not appear to be any strategy in what the Minister was saying.  It may transpire that students will come to regard their studies as futile in that their expertise cannot be put into practice.  If our youth lose faith in the ability of our democratic institutions to provide them with the opportunity to work and to develop and exploit their individual talents, <Col N="2306" /> they may not remain docile but may seek to influence events in an unorthodox way.  The sacrifices of previous generations built this country.  We have a duty to protect and support the progress which has been made.  We should adopt the appropriate policies to restore growth in the economy.</P>
    <P>I believe unemployment could reach 300,000 in a few short years unless firm Government action is taken to reverse the present trend.  Unfortunately, high unemployment has always been associated with Coalition Governments.  One only has to look back through the records to see the dismal failures of successive Coalition Governments in the area of job creation.  Different ideologies at the Cabinet table create special problems.  Decisions are delayed and the result is stagnation in our economy, with a rising crisis for those who are unable to obtain employment.  We have not got the safety valve of emigration to allow these people to filter away.  The problem is remaining on our doorstep, in our statistics, and increasing at an alarming rate.</P>
    <P>The Government seem to be motivated primarily by the desire to keep Labour and Fine Gael together in the Cabinet. That seems to be the primary objective and primary motivation which keeps the Government together.  The second motivation seems to be merely to keep Fianna Fáil out of office.  Unfortunately, the economy, unemployment and the problems facing our people are taking a very poor third place in the priorities of this Government.  If unemployment continues to rise to 300,000 as predicted on current Government policy, our credit-worthiness will suffer and eventually inability to borrow will inevitable lead to further massive job losses in the public sector, thus compounding the problem and bringing nearer the threat of undermining our society.</P>
    <P>This country cannot afford to have Cabinet table indecision of Coalition partners delaying decision making on policies to deal with the urgent problems facing our people.  Socialist type solutions will not provide answers.  Already there is too much dependence on the public sector.  There is a need to create a favourable <Col N="2307" /> climate for investment, a need to allow generous rewards for personal initiatives and effort.  There is a need to allow generous rewards for capital investment, a need to encourage and reward excellence, a need to allow labour generous rewards for diligent work.  There is a need for policies which would support and encourage private investment.  There is a need to eliminate waste in the public and private sector.</P>
    <P>We are hoping to see in policy from the Government specific indications as to how they would deal with these matters and bring forward the incentives which are so necessary.  What we do not need is an abundance of bureaucratic control and theoretical socialist solutions.  These have all failed in the past.  This national development corporation is not the solution. If extra money is available, it should be invested in infrastructural services. Additional expenditure on roads and sewerage and water schemes and housing could be justified as a permanent benefit would result and the jobs effect would be immediate.  A national development corporation has not worked anywhere else and will prove to be a costly failure if it is pursued here.  The business expansion scheme has not worked in the United Kingdom and will not work here unless employees and management get an incentive in a reduction of tax or an option to get shares in the company.</P>
    <P>The personal taxation level here is too high.  Payment of higher wages is no longer an incentive because tax rates are so punitive.  The marginal tax rate of 75 per cent plus the PRSI deduction is resulting in some workers bringing home less than 50 per cent of their gross pay. Our taxation levels are a disincentive to management and to workers.  This 75 per cent marginal tax rate and PRSI deductions make Ireland a very unattractive place to live.  Previous high tax bands were accompanied by well-known loopholes which have all now been effectively closed off.  So far as income tax is concerned, Ireland has got very much out of line with other EEC countries in imposing marginal tax rates of 60 per cent or more on a relatively large number of <Col N="2308" /> taxpayers.  The average and marginal tax rates on average industrial earnings are also much higher here than in neighbouring countries.</P>
    <P>The National Economic and Social Council in a recent report recognised the intense sensitivity of the Irish public to the amount and incidence of taxes.  They said that was very understandable in the light of the rise in the radio of tax revenue to gross domestic product from 33 per cent in 1979 to 41 per cent in 1983, a rise of over one-third in the space of four years.  The only constant theme in Government statements on unemployment is their misplaced optimism that the situation with regard to employment was improving and that the only way forward was to keep wage increases to the minimum.</P>
    <P>These views were repeated last night by the Minister for Finance when he said pay moderation would allow struggling firms to maintain employment.  With unemployment at such a crisis level, it is pathetic to see the Government placing all their reliance on wage restraint, as if there were no other options available which could also contribute.  To talk of merely maintaining present employment levels is defeatism.  Too high a price has been paid already.  It is time for the Government to adopt policies which would reverse the disastrous trends which are so clear in our economy at present.</P>
    <P>The National Economic and Social Council in a recent report said that part of the lack of success in dealing with the problems facing the economy here has been due to the lack of a coherent, planned, national economic and social strategy.  In my view, part of such a strategy should contain major alterations in present taxation policies.  High levels of personal tax and low levels of tax on manufacturing profits have not brought the desired increase in job creation. Unless the individual is motivated properly, increased output will not result and real competitiveness will not be achieved. We have got our policy the wrong way around.  It should be reversed to allow for low personal taxation and higher company tax on profits.</P>
    <P>We had low unemployment when personal <Col N="2309" /> tax was low.  We now have high unemployment while high personal tax obtains.  Some workers bring home less than 50 per cent of their gross earnings. I have instances of workers bringing home 48 per cent of their gross pay, workers who are prepared to work hard. They are motivated to do their best, and they find that the State is taking over 50 per cent of their income in taxation. Surely that is the wrong way to tackle the problem.  Surely we should be encouraging workers to work so that they can enjoy the fruits of their labour.  But no. We want them to work hard, but we want the State to take the fruits of their labour. That just will not work.</P>
    <P>There is no point in the Minister introducing a penalty on people who are absent from work through sickness or otherwise, and refusing to allocate grants to companies if the record of absenteeism is high.  The Minister is adopting a negative approach.  He should be positive.  He should introduce incentives.  He should allow the workers to enjoy the fruits of their labour.  They will be motivated if they are allowed to enjoy their reward. Imaginative tax alterations would bring dramatic results and would lower unemployment. We have now reached the ridiculous situation where a £1 increase in a single worker's take home pay costs the employer £3.6p, with £2.6p going to the Exchequer and into the social insurance fund.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance advocates wage restraint to improve competitiveness, while his own taxation policies are having the most serious adverse effects on our competitiveness through increasing the cost of employment, thus necessitating further wage increases to cushion the decline in employees' real disposal income as a result of the increased taxation which the Minister is imposing.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest constraints on growth in output and employment is the penal taxation policy being pursued by the Government.  If they reduce taxation, encourage initiative, encourage enterprise, encourage investment, encourage risk taking and reward hard work, they will get the result.  That is the only way in which we can motivate our workers to <Col N="2310" /> increase production.  Increased production will bring about increases in our sales.  It will bring about new opportunities and expand employment.  From some of his statements the Minister must agree with a great deal of what I am saying.  I recognise that he has a difficulty in Cabinet to get some of his colleagues to agree to the introduction of the type of schemes I am suggesting.  It is time we extolled the need to achieve profits.  I support what the Minister said tonight in regard to profits.  I wish that some of his colleagues in the Cabinet would make similar statements. If they did we might have some hope for the future.  Policies should allow people retain the wealth they accumulate through their thrift, enterprise and hard work.</P>
    <P>As Fianna Fáil spokesman on Environment I must express my party's alarm at the Government's neglect of the construction industry, the second biggest industry in the country.  The crisis affecting that industry is a matter of serious concern to the nation, a personal tragedy for the thousands who have lost their jobs and the hundreds of building contractors who have been forced out of business. We have not heard one word from any Member on the Government side on those matters.  The Irish construction industry was never in more serious trouble.  In 1983 the gross output of the industry was estimated at £1,876 million. There was no growth in the industry last year compared to a decline of 1 per cent in 1982.  When one recalls that there was an increase of 11 per cent in gross output in 1980 and a 21 per cent increase in 1981 it is easy to imagine the effect of the sudden reversal from growth to stagnation and of the continuing fall in output. When inflation is taken into account it can be seen that output, based on 1975 prices, has dropped from a growth of 4 per cent in 1981 to a reduction in the growth output of 12 per cent in 1982 and a reduction of 10 per cent in 1983.</P>
    <P>Big fluctuations in output occur in the construction industry from time to time but what is now significant is that the current decline is sharper than at any time in the last 25 years.  In the previous <Col N="2311" /> major recession of 1974-75 the drop in output was only half that experienced at present and hence the magnitude of the present position facing the industry can be realised.  The share of the country's resources being devoted to construction activities had risen steadily from the early sixties.  The percentage of gross domestic product going to construction was 9.4 in 1960; it reached a peak of 15.4 in 1979 but by 1983 it had fallen to 12.2 per cent. The reasons for this were the rapid development of the Irish economy and the necessity to improve infrastructure to meet the needs of a modern economy with a growing population.  However, the current Government view seems to be that future growth of the construction industry will be kept close to the growth rate of the economy as a whole.  The construction industry will, therefore, get a smaller share of the national cake as compared to the past position.</P>
    <P>People in the industry believe they are not getting their fair share of the resources at this stage.  Rather than being overfed the industry is on a Government enforced diet and the results are not very pleasant.  Employment in the industry in April 1979 was 145,000 of which 101,000 were directly employed in contracting and the balance by building material manufacturers, merchants, plant hire firms and consultants.  By April 1983 the numbers had fallen to 117,000, a drop of 28,000 or just 20 per cent and the decline persists.  Particularly badly hit are the architectural, engineering and quantity surveying practices.  Their respective institutes report a sharp cutback in work and a resultant increase in job losses. Estimates of total employment in private sector consultancy in 1982 was 8,000 falling to 6,000 in 1983 with a further decline to 5,000 in 1984.  If and when an upturn occurs there will inevitably be some delay in getting major projects to the construction stage due to this rundown of the design sector.</P>
    <P>To fully understand what is happening in the construction industry it is necessary to examine the individual contributions of the public and private sectors.  Public sector investment is a direct decision of <Col N="2312" /> Government and private sector investment is largely determined by the success or otherwise of economic and monetary policies.  The public sector has always played a major part in financing the construction industry.  In 1979 the public expenditure on building and construction accounted for 55 per cent of the total expenditure.  In 1982 and 1983 the percentage had risen to 75 per cent.  The reverse of the coin is worth noting.  The private sector share of expenditure fell from 45 per cent to 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>There are three major elements in construction output, housing, which accounts for about 40 per cent, public funded demand on schools, hospitals, farm buildings and power plants, and private demand.  Since 1979 housing has declined by nearly 20 per cent at constant prices.  Output in the public sector has grown while there has been a dramatic decline in the private sector.  In the two years between 1979 and 1981 output in the private sector has almost halved.  This sector accounts for almost 90 per cent of the total drop in output although it only accounts for about 20 per cent of the total output.  The current difficulties being experienced by the industry are mainly due to the lack of confidence by the private sector to undertake construction work which arises from a number of factors one of which is the world recession. Of course, that has now come to an end. The construction of advance factories has practically ceased and the picture I am painting in regard to construction is, unfortunately, a depressing one.</P>
    <P>Many sectors of the industry feel, as a result of the long recession, a lack of confidence in the industry and in their own ability to survive.  They cannot yet see the light at the end of the tunnel. There is a pessimistic view prevailing that the Government will not take any steps to halt the downward slide in the construction sector.  Confidence, as the Minister is aware, is a frail ingredient and there is no doubt that the industry would survive although in what size and shape it is not clear.  The responsibility lies with the Government.  Indeed, we are constantly reminded by the Government that the health of the Irish economy is influenced <Col N="2313" /> by changes in the world economy. The worst recession since World War II has ended and the economies of the industrialised countries are starting to grow again led by the recovery of the United States.  However, the decline continues at a very serious rate in the Irish construction industry.  If further evidence is required of the continuing decline in output and employment in the construction industry one has only to consider the most recent statistics which show that cement sales in January and February of this year were down 12 per cent on the same months last year. Employment in the construction industry in January 1984 was 16 per cent down on January 1983.  Compared to January 1982 employment is down 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>The industrial analysis of the Live Register for 9 December 1983, published last week, shows that unemployment in the construction industry increased by 815 in the month of November to 42,000.  It seems that 5,048 construction workers lost their jobs in 1983.  The recent CIF-EEC survey of the construction industry of December 1983 shows that the decline in output in the industry is continuing at a disturbing rate.  The surveys which have proved very reliable in the past also reflect employment trends under three main headings, civil engineering construction, residential building and nonresidential building.  The summary of the survey is that the rate of decline in employment in the industry is expected to continue during the first quarter of 1984 at a similar level to that experienced during the last quarter of 1983 although there are indications that there may be a significant increase in the number of firms letting people go in civil engineering and non-residential building sectors.</P>
    <P>What the construction industry needs most of all is confidence.  First, they need confidence that the Government will continue to support and implement its published plans for public capital investment. Secondly, they need confidence that the Government will actively seek ways to promote private sector investment through the introduction of investment incentives.  It was a shattering blow to the morale of the industry to see their worst <Col N="2314" /> fears confirmed in 1983 when the 1983 Public Capital Programme out-turn was published which showed that expenditure in 1983 was £142 million less than that provided for in the Estimates bearing in mind that the Government had already reduced the 1983 Public Capital Programme by £220 million on the levels detailed by Fine Gael and Labour in December 1982.  That decision by the Government to withdraw £362 million from planned public capital investment in 1983 has, more than anything else, led to the present demoralised state of the construction industry.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the present policy involving the highest rate of personal taxation levels in Europe, coupled with high levels of PRSI, levies, VAT, company and capital taxation are all resulting in a climate where personal initiative is being discouraged at every level, resulting in a lack of opportunities and hopeless unemployment. There is one area where the depressed state of the economy has not deflated demand and that is in housing. The housing needs of our people are not being met and the crisis will worsen in the immediate future due to the age structure of our population.  To meet current demands we need to construct 35,000 houses per year.  The Government have set a target of 30,000 and then proceeded to provide finance for only 26,000.  They built only 26,000 houses in their first year in office and it is doubtful if they will succeed in building that number in 1984.</P>
    <P>The national need is for 35,000 and we are increasing the problem and postponing the achievement of the targets while people are left without homes.  I estimate that there are more than 130,000 people waiting to be housed by local authorities at present.  If we are only building 6,000 local authority dwellings we will only house 24,000 people approximately at an average of two children per family.  The waiting list is getting longer each year and the Government should take some initiative to deal with that vast human problem. As far as housing our people is concerned too many have been condemned to put up with unfitness, overcrowding, involuntary sharing and homelessness.  A net figure of 28,000 dwellings in 1981 <Col N="2315" /> were claimed to be unfit beyond repair. It will take 16 or 17 years to catch up with the repair of those houses according to the rate of progress of the policy of this Government.  Even though there has been some improvement due to public and private expenditure in housing, it is also true that the disparity between the majority of the population and those in poor housing has worsened.  There is a need for a major increase in new house completions and improvements and extensions to the existing housing stock. Present policies will not meet the urgent demand.</P>
    <P>With some justification I can draw the attention of the Minister to successful efforts made in the past to bring about dramatic increases in the number of houses built.  In the period 1970 to 1973 there was an increase from 13,000 houses to 25,000 houses.  If it could be done in the past it can be done in the future. However, it was not done in the past without a major effort, without special initiatives being taken and incentives being introduced.  If the Minister and the Government had the will they would set about relieving the nation of this great social need and ease the difficulties and hardship of those who have no homes.</P>
    <P>It would be easy to achieve the housing targets if the Government had the will.  It would also create employment for thousands of people who have the skills and who are idle and walking the streets.  It is clear that unless the Government are prepared to introduce major changes in the taxation policies they have been following, to introduce initiatives that will encourage investment and allow people rewards for their efforts, that will extol excellence and create a climate for investment, very little can be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke in broad general terms, but what we need are specifics, We want an indication from the Government of the exact policies they propose to deal with the unemployment crisis that is affecting our people.  There is despair among young people.  There is a threat to democracy and to the continuation of the peaceful, happy environment in which families have been reared.  The State will <Col N="2316" /> be under threat if the Government do not take action to provide employment for our people.  The unemployment figure is slowly creeping up to the dramatic figure of 300,000 that I mentioned earlier but there is no evidence of any concern on the part of the Government.  They are unnecessarily preoccupied with matters that are secondary to the national problem, feeding the newspapers with stories about phone tapping and phone bugging. Half of the Government are touring America at enormous expense, accompanied by enormous entourages of civil servants and others, at a time when the country is faced with the most serious unemployment crisis.  The country is faced with a major recession that is deemed to be continuing despite the fact that the world recession is over.  Unemployment figures in Europe are below 10 per cent but here they are at a level of 17 per cent.  In the United States they are in a situation of near full employment.  The Minister spoke about the inability of the Government to provide jobs for all our people.  I do not accept that policy of despair.  The people want some hope, not despair from this Government.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that this Government have ignored or failed to take positive action on the critical problem of unemployment.  I could list the initiatives taken but I do not have time this evening.  There is the enterprise allowance scheme, the venture capital programme and the increase in the Vote for the Minister for Labour and many others.</P>
      <P>The unemployment figures are harrowing, and there is not a Deputy in this House who is not concerned.  It behoves all of us to be constructive and helpful and not continue in the vein we heard tonight and last night.  Party bickering or political points scoring is of no interest to those walking the streets looking for gainful employment.  Is it any wonder this House is becoming increasingly irrelevant to our people and is viewed with increasing cynicism and scepticism, particularly by the young people?  Look at the issues that have dominated this House for the past month or so, orchestrated by the Opposition benches.</P>

      <P>This Government are committed to decreasing our inflation rate.  The Taoiseach estimated the figure would be 5 per cent by the end of this year.  If we do not get our inflation rate down, and thereby our interest rates, and make our products more competitive in the marketplace we will not succeed.</P>
      <P>Springs of Wexford have been mentioned today.  Wexford is but an example of the difficult problem facing the Government.  All of us can do more.  If we reduce our inflation rate it will be the key to the future employment position and the resolution of the problem.  If our inflation rate is not below the rate of our trading partners we will be uncompetitive.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that everyone of us here, and all our agencies, can do more. The IDA, Fóir Teoranta, Córas Tráchtála and all the agencies involved could do more.  If we sorted out the variable premium problem which has most of our meat factories on a two- and three-day week we could do more. Obviously we are still indulging in the luxury of irresponsible Opposition.  It is a shame for the country that this is what is offered by the Opposition benches. This Government have tackled constructively the critical problem of unemployment.</P>

The problem is that the policy of this Government is to ensure that they do not do any more to try to solve the problem of unemployment. Fianna Fáil do not accept in a nation of 4,500,000 people, where vast resources have been put into educating during the years, it is not possible for <Col N="2318" /> everyone who is willing and able to work to do so.  If we find it acceptable that 250,000 people should be condemned to unemployment, this will dictate the level of our performance in the creation of unemployment.  For me, that sums up this Government's performance.  They are prepared to accept as satisfactory the situation where 250,000 people are unemployed.</P>

      <P>Last week the Minister, Deputy Bruton, said that his priority was the creation of a flexible and mobile workforce.  That is a far cry from the positive action a man in his position should take.  What is more alarming is that for many people, including myself, Deputy Bruton was the one member of the Cabinet who appeared to have the guts to do something about unemployment. If his priority is to get Irish workers to move from one town to the next to get employment, that will spell an end to the hopes of many people, particularly young people, of getting a job.</P>
      <P>The Government are involved in a kite-flying exercise once more.  We heard it from the Minister of Finance last night when he said that if there was a wage freeze this would achieve job creation. Do this Government think the unions are foolish enough to enter into such a bargain? Clearly the unions will not accept such kite-flying and we will end up as we did last year with wage increases in line with large increases in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are not interested in taking the positive action that is necessary. <Col N="2319" /> I will give two examples.  There was the recent indication from Córas Tráchtála that they have not sufficient resources.  This shows how our priorities are seriously wrong.  The decision of their chief executive, Seán Condon, to resign to go into export promotion in the private sector speaks volumes for the inadequacy of Government support in this vital area.</P>
    <P>If the Government are not prepared to put resources into agencies like CTT how can we expect to create jobs?  We recently heard Mr. Seán Condon speak openly about his desire to have another £2¾ million which is absolutely necessary so that CTT can do their job effectively.  He gets the cold shoulder from people like the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism.</P>
    <P>We see the great work being done by AnCO in their advisory training service and their assignment units to carry out management training on an in-company basis.  This very useful exercise, in order to increase company performance, has been given the cold shoulder by the Government and AnCO are starved of the resources necessary to carry out that kind of work.  We see the money paid by the hard-pressed taxpayers being given to Government Departments to replace Exchequer expenditure.  Clearly, the Government have no commitment.  We cannot see the Minister for Finance providing any encouragement to people on the dole.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and the Minister for Finance never saw a hard day in their lives, they never saw the spectre of unemployment and clearly, they have no aptitude for the kind of mental problem that 100,000 young people are going through at this time. This is the kind of situation young people have to face now, but the Minister for Labour is prepared to be involved in the cynical exercise of spending a day on the dole.  There is one clear message for the Government.  Unless they are prepared to make a very significant change in their policies there is only one area we can <Col N="2320" /> move into, that is into increased militant tendency which, we have seen, has raised its ugly head so much recently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <P>The verdict on this debate must be that the Government stand condemned.  The trouble is that the penalty will not be imposed on the culprits, the Government, but on the people who are suffering because of the lack of policies by the Government.  When we put down this motion on the most important issue facing this House we hoped we would elicit some response from the Government, some positive proposals, some indications to our young people of where we are going and how we propose to get there so that we could all respond, as Deputy Doyle said, in a positive, cohesive way.  The Government have reneged on that responsibility to the nation, particularly to the growing number of unemployed.</P>
      <P>In putting down this motion we hoped for some prospect for the future.  Deputy Doyle should read the record of this debate because she is exceptional in being the only Government Deputy who came in at any point and she will see it was this side of the House last night who put forward the proposals and that all we got from her side was a dreary analysis of the alleged success to date.  There was not one idea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the Minister's contribution if what he has issued is a measure of his contribution. The Government have not proposed one concrete proposal in contrast to the number we proposed during this debate.  They relied instead on a dreary recital of what they call achievements to date.  An increase in unemployment of the order of about 40,000 since they came into office can hardly be described in any other terms but disastrous failure.  This is compounded by the Government's attempt to distort that reality for, in the words of the Minister for Finance last night, an easing in the unemployment <Col N="2321" /> trend.  Not even previous ineffective Coalitions abrogated their responsibility to the same extent.</P>
      <P>Eighteen months after promising firm and decisive action to combat unemployment this inert Government can only wait for, in the words of the Minister for Finance last night, &ldquo;the required response from the social partners.&rdquo;  Who did the people elect to govern the country, the social partners or the people who now occupy the benches opposite?</P>
      <P>I would now like to refer to what the Minister said this evening.  It is in the script but I do not know if he delivered it.  I can only mention two points.  He said our ability to sell the work of Irish people abroad depends on how much we spend on marketing.  I presume that is the Minister's view.  I have heard him say it before.  He said he is working on a number of proposals which could help the Irish marketing effort.  He said State-aided schemes can certainly be of major assistance here.  Would the Minister like to reconcile that with the fact that the allocation for CTT in money terms is 7 per cent up on last year but because of devaluation decided by the Government is, in effective terms, 9 per cent down on last year?  Would the Minister like to reconcile that commitment to expenditure support for CTT with the fact that about 40 to 50 companies who are waiting to promote their products in the high technology area have to be told by CTT, the board under the Minister's responsibility, that they have nothing to offer them because they have not the funds to reach the markets the Minister says he is concerned about?  The Minister knows that the high technology Fianna Fáil brought into the country cannot now reach the markets because of lack of adequate support.</P>

He said this body will be designed to create a new instrument for a well-targeted and commercial State investment. He also said that the emphasis will be on projects that can give a clear financial return within a predefined period.  Two years after it was proposed it will be designed to do (a) or (b) and we are told they must concentrate their efforts on developments and new ideas.  We are told by the Minister he is working on proposals for this body with this criteria in mind. Two years after they announced the launching of it they are working on proposals.</P>

      <P>We have to recognise some realities.  We need policies to promote employment because of the growth of our labour force.  They are of primary importance but the Government have discouraged investment and have penalised initiative in an unremitting onslaught on incentive and enterprise.  The Irish are going abroad to invest and the others will not come here anymore.  The evidence is so clear the Government can ignore it if they wish at their peril.  Our total State foreign indebtedness last year rose by £2,000 million, our investment dropped by 23 per cent &mdash; the lowest in 16 years &mdash; and our balance of payments when revised at the end of the year will show that it has dropped considerably and our growth will be about zero in 1985.  Surely all these facts demand action from a Government and not constant analysis. Even the Thatcherite Government in Britain yesterday were able to give tax allowances to promote incentive but this Government continue to indulge in their self-righteous fantasy that they will bring the public finances into order while ignoring that public order, as distinct from financial order, is at risk of being totally undermined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lemass wishes to take three minutes of my time.  I do not intend to go into the merits of this matter because they were fully debated here on 10, 15 and 16 November last. The need to open this mill from the point of view of providing employment and in the national interest is already on the record.  Despite the fact that they spent <Col N="2327" /> £1.75 million purchasing the premises last February 12 months, the Government did nothing about this matter until we raised the issue last November.  We had the farcical situation where the Minister, Deputy Bruton, made it clear that he had no intention of opening the mill and delivered a cautionary address to the House in which he adopted a Victorian attitude.  He said on 15 November that he did not believe that anyone should try to press the Government into making arrangements that are not in the best possible interests of the economic development of the industry concerned.</P>
      <P>The following day we had the spectacle of a junior Minister, Deputy E. Collins, after much mumbling and fumbling saying that he was able to produce a new project out of his hip pocket.  Within 24 hours of the Minister rejecting the idea of any such project being feasible, we had the junior Minister saying, at column 2647 of the Official Report on 16 November:</P>
      <P>The IDA have been in negotiation with a company in Canada for some time now and I am pleased to be able to tell the House, especially the Members opposite, that, following a decision made by the IDA board last week on the basis of a revised proposal for the mills, the IDA have reached an agreement in principle with the FMI company of Canada.</P>
      <P>These are the facts.  That happened four months ago.  What I am concerned about is the credibility of this Government in making commitments and giving guarantees to this House ranging across the whole field of public administration and Government policy.  We had it in the security area, now we have it in the economic and industrial area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The junior Minister, Deputy Collins, gave a commitment to this House but the Minister, Deputy Bruton, the previous night rejected any idea that a viable economic or industrial proposition was on for Clondalkin.  The House was misled on the evening of 16 November and as a result men and women of the Clondalkin community who crowded the public gallery <Col N="2328" /> went home thinking something would happen immediately because of what Deputy Collins said.  Deputy Collins gave that commitment because earlier that day the Labour Party members in the Government had decided that the Minister, Deputy Bruton, had gone too far the night before.  There was an ideological conflict within the Government and they decided on this most blatant con trick and had the junior Minister, Deputy Collins, mumble and fumble for a while before he announced that a specific arrangement had been made between the IDA and the FMI company of Canada.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the people concerned and the country as a whole, I want to ascertain the progress that has been made in the four months since.  My information is that a few people have been cleaning the floors, building a wall, putting up the odd brick and painting the odd shed but that not one single piece of productive apparatus has been introduced to the building during the past four months and that no effort has been made to make arrangements to commence production. I want to hear what arrangement has been made to initiate production and the proposed plans and projections. What arrangements have been made with the FMI company in Canada or, if that deal is dead, with any other company?  I want a progress report on what the Government have done in the past four months, what they propose to do in the immediate future and their ultimate plans for this project.</P>
      <P>The record shows that this has been a massive exercise in the painting of cosmetic colours designed to con the people at large.  Once again we have an example of the national handlers who sought to patch the matter together following the statement by the Minister that it was not on.  They cobbled something together and the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, came in the following night to say these arrangements were in train.</P>

      <P>A total con job was perpetrated against the workers of Clondalkin Paper Mills.  When will the first piece of paper come out of that mill?  We are importing hundreds of tonnes of paper.  When are the Clondalkin workers to be allowed once again to produce paper?  I have a question down to the Minister, but it takes so long to get questions answered that perhaps he would like to answer it tonight.  Why is a wall being built there at a cost of £35,000?  Is it a fact that the building of this wall will inhibit the opening of the mills as a paper manufacturing concern?  The Minister should be honest with us and tell us exactly what is happening.  He is trying to get a few answers now before it is his turn to speak.</P>

      <P>But the Deputy wants questions answered, as do Deputy Lenihan and the workers in Clondalkin. The Minister should come clean and tell us when this mill will open.  The longer the delay the fewer skilled people will be available.  People have been waiting two-and-a-half years to go back to their jobs.  For goodness sake, let them go back and produce the paper we need.</P>

      <P>I hope that what the Minister will say will give confidence to those of us who have worked over many years to get paper-making re-established in Clondalkin mills.  The Minister recently made an announcement regarding paper conversion, and I would hope that the paper conversion operation would be only a prelude to paper-making, because paper-making and Clondalkin are synonymous.  Clondalkin is an unemployment blackspot, and the <Col N="2330" /> restoration of paper-making in the mills would be a healthy first step to restoring confidence in Clondalkin generally.</P>
      <P>While Minister for Industry and Energy I concerned myself with the difficulties at Clondalkin mills.  It is only fair to say that the difficulties there had manifested themselves some time earlier than the period of the 1981-1982 Government. The difficulties were signalled many months before the arrival of that Government.  The scheme worked out when I was Minister for Industry and Energy involved one-third State investment, one-third private investment and the remainder from the employees.  That would have given an employment potential of 300 people in the mills.  No scheme proposed to date by the Minister or anybody else has given close to that figure of employment.  While paper conversion would be a first stage in restoring morale in the mill I would hope it would not be long before a full paper-making operation would be restored and that we would approach an employment figure of 300 personnel, the figure in the scheme I proposed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will recall that an agreement was concluded in November 1983 after many months of intensive negotiations with FMI whereby the IDA approved facilities for a paper conversion project in Clondalkin.  For this purpose I agreed to lease an appropriate area of the mill to the company.  In addition the Government agreed to make available to the company an option on the remainder of the mill's assets not immediately required for paper conversion. It is the company's intention to progress to use these for paper-making, and the Government will make assets available to them on the approval by the IDA of a viable project for paper-making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreement with FMI in regard to paper conversion which is the initial part of the proposal was conditional &mdash; and was stated to be such when I announced it in the debate &mdash; on the acceptance of the trade unions concerned.  Discussions <Col N="2331" /> with the trade unions commenced in January and they are now at a very advanced stage.  I expect they will be completed within the next few days.  The conclusion of negotiations with the trade unions concerned will pave the way for the start of paper conversion operations. It will be a matter for the investors, FMI, to determine the precise date on which these operations will commence.  Assuming that the remaining negotiations with the trade unions are completed as quickly as expected, I imagine the commencement of paper conversion will be in a few weeks' time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That has already been announced, as the Deputy is aware.  To enable the paper conversion operation to succeed a considerable amount of renovation has already taken place.  A figure in the region of £15,000 has been spent since November on the renovation of the premises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>A fire resistant wooden partition is being erected on one side of the area of the mill being leased to the promoters.  It is a temporary measure regarded as necessary for operational control.  It did not cost £35,000 as Deputy Lemass stated but rather about £4,500. The figure spent generally on renovation is £15,000 of which about £4,000 is in respect of this wall.</P>
      <P>I am quite confident that as a result of the successful conclusion of negotiations with the trade unions, the only remaining matter preventing the commencement of the paper conversion operation, the venture will commence very shortly.  If it is successful and provides the basis for a viable paper-making project, as determined by the IDA, then paper-making will also commence.  Viability throughout this entire effort has been my concern, because I do not want to see people's money and hopes invested in something that is not viable.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 383 and 385 together.</P>
      <P>I have not received a copy of the survey carried out by the Ballina Trades Council.  I am satisfied that the Industrial Development Authority are making every effort to promote north Mayo suitable for industrial development.  Many large industries such as Travenol Laboratories, Asahi, Hollister, Allergen and Halal Meats have been secured for north Mayo in the past ten years.  The recent increase in unemployment in the area has not been significantly influenced by job losses in manufacturing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IDA have 126,000 sq. ft. of advance factory space at five locations and 64 acres of land at nine locations available for industrial development in <Col N="2208" /> north Mayo.  In addition, the IDA are currently providing 3 × 750 sq. ft. small industry units in Ballina and 3 × 750 sq. ft. units in Castlebar.</P>
    <P>The IDA are also actively co-operating with local bodies in the implementation of the Mayo Industrial Action Plan and are promoting Castlebar and Kiltimagh on a priority basis for industrial development.</P>

      <P>Efforts to find a replacement activity at Corroy have been continuous since the original decision to terminate glucose production there and have included the use of international consultants, in addition to the IDA, IIRS and other State agencies.  It is now felt that the site may be suitable as a base for several small manufacturing activities, preferably based on wet processing such as mixing, formulation and so on and the company plans to promote this concept both alone and in conjunction with the IDA Small Industries Division.  The company's concept is that should it be successful in finding entrepreneurs interested in setting up manufacturing operations at Corroy, it would provide utility services, office administration and general support services to these companies at cost or at a small profit and generally encourage their development.  This approach will be attempted for a two-year period and a small core staff, under the direction of a Ceimicí executive, will be retained on site for this purpose.</P>

      <P>I learned with regret of the recent death of a young girl while travelling from Limerick to Dublin for kidney treatment. The girl was a patient of one of the consultants of the Mid-Western Health Board who referred her for specialist medical care to Dublin.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the funds raised in the Limerick locality for the provision of a kidney dialysis unit for Limerick Regional Hospital.  I should point out however that the most significant costs associated with the establishment of a dialysis service in Limerick would be the recurring costs of running the service. Indeed the health board have estimated that such costs would be of the order of £160,000 annually.  While in current conditions there are no funds available to supplement the board's allocation for this purpose, in July last my Department gave approval to the Mid-Western Health Board for the establishment of a maintenance dialysis service at Limerick Regional on condition that this could be done from within the existing revenue allocation.</P>
      <P>The board have taken the preliminary steps to establish a service at Limerick. A suitable area in the regional hospital has been set aside for the development of a dialysis unit.  Arrangements have been made with Jervis Street for specialised training for four nurses employed by the board.</P>

      <P>One of the conditions for receipt of contributory old age pension <Col N="2215" /> under the Social Welfare Acts requires a claimant to have a yearly average of at least 20 reckonable contributions over the period from the beginning of the 1983 contribution year or from the beginning of the year in which he entered insurance, whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before he reached pension age.  The Department's records show that the person concerned had a total of only 238 reckonable contributions in the required period and as this is equal to a yearly average of only seven he does not qualify for the pension. The decision that he does not qualify for a contributory old age pension was upheld by an appeals officer whose decision in the matter is final and conclusive, unless new facts are brought to notice.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 5 December 1983 and following the completion of inquiries to establish that he satisfied the availability conditions his claim has been authorised at £74.85 weekly, being the appropriate maximum rate in his case.

      <P>The person concerned <Col N="2219" /> claimed unemployment benefit on 17 January 1984 and her claim was allowed at £34.80 weekly being the maximum rate appropriate in her case.  All arrears due have been paid to her.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to pay-related benefit with flat-rate unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that the weekly sum of pay-related benefit, flat-rate unemployment benefit and income-tax refund paid may not exceed 85 per cent of the net average weekly earnings.  The 85 per cent limit in the case of the person concerned is £24.00.  As she is in receipt of flat-rate unemployment benefit of £34.80 weekly she is not therefore entitled to pay-related benefit.</P>
      <P>Weekly payments of £34.80 will continue to be made as they become due.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Payment was disallowed from 1 August 1983 following her examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that she was capable of work.  She appealed against the disallowance and in connection with her appeal she was examined on 19 October 1983 by a different medical referree who also was of the opinion that she was capable of work. The decision to disallow payment of disability benefit was subsequently upheld by an appeals officer who decided on 23 January 1984 that she was capable of work during the period from 1 August 1983 to 11 August 1983, the date of the latest medical certificate before him.  The decision of an appeals officer is final and can only be altered in the light of new <Col N="2224" /> evidence which was not before him at the time of making his decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 427 to 430, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>It has not been possible to establish conclusively the initial source of infection in the recent outbreak of TB in North Kilkenny.  Local conditions such as poor fencing and fragmented holdings facilitated the rapid spread of the disease and, as a consequence, TB has become well established in a number of herds in the area.  My Department are paying special attention to the outbreak through intensification of testing, with special emphasis on herds contiguous to reactor herds.</P>
      <P>While this is a serious outbreak, there can be no question of my Department pursuing the type of slaughter policy which would be adopted in the event of an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that present levels of reactor grants, together with the meat factory salvage value of reactor animals, offer a reasonable level of reimbursement to affected herdowners.  Grant levels were substantially increased a year ago.</P>
      <P>The serious Exchequer situation precludes any change in the hardship fund which would give rise to additional expenditure.</P>
