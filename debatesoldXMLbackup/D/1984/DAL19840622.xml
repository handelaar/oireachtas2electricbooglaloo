    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 25 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): This section is being substituted for section 15 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, to make it clear that a person charged with an offence, whether he has been arrested on a warrant or not, must be brought before a district justice if a Justice is immediately available or, if not, before a peace commissioner as soon as practicable.  The existing section 15 provides that a person charged with an offence shall, on arrest, be brought before a justice if immediately available and, if not, be brought as soon as may be before a peace commissioner.  There is doubt as to whether this applies to a person arrested without warrant since he is not a &ldquo;person charged&rdquo; when arrested, whereas a person arrested on a warrant is regarded as having been charged when the warrant is issued.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) caters for the position of a person arrested on a warrant and is similar to existing subsection (1) and (2), combined, of section 15, except that he is to be brought before a peace commissioner as soon as possible instead of &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (2) makes a similar provision in relation to a person arrested without warrant.  With regard to subsection (3) this provision is not in the existing section 15 but it represents in substance the existing law as it appears from reported decisions of the courts, at least in relation to arrest without warrant.  It provides in effect that where a person is arrested on a warrant after 10 p.m., or if he was arrested without a warrant, is charged after 10 p.m., it will satisfy the requirement to bring him before a court &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; if he is brought, at the commencement of the sitting, before a district justice due to sit on the <Col N="239" /> following morning in the district where he was arrested.</P>
    <P>This provision takes account of the practical difficulties confronting the Garda in bringing a person before a court where he is charged late at night.  In any case, if the person was in fact brought before the peace commissioner, the peace commissioner would presumably remand him in Garda custody to that District Court sitting.  If the case were a minor one and otherwise suitable for giving &ldquo;station bail&rdquo; the member in charge could admit him to bail conditional to appear at the following morning's court.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that the subsection applies only to a person who has been charged and that a person may not be questioned after he has been charged except to clear up ambiguities in any voluntary statement he may have made or, possibly, in exceptional circumstances for the purpose of preventing harm or loss to some other person or to the public.</P>
    <P>Subsections (4), (5) and (6) re-enact corresponding provisions of section 15 of the 1951 Act.  They provide for remand on bail or in custody of an accused who is brought before a peace commissioner after being charged.</P>
    <P>Subsection (7) is a saver for other existing law under which different procedures apply in relation to a person charged in certain circumstances.  For example, under section 31 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, the sergeant or other member in charge of a Garda station may, if he considers it prudent to do so, release a person on bail, subject to a recognisance to appear before the District Court at the appropriate time and place.  Under section 26 of the Extradition Act, 1965, a person arrested on a warrant must be brought before a district justice assigned to the Dublin Metropolitan District or such other justice as the Minister directs.  Also, under that Act, different periods of remand apply in relation to a person arrested on a provisional warrant from those applicable to arrest on an ordinary warrant.</P>
    <P>As I said previously, it is a substitution for section 15 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, and it updates the situation in relation <Col N="240" /> to a certain amount of case law which has emerged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We support this section and there are just a few questions which I should like to ask in relation to it. Section 25 (3) states:</P>
      <P>Where a person is arrested pursuant to a warrant later than the hour of 10 o'clock on any evening or, having been arrested without warrant, is charged after that hour and a justice is due to sit in the District Court district in which the person was arrested not later than noon on the following day, it shall be sufficient compliance with subsection (1) or (2), as the case may be, if he is brought before a justice at the commencement of the sitting.</P>
      <P>Does this mean that section 3 of this Bill will allow a person to be detained for six hours or 12 hours and that this further period can then be added to that subsequently because the person would not be charged until the end of the period of 12 hours?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> No. Under section 3 of the Bill there are powers of detention for questioning after arrest without warrant.  Where somebody has been charged there is no new power allocated here.  The case law provides that where a person is arrested on a warrant after 10 p.m. or if he was arrested without a warrant and charged after 10 p.m. it would satisfy the requirement to bring him before a court as soon as is practicable.  Practicability in this case could mean to any District Court sitting on the following day, and writing this into the Statute Book is an improvement on the present situation where somebody can be detained after being charged overnight in custody and can be held until it is practicable to bring him before a District Court the following day.  Under this Bill, he now has to be brought at the commencement of the District Court, in other words, before noon on the following day.  It clarifies and improves the existing position under case law and does not arise from section 3 of the Bill.  It arises from the situation which pertains <Col N="241" /> at present that if somebody is charged they cannot normally be questioned after being charged but they can be held until they are brought before the court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors suggested that section 25 (3) should be amended by replacing 10 o'clock with 4 o'clock in the afternoon.  This would have the effect of increasing the length of time that a person would be held before coming before a justice.  I presume they were suggesting that there was some practical reason for this but it is feasible, in any event, to operate on the basis of 10 o'clock.  Is that the position?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The present practice arises from established case law and the requirement is to bring somebody before the District Court as soon as is practicable.  That, in certain circumstances, could be interpreted as to what was practicable during the day when the court was sitting.  If there was an afternoon sitting of the court, for example, it could certainly extend to 4 o'clock. Now that it is going into the Statute Book we should tighten it up.  We are talking about the appearance in court the following morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Association of Criminal Lawyers state that they support this section generally except section 25 (3) which is under discussion at present. They say that in the context of the Bill it could mean that any person can be held for a further 14 hours other than that envisaged in the Bill.  If a person is arrested for questioning under section 3 at 10 a.m. on a Saturday morning and the 12 hours expire at 10 p.m. on Saturday night, obviously there is no court sitting on Sunday.  Does that mean that, under this section, a person arrested at 10 a.m. or after that time on a Saturday will not appear in court and will not be allowed bail until 12 noon on the following Monday?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> No.  The detention section would apply for six hours plus six hours.  Somebody could be <Col N="242" /> charged before a peace commissioner and then if it was appropriate be given station bail.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that this section was to replace the necessity to bring them before a peace commissioner and that the Garda would not be obliged to do that but to hold them until the next sitting of the court.  Obviously they may bring them before a peace commissioner but they are not obliged to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The obligation is to bring them before the District Court if it is sitting the following morning.  If the District Court is not sitting then they are free to bring them before a peace commissioner and they will be obliged to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">

      <P>Section 25 (2) states:</P>
      <P>A person arrested without warrant shall, on being charged with an offence ...as soon as is practicable.</P>
      <P>The new section also provides that where a district justice is not immediately available it is sufficient in the case of a person arrested on warrant later than 10 p.m. that such person be brought before a district justice no later than noon on the following day.  In these circumstances I would have thought it was not necessary to have the arrested person brought before a peace commissioner.  I am concerned about the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors' recommend-action that section 25 needs to be clarified if it supersedes section 31 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.  I am also concerned about the comment made by the Association of Criminal Lawyers with regard to section 25 (3).</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Subsection (3) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a person is arrested pursuant to a warrant later than the hour of 10 o'clock on any evening or, having been arrested without warrant, is charged after that hour and a justice is due to sit in the District Court district in which the person was arrested not later than <Col N="243" /> noon on the following day, it shall be sufficient compliance with subsection (1) or (2), as the case may be, if he is brought before a justice at the commencement of the sitting.</P>
    <P>The powers of subsection (3) arise where a District Court sitting is due to sit before noon on the following day and the obligation is to bring him in at the commencement of the sitting.  Existing practice would enable an interpretation which would allow a person to be brought before a District Court at any time on the following day, even in the late afternoon and the amendment suggested by the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors seems to suggest that this discretion should be maintained so that they could bring a person in to be charged up to 4 p.m.  I am not willing to accept that suggestion.  If a person is charged after 10 p.m., is held overnight and if there is a District Court sitting the following day we should insist that the Garda bring the person before that court.</P>
    <P>The question of &ldquo;as soon as is practicable&rdquo;, being substituted for &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; was also raised.  In my opinion &ldquo;as soon as is practicable&rdquo; is a better form of words because practicality means it has to be done immediately unless there is a practical difficulty.  I do not think &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; is as tight a phrase.  It allows greater latitude.  These practices at the moment do not arise from statutory provision but from a practice that has developed over a number of years and from particular court decisions.  What I am doing is making some of the provisions that arise from practice statutory. We are substituting for section 15 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, the various provisions here.  The provisions are tighter and in ease of the person charged. There is not an extension of the latitude provided to the Garda Síochána in the procedures in section 25 to enable them to charge people before a District Court. It is a tightening of the practice that exists.  I recommend this to the House and I am glad I have the co-operation and assistance of Deputy Woods on this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I missed what the Minister said at the outset on section 25 as a whole in relation to section 31 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.  The Garda were concerned that section 25 might supersede section 31 of the 1967 Act which provides for the release of a person on bail by the member in charge of a Garda station.  Whenever a person is brought into custody in a Garda station by a member of the Garda Síochána the sergeant, or other member in charge of the station, may, if he considers it to be prudent to do so and no warrant directing the detention of that person is in force, release him on bail and for that purpose take from him a recognisance with or without sureties for his due appearance at the District Court at the appropriate time and place.  I take it that section 31 still stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Section 31 of the 1967 Act is in effect the statutory provision which is colloquially known as station bail.  If a person is held in a Garda station overnight section 25 applies and the obligation is to bring them before a District Court, if a court is sitting before noon the following day, at the commencement of the sitting.  It does not interfere in any way with the alternative of station bail.  If a person is entitled to station bail they should get it and are not to be held overnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (3) allows a person arrested without warrant but charged after 10 p.m. to be held without being brought to court or before a peace commissioner up to, depending on the court sitting, noon the following day.  That appears to be almost an invitation to make arrests on holding charges at a late hour and question a person without the safeguards provided for a person detained under section 3.  That would mean that only the integrity of the gardaí would prevent abuse of this disingenuous provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Garda are obliged to charge as soon as they have evidence to do so and when a <Col N="245" /> person is charged they cannot, as a general rule, be questioned subsequently.  At the moment the obligation is to bring a person before a District Court, if a court is sitting the following day, as soon as is practicable.  We are tightening that up because we are saying they must be brought in at the commencement of the sitting.  One can envisage a lot of cases listed for a District Court and then being dealt with before the person charged is brought before the court.  I appreciate the Deputy's concern because he was very concerned about section 3 but this provision is in ease of the person who has been detained and charged rather than the opposite.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 49:</P>
      <P>In page 18, subsection (1), line 24, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This section seeks to give the Minister power to make regulations to provide for the recording by electronic or other similar means of the questioning of persons by members of the Garda Síochána at Garda stations or elsewhere.  Subsection (1) states that the Minister may by regulation provide for the recording and that the regulations may be made so as to apply generally or to questioning at certain places.  Amendment No. 49 seeks to replace the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; with the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  It is our view that the Minister should be obliged to make the regulations.  We are seeking the change because with the powers of detention under section 3 it is essential that the recording of questioning takes place.  We are of the opinion that it would be better if the Minister was obliged to ensure that recording takes place rather than leaving it as an option.  Experience with other legislation where an optional power was given to a Minister has in many cases meant that regulations were not introduced. Various reasons were brought forward for not doing that.  Unfortunately, it is true that where a Minister is obliged &mdash; not this Minister &mdash; to introduce regulations they have not been introduced. In view of the wide-ranging effects of the Bill, particularly section 3, the Minister should be obliged to introduce the regulations.  It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that within a few months, or whenever the Minister introduces the regulations bringing the provisions of the Bill into operation, he, or the Government, may claim that it is too costly to introduce these recording processes and systems.  For that reason we would ask the Minister to accept our amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a fairly long debate earlier on the whole question of electronic <Col N="247" /> and other recording.  It arose when I put down a number of amendments which proposed certain safeguards and I do not intend to go back over that ground.  I expect that the Minister will state his position again as to what he is doing about this section in general.  We know from some of the reports we quoted that there are considerable difficulties in implementing this section in practical terms and the Minister has undertaken to have it examined as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>The Minister has tabled amendment No. 51 which states:</P>
      <P>In page 18, subsection (3), lines 33 to 36, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;and for supplying&rdquo; to the end of the subsection.</P>
      <P>Section 26 (3) states:</P>
      <P>(3) The regulations shall include provision for the preservation, for such time and in such manner as may be prescribed therein, of every recording made in accordance with the regulations and for supplying, on request, the person questioned or his counsel or solicitor with a copy of the recording if any criminal or civil proceedings are instituted to which it is or may be relevant.</P>
      <P>What the Minister is proposing is to delete the second half of this subsection, including &ldquo;and for supplying&rdquo;, thus he is doing away with the provision for making the recording available in criminal or civil proceedings to the person questioned or to his solicitor or counsel.  The Minister included this provision initially and I assume he had good reason for so doing.  I would be concerned about any possible reason for depriving people who want to defend and vindicate their constitutional rights.</P>
      <P>Under Article 40 the State is bound to defend and vindicate the fundamental rights of the citizen.  Article 40.3.1º states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State guarantees in its laws to <Col N="248" /> respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen.</P>
    <P>Article 40.3.2º states:</P>
    <P>The State shall, in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name, and property rights of every citizen.</P>
    <P>There is clearly an onus on the State and consequently on the Department and the Minister to protect, defend and vindicate the rights of the citizen under the Constitution. Obviously the reason for putting in this subsection originally was to ensure that a person could vindicate his good name and exercise his rights in that respect.  I find it hard to see why the Minister wants to take out this provision at this stage.  It looks as if somebody came to the Minister and said it would cause a lot of bother and difficulty.  I should like to hear the Minister's views on this matter. It would seem to be a valuable protection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Our spokesman has raised the question which concerns me. Whilst from time to time during the course of the debate one may have been at odds with The Workers' Party on a number of their amendments and proposals, there may be some substance in their proposal to change the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in subsections (1) and (2).  I have no doubt the Minister will have a better reason for retaining the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; rather than substituting the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  For the time being I would be supportive of the The Workers' Party in relation to the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the requirement under Article 40.3.2º of the Constitution, the right of the citizen to his good name is sacred.  The Minister has from time to time compared this legislation with legislation in another jurisdiction and I am not certain whether recordings are made available in the circumstances envisaged in the existing subsection.  In continental countries, to the best of my knowledge, <Col N="249" /> recordings are made available to the citizen in the interests of the preservation of the good name of that citizen.  Why has the Minister changed his mind by the introduction of a proposal to delete the second half of section 26 (3)?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to spare the Minister from having to repeat something he said earlier.  Section 26 confers on the Minister the power to make regulations to provide for the recording by electronic or other similar means of the questioning of persons by members of the Garda Síochána at Garda Síochána stations or elsewhere in connection with the investigation of offences.  The section does not impose a duty on the Minister to make such regulations.  It goes on to provide that any failure to comply with a provision of the regulations will not of itself render inadmissible in evidence anything said during such questioning.  I can think of several reasons why he wants to make this change.  I will leave it to the Minister to enunciate them.</P>
      <P>In this connection the Ó Briain Committee recommended that feasibility studies should be instituted at once to establish whether video taping of interrogations in the investigation of serious crime is a viable proposition.  In addition they recommended that tape recording should be tried on as wide a basis as possible.  They said it was fully appreciated that a variety of technical and legal difficulties will have to be surmounted but they believed that a start should be made at once in trying out mechanical aids and that persons being questioned should be informed that the interrogation is being recorded.  Their report so recommended.</P>
      <P>I should be interested to hear the Minister's reasons for removing this section. From the research I have done I can think of several reasons why it would be practicable to do that at present, that its provisions would not necessarily be feasible given the present crime and subversive situations in the country.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I should like to make some general comments about the section.  Then I should like to <Col N="250" /> deal with the amendment in the names of Deputies Mac Giolla and De Rossa.  If it is in order, while commenting on the section, I propose to move amendment No. 51 and to comment on that.</P>
      <P>First of all, the Ó Briain Report made this type of recommendation.  The idea of electronically recording a Garda investigation, the questioning of a detainee by the Garda Síochána is to provide a major safeguard for the person who is detained in custody and who is being questioned by the Garda Síochána.  The phrase used is &ldquo;electronic recording&rdquo; because there are a number of options.  People have been talking about tape recording but, of course, it could be video recording, or it could be silent video where there would be observation rather than a sound track.</P>
      <P>The Ó Briain Report recommended that pilot schemes be set up forthwith but that was never done.  Before the Criminal Justice Bill was published I appointed a committee to examine the situation.  That was the first time to my knowledge that any examination was instituted in this country of the possibility of the use of electronic recording in Garda stations to monitor the questioning of detained persons. The committee was comprised of Mr. Noel Ryan, a Principal Officer in the Department of Justice, Mr. James G. Lacey of the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering in UCD and Superintendent Hubert Reynolds of the Garda Síochána.  Mr. Paul Hickey, of my Department, is secretary to the Committee.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of that advisory committee are:</P>
      <P>(a)  to examine and report on the measures necessary to introduce a system for electronic recording of questioning of persons by members of the Garda Síochána in connection with the investigation of an offence.</P>
      <P>(b)  to examine in particular whether such recording should apply generally or to questioning at particular places, the extent to which and the circumstances in which it should apply and whether it should apply to all or only some offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="251" /> (c)  to recommend the type of equipment required for such recording and any necessary modifications to Garda stations.</P>
    <P>(d)  to estimate the cost of such equipment and modifications and any other costs involved.</P>
    <P>(e)  to report on the arrangements necessary to meet the reasonable requirement of the defence and prosecution in this regard; and</P>
    <P>(f)  to report on any other matter that the committee considered to be relevant to the foregoing.</P>
    <P>That committee have been working and they have proceeded with all possible speed to have field trials introduced. They have been in Scotland and in England to study developments there. They are working closely with the Garda authorities in planning what has to be done.  They expect to visit some United States jurisdictions to examine, in particular, video recording which is widely used there.  A lot of work has been done now but a lot still remains to be done before we will be ready to move to pilot schemes.  It will then be necessary to evaluate the pilot schemes before electronic recording can be introduced as general practice.</P>
    <P>Deputies might remember that when I spoke about section 3 I was asked about the suitability of Garda stations for detained persons.  I pointed out that it would be the major Garda stations in Dublin that would be used and also that it would be a question of two, three or, at the most, four district headquarters stations in the rural Garda Divisions. Therefore in a place like Wexford there would be perhaps three or four centres where a person would be detained.  Consequently, when it comes to electronic recording we are not suggesting that the facilities should be provided in every Garda station in the country.  What I am saying is that they would be provided in those Garda stations where it would be customary to detain people under section 3.</P>
    <P>It is not easy to introduce this practice <Col N="252" /> quickly.  I want to make it clear that there is a difficulty in being able to introduce tape recording immediately the provisions of the Bill are implemented because research has not been done in this country and pilot studies have not yet been set up.  Elsewhere in Europe, even in England, they had been discussing tape recording for many years.  They expect four years to elapse in England before they are able to introduce it there.  In Scotland field trials have been going on for approximately three years now.  I suspect that in certain police districts in Britain there is a reluctance to move towards electronic recording anyway and I would think the delays there are very long indeed.  A lot of research has now been done elsewhere and we can benefit from that research.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the amendment in the names of Deputies Mac Giolla and De Rossa.  I have made it clear that there is a commitment to introduce tape recording, or electronic recording but it can be done only following a thorough examination of the legal and technical difficulties involved.  As I have said, I have set up a committee which intends to carry out field trials.</P>
    <P>The reason I am reluctant to change from the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is that I must proceed on the matter in a systematic way.  I would be afraid that if the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; were included and some unavoidable delay arose a court order could be obtained to compel me to proceed notwithstanding our state of readiness.  There must be some flexibility to enable the problems to be thoroughly studied.  I have already encountered a difficulty.  I inserted a provision in the original section that copies of recordings would be supplied to the accused, his solicitor or counsel.  At the time we knew very little about tape recording and I inserted that provision in good faith.  The section would have placed an obligation on me to provide in the regulations for a copy of the recording to be supplied to the accused, his solicitor or counsel in every case.  I now have amendment No. 51 down to delete this provision.  Deputies Woods, David Andrews and Skelly asked me to explain why I feel it is now <Col N="253" /> necessary to delete this provision.  It is not a question of the Minister making some concession to any particular interest group but a real, practical difficulty has arisen.  First of all, there is the problem of providing recordings in cases where interests of third parties would be jeopardised.  Until the questions have been examined in detail and a solution worked out it would be undesirable to maintain the existing provision in the section.  The committee I set up to advise me on the introduction of tape recording are looking at this and all other aspects of the problem and they are taking in the experience in other jurisdictions.  Of course the House can take it that, in whatever solution is adopted, it would be essential that adequate facilities would be afforded to enable the accused, his solicitor or counsel to listen to tape recordings in order to prepare a defence.  To put it in straightforward terms, whatever I provide here will have to be extended to people who are detained under the Offences Against the State Act.</P>
    <P>The Provisional IRA run a reasonably disciplined military organisation.  Perhaps I should have seen it when I drafted the section but it seems obvious to me now that an obligation to supply a tape recording of an interrogation in a Garda station to members of the Provisional IRA who have been detained, and who may have given information to the Garda Síochána, puts that person in absolute risk of his life.  The very possession of the tape recording would bring about a situation in which whatever chain of command is in existence in the Provisional IRA would require the handing-up of the tape so that superior officers &mdash; if I can use the term loosely &mdash; could listen to the tape and monitor what had been said by their members to the Garda.</P>
    <P>The same problem arises in relation to organised crime.  I envisage the situation of a drug pusher being questioned.  The questioning is recorded and there is an obligation in the section that a copy of the recording be given to the suspect. Now, for a member of an organised criminal gang, it is reasonable to expect that he would not be allowed to be the only listener to his own tape and it certainly, <Col N="254" /> if he gave any information, would put him at risk.  Consequently there is a double difficulty.  There is the difficulty of third parties with a vested interest listening to the tape and jeopardising the welfare of the person who is being detained and who has given information to the Garda Síochána.  Then there is the intimidatory effect.  The very fact that a recording existed and would be supplied would in many cases be sufficient reason for a detained person saying nothing if he was involved in one of the groups who organise crime or in one of the subversive organisations.  Therefore, I am moving this amendment not because I have been pressurised by any pressure group who do not like the idea of tape recording.  It is for very valid reasons indeed.  I take Deputy Woods's point.  He quoted an Article of the Constitution with which we all became very familiar last year, and it is nice to hear the familiar words echoing through the House at 2 o'clock in the morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It does indeed.  The House can take it that it would be essential in whatever solution is adopted to this problem that adequate facilities would be afforded to enable the accused and his solicitor or counsel to listen to the tape recordings in order to prepare a defence, rather than creating a mandatory requirement for the person questioned to be supplied with a copy of the recording with the intention of creating a safeguard and in ease of his situation but which, in effect, could put him in jeopardy.  The regulations would have to include provisions to the effect that the accused or his solicitor or counsel could listen to whatever recording was available, if it was an audio recording, to enable him or them to prepare a defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 26(2) allows flexibility to enable electronic recording to be introduced on a phased basis in relation to specific offences or at designated Garda stations. I have mentioned already that it would be designated Garda stations.  In the first instance, the motivation for electronic <Col N="255" /> recording would be to provide a safeguard for people who are being detained under the provisions of this Bill or under the Offences Against the State Act.  As I have indicated to the House, we are talking about a small number of Garda stations in each division for this purpose. Many of them are quite modern.  The Garda station building programme is proceeding quite satisfactorily and it would be those Garda stations which would be designated.  We have in mind here the possible difficulties of the section 30 cases and in those cases I am open to the option of excluding audio recordings for some of the reasons I have outlined, and thinking in terms of silent video instead of audio recordings.</P>
    <P>Section 26(3) provides that the regulations must prescribe the period and manner of preservation of the recordings. I have already referred to the amendment I am moving to section 26(3) and the necessity for removing a portion of the section.</P>
    <P>Section 26 (4) provides that failure to comply with the regulations will not by itself make the person responsible liable to civil or criminal proceedings.  This is necessary to preclude the possibility of actions being taken against individual gardaí in respect of breaches &mdash; however trivial &mdash; of the regulations.  Breach of the regulations &mdash; in other words failure to tape-record &mdash; will also not by itself render inadmissible statements obtained during questioning.  However, the subsection will not affect the right of the court to exclude evidence at its discretion. This means that it will still be open to the court to exclude evidence which has not been recorded.  Obviously, when tape recording is in operation, culpable failure to record, when recording ought to have taken place will, in the absence of a satisfactory explanation cast serious doubt on any alleged inculpatory statement made by an accused.  The garda tendering the evidence will bear a very heavy burden to satisfy the court that the evidence should be admitted and most probably it will be excluded.</P>
    <P>This is an enabling section.  I see it as a serious obligation to introduce recording <Col N="256" /> with all possible speed as a safeguard for detained persons.  I must refuse to accept The Workers' Party amendment because if &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;may&rdquo; and I am obliged by a court to deliver on &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, I may not be in a position to deliver on it because the research has not been done and it will take some time before the research is done and the practical decisions are taken.  However, I will proceed with all possible speed.  Tape recording of questioning of persons by members of the Garda Síochána at Garda stations and elsewhere has wider implications than questioning under section 3 of this Bill. Deputies will remember that we have already moved and accepted an amendment here that sections 3 to 8 and 13 to 18 will have a temporary life unless reactivated by this House.  As I have said on a number of occasions, while on Committee Stage, I moved an amendment that the duration of these sections would be five years, on Report Stage I will be reducing that to four years.  At the end of four years in assessing the efficacy of these sections, obviously the question of whether in the meantime facilities for recording have been introduced into designated Garda stations would weigh heavily on the minds of Deputies when they come to reassess whether they will reactivate them.  While Deputies would feel free to argue that there might be a long delay, there is also a time limit on me or any other Minister.  I hope that we will move to pilot schemes reasonably quickly and that the designated Garda stations can be equipped so that we can provide this safeguard which in our jurisdiction was recommended initially by the Ó Briain Report.  I said at the outset that I did not intend going back over the ground covered earlier and that essentially I accept the bona fides of the Minister in this regard.  From what he has said now it is clear that he has gone ahead with the committee fairly urgently.  This is very much in line with the debate we had earlier.  I accept, too, that his intention is to proceed urgently with the studies that were recommended some time ago and I hope that this will result in the developments we desire.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="257" /> I said at the time also that I recognised the possibility of video being desirable in certain cases.  I was thinking particularly of drug cases or of cases where people wished to give information they do not wish to have on tape, in other words, that they would accept a video operating in the room but not a sound tape.  I am happy to leave the matter with the Minister and we look forward to hearing from him on it in the future.  I appreciate also that he would intend keeping in line with the constitutional requirements by providing necessary access in a way that will not upset the work of the Garda.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister can tell us what status the pilot schemes he talks of will have.  I take it they will have no status so far as this Bill is concerned. How are these schemes to be monitored and by whom in terms of ascertaining how effective they are or which system or combination of systems is best?  Also, is this House to have any say in the operation of these pilot schemes?  The House is being asked to pass the Bill, particularly section 3, with the right to detain for up to 20 hours but there is no provision to cover a situation of possible abuse under section 3 which as the Minister suggested might not be reviewed for up to four years.  Obviously, if it transpires that recording has not been introduced when the legislation is being reviewed the attitude of Deputies to the section will be coloured.  I contend that 12 months would be far too long to wait for a system of recording in respect of the detention section.  The Ó Briain Report which has been quoted so many times contains a strong view that a recording system ought to be introduced in cases of detention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The pilot schemes would be experimental.  They would be the schemes from which the technical difficulties and the general legal implications of the scheme could be worked out.  There are considerable difficulties involved in introducing electronic recording as has been evidenced by the experience in other countries. Such an initiative would have to be studied <Col N="258" /> not only from the technical point of view but also in terms of its implications for the legal system before a system that would work properly could be devised. There are implications for the work not only of the Garda but for the courts, for the defence and the prosecution lawyers and in respect of rules of evidence, not to mention the technical difficulties associated with having machines that are tamper proof.</P>
      <P>One of the problems that would arise immediately would be the possibility of doctoring tapes.  Tape can be cut and matched fairly easily.  It is not a very difficult exercise to cut and splice audio tape.  Many homes in which there is audio equipment also have equipment &mdash; which is not very expensive &mdash; the equipment required for such a task.  Magnetic tape used for sound can be spliced also.  This is not a highly skilled operation either but I understand there is equipment on the market which can detect where tapes have been tampered with.  I understand that by running a tape through a certain type of unit the matching, not of the up-front sound but of the background sound is absolutely foolproof in establishing whether a tape has been tampered with. This equipment can bring up the background noise with the various variations on it.</P>
      <P>On the question of who would monitor all this, I think a steering committee, representative of all the interests, the courts, the prosecution and the defence, must be set up to oversee the operation so as to ensure the fullest co-operation of all the interests concerned.</P>
      <P>I cannot give an answer as to what timescale might be involved.  All I can say is that I have proceeded with speed on this section and that I will proceed as quickly as possible with the pilot schemes.  Then, when information has been collected from those schemes, I will proceed to introduce the scheme more widely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (2) of section 26 provides that the regulations may be made so as to apply generally or to questioning in such places, to such extent, in relation to such offences or in such circumstances, as may be prescribed therein.  That enables <Col N="259" /> one to introduce a statutory scheme but it does not put a statutory obligation on the Minister or on an administration to do everything at the one time.  We must proceed slowly in this matter. Deputies will appreciate the difficulty of substituting the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; because to use the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; could compel the Minister or a subsequent Minister to attempt to do something that he is not in a position to do and which consequently would bring about a situation in which it would be impossible for anyone to be interviewed at a Garda station, whether under section 3 of the Bill, under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act or under any other legislation or in a case of a person being arrested and asked a couple of questions for the purpose of checking out ambiguities in a statement made voluntarily after he had been charged.  Major difficulties would follow if it were to be mandatory on the Minister to introduce such provision. Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.  I have dealt already with the necessity for the deletion of the words in subsection (3) and I think Deputies will accept the explanation I gave in that regard.  Otherwise, I would be willing to accept any import that any Deputy would wish to make because we are at the stage of studying the situation with all possible speed with a view to implementing pilot schemes.  I would welcome any strong view a Deputy may have or any expertise he may have and which he may wish to use in putting forward a submission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In a submission which I received from the Inchicore Against Vandalism Committee, it is stated in relation to section 26 that the committee are all aware of how ineffective this revision may be, that it is very easy to edit or to accidentally cause a breakdown in the mechanical means used as was shown clearly in the Watergate case.  That indicates that there is a readily acceptable understanding of the Minister's reluctance to introduce such a measure at this time.  It is unfortunate that mainly because of subversives operating within our society, the Minister's amendment <Col N="260" /> had to be included here.  This is another example of the reason for the Special Criminal Court.  It is really in the hands of the subversives themselves to bring about an end to the necessity for that court.  This applies also in respect of recording.  In this age of high technology it would be irresponsible if the Minister introduced such a system without having it fully checked out and satisfying himself that it was foolproof and that it could not be interfered with or abused in any way. I have no objection to the Minister's amendment.  I also see why he cannot accept the other two amendments.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> As regards my amendment it is not just a question of subversives or organised crime.  There is also the rights of third parties.  If during the questioning of a person by a garda the person slanders a third party and if the tape is played to other people, there is the question of a civil action being taken by the third party. I know that people outside the House have commented on this amendment and said it was backing down from a commitment given originally.  They said quite openly that it was because of pressure from the Garda.  It is not.  There are very valid reasons for introducing this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made a very strong case regarding my amendments. We are faced with the dilemma that section 3 is giving a new power of detention and there is an obvious need to ensure that it is not abused in any way. The fact that the Minister has introduced section 26 is an acceptance by him that there is need to assure people that section 3 will not be abused and that there is need to provide a recording system.  At the same time we are being asked to pass this Bill which includes section 3.  Section 26 will not be operative until such time as some proven electronic system is introduced. Has the Minister looked at the possibility of introducing any other form of recording?  I am thinking about a clerk or stenographer being present at the questioning in the interim period between the introduction of section 3 and <Col N="261" /> the developing of an electronic system of recording.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I have not looked at that suggestion.  It comes as a cross between custodial guardian and the idea of recording.  Difficulties would arise if the stenographer was employed in the Garda station and recorded all interviews between the Garda and detainees. I would be surprised if the Deputy would think that was an adequate safeguard. If there is a danger that electronic recordings can be damaged or tampered with, arguing from the Deputy's standpoint the idea of a regular Garda or civilian employed in a Garda Station with a notebook and pencil recording the interview between the Garda and the accused, would not only prove very expensive but might not prove to be the effective safeguard the Deputy requires.</P>
      <P>We did not leave section 3 without safeguards.  A person can only be detained on reasonable suspicion.  They can only be arrested on reasonable suspicion when there is an existing power of arrest without warrant.  The member in charge of the station must be satisfied. For extra periods of detention the authorisation of the chief superintendent is required.  The detained person must be informed of their right of access to a solicitor.  A young person must be informed of their right to inform their parent or guardian.  The parent or guardian has a right to be present.  We are committed to a complaints procedure with an independent element.  We have a commitment to introduce regulations amending and developing the existing internal Garda regulations for treatment of people in custody.  It is not as if we came to this section without any safeguards. We have wide ranging safeguards in this Bill.</P>
      <P>There are very real practical difficulties and these have not always been met in other jurisdictions.  We need not experience the delays they have experienced because we can learn from them.  There is no point in my saying this can be delivered next week.  It will take a while but we are working on it with all possible speed.</P>

      <P>In relation to subsection (3) and the vindication of an innocent person, I agree with the Minister regarding subversive organisations who have little if any regard for justice in the context of the type of law they apply to people who do not agree with them.

      <P>In replying to my suggestion concerning a manual system of recording the events, the Minister indicated that he thought it might be expensive to introduce that kind of system.  He also intimated I might consider it less than perfect because it would be a civilian employee or a garda who would be involved in doing the recording.</P>
      <P>What I am suggesting is a temporary measure while the Minister is working out the electronic system proposed in this section.  I do not have any hang ups about the garda being involved in taking the notes of the proceedings.  We already had the section which dealt with the member in charge being responsible for various functions and seeing that regulations are enforced and complied with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should consider an interim measure to ensure that there is a reasonably detailed recording of what takes place during the detention of a person under section 3.  At present and until such time as an electronic system is installed, the only record of what transpires <Col N="263" /> are the notes the garda carrying out the questioning may keep.  Obviously those notes will be of whatever admissions a detained person makes, or of information which will be to the benefit of the case the garda wants to build.  The Minister should be a bit more forthcoming in relation to a recording system which would operate from the time section 3 comes into operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I will come back to first principles.  There are two reasons why persons have advocated a recording system.  First, if it is a video recording, to have a visual recording to ensure that the treatment of the person in custody is monitored and that there is a record of how they are treated.  Consequently, this is a safeguard against their physical ill treatment.  Second, if it is a tape recording, to ensure that any statement made by a detained person, which was purported to be voluntary and which was being produced in court in evidence, would be an independent means of monitoring of whether this statement had been extracted voluntarily.</P>
      <P>If I were to accept Deputy De Rossa's suggestion for a stenographer in a Garda station, that stenographer would either be a member of the Garda Síochána or a civilian employed by the Garda station. If it is the Deputy's case &mdash; and it seems to have been when we were discussing section 3 &mdash; that the Garda would invent confessions if there was no monitoring of the questioning of the detained person, it is logical from some Deputies' point of view to suggest that they might invent complete stenographic record to correspond with an invented confession.  Consequently, I am arguing from his standpoint and can see no particular merit in the type of safeguard the Deputy suggests. I would prefer to rely on the many safeguards in the Bill, in the statutory regulations and the complaints board with a very strong independent element, and to work on this section so that, at an early date, we can move from an examination of the feasibility to pilot schemes and from that to the introduction of the system generally.  That is my position.</P>

If he examines the record he will see that I never at any time claimed that the Garda would invent confessions.  I argued that the detention was wrong, because basically there was no evidence to indicate that detention would lead to any diminution of the crime rate or any increase in the crime detection rate.  That was my argument.  I never claimed the Garda would invent confessions.</P>

      <P>This has been a long debate and the Minister may have confused my contribution with that of another Deputy.  The Minister has explained that there are practical difficulties in introducing electronic monitoring of events during detention or during questioning.  I am willing to accept that there are practical difficulties, but I have a practical difficulty too.  Section 3 gives the power to detain for up to 20 hours. There is a very strong recommendation in the Ó Briain Report that there should be a monitoring of detention and questioning during detention.  The Minister accepts that need, even if only to assure the population at large that there can be no possibility of detention being abused. My argument is that in order to give that assurance a form of recording should be introduced by the Minister when section 3 is made operative.  I argued that there is a need to provide this in order to give an assurance to the public.</P>

    <P>I recognise that the Minister may have financial difficulties providing stenographers or whatever manual system is introduced, but the need is there and it would be essential that a form such as this be introduced.  It is very difficult to accept, on the face of it, that we can pass a section on detention given that everybody believes there is a need for a recording system and that that detention section will operate before any recording system <Col N="265" /> is introduced, but I urge the Minister to rethink his position in relation to my suggestion. I am not saying it is the best possible suggestion because there may be variations on it which could be introduced by the Minister.  I am very anxious to ensure that a recording system of some form be introduced as soon as section 3 becomes operative.</P>

      <P>It is clear that we all want to see some form of recording introduced, but there are practical difficulties which emerged during the earlier discussions we had on the section dealing with safeguards.  It is clear that the Minister is pursuing this as vigorously as one could expect.  He has given undertakings to come back to the House when he has something to report in that area, and I accept those assurances.  He has also given an undertaking in relation to safeguards to consider providing a means for the person who is detained to record notes or make notes.  I have found in a number of cases that this was very valuable to the person concerned because they were able to keep brief notes of what happened and when they happened.  The Minister said he would consider this.  It is not as difficult as electronic recording and it would produce a record of the period. What the Minister proposes here is reasonable.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Subsection (1) empowers the Garda to take the fingerprints of a person convicted of an indictable offence or dealt with under the Probation Act.  The fingerprints may be taken within the precincts of the court or at some other convenient place.  At present the Garda rely on the regulations as to Measuring and Photographing of Prisoners 1955 (S.I. No. 144) made under the Penal Servitude Act, 1891, for authority to take fingerprints of persons in custody who have been charged.  There is a serious doubt as to whether this is a valid basis for fingerprinting persons.</P>
      <P>The provision in this subsection has been criticised on the grounds that it permits fingerprinting of persons dealt with under the Probation Act.  This, it is said, is contrary to the spirit of the Probation Act which is concerned with giving people a second chance.  You dealt with this point in your reply to the Second Stage debate where you said that the Act is widely used in our courts and that even people with several previous convictions are sometimes dealt with under it.  Application of the Act does not mean that the accused has been acquitted.  The reality is that the offence has been proved although there is no formal conviction. In many cases offenders dealt with in this way go on to commit further offences. The Garda need to be able to fingerprint such a person and to retain the records so as to facilitate subsequent detections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to note that the subsection applies only to a person prosecuted for an indictable offence, although he <Col N="267" /> may be prosecuted summarily in the District Court.  It has no application therefore in relation to a person prosecuted for a summary offence.  It has been suggested by the Law Society that it should apply only to persons convicted on indictment. This would considerably narrow the scope of it.  As has been indicated, many serious offenders are dealt with in the District Court.  Many of them in fact plead guilty and it would be wrong to exclude them.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) imposes a time limit of one week after the date on which the person is convicted or dealt with under the Probation Act within which the Garda must take the fingerprints unless the person has made it impracticable for them to do so &mdash; for example by absconding. Subsection (3) makes it an offence for a person to refuse to allow his fingerprints to be taken; it will be a purely summary offence punishable with a maximum fine of £1,000 and/or 12 months imprisonment.</P>
    <P>I agreed when we were discussing section 6 to bring in an amendment on Report Stage to provide for the destruction of fingerprints, taken under section 5, of a person later dealt with under the Probation Act.  I said the destruction would be after a period during which the person had not come under unfavourable notice and had not been guilty of an offence.  Of course, many people dealt with under the Probation Act can come under notice four or five times.  It is desirable that such young offenders would not have a Garda record and would have their fingerprints destroyed after a period during which they have not come under unfavourable notice during a specific time.  So far, I have not decided on the time, but I will consider an amendment for Report Stage.  I need to give the matter more attention before I can be more specific.  I want to link up matters as we have discussed them on section 6 with section 27.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister quite correctly wants to obtain the fingerprints of convicted persons and he will be able to do so under this section.  I welcome his <Col N="268" /> firm commitment to a limited period in relation to those who are given the benefit of the Probation of Offenders Act.  I do not know what period the Minister is thinking about, certainly I should not like it to be longer than two years, in other words that if the people concerned do not again come under the attention of the Garda within that two year period, then the fingerprints will be destroyed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a question for detailed study.  In effect, the period of probation could be reasonably long.  If that period is one during which a person is under observation, in any event, one would hope that would be included in the two year period.  I agree very much with Deputy De Rossa on that point.  Deputy De Rossa already had an amendment down, so instead of putting one down ourselves, we supported his at the time.</P>
      <P>This is a very important matter, especially for young people.  The Minister has accepted the spirit of what has been said. I press on the Minister at this stage that the period should not be too long.  Such people will be on the records and the sooner they can get back into the normal mainstream, after a reasonable period, the better.  The Garda must have a reasonable time, for practical reasons, for keeping the fingerprints.  I suggest that the Minister consider a two year limit when he is thinking of a Report Stage amendment.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, some suggestions made were in relation to the Incorporated Law Society's views about most modern statutes providing that offences are prosecuted either summarily or by indictment.  A great many minor offences can, therefore, be prosecuted by indictment. In their view, the section should relate only to cases in which a person is convicted on indictment.  Obviously, the Minister feels that this would exclude too many cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the other end, offences, such as an employee overcharging on the famous oft-quoted pound of butter, the man erecting an extension without permission, <Col N="269" /> the publican not providing sufficient exit doors and the man selling his wares on the street without a licence, all can be tried on indictment.  It is not likely, in practical terms, that the Garda would want fingerprints in many of these cases. It would create some difficulty, probably, if a schedule of offences were included. I do not really see any easy way out of the position as the Minister explained it. We shall accept that and look, in particular, for the amendment on Report Stage in relation to those who are dealt with under the Probation of Offenders Act, which may affect me in making any amendment to section 6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to introducing an amendment on Report Stage which will require the destruction of the fingerprints after a specified period.  The Minister should consider a maximum limit of two years, including the probation period.  My amendment on the earlier section was aimed at having persons on probation exempted from having their fingerprints taken.  However, I am quite willing to accept the Minister's commitment that he will introduce an amendment which will limit the period during which fingerprints can be held.  I would urge him to make that period as short as possible.</P>

These are, after all, usually first offences and this is an opportunity to keep a clean sheet rather than be recorded permanently on the criminal files.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> This <Col N="270" /> section enables the Minister for Defence to make regulations applying, with appropriate modifications, provisions such as those relating to inferences in section 16 which has now gone, sections 17 and 18, trial procedure, sections 19 to 24, inclusive, trial by court-martial. Section 201 of the Defence Act, 1954 provides that the rules of evidence to be adopted before court-martial will be the same as those which, for the time being, are followed in civil courts.  Under the Court-Martial Appeals Act, 1983, court-martial convictions may now be appealed to the Courts-martial Appeal Court, which corresponds generally to the Court of Criminal Appeal.</P>
      <P>As court-martial procedures may, in due course, come under scrutiny of the appeal court, it is desirable that such procedures should be kept in line with the procedure in operation in the civil court system.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £10,056,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1984 for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Energy including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain loans, subsidies, grants and grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>Although this is my first time to present an Estimate for the Department of Energy, I have already been able to indicate to the House, when I availed of the opportunity given to me by an Adjournment debate last December, those aspects of energy resources policy which I believe to be particularly significant.  I welcome this further opportunity of going into more detail in describing the role which I see for my Department, and of hearing the views of Deputies in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the fact that the Estimate for my Department is quite small, my <Col N="273" /> Department's role in the public sector is one of considerable extent.  In addition to the activities for which my Department exercise direct responsibility for expenditure from the Vote, I am answerable for the plans and overall operations of the four very important State agencies in the energy area &mdash; the ESB, Bord na Móna, Bord Gáis Éireann and the Irish National Petroleum Corporation.  I will, therefore, advert in my speech to the work of these agencies so as to give Deputies an opportunity to discuss all aspects of energy policy.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the expenditure requirements of my Department I am glad to be able to say that my Department are making an increasing and, by now, very significant contribution to the revenues of the State.  Over the years determined efforts have been made to use our natural resources for the benefit of the whole community.  The utilisation of our natural gas is now contributing substantial amounts of revenue.  This contribution however is not reflected in the Estimate before you, as it is presented in the traditional form.  Some £54 million will be remitted by BGE direct to the Exchequer on foot of receipts for natural gas and BGE will also fund from its own resources an estimated 30 per cent of projected capital expenditure on the gas transmission network, a further £5 million. It is expected that Marathon will pay about £5.6 million in royalties to the Exchequer in 1984.  I would also like to draw attention to the fact that availability of natural gas to the ESB has reduced the fuel bill of that organisation by the order of £100 million, as against the position where no natural gas was available.  We have, of course, to offset against this capital charges associated with the provision of gas burning plant.  In its continuing licensing activities, my Department have secured interests for the State in exploration consortia which have been estimated to be worth of the order of £4.5 million.</P>
    <P>I will now begin with some general observations on the Estimate itself. Deputies will note that the Estimate for this year is just over £10 million and shows an increase in net expenditure of <Col N="274" /> approximately £1.2 million over the outturn for 1983.  The increase in gross expenditure is much the same since the estimated total receipts from Appropriations in Aid for 1984 show very little change from the 1983 outturn.  There is increased expenditure in ten subheads totalling £2,791,000 offset by reductions totalling £1,542,000 in other subheads. Most of the increased expenditure arises from subhead P. &mdash; FEOGA &mdash; Western Aid Electrification &mdash; on which an estimated £1,870,000 will be spent from the Vote.  This is a capital service.  The largest reductions in expenditure are in Subhead L &mdash; State Support for Mining Operations (£521,000) and J &mdash; Town Gas Subsidy (£390,000).  About a quarter of the gross expenditure is provided for capital services.  As well as FEOGA, £1 million has been provided for private bog development (Subhead M) and £97,000 for investigation of new and renewable sources of energy (Subhead N).</P>
    <P>Following the two oil shocks of the seventies, all Governments and the public came to realise the economic and security implications of energy supplies. This has now become a major issue for domestic policy and international collaboration through agencies such as the EEC and the IEA (International Energy Agency).  The major objectives of most energy policies are to reduce excessive dependence on oil and other imported energy, to improve security of supply, to diversify fuel sources, to improve efficiency in utilising energy and to reduce its cost to consumers.  Success in achieving these objectives takes a considerable number of years and, in some cases, requires heavy investment.  A major effort has been made in Ireland and I am glad to report that our progress has been recognised in, for example, a recent review of energy policies carried out by the EEC Commission.  While much remains to be done we can say that our energy structure is today a great deal more secure and diversified than it was some four or five years ago.</P>
    <P>There has been a significant transformation of our energy utilisation including the flexibility to use different fuels, and undesirable trends have been reversed. <Col N="275" /> Up to 1979 energy consumption had been growing rapidly at a rate of 6-7 per cent per year based entirely on imported oil. In that year &mdash; 1979 &mdash; we imported 80 per cent of our energy, and oil made up over 70 per cent of the total.  A policy of utilising our own resources of natural gas and peat and increased efficiency in utilising energy has changed this.  The growth in energy consumption has been stopped and it is now falling slowly.  Domestic production of energy has almost doubled and imports have fallen correspondingly so that today about 40 per cent of our requirements are now produced at home. A more dramatic change has occurred in oil consumption which has fallen by one-third over the past four years and now supplied just under half of our total usage.</P>
    <P>This improvement in our vulnerability has not been achieved without cost.  The production of energy and its diversification calls for heavy investment.  The capital investment programmes of Bord na Móna and the ESB have been particularly large and are now approaching completion.  Substantial investment in natural gas distribution has also occurred and will continue for some years to come in order to exploit the market for gas in our towns, cities and industries.  I will now deal with the major State agencies in the energy sector.</P>
    <P>The Electricity Supply Board's capital expenditure for 1984 will be of the order of £249 million.  Since the two oil crises of the 1970s, the thrust of the ESB's generation strategy has been to diversify away from imported oil as a fuel source and make maximum use of native fuel resources.</P>
    <P>The most significant change in the ESB's fuel mix in the past five years has been the replacement of oil by gas for a substantial amount of its electricity generation. As recently as 1979, nearly three-quarters of our electricity was generated from oil.  Natural gas had just become available.  Today, oil-generated electricity is down to its lowest level of just over 20 per cent and gas-generated electricity is now more than 50 per cent of the total.  This dramatic change was <Col N="276" /> achieved through investment in new plant at Aghada, County Cork, and North Wall in Dublin, and conversion to gas burning of existing oil-fired plant at Marina, County Cork, and Poolbeg in Dublin.</P>
    <P>This investment of about £100 million has already brought significant benefits, both nationally and to the ESB customer as compared with continued reliance on oil.  At end March, 1984, it had saved the ESB customer about £262 million compared with oil generation and it had reduced the balance of payments by £355 million through the replacement of expensive imported oil by indigenous natural gas.  In addition, Bord Gáis Éireann had been able to contribute £109 million to the Exchequer, largely from sales to the ESB.</P>
    <P>This rate of gas usage could not be continued indefinitely and, timed to coincide with the phasing out of natural gas, the ESB are planning to commission a coal-fired generating plant at Moneypoint in County Clare.  This is scheduled to come on stream in three phases in 1985, 1986 and 1987.  With the plant fully operational the position will be that, by the end of this decade, the ESB should be producing 50 per cent of all electricity from coal, a further quarter or so would be provided by hydro and milled peat and the remaining quarter would be provided either from gas depending on future availabilities, imported oil, or further development such as conversion of existing oil or gas-fired plant to coal burning. This will mean that we will be largely dependent, in the long term, on imported fuel for electricity generation.  It is essential, therefore, that we should diversity our fuel sources for electricity generation to the greatest degree possible in order to ensure security of supply and access to the most economic fuels available.</P>
    <P>One further point in relation to the Moneypoint coal-fired project is that, as Deputies will be aware, completion of the third phase has been reviewed in my Department in the light of reduced demand for electricity, the board's present over-capacity and the need, in present circumstances, to re-evaluate all capital projects.  I have given the fullest <Col N="277" /> consideration to the out come of this review and have brought my conclusion to the Government.  I am glad to be able to inform the House that the 3rd phase of the Moneypoint project will now be completed.</P>
    <P>The ESB's capital expenditure on construction projects, that is new generating plant, will amount to £153.6 million in 1984.  £146 million of this sum will be spent on work at the Moneypoint site. The balance of £7.6 million relates to residual expenditure, on recently commissioned extensions to the peat-fired stations at Lanesboro and Shannonbridge, the new gas fired combustion turbines at North Wall in Dublin and the conversion of Poolbeg to gas firing.  Combustion turbines have played an important role in allowing the ESB to switch quickly to using natural gas.  Their flexibility derives from the relatively short lead-times required.  Other types of generating plant require lead-times in the region of seven or eight years, as opposed to three years for combustion turbines. This shorter lead-time enables early adjustments to be made in the generation plant programme to cater for variations in electricity demand, for whatever reasons such variations might arise.</P>
    <P>The expenditure figures involved are, of course, very large and it is appropriate at this point to mention that, in all its activities, the ESB does its utmost to avail of Irish industrial and commercial resources.  It is firm ESB policy to promote and support Irish industry as much as possible.  ESB assistance to Irish firms has taken the form of technical support, including product design help in the early stages of production.  Generating station construction contracts are sub-divided to facilitate Irish firms and the success of this approach is indicated by the fact that at the Aghada station 60 per cent of the total investment was channelled directly into the Irish economy.  The corresponding figure for stations built in the fifties was 10 per cent.  The board have assured me that they will continue to do their utmost to avail of the services of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>The board's expenditure on premises and general equipment is expected to <Col N="278" /> amount to £8.6 million in 1984.  This includes £4.35 million for completion of the new head office complex in Dublin which will incorporate the new national control centre.  Other items of expenditure include computers, office furniture and tools.  When the head office complex is completed the ESB will not be embarking on any further head office or district headquarters developments until after 1990 while other premises developments will be limited to absolute priority cases.</P>
    <P>There will also be substantial expenditure by the board on transmission and distribution projects.  These will account for expenditure of about £89.5 million in 1984 with expenditure on transmission projects alone amounting to approximately £30 million.  This amount includes £21.5 million for the Moneypoint to the east transmission lines and £8.5 million on the maintenance of standards on the existing transmission system.  In addition, there will be expenditure of £2.5 million on the board's new national control centre which is expected to achieve efficiency savings of up to £2.5 million per annum in their fuel bill.  Expenditure on distribution projects will come to about £51.33 million in 1984.  This expenditure is required so as to maintain an acceptable level of service to existing customers and to strengthen electricity distribution networks for the connection of new customers. The activity is essential and has a high employment content.</P>
    <P>A development of significant importance during the past year was the ESB Strategic Plan 1983 &mdash; 1988.  The plan, which has as its primary objective &ldquo;to make major changes to achieve substantial price improvement&rdquo;, was drawn up by the board and management of the ESB on their own initiative and responsibility. The plan has already been the subject of debate and question in this House, principally because of its far-reaching implications for future energy policy.  Members of the House are aware of the Government's decision on the peat generation aspects of this plan; I feel sure that the House accepts that the future of Bord na Móna has been sensitively cared for and that full consideration has been given to the social, strategic and regional <Col N="279" /> implications of the proposals &mdash; as well as the economic aspects.  The ESB carries responsibility for the other proposals of the plan under its statutory obligations.</P>
    <P>Another development in the provision of electricity has been the western package electrification scheme.  Expenditure of £1.87 million and receipts of £.936 million are provided for this scheme in the Vote.  The scheme is part of an EEC funded package of measures designed to alleviate the special problems of agriculture throughout the west of Ireland.  As well as the electrification element of the package, aid is also provided for the development of water supplies, roads, land improvement, forestry and training services in the agricultural community. The counties to benefit include Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Galway, Monaghan, Longford, Cavan, Roscommon, Clare, Kerry and parts of west Cork and west Limerick.  The aim of the western package electrification scheme is to improve the viability and competitiveness of farms through the extension and improvement of electricity supplies to farms throughout the region.  Thirteen million pounds in aid is being jointly provided by the State and the EEC over a ten year period.  Aid is available towards the provision of electricity to farms previously unsupplied, increased and three-phase supplies to farms requiring additional power for their agricultural needs and also aid to a number of marketing and processing plants involved in the agricultural sector.  Finally, aid is provided for the improvement of the networks thoughout the region.</P>
    <P>Eligibility is in accordance with EEC Regulation 1820/80.  Those who qualify for aid must be principally dependent on agriculture for their income.  The State and the EEC each contribute 40 per cent of the cost of connection, the remaining 20 per cent being borne by the beneficiaries. To date, 2,735 applications have been approved under the scheme at a total cost of £5,607,828 and it is anticipated that a further 1,434 farms will benefit under the scheme in 1984.</P>
    <P>In May of last year, the Government announced the setting up of an inquiry <Col N="280" /> into electricity prices which would identify and analyse the reasons for our high electricity prices and make recommendations to achieve lower prices.  The membership of the group includes representatives from industry and Government Departments and is under the chairmanship of the former chief executive of the Danish electricity utility, Elsam.</P>
    <P>The inquiry commenced in September 1983, and is expected to complete its final report for the Government towards the end of this month.  It has already furnished an interim report to my predecessor.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made for the sum of £75,000 in my Department's Estimate in respect of the price inquiry.  This sum is being provided to cover expenditure on fees and expenses for the members of the group and, principally, on expert back-up services for the Inquiry.</P>
    <P>In regard to turf development, for almost 40 years Bord na Móna has been at the centre of energy policy in this country in our efforts to develop and utilise our own energy resources.  Today, Bord na Móna contributes approximately 15 per cent of our national energy needs, has developed considerable expertise in exploiting this traditional native fuel and is at present pursuing a vigorous policy of expansion.  At the end of the 1982-83 production year turf accounted for 866,000 tonnes oil equivalent in our national energy bill and will expand to 1.1 million tonnes oil equivalent when the present development plans are in full production.  The overall Bord na Móna capital estimate for 1984 was originally for £37 million which was mainly for the continuation of bog development work under the board's third development programme. Significant provisions include £5.5 million for railways, £4.8 million for machines, £4.2 million for drainage and £1.6 million for buildings.</P>
    <P>Included in the total estimate of £37 million was a provision for £15.4 million for the Ballyforan briquette factory. Early in 1983, the board had it indicated to them by the then Minister for Industry and Energy that it should undertake a full review of the Ballyforan-Derryfadda <Col N="281" /> briquette factory and bog development project.  Several factors combined indicated the need for this review; the costs of the project had significantly increased from the time of earlier approval; the price of oil had eased, the solid fuel market was seen as noticeably more competitive at a time when the board itself was implementing in phases, the Government approved price increases for turf and for briquettes.  The price for milled peat to the ESB had been increased.  By mid-1983 it became evident that greater attention needed to be given to the marketing projections.</P>
    <P>The result of this review led the board to conclude that it would not be prudent for it to continue with the project and, accordingly it took the decision in May 1984 to defer the project for one year. The board, by way of comment, also added to its decision that if the Government were to make moneys available, development work could still continue on the bog, thereby saving the jobs of approximately 156 people.  The board itself is continuing this development work for this current season but could not see it possible to carry on this work for longer than approximately one year unless restart of the project as a whole were foreseen.  The total expenditure now envisaged on the Ballyforan project for 1984 is £4.6 million rather than the £15.4 million originally estimated for.  That entire position is to be further considered in meetings between the board and the Department.  Full assessment of the position is being made.  Some minor impact on Bord na Móna will result from the ESB strategic plan.</P>
    <P>In 1984, production will consist of just over half a million tonnes of sod peat, four and a half million tonnes of milled peat and about a half a million tonnes of briquettes.  Production of moss peat will rise from 1.3 million cu. metres in 1983 to 1.4 million cu. metres in 1984.  Much of the additional milled peat will be used for electricity generation which would otherwise have to be generated by oil. The remainder will be used for the production of briquettes in the Littleton factory which, it is anticipated, will come into full production in 1984-85.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="282" /> The Private Bog Development Scheme came into effect in June 1981.  The scheme is administered by Bord na Móna and is funded by an allocation from the Department's Vote.  It provides for payment of grants to individuals, qualified groups or societies towards the cost of private development for the production of turf for fuel.  Bog development comprises the cost of access roads, drainage and the cost of purchasing, hiring or leasing equipment to carry out the development work.  Grants payable may not exceed 60 per cent of the cost in the case of qualified groups or societies and 45 per cent in the case of individuals.  The scheme was introduced to increase the volume of indigenous energy being produced, that is, mainly sod peat.  It is an effort to bring dormant resources, that is, a very large number of smaller bog areas which would not be of interest to Bord na Móna, into turf production.  The scheme has had a wide welcome and to date, £2.4 million in grant aid has been approved in respect of the development of some 25,000 acres of bog under this scheme.  I intend to review the scheme at the end of this season.</P>
    <P>Of all the types of fuel in use in the modern world today oil is probably the most important and certainly the most versatile.  Deputy Eddie Collins, the Minister of State at my Department, dealt with a number of issues relating to oil supply when addressing the House on the 1983 Estimates last June.  I consider that further comment is now warranted on these issues.</P>
    <P>The first such issue is that of Whitegate Refinery.  The refinery has been in operation in State ownership since September 1982, a period of just 20 months.  Over much of that period it has been the focus of much critical comment, not all of which could be considered to have been well-informed, in relation to its efficiency and the economics of its operation in terms of the disparity between petroleum product prices ex-Whitegate and the prices of alternatively sourced supplies into the Irish market.  The refining industry worldwide made huge losses but integrated companies strove to recoup these losses in the downstream market.  In its <Col N="283" /> first six months of operation there was a market disparity between Whitegate product prices and import/transfer prices, that is, the prices at which the oil companies import 65 per cent of their product requirements.  Improvement in crude contract supplies, judicious spot purchases and operational efficiencies have resulted in a marked improvement.</P>
    <P>Most of the bad comparisons were made on an assumption of 100 per cent spot product the price of which was then particularly low but no company and no country could depend to any appreciable extent on such sources.  The current magnitude of the &ldquo;diseconomy&rdquo; and the improvement in economics over the past year were contributory factors to the reaffirmation of the Government's commitment to the continuance of operations at Whitegate as expressed in a Government decision of 31 January last.  Oil prices in current world circumstances and the relationships between spot and official prices will of their very nature remain volatile.  It is not possible to assure anyone that further changes in prices ex-Whitegate may not occur, whether downwards or upwards.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the mandatory off-take regime, which the Government were left with no option but to introduce and to defend, successfully, in several injunction proceedings, in order to ensure disposal of Whitegate's production, and thereby secure the continuation of refining there, is the subject of a legal challenge by a grouping of the smaller oil companies which is being contested by the Government.  This challenge was initiated in the High Court, which referred certain questions in the matter relating to particular provisions of the Treaty of Rome to the European Court for ruling.</P>
    <P>I mentioned some moments ago that the Government were left with no option but to ensure the disposal of Whitegate production by a mandatory, statute-based system.  This is not and has never been the preferred approach.  Just as in 1982, the preferred option of Government remains the disposal of Whitegate production by means of voluntary off-take <Col N="284" /> arrangements entered into by the oil companies marketing in Ireland.  The oil companies themselves had difficulty with or were not amenable to formulating such arrangements in conjunction with Government in 1982 but I would hope that a number of developments since then will make progress possible.  In this connection I entered into negotiations with the oil companies with a view to reaching agreement on such suitable arrangements for disposal of the refinery's output as would enable the Government to phase out or dismantle the current mandatory provision.  It is my hope that if the industry approach the discussions with a willingness to be constructive then significant progress can be achieved. I can, for my part, assure the industry that the Government are committed to a constructive approach to this dialogue.</P>
    <P>One area of oil supply which continues to be the cause of concern is that of oil stock levels within the jurisdiction.  Current events in the Persian Gulf, while not an immediate cause for concern, show the continuing uncertainty about disruption of oil supplies.  There continue to be less than 65 days of stocks actually held on Irish soil and this constitutes an inadequate level in the event of supply difficulties. I am following up with the oil companies the question of raising stocks on Irish soil with minimum delay to an acceptable level.</P>
    <P>I have had a further discussion with Gulf Oil in regard to the Whiddy terminal and await further response from them.  I am concerned to protect the State's rights as regards storage and also as regards restoration of or compensation in lieu of the damaged condition of property on the leasehold.</P>
    <P>Overall, therefore, there has been, in the past year, relative price and supply stability on the international oil market. Although one can never predict with any degree of certainty future events insofar as oil is concerned, it is to be hoped that this stability will continue and that this will allow us to build further on the progress made.  The unstable and threatening situation in part of the Middle East indicates clearly that the need for care and <Col N="285" /> the utmost prudence on security of supply is as great as ever.</P>
    <P>The development and transmission of our natural gas resource is the responsibility of Bord Gáis Éireann.  The Government's policy is to broaden the use of our existing natural gas reserves, to underpin the security of essential energy supplies and to maximise the net return to the economy and to the Exchequer from gas revenues.  The successful completion of the Cork-Dublin pipeline marks the first stage of the Government's strategy for natural gas development.  This will be followed by the provision of supply to town gas companies capable of disturbing natural gas safely and efficiently, when a supply can be provided on an economic basis.  Deputies will be aware that a major agreement was reached last year with the Dublin Gas Company on the distribution of natural gas in Dublin.  The conversion, development and marketing programmes are all major undertakings designed to maximise and expand the use of natural gas as a competitive premium fuel.  The State's investment in this project is largely by way of rebates off the price of gas to the company.  Some of the State investment is in the form of interest bearing loans.  All going as planned, it is estimated that revenues in the region of £740 million in today's money will accrue to the Exchequer over the life of the project. From the time my predecessor took office the draft supply agreement with Dublin Gas was the subject of in-depth review.  The company itself has very considerable work to do on its cost estimates and had a real need to deepen its conversion survey in order to copperfasten the cost estimates.  While the company and its banking advisers were involved in aspects of the review essential for their own reasons, my Department very fully re-examined several aspects of the scheme and this resulted in major improvements which could be summarised as an increase from 50 per cent to 56 per cent of the profits, provision for the appointment of four directors, including the chairman for the initial period by the Minister to the board of Dublin Gas and, above all, a major improvement in that, allowing the need to pay off the bank <Col N="286" /> debt and to repay State loans, the company would be subjected to a control on its margins so that its buy-in price would rise whenever the selling prices of the company afforded profit margins higher than a level which is defined in the supply agreement.  After the bank and State debt envisaged in the financial parameters on which the whole project is based are repaid, normal price control applies. These measures have significantly tightened control by the State over a company into which State finance in the first and front line of exposure has been invested. In addition to that, once the agreed capital expenditures are repaid, there is adequate provision against excess profits.</P>
    <P>Policy in the area of further extensions to the grid is not yet finalised.  I am currently reviewing organisational and financial aspects of gas distribution generally and the role of Bord Gáis Éireann. It is my intention that there will be a major public sector involvement in the distribution process.  Such a policy has to fit appropriately into an overall national policy for the utilisation of the Kinsale Field, the positioning and pricing of natural gas in relation to alternative fuels, and the commercial and cost factors involved.</P>
    <P>With regard to particular utilities I hope to announce a decision on a supply to Clonmel shortly.  Limerick has already made progress in preparing a project. Waterford and Kilkenny have also made some progress in this regard.  The extension of supply to other population centres which do not have an existing town gas system will be considered at a later stage as well as supplies to industries.  I must emphasise that the critical factor is a viable gas utility project, equitable for the seller, BGE and the buyer without excess dependence on State support and without exposure to excess transfer of the benefit away from the State and the consumer.</P>
    <P>BGE will be surrendering £54 million of its profits in 1984 for the benefit of the Exchequer.  The board's capital programme for 1984 amounts to £16.9 million, 30 per cent of which will be funded from their own revenue and the remainder from borrowings.  The project to <Col N="287" /> extend the Cork-Dublin natural gas pipeline to Northern Ireland will account for a major proportion of this money.  The construction of the first stage of this pipeline, which will also act as part of the Dublin Gas network, is scheduled for completion by autumn of this year.  Contractors have been appointed and the engineering design work is completed.</P>
    <P>A provision has also been made in the Estimate for preliminary expenditure on Stage 2 of the project which will bring the gas from North Dublin to the Border and for some work in connection with extension of the grid to provincial centres.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of some concern, then, that problems have very recently been raised by the British side relating to the arrangements agreed last October for the sale of Kinsale gas to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The memorandum of understanding approved and signed on behalf of both Governments contained all the key elements of the proposed contract &mdash; quantities, price escalation and currency provisions and a contract incorporating these provisions has been concluded and initialled by BGE and NIGAS.</P>
    <P>The memorandum of understanding was entered into by both Governments with the express intention that the understanding would be fully implemented and work is proceeding on an agreed basis since last October.  Negotiations for EEC aid are well advanced.  In view of these facts the Government are looking forward to an early implementation of the agreed arrangements.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the very important area of offshore exploration.  In Irish offshore exploration attention generally continues to be focussed mainly on the Celtic Sea area following the 1983 Gulf discovery on block 49/9, and appraisal work in connection with that find is proceeding. Even though the first appraisal well related to the discovery was disappointing, the hydrocarbon flows achieved in the discovery well which is, after all, located in shallow waters and only 25 miles from shore are very encouraging. Needless to say, no decision can yet be taken on whether or not the find is commercial but I will be pressing for an <Col N="288" /> appropriate appraisal programme.  As regards this year's exploration programme BP have recently completed the drilling of a well in the Porcupine and Gulf are currently drilling a well in the Celtic Sea.  Occidental will shortly drill in the Fastnet Basin and, later on, Gulf and Conoco will drill exploration wells in the Celtic Sea.  All of this is apart from any further appraisal work related to the Block 49/9 find.  There are possibilities that other wells will also be drilled.</P>
    <P>Following the Gulf discovery, many exploration companies throughout the world expressed interest in acquiring acreage in the Celtic Sea.  With this in mind I decided to initiate a new round of offshore licensing on 29 February this year.  A total of 76 blocks, predominantly centred on the Celtic Sea but including a smaller number off our east coast, are being offered for licensing under the round.  As I indicated when I announced this licensing round, arrangements were made by my Department in anticipation of the round to have very extensive seismic surveys undertaken over the blocks which are included in the third round.  These surveys utilise the very latest seismic techniques and, hopefully, will produce data for the industry of a much higher technical quality than the older, previously available seismic data. In addition, the Celtic Sea Report, which was produced by my Department and comprises a comprehensive examination of the geology, geophysics and geochemistry of the Celtic Sea, is again available for purchase by the oil industry.  The closing date for the round has been fixed for 15 February 1985.  I believe that this will give companies sufficient time for evaluation of the available data and the blocks on offer.</P>
    <P>I look on this third licensing round as a major step in promoting our ongoing policy of securing the thorough and expeditious exploration of our Continental Shelf.  While oil exploration is a high risk business for the oil companies exploring offshore Ireland, nevertheless we must do all we can to ensure that as much exploration drilling as possible is undertaken. Every well drilled improves the chances of discovering commercial <Col N="289" /> reserves.  Even dry wells provide a great deal of information on the petroleum geology of our offshore basins.  I, therefore, hope and expect that in the wake of the 1983 oil find, this third round will lead to a greatly increased level of exploration activity, particularly from 1985 onwards.</P>
    <P>In the Irish offshore to date a total of 79 exploratory wells have been drilled &mdash; 32 in the Marathon-Esso leased areas and 47 under exclusive licences issued under the 1975 licensing terms.  Arising from this, we have at present only one producing field&mdash;The Kinsale Head Gas Field.  While no commercial discoveries of oil have yet been declared, we have had, nontheless, some significant flows and shows in a number of our offshore basins.</P>
    <P>In the context of its extent I believe that our offshore is under-explored. While our designated areas extend almost all around our coastline and far into the Atlantic, only 79 exploratory wells have so far been drilled.  We must, therefore, continue to promote and encourage exploration in our offshore. Every oil company will assess carefully and closely the relative advantages which it perceives in electing to undertake exploration in one region as opposed to another and we have been singularly successful in attracting the most respectable oil companies in the world to engage in exploration offshore Ireland.</P>
    <P>One of the most important factors to be taken into account is the anticipated level of State take.  The degree of flexibility built into our licensing terms gives assurance to the companies in this respect.  The levels of royalty and State participation set out in the terms are maximum ones, and it is open to me to settle for lower levels where this is necessary to ensure a reasonable return on investment, so that production can go ahead. Our aim, like that of the oil companies, is to secure the discovery and commercial production of hydrocarbons.  The overall objective of the 1975 terms, in short, is to provide from a commercial development the maximum benefits for the Irish people, while ensuring a fair return for the developers.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the 1975 <Col N="290" /> terms to which I have referred do not apply to a certain part of our committed offshore area &mdash; that part which is held under lease by Marathon, either alone or in conjunction with others.  The provisions of an agreement entered into in 1959 apply to these leasehold areas.  This agreement contains provisions which in current terms are exceptionally favourable to the licence holder.  In particular, they provide an extended period through which the company could hold petroleum leases without pursuing an active exploration programme beyond that set out in the agreement and also it provides a framework which sets limits to the sum of royalty and tax payments.</P>
    <P>The agreement provides that in certain circumstances certain payments might fall to be made to the leaseholder under the provisions of the agreement.  These provisions may have to be acted upon in the next few years.  The level of activity by Marathon-ESSO in the area exclusively leased to them is extremely disappointing to me.  The acreage, which is considered to be of good potential, is under-explored.  I will be looking for a significantly accelerated exploration programme in the Marathon-ESSO acreage.</P>
    <P>Because of my concerns with the third licensing round I have concentrated on the Celtic Sea area so far.  However, other basins in our offshore should not be ignored, particularly as there have been significant shows and flows of oil and gas in those basins.  Our &ldquo;open door&rdquo; policy continues to apply to blocks which are not included in our third round and which are not already committed.</P>
    <P>Mainly because of soft oil markets, many oil companies have temporarily shelved plans to explore the more expensive deep-water areas throughout the world.  However, BP drilled a well in the Porcupine Basin this year, their fifth well in the discovery block 26/28.  Unfortunately, no significant shows of hydrocarbons were encountered.  BP will now evaluate the geological and other information obtained from this well, in conjunction with previous data, to enable them to decide on their future plans.  Because we believe this basin has considerable potential, my Department are currently <Col N="291" /> working to produce a report dealing with the Porcupine Basin similar to that produced for the Celtic Sea.  Constraints on staffing, however, have delayed that work.  On shore exploration is continuing in the North West Carboniferous Basin where non-commercial quantities of gas were discovered in 1962-63.  The present licencees have carried out extensive geological field-mapping and seismic surveys and in April started drilling the first of two wells to be drilled this year.  This first well has been completed and has been temporarily abandoned having encountered some background gas shows at some levels.  The second will start very soon and we await its result with great interest.</P>
    <P>In a period of plentiful fuel supply there may, on the face of it, appear to be less need for expenditure on energy conservation. However, I feel that this would be a very shortsighted policy and a sum of £400,000 is being provided in my Department's Estimate this year for the promotion of energy conservation.</P>
    <P>The domestic sector was well catered for in the past with publicity campaigns and the attic insulation grant scheme.  We have continued our concentration more on the industrial and public sectors.  This does not mean that the domestic sector has achieved its potential or that the public do not need reminding of the benefits of taking energy-saving actions.  The Department's &ldquo;Hotline&rdquo; is available for advice on any energy conservation queries and I would urge people to take advantage of this expert service.  I would hope to consider having further publicity campaigns when funds allow this.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, my Department's programme for the industrial and public sectors, has been, with the help of the IIRS, coming up with worthwhile results.  Since 1979 total energy consumption fell by 7 per cent while there has been some growth in the economy.  This is a reversal of the previous trend of a strong connection between growth in energy consumption and growth in economic activity. While other factors, including prices, have undoubtedly had an impact on consumption, conservation and increased <Col N="292" /> efficiency in using energy were major factors and can be expected to continue contributing to lower demand in future.</P>
    <P>My Department, with the help of the NBST, have encouraged the widest participation by Irish applicants in the EEC Scheme of Aid for Energy Demonstration Projects for 1984 following on our success last year in achieving contracts involving aid of IR£2.4 million.</P>
    <P>An initial assessment of my Department's steam plant audit service has shown potential savings of IR£3.6 million per annum and a further assessment will be carried out towards the end of this year.  No matter what way Ireland's energy scene changes in coming years, the need for vigilance in getting the best value out of that energy will not change and so, I will continue to encourage energy conservation for all our sakes.</P>
    <P>As in the case of energy conservation a short-term judgment based on present conditions might suggest that expenditure on the investigation of new and renewable sources of energy was not really necessary.  Nevertheless, I suggest that a long-term view should be taken and my Department's Estimate for 1984 contains a provision of £97,000 for this activity.  This sum will be used to continue the existing policy of assessing the potential for use of natural energy sources, demonstrating well-developed technology in action and supporting research to a small degree.</P>
    <P>During 1984, studies of the size of wind, hydro and geothermal resources will be complete.  It is hoped that reports will be available to the public by the late summer.</P>
    <P>This year will also see the commencement of an EEC contract, under which the EEC will contribute to the cost of monitoring, maintaining and, where necessary, modifying five of my Department's wind machines.</P>
    <P>The Nuclear Energy Board which has a very small complement of staff has some very important statutory responsibilities designated to it by the Government. These responsibilities involve such actions as regulating the import-export, transport, use, distribution and disposal of radioactive substances and irradiating <Col N="293" /> apparatus.  The licensing involves some 200 licensees covering medical, industrial, research and teaching areas within the country.  The board carry out inspections on the licensees to ensure that the conditions of the licences are fulfilled. The Nuclear Energy Board are responsible for the National Radiation Monitoring Service, N.R.M.S..  The main service provided by the NRMS is the assessment of doses to people involved in radiation work.  The service processed and reported on 64,000 personal doses badges during 1983 which represented the monitoring of over 2,500 individuals. The Nuclear Energy Board also advise the Department of Health through the board's Radiation Advisory Committee on matters connected with radiation safety, for example in the design of Beaumont, Tallaght, and other new hospitals planned.</P>
    <P>The board carry out a programme of monitoring to check the levels of radioactivity in the environment and, in particular, in the Irish Sea.  I have placed the board's latest report on the Irish Sea in the Dáil Library.  The Irish Sea Programme involves the monitoring of radioactivity levels in fish samples, seawater, seaweeds and sediments.  Other environmental monitoring deals with measurements of radioactivity in drinking water, food, rainfall and in the atmosphere.</P>
    <P>My Department, through the Nuclear Energy Board, are kept in touch with important international research and development work in radiological protection and nuclear technology.  The Nuclear Energy Board participate in working committees of the EEC, the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the International Atomic Energy Agency, where discussions take place on the disposal of radioactive waste and the elimination of discharges and dumping of radioactive materials in the sea, which are matters of particular concern to Ireland.</P>
    <P>I now turn to minerals exploration. There has been a significant drop in the level of minerals exploration activity in Ireland.  This is not unexpected, given the poor metal prices which have prevailed <Col N="294" /> for some years and the worldwide economic recession.  Nonetheless, the level of investment still being maintained by a number of companies confirms the longstanding confidence of the minerals industry that further commercial base metal orebodies remain to be found in Ireland.</P>
    <P>An improvement in some metal prices during the past year and the modest improvement being recorded in the world economy now gives some cause for optimism although any upward trend will take some time to work its way through to substantial new investment in minerals exploration.</P>
    <P>My Department keep in close contact with the representative bodies of the industry and there are ongoing discussions on ways of stimulating interest and investment in minerals exploration.  Following consultation with the industry I introduced, in September 1983, an open-file system for minerals licence data on file in the Geological Survey of Ireland.  Up to that time, even though a prospecting licence was surrendered, data resulting from operations under it were treated as confidential.</P>
    <P>I am aware that concern has been expressed, over the years, by some members of the industry about the absence of pre-determined mining lease terms.  The argument put forward is that the absence of such terms makes investment by international mining companies in minerals exploration in Ireland unattractive. However, no clear evidence in support of this argument has been put forward to my Department.  This matter has been looked at a number of times over the years.  Bearing in mind the variety of hard minerals being sought in the land area of the country and the variety of settings in which such minerals can be found &mdash; which have a significant bearing on the profitability of such finds &mdash; there are serious practical problems about determining mining lease terms, in advance of discovery and evaluation of each deposit, that will give a fair and reasonable return both to the State and the operator.  Furthermore, it would be reasonable, if lease terms were to be pre-determined, to take account of a highly <Col N="295" /> profitable mine development situation and to indicate what the level of State &ldquo;take&rdquo; in such a situation would be.</P>
    <P>Bearing these considerations in mind and, as I am satisfied that the terms of State mining leases granted to date have been at least as attractive as those obtainable by mining companies in other countries, I have been reluctant to fix future lease terms into a standard mould which could result in the State getting an inadequate return from the leasing of State-owned minerals.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the industry was invited early this year to furnish their ideas as to how a leasing regime could be devised which would reasonably meet the concerns of the State and of the industry.  I have received a limited response in the matter from the industry but it is my intention that further discussions should take place between officials of my Department and of the industry to see if the matter can be progressed further.</P>
    <P>My Department, in consultation with the industry, have been vigorously pursuing the early adoption of an EEC scheme to aid minerals exploration within Community territory.  Unfortunately, although the major share of the produce of Irish mines is sold in the Community &mdash; its natural market &mdash; a number of our partners in the Community do not share our urgency to get the scheme under way.  Nonetheless, I am hopeful of an early resolution of the difficulties experienced by some countries with the scheme.  While the total amount of money to be made available, £7.3m, is quite small, nonetheless, it could provide a useful stimulus to minerals exploration activity.  Recent years have seen the closure of some of our largest mines, mainly due to exhaustion of their minerals reserves.  The Tara Lead and Zinc Mine is now operating in a more satisfactory climate than in the difficult years after start-up in 1977 and Bula Ltd. is involved in discussions at present with a number of parties with a view to operational and financial arrangements which would permit commencement of development of the Bula orebody.</P>
    <P>Gypsum mining and processing operations <Col N="296" /> continue at Kingscourt and the barytes mine at Clonakilty has been taken over by new developers.  Coal mining operations have expanded in the Leinster Coalfield and in Ballyingarry, County Tipperary.  While the coal mining operations are small in themselves, they are serving to provide employment in a critical time for our economy in areas where employment opportunities are limited and they are contributing to a reduction in our dependence on imported coals.</P>
    <P>Studies are proceeding with a view to development of the talc magnesite deposit at Westport, County Mayo, but it is too early yet to say when development will commence.</P>
    <P>The Vote for my Department for 1984 amounts to £10 million.  This is small in comparison to other areas of energy activity so, I have also outlined for the House the wide range of my responsibilities as Minister for Energy and the extent of the non-voted capital expenditure involved, £303 million this year, in the supply of energy by the State companies under my aegis.  It is clearly vital that my Department have good working relationships with all of these companies.  It is essential that we get value from this investment.  As Minister for Energy I must also look to the optimum development of our indigenous sources of energy, peat and natural gas, to further promoting explorations for oil and gas, to enhancing our security of supply, to improving our energy efficiency, and to examining new sources of energy.  This is a formidable and continuing task.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Estimate to the House.</P>

      <P>I see.  There are a few Deputies who would like to make a short contribution this morning so I will not over-extend my time.  There is a certain amount of lack of energy here this morning after the 4 a.m. finish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="297" /> I am delighted to have the opportunity to try on behalf of this side of the House to deal with the Estimate for the Department of Energy.  Indeed it should be noted that during the year there has been a reversal to what the original positions were in relation to the Department of Industry and Energy.  Some people were of the view that they were better separated, so as not to try to make little of one more than the other.  In the short time that I was there as Minister there was a significant co-ordination that could be carried on between an energy policy and an industrial policy and the effects that an energy policy can have on industrial development in the country.  However we are back to where we were originally and this is an opportunity to deal with them separately.</P>
    <P>Listening to the Minister's address there seems to be a lack of planning in relation to future energy policy and the co-ordination of energy policy.  It is a very serious matter that has to be tackled but it is not being tackled.  We will give the Minister the opportunity at the end of the day to inform us if, in fact, there is a fully-thought-out co-ordinated energy policy between the various suppliers of energy into the economy at the moment. We are too well aware of the situation that exists in relation to the ESB, Bord na Móna, Bord Gáis Éireann.  It is time we sat down and planned exactly where we are going in the future, not to mention what is going to be the future of the peatlands when Bord na Móna have finished developing them.</P>
    <P>That is an area to which I must first refer the Tánaiste.  From what I heard here this morning there is a total lack of energy policy for the future and I will refer to this in more detail later on when I get around to dealing with the various agencies that are under the control of the Minister for Energy.</P>
    <P>Other aspects of the Estimate that certainly strike me quite forcibly indeed are lack of action, lack of progress, lack of decision-making in relation to the energy area.  Decisions are very badly needed here and this is also symbolic of other Departments and indeed of the actions of the Government in many, many areas. <Col N="298" /> As I said earlier this year in the House, it is my view that what I can only describe today as the paralysis of action and the frightening lack of decision-making in vital areas that are hindering the development of the economy and stopping progress towards tackling the problems that exist in various aspects of the economy today.</P>
    <P>The decisions that are not being faced up to &mdash; and they are not being faced up to in this particular area of energy either &mdash; all contribute to a further slide down the slippery road.  Everybody looked forward to the implication of the Joint Programme for Government by the present Government when they came into office. Time and time again we have had to record in this House that not a single line of that policy has been implemented.</P>
    <P>We are now approaching mid-term in the life of this Government and we have not had decisions.  The Minister will recall that only some three months ago at Question Time here I tried to get some idea of decision-making in relation to the peatlands of the midlands and indeed in relation to the Ballyforan project also. Time and time again we met with the very same response &mdash;&ldquo;the project has been under review&rdquo; and the Ballyforan project has been under review, for about 18 months.  The strategic plan produced by the ESB is also under review, and under review and under review.  I had to remind the House three months ago that when I tried to get information about it, it was not forthcoming.  But I then said that there would be no problem when it came to the time of the Laois-Offaly by-election in getting a decision, whether it was the right decision or the wrong decision. It so happened that that was the case.  We got a decision midway through the Laois-Offaly by-election, a decision which I described then, and which I repeat today, as more than a get-me-by decision.</P>
    <P>It was a get-me-by decision to get out of the problems of Laois-Offaly and the results show quite clearly that it did not get the present Government out of the problems of Laois-Offaly because the good, honest-to-goodness people of Laois-Offaly did not believe for one moment the seriousness of that decision. <Col N="299" /> They did not believe for one moment the seriousness of that decision.  They did not buy it.  It was a get-me-by decision.  It has been said that if this Government are long enough in office the name of a parish down there, Welsh Island &mdash; I am sure, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you are familiar with it &mdash; will be changed by them to Desert Island.  Unless the Government, the Minister and the Department of Energy sit down and work out what is to be the long-term future of the midlands, then that change of name of a particular parish will undoubtedly take place.</P>
    <P>I am glad the opportunity was given to the Minister, to his party and to the other party in Government, to go down to the midlands and see the stupidity of the things that were being proposed.  That gave them the opportunity to see the foolishness of what would happen in relation to the midlands if they had allowed the ESB to proceed with the strategic plan that had been outlined.  We all know the peatlands are going to be cut away sooner or later, but between the ESB, Bord na Móna and within the realms of the Government, where is there any sign of a start being made for economic planning to replace the jobs that sustained the economy of the midlands? The whole economy as we all know, is sustained by the ESB and by Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>Time and time again members of the Government have said they do not interfere with decisions of semi-State bodies; do not have anything to do with them. When it came to the strategic plan of the ESB the Government were glad to announce a kind of good news decision for the Laois-Offaly by-election.  However, not many miles towards the west when it came to taking a decision in relation to the Ballyforan peat briquette factory, the Minister for Energy, with hand on heart, and the rest of them stood up time and time again and said, &ldquo;this is a Bord na Móna decision.  We do not interfere. The board of Bord na Móna run their own business.  They tell us the project should not go ahead, and that is the end of that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I will ask the Minister to look me <Col N="300" /> straight in the eye and tell me that it was not a Government decision in relation to Ballyforan and it was not a Government decision in relation to the ESB.  Nobody would believe it.  I do not believe it. Nobody outside this House believes it and certainly the people of Laois-Offaly did not believe it either.  Not wishing any evil on the poor constituency of East Galway and Roscommon, but if they had had the same unfortunate and regrettable opportunity as Laois-Offaly, they too would probably have got a clear-cut decision.</P>
    <P>It is part of the overall, bad performance of the Government.  We have had a review, a review and a review; a committee, a committee, a committee; a task force, a task force, a planning board and what have you.  These are no substitutes for Government decisions in relation to the problems of this country.  The Government are nearly half way through their term of office and unless a drastic change is made in the area of decision-making, in the area of planning and in the area of giving some hope, not alone to the areas that I have just spoken about but indeed to areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not able to energise too well this morning.  We are not great at all, I can tell you.  The water is being consumed at an enormous rate to try to keep the show on the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get back to energy, as I said, Bord na Móna do their own business, the Government do not interfere.  I know as <Col N="301" /> well as the Minister knows, it is his decision in relation to Ballyforan, nobody else's.  I am sure there are Deputies here from these constituencies.  I will not dwell on them in detail.  I am delighted to see my young colleague in the House this morning showing his concern for his own midland region of Laois-Offaly.  He will also take the opportunity of saying a few words.</P>
    <P>In relation to the ESB itself for which the Minister has responsibility, we are all keenly aware of the over-capacity that exists.  I am not blaming the ESB in relation to the decision taken back in the mid-seventies.  We all know long-term planning is involved in relation to the provision of power stations.  But we must also face up to the fact, and the Minister said it here today, that stage 3 of Moneypoint is going ahead.  We must face up to the reality of the situation.  I am sure that produces approximately 900 megawatts on its own.  We have approximately 950 megawatts of excess capacity at present. Surely that poses the question what is to be the long-term plan in relation to it?  It is not good enough to come in with half decisions.  From the point of view of the development of the economy we need clear-cut decisions in relation to that situation. We are all keenly aware of the cost of electricity and the impact it has on cost competitiveness and manufacturing costs in this country.  Time and time again we hear lectures from the Taoiseach and members of the Government in relation to competitiveness.  And yet who is contributing more to the non-competitiveness of Irish industry than the ESB itself, and the Government by their own actions are adding to it.  A reduction of ESB charges by 12½ per cent could generate 6,000 new jobs in this country.  This has been shown in two surveys that I have studied in recent times.  Surely if the Government have any objective in the area of job creation they should be moving towards that area.</P>
    <P>Before I left the Department of Industry and Energy in 1982 the then Government had already taken a decision to set up an inquiry into the ESB and announced it publicly.  That was in October-November 1982.  We are now in <Col N="302" /> June 1984.  We have not got the results of this yet.  If it takes two years to do a simple job like that where are we going in relation to the major problems that have to be solved and the impact of electricity costs on industry in this country?</P>
    <P>It has been said time and time again that electricity costs to industry here are approximately 25 per cent higher than for our competitors in Europe.  The inquiry which was set up then has, unfortunately, not finalised its work yet but I am sure it will give us the answer.  I am not prepared to say until I know that we are comparing like with like but certainly there is a serious discrepency between the cost of electricity in Ireland and the cost to our competitors in the market place.  We have to level it up if we are to continue in the international market place.  I think it is time the Minister looked at the concept of a two-tier price tariff in this country because we appear to be seriously out of line in relation to industrial costs.  I would also ask the Minister to say whether he has given any consideration to what I believe is an application from the Department of Industry in relation to a reduction of ESB costs to Irish Steel as the Government grapple with the problem of the future of Irish Steel.  What is the response likely to be?  I know the ESB will probably make the case that, if they give a reduction to Irish Steel, which the Department of Industry are seeking I understand, in looking at the overall position and future of Irish Steel, the new large consumers of electricity like Alcan and others will also be looking for the same treatment.  The Minister might let us know where he stands in relation to this.  We will have an opportunity next week to go into the other areas of the future of Irish Steel.  Again I say in relation to the tackling of ESB prices there is the same lack of action and lack of progress and lack of decision-making by the Government.</P>
    <P>I have to concur with what the Minister and indeed many Members of this House have said time and time again, that Bord na Móna have been a very successful semi-State body in relation to the development of our natural resources and in the provision of jobs in areas of this country <Col N="303" /> where alternative employment would not be readily available.  What will replace the jobs on the development of milled peat and sod peat in the midlands? If planning has not started is it not time to start it and to look at what use is to be made of the cut-away bogs, whether they are to be grassland or used for horticultural production or whatever.  A policy should be drawn up for the cut-away bogs of the whole midland area.  There are opportunities to be grasped there through research, planning and getting on with it in time.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister to try to explain his decision in relation to the part of the strategic plan of the ESB to which he referred in his speech.  The workers in those plants are wondering what is to be the position.  I have been asked by Deputy Calleary in relation to Bellacorick, by Deputy John O'Leary in relation to Kerry and indeed by others what does the ESB and the Minister mean when they say that the situation will remain open subject to plant availability?  What is that supposed to mean in simple language? Does that mean that if the boiler breaks down tomorrow the plant is not available and the station could close or does it mean that if the boiler breaks down you are going to provide the money to fix the boiler so that the plant can go again the following day or the following week or whatever?  Everybody believes that is the thin end of the wedge, the foot in the door.</P>
    <P>What I want is a clear and unequivocal statement in relation not alone to Bellacorick but indeed to the rest of the plants. Are they going to be closed by stealth? Are the stations going to be run down? Is money going to be provided for maintenance?  If not, come clean and say: &ldquo;We are closing and that is it&rdquo; and do not try to close them by stealth.  That is not the way to do business and that is not the way the people of this country want to have business done on their behalf either. If that is going to be the decision let them say it and there will be a lot more respect for the Government which is fast losing respect and credibility in many areas because they are not dealing with the <Col N="304" /> problems or pursuing the policies in this and other areas as they promised.</P>
    <P>I am a bit dubious when I see that the grant money for the private sector bog development is being reduced.  That is not new.  In 1982 I recall distinctly the Department of Finance wanted to do away with the scheme altogether.  What I am afraid of is that they are beginning to get their way in reducing the amount of grants available to the private bog development scheme, a scheme which was introduced in 1981, which has been very successful and has provided jobs in the off season.  It has resulted in a substantial reduction in imports.  More important, it has got people back to working for themselves and developing the work ethic that had gone out of rural Ireland but which this type of scheme has brought back.  In my view it would be a serious and retrograde step to abolish this scheme but it would be typical of the decisions which have come from this Government where Pale politics is pursued religiously to the exclusion of other parts of the country.  That scheme has been highly successful and has made more than its fair contribution to the Exchequer.  It would be penny wise and pound foolish to allow some bureaucrat to abolish that to save £1 million.  It would not surprise me.  I feel it is going to be put under the hammer again.  The statement says it is going to be reviewed. &ldquo;Review&rdquo; means one thing and that is, that there are preparations being made to scrap it.  That would be a retrograde step but it would not surprise me.  Pale politics is all that matters to the Government and this could be another one for the hammer.</P>
    <P>To turn to the Irish National Petroleum Corporation for which I was preparing legislation at the end of October 1982, this State company is operating without a legislative statutory basis.  In 1984 there has been no further development.  We took the controversial decision in relation to Whitegate and I am glad that that decision has been proved to be the correct one.  Despite all the money on various PR agencies around this country by the people who would love to see it closed and leave it closed, they were not successful <Col N="305" /> and despite the fact that I was ridiculed and told I could not do my sums and there was a controversy as to whether Whitegate was going to cost this country 1p or 1½p on the price of petrol in the short-term.  We explained that we were in a contract situation.  Nobody was interested in that.  I recall the hullaballoo and all the talk and the time that was wasted both on the airwaves and in newspapers about whether it was a ½p or 1p, while this Government could let £800 million drift out of this country unknown to them.  What did we hear about it?  Just for a day, that is all.  It disappeared very quickly &mdash; news management, good handling.</P>

      <P>That is Whitegate. When are we going to see legislation to put it on a proper statutory basis?  Are there any plans for development of the Whitegate Oil Refinery to improve its cost effectiveness in relation to the product it produces?  It can be done with a small enough investment and I hope the Minister will deal with that at the end of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand why we have had <Col N="306" /> no progress or action in relation to the future of the Whiddy oil terminal in Bantry. When I left the Department in October or November 1982 I remember distinctly an offer being on the desk.  The Whiddy oil terminal was being offered free gratis to the Government of the day on condition that the storage of the million barrels of oil that are kept there would be released forthwith.  I held the view then and I still hold the view and I am glad the Minister appears to hold the view that this company should either put back the foreshore lease property they have in the condition in which they found it or else compensate the Government of the day for doing it.  There has been no progress or development in nearly two years.  I am not pointing all the fingers at the present Minister.  He had a predecessor and we did not see any action taken by him.  We will not condemn this man. He is not there long enough yet.  There is no development or action being taken in so far as I can see &mdash; I am open to correction &mdash; in relation to the Whiddy oil terminal and its future and indeed to the contribution it can make to the economic development of that area if the people down there knew where it was going.</P>
    <P>The natural gas area is an area which is near and dear to my heart.  The first area I will refer to is the apparent problems that exist in relation to the supply of gas from Kinsale to the North of Ireland.  It is difficult to know what to say in relation to it except that when I left the Department the agreement was ready to be signed.  Now, nearly two years later, the British Government, through the Minister of State in the North of Ireland, Mr. Butler, are thinking of backing off the whole deal.  I am not privy to the information the Minister has but I want to put it on the record of the House that when the first talk about renegotiation arose, and this is the second time there is talk of renegotiation of this agreement, I told the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Bruton, and I want to tell him here today that I will fully support his action in not renegotiating that deal.  I can see this quite clearly as a negotiating tactic.  I went through those negotiations on two or three different occasions and we came <Col N="307" /> to a resolution and an agreement in Stormont Castle.  That same Minister who now talks about problems and renegotiations is the man who said in front of the television cameras that agreement had been reached on delivery dates, on quantity and on price.  Why should any Irish Government or any Irish Minister allow that Government to come back and renegotiate a deal like that?  Now they have the hard neck to come back and try it again.  It is a time worn practice with those people when they feel that they have an opportunity of getting a better deal.  As far as I am concerned the first deal they got was a good one.  When Ministers announce in public that agreement has been reached that should be that.  I will not for one minute ask the Minister to renegotiate that deal.  They had their advisers and their opportunities. If you make a bad deal in business you put up with it, if you make a bad deal in Government you put up with it as well. What I am saying is that I do not want the Minister coming back to this House and to the Irish taxpayers and I know he will not do it, because already a renegotiation has taken place.  I tried to get information on a few occasions as to what extent renegotiation has affected the taxpayers who are the ultimate beneficiaries of this contract.  I know the price per therm was reduced somewhere in the region of 1p to 1½p over the term of that contract.  By my simple calculations that could mean anything from £23 million to £29 million.  This is the original negotiation. If that adjustment was made I do not know the basis or the reasons for making it.  I certainly would not have done it if I was there.  The man was ready to sign the agreement when I left office. There was a change of Government and because of the political volatile situation in which we found ourselves advantage was taken of it, but to what degree I do not know.</P>
    <P>I gather, from reading the Minister's speech today, that contracts have been entered into for the building of the pipeline from Dublin to the Border.  If that is the position who is going to pay for it?  I know there was a provision in the original <Col N="308" /> agreement, and I am sure there is in the second part, for a contribution from the North of Ireland authorities to the building of that pipeline.  I would like the Minister to state precisely the position.  Is the building of the pipeline project going ahead?  If so, has he any reason to believe that the British part of it will not be paid for?  Does the Minister think there is any legal basis for their getting out?  I do not know what the understanding means in legal terms.  Perhaps the Minister will give us the opportunity of hearing his own legal assessment of it and that of his advisers.</P>
    <P>However, I must ask the question as to why, after 18 months, there has not been a legally binding contract in relation to this?  We are not talking about small money.  We are talking of a contract in the area of £500 million.  Is this the slipshod way we do our business?  Why was this not put on a full legal contractual basis?  Then they could not come back and try on a re-negotiation of the contract. It is a bit much to suggest two years after the calculations and negotiations have taken place that just because the dollar has strengthened there is a basis for renegotiation.  The advisers from the Treasury in London sat around the table when all those facts and figures were dealt with.  They had the same access as we had, and what we would normally think better access, to information and better negotiators than we had.  If they were not able to do a good deal then it was just hard luck.  The Treasury man from London in Belfast did say when I was there that he felt the Minister had given away too much.  However that is a long time back.  There is no reason, in my view, why any renegotiation should take place.</P>
    <P>The sincerity of the British Government in relation to the Northern Ireland people should be tested once and for all. I believe this project was a flagship in North-South economic development.  I believe their sincerity should be tested. I have grave reservations about the sincerity towards this project because they have allowed the price of gas to be increased substantially on two occasions since they started negotiating this project. <Col N="309" /> If they were interested in acquiring the customers they require for the success of this project they would have done as we did down here, that is, subsidise the price of gas until natural gas is brought in.  They could have done the same thing in the North of Ireland if they were sincere about it.  It is one of two things: either they are not sincere or they were trying to get it up to a situation where they could hive it off to private investors and there would be a huge return.  That, in my view, is not sincerity towards the North of Ireland people.  I think they are entitled to more than that.  I had doubts myself at a couple of stages during the negotiations as to whether they ever intended or they ever wanted to deliver that gas beyond Belfast.  They had very little intention of taking it over to Derry and other areas.  Perhaps they could put the responsibility and the blame on us for making it so dear that it would not be a feasible proposition to go over there.</P>
    <P>This is very important in relation to the good relationships that we hear of and have heard of time and time again between the British Government and our Government.  This is a case in which the Minister should say, &ldquo;You either believe in your agreements that are made between Ministers and announced in public or you do not&rdquo;.  If we lose that contract then so be it, we will use this gas ourselves, but no longer should we adopt the weak-kneed attitude and bend the knee towards the pressure that comes when they think they can embarrass us into changing an agreement.  I will fully support the Minister and he will have the full support of this side of the House as well.</P>
    <P>I think we dealt with natural gas for Dublin to some degree late one night. We had very different views on whether the resignation of former Labour Minister, Deputy Frank Cluskey, was justified on the basis that he said the deal which had been done by the previous Fianna Fáil administration, of which I was the man responsible, was far inferior to his own deal.  I think I showed pretty conclusively that night that such was not the case, a deal which costs the taxpayer an additional £27 million, which gives away <Col N="310" /> an option on 25 per cent of the equity of Dublin gas and conversion rights of £5 million, but in the meantime until those conversion rights are taken up there is up to a 30 per cent possible return on that investment of £5 million and the State, for all its investment, can only get 29 per cent of the voting rights and 25 per cent of the equity and the profits of 50 per cent increased to 56 per cent.  I am sure the Minister, myself and the shareholders and directors of Dublin Gas would all love to think that it would be so successful that there would be such excess profits.  But as we all know excess profits can be controlled by increasing the price of the raw material in the first instance.  This magic formula of excess profits I do not buy for one minute.  It does not mean a thing.</P>
    <P>It is a paper exercise, a cosmetic exercise. It is only trying to dress up what was a much inferior deal to the deal negotiated because we got no return from an extra £27 million except the 6 per cent of the profits.  When we look at the equity of the company and all the money we were putting into it we see what the private sector could get.  Good luck to them. They did a good deal and they were able to pull the wool over everybody's eyes. This happens but not for one minute do I accept that Deputy Cluskey's resignation was in any way connected with that arrangement.  He resigned for the reason that he tried to get a seat in Europe. Unfortunately he did not.  He is an excellent representative, and we will have the benefit of his contributions here in future weeks and months and indeed we will all benefit from them.  It is time we saw honesty in politics.  We are not seeing much of it at the moment and it is time we saw a little more of it.  We should give the answer to the Irish people and try to come clean with them and not hide behind smokescreens of sincerity, integrity and honesty.  The sooner we realise that the better.  The sooner the Government realise that they cannot get away with the cosmetic exercises that were done in relation to either energy or industry, that they cannot succeed and cannot go on indefinitely the better.</P>
    <P>The first problem is the gas supply to <Col N="311" /> Limerick, Waterford and Clonmel.  Perhaps the Minister has changed his mind from the policy that he enunciated here at Question Time one day that before any town gets the distribution of natural gas into their own area he would have to be satisfied that a majority shareholding is going to be held by the public sector for that distribution.  Listening to what is being said today I am not sure whether that is the present position.  If it is maybe we will get a re-enunciation of their policy.  You could take two interpretations from the speech today.  Limerick city has been deprived of gas which they could have had 18 months ago.  It is a small job to take an extension of the pipeline coming from Cork to Dublin and bring it to Limerick.  It is no more than one has to do with a group water scheme. There is nothing mythical about how you lay an extension of the pipeline.  But because of ideological hangups Limerick city is being deprived of the supply of natural gas from which not alone consumers but also industry could benefit in relation to their manufacturing costs.  I made the decision to let Limerick go ahead and get a supply of natural gas in October 1982.  We are now into the second half of 1984 and because of an ideological hangup they have not got a supply.  In 1982 Limerick Corporation were agreeable to go into a joint venture with the private sector.  It is an indictment of the Government and of the Minister's predecessor in office that Limerick still does not know when they are going to get gas.</P>
    <P>I do not know what is going to happen in Kilkenny, because it is only the private sector that is involved there.  It is different when one goes to Clonmel.  If Kilkenny is going to be deprived of the opportunity of availing of natural gas just because it is a private sector company, if that is the position let us put down the markings clear along the line.  What is going to happen in Waterford?  Is it going to be Waterford Corporation?  If that is it then say so.  But do not be holding up the supply and the development of those areas and the benefits that natural gas would bring to them for any longer than <Col N="312" /> has been done up to now.  Decisions were made before you came in.  Most of them were put under review and they were put in the pigeon hole and they are there since.  Yet the people of those areas await the arrival of natural gas which is their right.  One thing we must get clear in our minds is that the people of this country are the people who own the natural resources, and how are they going to benefit from natural gas?  This can be done by providing the maximum return to the Exchequer and not wasting it in bad management or otherwise in bringing the facility to the various areas we have been speaking about.  Maximising return to the Exchequer is the most beneficial way the people who will have natural gas are going to benefit whether it is in the area of taxation, economic development or whatever way the Government of the day decides to use it for best advantage. To distribute it in the most cost effective manner is the way the taxpayers and the people will benefit from natural gas distribution. The Government are suffering from ideological hangups.  Maybe the Tanaiste has to do it for his own political survival and the political survival of his own party against others.  If that is the price this country is expected to pay for the inactivity, the indecision and lack of unity and purpose of a Government, whether in the area of natural gas distribution or otherwise, that we will have to stand still, that we are totally paralysed in relation to where we are going in the future, then I would say that price is unacceptable to the Irish people and the first chance they get they will show it is totally unacceptable.  The problems are too great, and any areas in which we can move forward and make decisions towards the development of the economy and the provision of jobs should be tackled without further delay.  If this paralysis has to continue under this Government will someone do something about it?  Let us have some policy direction and some decision in relation to it and not have the country suffering as Limerick, Waterford, Clonmel and Kilkenny are suffering by the non-arrival of natural gas.</P>
    <P>I presume we will have an opportunity <Col N="313" /> to go into this in more detail next week on the Adjournment debate.  That is the way I feel about it.  It is time that people should make up their minds where they are going, nail their colours to the mast, point the direction in which this economy can develop whether it is in the area of an energy policy or an industrial policy, and let us get on with the job.</P>
    <P>I would also like the Minister to comment on the five-year corporate plans for the semi-State bodies.  Has the five-year corporate plan which we heard about 12 months ago been delivered into the office of the Minister in relation to Bord na Móna, the ESB or the INPC, and if not why not?  Can he give us some idea as to where the future lies in relation to policy planning and development by the ESB, Bord na Móna and the INPC, or was this another cosmetic exercise to fit the bill on the day on which it was announced?</P>
    <P>There are others who want to make contributions.  I will not hold you any longer except to ask if the Minister will take this opportunity of giving me the information I have sought in relation to it.  The Department of Energy, while not having a very big Estimate in monetary terms, nevertheless has a vital role to play in the economic development of this country.  What we want to see is an energy policy that takes account of the coming on stream of more and more natural gas into the city of Dublin and elsewhere. Naturally that is in competition with the ESB consumers.  Where are we going in the future?  Where is the emphasis and the policy direction going to be in the development of our natural resources in gas, electricity, coal, producing something like 900 megawatts at Moneypoint? Has this been looked at?  Has it been balanced, and what is the best balance in relation to moving forward in the economic development of the country?  If that exercise has not started it is time it did start, because it may be too late.  It is showing signs of being too late, when we arrive at a situation where two semi-State bodies, the ESB and Bord na Móna, under the direction, supervision and statutory authority of one Minister, seem to be going in opposite directions and both of them looking after their own <Col N="314" /> independent republics.  We cannot afford that wastage of public funds.  It is time that there was better co-ordination, better forward planning.  This is an area where poor planning in the past has been reflected.  It is time to improve on it for the future.  Nevertheless, the progressive policies pursued by Bord na Móna in the past should not be stultified at this stage. They should be given clear policy direction by the Government to let them go on and do the job.  The same goes in relation to the ESB.  Whatever the political decisions that have to be taken let them be taken and let the ESB go about their business.  They, too, have shown themselves to be highly commercialised, very sharp in their commercial dealings. Nevertheless they are being hindered by the lack of policy direction and decision making by the Government.  You have the responsibility.  You are elected to do a job and you should do the job whether or not your supporters like it in the short-term.  The country will thank you in the long-term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate is very important in the sense that energy costs have a great bearing on our employment prospects.  One of the things that we should emphasise is that we must try to ensure the maximisation of the use of our natural resources in order to do two things: to ensure the maintenance of as many jobs as possible at home and, at the same time, to contribute to the improvement of our balance of payments.  This Estimate is most important and one on which I feel we should have perhaps a longer time to discuss than we have the opportunity to do here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to raise a couple of points that have been alluded to by the previous speaker.  I refer to the importance of jobs and their interrelationship with energy. Nowadays there is such dependence on electricity in the whole area of industry that every possibility must be explored to ensure that we keep energy costs as low as possible.  We must try to ensure that the manner in which we produce electricity is as efficient as possible.  In all of this the peat generating stations, which have been the subject of some discussion for <Col N="315" /> some time past, have a useful role to play in that they have become part and parcel of the social and economic life of their respective communities.  In this regard I should like to ask the Minister, as has Deputy Reynolds, to further clarify some confusion that may have arisen following the recent announcement.  Some workers in the Allenwood generating station, County Kildare, have asked me to raise with the Minister whether or not it means that the station, which the local committee feels has a possible lifespan of 12 to 15 years at present, will have its continued existence assured following the recent decision.  Should something untold happen by way of maintenance difficulty in the meantime would that prematurely bring about the end of the commissioning of that station?  It is important because that station did have what is known in the business as a mid life renewal some years ago which has allowed it to have another 12 to 15 years of a reasonably useful lifespan.  I should like to ask the Minister to do everything possible to ensure that that lifespan is realised and thereby protect not only the jobs of those directly employed in the station but also those employed in the production of sod peat in the Allenwood area generally.</P>
    <P>Another thing that needs to be referred to and which only comes up when thoughts about the closure of such stations arise is replacement industry. Replacement employment for those involved in the production of electricity or peat, should anything happen which would change prospects for them, is most important.  Careful consideration should be given to exploring the possibility of replacing stations many of which over the next 20 to 30 years will ultimately have outlived their usefulness and replacements will have to be found by one means or another.  We should address ourselves to that problem now and not await a doomsday situation as has happened in the past whereby at the eleventh hour we all look around for an alternative when it appears that a peat generating station is about to close or a Bord na Móna operation is in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>There are numerous alternatives that <Col N="316" /> would be very acceptable and compatible with those environments.  A good day's work would be done if we could at this time set targets for the provision of replacements &mdash; whether that means afforestation, grass production, horticultural operations, lakelands, artificial lakes or tourist amenities.  All of those avenues can and should be explored, all are employment orientated and all would be extremely beneficial.  It would alleviate the fears that have rested with some of those communities for a number of years because they feel that enough is not being done by way of consideration of those alternatives.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to make is in relation to natural gas.  It would be desirable that where new communities are developing and where there will be an increasing need for the provision of industrial jobs over the next few years every effort should be made to ensure that they are given every opportunity to avail of natural gas.  Whether this is by means of domestic supply or by direct provision to industry is immaterial.  The important thing is to ensure that that natural resource is made as available as possible to as large a sector of the community as possible with the greatest possible benefits.  That is something that should be kept in mind.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay further the proceedings of the House.  I wish to emphasise from my own constituency point of view &mdash; and I know the Minister's own colleagues in that constituency would be very concerned to ensure this also &mdash; that stations such as Allenwood are assured of their lifespan more definitely than what appears to be the interpretation of the recent announcement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister when replying to clear up a few points that I find contradictory in the Estimate which he has moved here this morning. On page 11 he talks about how Bord na Móna have been sensitively cared for in the ESB's strategic plan 1983-1988. Yet on page 16 of his speech he says that there will be some minor impact on Bord na Móna resulting from the <Col N="317" /> ESB's strategic plan.  I see the Minister trying to play off one State body against another.  I am very concerned that the proposed briquette factory at Derryfadda near Ballyforan in my own constituency has been suspended.  The Minister has given us very little information as to what the outcome of the review will be.  One of the hallmarks of the Minister's speech is that he has highlighted some problems but there are no decisions, no policy and no commitment to the briquette factory.</P>
      <P>Over the last five years I have listened to two reviews being announced and I am very concerned that we have not got any definite commitment to continue with the project at Derryfadda.  We have also had Government speakers telling us that the EEC would be prepared to give it loans. We have had Government speakers say that the EEC will give us grants.  I understand that that would be the position because turf, or peat as it is called in the EEC, is regarded as an energy resource which would be allowed grant aid.  This has been fought for in the European Parliament and I understand it has been accepted.  I cannot understand why the Minister and the Government would not avail of grants and, hopefully, loans to continue with the building of that briquette factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told us this morning that £4.6 million will be spent this year out of the original Estimate of £15.4 million. Year after year we hear from the Government that £X million is provided in the Estimates but we can see now that less than one-third is going to be spent this year.  Last year I understand there was £5.2 million in the Estimate and I should like to know what was spent out of that allocation?  Over the last couple of years money has been put into the Estimates and only a small amount of it has been spent.  The people in my constituency and in Roscommon are very cynical and very frustrated at the way major announcements are made about money in the Estimates and then we see only a fraction of that money being spent.  When replying could the Minister tell us where the money is being spent?  He mentioned the jobs of 156 people which are in jeopardy and, according to the Minister, Bord na <Col N="318" /> Móna cannot see the possibility of continuing to develop the bogs after one year.  He has given only part of the story there.  There are 60 part-time employees there whose income from Bord na Móna supplements their small farms.  There are young people there who learn their trade as apprentices and indeed many State bodies sponsor them to learn their trade in Derryfadda.  There is no mention of what will happen to the part-time employees if the decision to suspend the project is not reversed.  We will also be losing skills and the local knowledge that young people are getting there.</P>
    <P>It is time we had some Government intervention concerning this project.  We had Government intervention in some of the ESB power stations in Laois/Offaly, which was certainly an election ploy and was treated in a very cynical way by the electorate there.  We had no Government intervention in Screeb in Connemara to assist a power station which was very important to the Connemara area and just as important as a major factory in Dublin or Cork.  There has been no Government intervention either in Derryfadda. I am very disappointed that there has been no decision by the Minister. All he has done is to outline the problem here.  Would he not agree that it is economic lunacy to have money spent there and then leave the whole project like a white elephant?  I would like to know from the Minister what the situation is as regards money being spent there.  Up to the end of 1983 we had £4.7 million spent there.  That does not take into account the contract that Bord na Móna had entered into and surely a semi-State body can enter into a contract in good faith, because there is enough of milled peat produced there to start the production of briquettes.  We do not know how many contracts Bord na Móna have entered into.  It is a serious situation for them that this project is now suspended for a full year.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed that the private bog development scheme is going to be reviewed.  It certainly was a major benefit to people who developed bog lifts that Bord na Móna would not normally be interested in.  Another aspect of that <Col N="319" /> scheme is that it repaired bog roads.  It is the only scheme under which bog roads can now be repaired because the EEC regulations on local improvement schemes do not allow money to be spent on bog roads or for bog drainage.  All that money is now allocated towards farm roads.  I would stress to the Tánaiste that we should be talking about increasing the allocation for private bog development, total development of bog roads, drains and the actual production of turf there. I should also like to put it to the Minister that, as regards the briquette factory at Derryfadda, we should be developing our natural resources in very isolated areas of Counties Galway and Roscommon where jobs are at stake.  If the Government are not prepared to intervene now I would like them to consider bringing this project under the umbrella of the National Development Corporation.  We heard the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, telling us that this project was one of considerable risk.  I should like to ask the Tánaiste if there is some way, whether it is through the NDC or some other body, that the Government can intervene to ensure that we will continue to develop our natural resources and particularly the building of the briquette factory here.  I have seen an article in <i>The Irish Press</i> by Mr. Rattigan, the former managing director, about the situation down in Bellacorick.  He referred to the benefits that came from milled peat and he went on to say that, where raw materials for energy are being imported into this country, &ldquo;One might as well contemplate getting rid of the national dairy herd because cheaper milk could be shipped by tanker from New Zealand&rdquo;.  I am sure there are many other examples we could give of allowing imports into the country instead of developing our natural resources.  Are we going to allow the wheel to turn the full circle now and do it ourselves rather than develop our own resources and provide jobs and teach the skills that are available for young people in a place like Derryfadda which is in my own constituency.</P>
    <P>Although the amount of money here may be small compared to other Estimates, <Col N="320" /> this Energy Estimate moved by the Minister here today is very important. I am certainly disappointed that there are very few decisions here.  We have outlined the problems.  We have some contradictions but we have no decisions and at the end of the day we have no policy by the Tánaiste and by the Government.</P>

I am sure the Minister will have sufficient energy to ensure that this Estimate which is so important for the development of our natural resources will not be a Vote of £10 million this time next year when we come to debate it. The Tánaiste will still be handling that section of our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord na Móna, 40 years in business, and contributing 15 per cent to our national energy needs, have enormous potential if only we had a Government with the financial interests of this island at heart.  The decision of the Government to force Bord na Móna to review, analyse, postpone and now officially defer the building of the Derryfadda briquette factory at Ballyforan is the most blatant political discrimination ever imposed in any part of this State.  The financial loss to the national economy and to the western economy shows that the supposedly socialist-inhibited Government have no interest in developing our natural resources or indeed providing jobs that are so vitally necessary at this time.  It is totally inconsistent and economic madness that is the hallmark of this academically-led Fine Gael-controlled Government.  The threat to and loss of permanent jobs throughout Bord na <Col N="321" /> Móna and the total termination of seasonal jobs endangers the viability and the economic structure of Bord na Móna. The Minister referred to the proposal to defer the building of this factory due to the marketing situation.  I would say to the Minister that surely marketing is meeting a temporary set-back and a temporary problem; it is something that can be expanded and developed.  With proper expertise and proper financial investment it can be improved.  There is no doubt about it.  The market is there and surely this marketing strategy could be developed alongside the building of the factory. We could not accept that a flimsy excuse like marketing problems would be the reason for Board na Móna's pressured decision to postpone the factory and we in the west are totally disappointed with this Government.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer also to the situation in regard to natural gas.  There was no mention whatever of the necessity to provide natural gas to the farmers of Dublin, Meath and Louth who are making such a contribution and indeed at a major cost to themselves and to our vegetable market here at home.  Surely there is a major opportunity here for the Government to save at least £100 million annually by providing a cheap energy resource to provide all-year-round growing for the farmers of this area which is so important to our capital city and our country.  There is no mention whatever of the major market in Northern Ireland available to them although the fact is that we have already signed a deal with the British Government, a deal which is now in question.  Today's papers, and particularly <i>The Irish Press</i>, clearly illustrate this and the headline, for the Minister's information is &ldquo;British to Seek Gas Pipe Cuts&rdquo;.  The British Government, it says are to seek a cut in the price that the South is proposing to charge to supply Kinsale gas to the North.  The deal has been signed and agreed as far as we are concerned as a Government.  Indeed this should be our position on the Forum also, that as long as we are dealing with Britain in a situation like that we stick to what has been signed and agreed.  We do not deviate from it and we are quite confident <Col N="322" /> that if you stick rigidly to that you will get what you have already agreed to.  Our resources must contribute to their maximum potential to our economy and to our people.</P>
    <P>With regard to the oil situation, we are faced with the failure of the Government to create economic activity or even a favourable economic environment. Despite the fact that our economy is in such a depressed state at the moment we all realise that there are Irish overseas who have done well, who have the resources financially and the liquid capital available to invest here if there is a suitable environment here and if there is an invitation and an opportunity offered for Irish people to invest money and take foreign money into this country and make 100 per cent contribution to our economy.  The failure of the Government to create that economic environment due to high taxation, high costs and high VAT rate in our country has not led to the expeditious development of exploration off our shores that we would like to see. I would suggest to the Minister, as a very important man and as a man whom we respect in this Government, that he should, representing a socialist party, ensure that a proper economic environment is available here and will be available in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>There is no mention here and, indeed, the official Government organ has not covered the fact at all this morning, that petrol has gone up by 1½p.  Just a few short weeks ago, due to the fact that the dollar had a major effect on decreasing the price of petrol, you would nearly think that the petrol came from Bula Mines so much propaganda was used by the Minister, Deputy Bruton in announcing that petrol prices were coming down. But there is no mention now that the price of petrol which is such a vital element in keeping us all mobile has gone up 1½p since last night.  This shows the necessity to create that economic environment which I have referred to.</P>
    <P>I want to give an opportunity to our new colleague, Deputy Brian Cowen, to speak.  I wish him many, many years of success in this House following in the footsteps of his late, noble and eminent <Col N="323" /> father, Deputy Ber Cowen.  I hope that this time next year when we come to discuss these Estimates again, through the good offices of the Minister we will have a total, positive type of investment and a favourable climate for development of our natural resources that can contribute so much to the prosperity of this island.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to use this brief opportunity to ask the Minister certain very relevant questions in relation to his plan in the ESB for which I would like to thank him.  It played a major part in our massive victory in the by-election.  He has resorted in certain instances here to very general rhetoric.  He said he has a firm ESB policy to promote and support Irish industry as much as possible.  It would surprise many of the workers that the Minister's party is supposed to represent, that the plan which was released in October of last year and which he sought to clarify briefly before the by-election by his statement did not refer to the crisis of the power stations.  That statement as quoted from his speech was surprising indeed.  He refers particularly in his speech under the heading of the ESB to capital expenditure, to the extension that is going on at Shannonbridge which is a relatively modern power station in my constituency, but he does not refer in any of his speech to the major crisis which affects the power stations in my constituency and elsewhere at present, that is the serious rundown in budget maintenance.  Plants are run down there and shortly they will not be viable projects <Col N="324" /> at all, due to the conscious efforts of this Government to run down the plant and the reason is that the Minister is not prepared to make the money available. Whatever he thinks the shop stewards of the ESB know exactly what is going on and we have detailed figures to show that the Minister is not making the money available.  If he is not prepared to make the money available let us know and let our people at home know that he is not making it available because this is supposed to be the open, reforming Government, the Government of integrity and honesty.  Let us hear it from them.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I would like to say that our spokesman, Deputy Reynolds, has referred to the stations remaining open subject to plant availability.  It would seem to me that if the Minister is not prepared to make the money available to ensure that the stations are going to be run on a viable basis, Ferbane and Rhodes and the rest of them are going to go eventually. If that is the case, let us know.</P>
    <P>Also, what has not been referred to is whether the Minister is committed to going back to the previous staff levels that were there.  The shop stewards want to know if he is going to run the stations at present staff levels.  Presently they are very severely understaffed.  We want to know what is the Government commitment in that area.</P>
    <P>Ballyforan is outside my constituency but Derrinlough engineering works is in my constituency and it very much depends on whether or not Ballyforan goes ahead.  It provides employment for 150 people.  If Ballyforan is being deferred for a year what happens to Derrinlough in the meantime?  If Ballyforan is being deferred what work is available for the people in Derrinlough? In regard to contracts which are presently being given outside the board to private companies, a fact which the Minister as a socialist would find anathema in any semi-State body, is he going to take a policy decision?</P>

I have it on good information from a horticulturist that if the board continue with cut-away bogs down to the levels which they are talking about, we will not have the peat available to ensure that we can have intensive horticulture which is a very labour intensive industry in our area.  I am asking the Minister to clarify these issues.  The people at home want to know them and I am sure his few supporters in the Labour Party in Laois-Offaly also want to know them.</P>

      <P>Like previous speakers I, too, would like to welcome Deputy Cowen to the House.  I certainly think it is important to have young men around the House.  I am not looking at anyone in particular here this morning.  But I certainly welcome Deputy Cowen and his contribution.  He started off on the right foot with a good, aggressive, balanced contribution, and I look forward to hearing many more from him.  The people of the midlands can feel that they have done well for themselves in their decision and I say that out of respect for the Cowen family, some of whom had a little part to play in the education of young Spring here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many points have been raised and it would be quite difficult to cover all the areas but I can assure the Deputies that where anything that is left undone at this stage I will certainly try to come back to it in the course of future debates or in the next few weeks.  I will take points in no particular order because I think many of the speakers had various concerns; some in fact voiced similar concerns both on a national basis and with geographical emphasis.  I assure the Members across the House that I can understand the geographical nature of their concerns.  On a general note, I realise that cynicism abounds in this country at the moment. In fact we might be helping towards it ourselves, but in relation to the policy aspects of the ESB strategic plan, I made a statement a number of weeks ago. Granted it had a certain bearing on life in the midlands, on the future of the <Col N="326" /> stations in the midlands.  We should not underestimate that it had a very significant bearing, and indeed will have a significant bearing on many other areas of the country, including Kerry, Cork, Wexford, Dublin and right throughout the country, Connemara and Clare.  All the aspects of that decision were not the most popular.</P>
    <P>I have heard some Deputies referring to the delays in relation to reviewing the strategic plan.  I can assure the Deputies there was no delay, and there was also the possibility of causing a delay in relation to a general election situation, but as far as I am concerned as soon as the strategic plan was received in my Department, we set about looking at it.  I can assure the House that at no time were any of the officials in my Department in the course of our consultations or in the course of the examination of the strategic plan given any overriding political considerations. We were to look at the strategic plan from the point of view of something that has been very much the theme here this morning, the overall energy strategy for this country.  That was the basis on which the examination took place.  That was the basis on which I felt at the first available opportunity the decision would be announced.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of the Ballyforan project which we have debated at some length in this House &mdash; and many of the points raised this morning have been dealt with previously &mdash; I believe that the decision of the Government in ordering the review of this project has in fact been proved to have been the correct decision.  We all have our own regional concerns and own national concerns in terms of creating employment, but we have to look at and assess the basis on which employment is created.  The review in relation to Ballyforan brought the Bord na Móna board itself back to my Department with the option of the deferment for 12 months, because of many factors which I have outlined in this House recently.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Reynolds as a successful businessman must be aware of the type of analysis that has to go into the <Col N="327" /> question of building a major project like the Ballyforan briquette factory.  At any given time one must assess and make predictions and projections in relation to the demand for energy products.  In our situation the demand for energy products has fallen off drastically.  The output of briquettes from the existing factories could not be disposed of if we were to bring on to the market the anticipated production at the Ballyforan project, be it stage 1 or stage 2.  We cannot have the cake and eat it in certain situations where we want to have the expenditure justified.  At the end of the day &mdash; and I take Deputy Treacy's point in relation to the marketing situation &mdash; in our country the marketing situation particularly in the solid fuel area is one which fluctuates, obviously depending on many variable factors.  The sales of briquettes in 1983-84 were only 90 per cent of projected sales and only marginally above the 1982-83 figures.  I have asked for an updating on the marketing strategy and the whole question of marketing.  This is one of the situations where we must convince the Irish people that they have a role to play in relation to the marketing to our native products and try to substitute indigenous fuel resources for imported oil or coal.  For the present there is no possibility that marketing can be seen to improve in the short-term.</P>

      <P>A number of speakers referred to the question of the private bog scheme.  I would like to remind Deputies in the House that in relation to the situation when the late Deputy George Colley introduced the scheme in 1981 he very clearly stated at that time that he would be reviewing the scheme or seeking a review within the period of two to three years.  Regrettably, the time has passed and I accept the merit and the success of the scheme which has been very successful to date but there have also been other considerations, and one must look at the implications and the effect of the expansion of the private bog <Col N="328" /> development scheme on Bord na Móna. We must look at the ability of the private producers to dispose of the turf produced. Obviously, and it is significant, the growth in private production has a serious effect on the briquette market. These matters will have to be looked at in the course of the review, and I assure the Deputies and the House that the review is being undertaken looking at the positive side of the scheme which has to be looked at after the three-year period.</P>
      <P>Deputies have asked questions in relation to the future of the Allenwood and Portarlington stations.  As I said on the previous occasion the sod peat stations will continue in operation until the Bord na Móna bogs supplying them run out. We arrive at a fairly obvious conclusion at the stage when there is not raw material available within the direct area surrounding these stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various questions have been asked in relation to the ESB corporate plans.  My Department has set out to get the corporate plans to cover a five-year period. The ESB and the INPC corporate plans have been received in the Department and we are at present examining them.  Bord Gáis and Bord na Móna points of view have not been furnished as yet.  We are expecting them very shortly.  We are in close contact with them.  In regard to the planning functions of my Department which Deputy Reynolds referred to in the earlier part of his contribution, my planning function is to ensure that there is a consistency and proper co-ordination between all of these bodies.  Deputy Treacy came in and said it looked like I was trying to bang heads together in terms of getting these bodies together; they have all separate functions within the energy area.  It is my function to make sure all those plans are co-ordinated, that we do not have Bord na Móna doing something that will jeopardise the ESB or <i>vice versa</i> as has happened in certain situations.  My function is to ensure that there is continual review of the situation between these four bodies, to ensure that their corporate plans are going in the direction which is of benefit to the Government and the people and to <Col N="329" /> ensure that future policy incorporates each of these various bodies in the energy area.  We have to ensure that natural gas will be developed to capture domestic and industrial markets in the main urban areas.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of phasing out the usage of gas for electricity generation when the coal plant in Moneypoint comes into production.  There is the question of making sure that we have the maximum use of milled peat for electricity generation and for the maximum possible production of briquettes.  At all times in terms of Government policy we have to be aware of the vulnerability of the energy front and ensure that we can cushion this country and the Government from any fluctuations which may take place on the world market.  The progress that has already been achieved by us in terms of our vulnerability on the whole question of oil is significant and the fact that we have reduced our dependence on oil from 70 per cent to 50 per cent.  Our domestic production in the other area has gone up from 20 per cent to 40 per cent. It is very important that at all times we have diversified options in relation to producing energy so that any short-term fluctuations in the world situation, be it in the oil or coal markets, will not jeopardise our situation overnight.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the ESB and Bord na Móna situation has been clarified in the last number of weeks.  The strategic plan does ensure and will go ahead to ensure the maximum output and utilisation of milled peat and safeguard the Bord na Móna operations.  A question has been raised in relation to the plant availability.  Plant availability obviously has to be looked at from the point of view of merit in terms of efficiency ratios in relation to the output of the plants.  The stations at Bellacorick, Cahirciveen and Gweedore have been mentioned.  These in fact are lower-efficiency stations than, say, Aghada which is a gas-fired one but in relation to their usage those stations have been seen to have a high-efficiency ratio in terms of turf production stations.  Obviously, it is a question of continuous maintenance.  I can assure the House that the normal <Col N="330" /> practice of replacing parts will continue and ensure that these stations are kept in full and efficient production.  A very important aspect of this whole matter is the question of efficiency in production.</P>
    <P>The whole question of the natural gas area has been raised.  Deputy Reynolds and I have on past occasions looked at this and considered it in what I assume will be a continuous discussion.  Perhaps in 10 years' time we will both have to make judgments on what happened 10 years previously in relation to the Dublin gas situation.  The project is under way as is consideration of supplying the urban areas generally.  We must be realistic in this House on the question of the urban areas that are going to get gas. These will have to be commercial projects. I take Deputy Reynolds point.  We are trying to reach the same goal, perhaps, going in different directions, in ensuring that our natural resources are used for the best benefit of the economy and for the consumer.</P>

      <P>On the question of supplies to Northern Ireland, it has become public knowledge that difficulties have arisen.  The Department and myself were going ahead on the basis of the agreement being signed and going ahead with the deal.  I know that a lot of time and energy was spent in the preparation of the memorandum of understanding which has been initialled.  We both see it from the point of view of the usage of natural gas.  We had resources in this country which we felt would have been of benefit to the economy of Northern Ireland.  From my point of view and the Government's point of view we are very anxious that the agreement would go ahead on the basis already agreed, That will be the basis of any further discussions which we will be having.  Bord Gáis are at present looking at the depletion policy so as to ensure that at all times over the next decade we will have the optimum usage of supplies over the life of the Kinsale Head field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="331" /> Deputy Reynolds touched on the whole question of electricity prices, an important area because of the general focus now on what is considered to be the high price of industrial energy.  As regards the decisions on Irish steel, obviously there is a fine balance to be achieved in consideration of all the factors, including probably the most important one, the tariff structural electricity prices for large industrial users.  Industry generally has been complaining for some time that electricity prices are a serious handicap to their competitiveness.  I am conscious of this matter, a matter that the Government will be looking at in the short term.</P>
    <P>I regret that time is limited.  I thank the Deputies opposite for their co-operation. As I have said, I will come back to them on a number of points which I have not had time to consider. I will make myself available for discussions with them at any time because it is important that we develop this area along lines that can be seen to be for the benefit of the economy and of the people generally.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £17,467,000 be granted to defray the charge that will come in course of payment during the year ending on 31 December, 1984, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, including sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>I propose, as in previous years, to discuss the Fisheries and Forestry Estimates together and I shall move the Forestry Estimate at the conclusion of the debate.</P>
      <P>The amount provided for the Fisheries Vote this year represents an increase of 6 per cent over last year's outturn and will be adequate to continue the development of our sea and inland fisheries resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During 1983 the estimated value of <Col N="332" /> landings of sea fish excluding salmon in home ports and abroad by Irish registered vessels was £50 million.  The estimated value of exports of fish and fish products during the same period was £80 million.  These are new records.  The principal export outlets are France, Great Britain, West Germany and the Netherlands and, outside the EEC, Nigeria, Spain and Sweden.</P>
    <P>Investment in shore-based processing facilities continued during 1983.  Eleven fish-processing projects were approved for EEC FEOGA aid amounting to £2.6 million.  The total capital investment in those 11 projects came to £5.8 million, including grants amounting to £1.3 million made available by the Industrial Development Authority and Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Over 70 firms are engaged in fish processing and they employ about 1,700 persons.</P>
    <P>The grant-in-aid to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara for Administration and Current Development amounts to £4.804 million and the grant-in-aid for Capital Development amounts to £2.740 million. Additional funds for capital development are available by way of repayable advances from the Central Fund and a total of £3 million has been allocated for this purpose in 1984.  Funds are also available by way of a line of credit from financial institutions to meet the continued demand by fishermen for loans for boats, gear, re-engining and other purposes.</P>
    <P>Further financial assistance to fishermen is provided by way of an interest subvention scheme.  This element of subsidy for the fishing fleet represents a considerable further aid for the fleet and in 1984 £1.3 million has been allocated for this purpose.  A sum of £1.115 million approximately is provided to meet the cost of grants under the board's marine credit plan; the board's grant-in-aid for capital development also includes a provision of £373,000 for grants for mariculture development and the provision of services to the fishing industry such as ice plants and training facilities.</P>
    <P>The continuing high level of arrears in boat repayments is a matter for concern. The situation is serious but it is noteworthy that in some ports there are <Col N="333" /> boat-owners who are up to date with their repayments.  Every effort is being made by BIM to reduce the level of arrears and I am at present reviewing the whole position.  I have full confidence in BIM to deal with any problems of arrears in an equitable manner in consultation with the fishermen concerned.</P>
    <P>My Department are at present in the process of holding public inquiries around the coast prior to considering designation of areas for aquaculture development in accordance with the Fisheries Act, 1980.  When the designation process is completed individuals will then be licensed to operate in specified areas. There appears to be some misunderstanding, I believe particularly among some local authorities, about the possible effects of designation of areas for mariculture purposes on other activities in these same areas.  I would like to assure them that their fears are unfounded and to stress that aquaculture development and other activities such as the establishment of industry and recreation can coexist in the same general area.  Indeed aquaculture development can provide raw material for industry in areas where potential for industrial development is limited.  In any event I will of course have full regard to all representations made by the various interests concerned in the course of the public inquiries before making the relevant designation orders.</P>
    <P>BIM continues its mariculture grants scheme for both pilot and commercial fish farming projects.  This scheme, coupled with the FEOGA grants available for such projects, plays a crucial role in the development of this sector of the industry.</P>
    <P>There is, I believe, considerable scope for the development of mariculture in this country and I am examining ways and means by which that development can be accelerated.  We enjoy many advantages here for mariculture development. These include a long coastline and relatively unpolluted waters, but careful planning and research is essential to ensure success.  I welcome the appointment of a full-time manager by the Tralee Oyster Fisheries Society and I look forward to the implementation of the development <Col N="334" /> plan prepared by the society for the conservation and rational development of the valuable Tralee oyster beds for which considerable State and EEC aid is being provided.</P>
    <P>The Sectoral Consultative Committee on Fisheries has presented its report to the Sectoral Development Committee and I expect that the final report will be available shortly.  I am confident that the considered recommendations of both committees will be of great benefit to the Government in deciding new policies and strategies for charting the future course of the industry.</P>
    <P>Our first year's experience of the Common Fisheries Policy was not an altogether happy one, mainly because of the late agreement in December 1983 on Total Allowable Catches (TACs) and Quotas.  That particular problem was be devilled by an ongoing wrangle over the share out of newly-available herring in the North Sea which thankfully was resolved in December 1983, thus leading to agreement on stocks of interest to us. We were immediately presented with proposals for 1984 TACs and quotas and I am very happy that these were agreed at the meeting of Fisheries Ministers on 31 January 1984.</P>
    <P>In regard to the details of the quotas' agreement I am satisfied that we have obtained the best deal possible, given the state of some of our stocks, particularly herring.  We have attained our &ldquo;Hague&rdquo; target overall, shortfalls in our herring allocations being compensated for by additional quantities for other species, mainly mackerel.</P>
    <P>We are now in a position for the first time to implement the terms of the Common Fisheries Policy in the areas of TACs and quotas without which other aspects of the policy, such as access, conservation and control are rather meaningless.  Thus I see 1984 as offering the first real test of the CFP and I have every reason to believe that it will pass that test.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the export refund for whole frozen mackerel was abolished with effect from 1 November 1983.  With the aid of this refund and, may I add, the marketing arm of BIM, a successful export trade to Nigeria in particular <Col N="335" /> was built up.  I protested vigorously to the EEC Commission about the abolition of the export refund for mackerel and as a result of my protest an examination of the Irish mackerel market was undertaken by Commission officials. Unfortunately the Commission maintained that our problems stemmed primarily from the high cost of finance charges here and thus could not be properly dealt with in a fisheries measure.</P>
    <P>I believe that the abolition of the refund is a reflection of the severe strain on the finances of the Community which, as we know, has already had effects in other sectors particularly in agricultural products.</P>
    <P>The advisory committee on marketing, which has been meeting under the chairmanship of Mr. Michael D'Arcy TD, Minister of State at my Department, has done very valuable work in the past year in making practical suggestions for the improvement of marketing arrangements for fish.  BIM are also continuing their efforts in locating remunerative markets abroad for Irish fish and I recently visited Japan with officials from the board in order to carry out an examination of the market potential there.  As a result of the visit, which was very encouraging, representatives of a number of Japanese firms will be visiting Ireland shortly for discussions with Irish exporters.</P>
    <P>Irish exports to Japan have increased from £38,000 in 1981 to £844,000 last year, mainly frozen herring roe and frozen and smoked salmon.  The exporters are now looking at prospects for herring, mackerel and consumer packed shellfish, including crab and Dublin Bay prawns. Recently the Japanese Government have become committed to improving the level of imports, particularly from the EEC, to balance exports from Japan and I am confident that Irish fish exports can secure a satisfactory measure of the improved markets likely to be available.</P>
    <P>A positive result of a recent EEC Council of Ministers meeting was an agreement that the Commission would carry out a study of the Community's herring market which has been severely depressed for some time.  We have participated <Col N="336" /> in this study and I hope that following examination of the report action will be taken by the Community which will give a much needed boost in demand for our herring landings.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware mackerel represents almost 60 per cent of our national catch and the marketing of this species is therefore of paramount importance to our fishermen.  We have in recent years been largely dependent on the Nigerian market and concern has been expressed by my Department and BIM on the dangers of dependence on one particular market.  There are problems in exporting fish to Nigeria at present because the new Government there has become rather restrictive in issuing import licences which are now required for all imports into that country.  This problem is incidentally not confined to fish but applies to most commodities.  Everything possible is being done to expedite the issue of licences and I hope that the problem will be satisfactorily resolved.  At the same time efforts are continuing to diversify mackerel exports to other markets.</P>
    <P>The amount allocated this year in Subhead C.2 of the Vote for fishery harbour improvement works is £2.7 million.  This sum is needed to pay for work in progress at the start of the year and the balance will be used to commence some urgently needed new works.</P>
    <P>During the last year work on the Howth development scheme progressed satisfactorily.  Work on the west pier has been completed except for resurfacing which is expected to be put in hand shortly.  The syncrolift and boat yard have been completed.  A contract has been passed for the provision of a new ice-plant and work is scheduled to commence shortly.  Arrangements were completed with Dublin Corporation for landscaping the sea front.</P>
    <P>At Castletownbere work on the provision of an effluent treatment plant has now been completed.</P>
    <P>At Killybegs the erection of a telephone exchange building to provide a much needed improvement in communications is also virtually completed.</P>
    <P>At Rossaveal a sectored navigational light to guide vessels from the open sea <Col N="337" /> into the approach channel in Casla Bay has been erected.  A net and gear storage compound as well as a net repair area have been provided.  A harbour master has been appointed.  A comprehensive brief on which the overall development plan will be based was forwarded by my Department to the Office of Public Works.  At present marine engineers of the Office of Public Works are working on the plan and are endeavouring to have it available at an early date.</P>
    <P>A major development scheme at Caherciveen was completed.  Works on other major schemes are progressing satisfactorily at Kilcummin and Killala in County Mayo and at Portevlin, County Donegal. The schemes at Kilcummin and Killala are expected to be completed this year and the scheme at Portevlin is due for completion early in 1985.  A minor scheme at Liscannor, County Clare, was completed and work is in progress on the pier at Seafield, County Clare.  Work started recently on a scheme at Rathlacken, County Mayo.  Rock armouring of portion of the West Wall at Kilmore as a first stage of a development scheme for the harbour has been carried out. Arrangements have been made with Donegal County Council for replacement of the fendering on the pier at Rathmullan.</P>
    <P>During the present year the main contract work will be completed at Howth as will be also surfacing of the west pier and the necessary amenity works.  Ongoing works will also be completed at a number of other landing places.  Provision has been made in the harbour development programme for the construction of the syncrolift at Killybegs and for essential repairs to the pier at Schull as part of a major improvement scheme there.  In all, work is expected to be undertaken at over 20 landing centres in the current year.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the inland fisheries.  The Central and Regional Fisheries Boards, which were set up in October 1980 continue to work for the better conservation, protection and development of every aspect of our valuable inland fisheries. Considerable progress has been made by the boards in the law enforcement area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="338" /> Under section 32 of the Fisheries Act, 1980, the introduction of a staff scheme for the staff of the central and regional boards is well under way.  This scheme provides for the rationalisation of staff structures and salaries and for improved deployment of all staff.  A superannuation scheme for the staff of the central and regional boards was finalised in July 1983 and all eligible staff are now being given the opportunity to make provision for a pension for both themselves and their dependants.  In the context of the proposed staff scheme substantial increases have been approved for the protection staff of the regional fisheries boards.</P>
    <P>The most important aspect of our inland fisheries is our salmon fisheries.  In 1983 the total weight of the salmon catch by all fishing methods was 1,512 tonnes valued at approximately £6.7 million as compared with 908 tonnes valued at £3.9 million in 1982.  The overall weight of our salmon catch in 1983 showed an increase of almost 67 per cent on the 1982 catch. While this increase in the salmon catch is very encouraging the overall stock situation must still be very carefully monitored. Illegal salmon fishing is still a major problem and the flagrant disregard shown by some fishermen and salmon dealers for the necessary salmon conservation measures in force, is difficult to understand.  Salmon stocks are being protected for the benefit of present and future generations of fishermen.</P>
    <P>I carried out a comprehensive review of salmon conservation measures, involving consultations with all sections of fishermen, and fishery boards, as well as studying all the relevant facts and statistics available before the commencement of the present salmon fishing season.  My consultations with the various interests involved showed a wide divergence of opinions.  However, I have the ultimate responsibility for the conservation and rational exploitation of our salmon stocks and the overall national interests have to take precedence over individual groups or sectors of the industry.  There is also an onus on me to ensure that, as far as possible, catches are equally distributed between the different categories of fishermen, <Col N="339" /> something which is very difficult to achieve.</P>
    <P>There was a sharp fall in salmon catches in the late seventies and as a result my predecessors had no option but to introduce stringent conservation measures to protect our valuable salmon stocks.  That these measures were necessary has, I feel, been proven by the fact that catches of salmon have fallen from over 2,000 tonnes in 1975 to about 600 tonnes in 1981.  I am glad to say, however, that catches have since increased and the 1983 catch was, as I indicated earlier, up to 1,500 tonnes.  That is not to say, however, that we no longer need conservation measures.  It is essential for the maintenance of these valuable stocks that there is sufficient escapement into our rivers each year to allow for adequate spawning to maintain the necessary levels of recruitment in future years.</P>
    <P>There has been in recent years a lot of criticism and differences of opinion about our conservation measures.  Some fishermen consider they are oppressive, others maintain that they are inadequate or are not being properly enforced.  There have also been clashes between fishermen and fisheries protection staff, which is something I abhor.</P>
    <P>The main changes I decided to make were as follows: (1) The ban on the use of monofilament nets for salmon fishing to be retained but the regulation is to be amended to ensure that fishermen engaged legitimately in fishing for species other than salmon are not liable to conviction. I hope to have the necessary amending order made within the next week or two; (2) The extension of the commercial net fishing season by one week in the southern fisheries region, that is up to 8 August, and the further extension of the season in this region for draft nets and snap nets to 13 August; (3) The fishing season for draft nets, snap nets and loop nets to continue for one week after the close of the drift net season in all areas except the east coast, and in the southern fisheries region.</P>
    <P>While from the point of view of the value of the catch salmon is our most valuable freshwater species, the importance <Col N="340" /> of our brown trout and coarse fisheries as an amenity and a tourist attraction should not be overlooked.  The Central Fisheries Board are at present preparing a development plan covering trout, coarse fish and sea angling as well as salmon which I hope will result in big improvements in these fisheries in the longer term.</P>
    <P>The Salmon Research Trust of Ireland which is funded jointly by my Department and Messrs.  Arthur Guinness, Son &amp; Co., Ltd., continues its research into the biology of the salmon and the factors bearing on its future survival as a species. A grant-in-aid of £56,600 is allocated to the trust for 1984.</P>
    <P>Contributions towards the expenses of running the Foyle Fisheries Commission are made jointly by my Department and the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland.  An amount of £130,000 is included in the Estimate to meet our share of the commission's estimated deficit in 1984.  Increased expenditure on wages and salaries is the main reason for the commission's increasing deficit.  I am satisfied however that the commission is making every effort to keep its annual deficit to a minimum level while continuing to fulfil its responsibilities under the Foyle Fisheries Acts to conserve and manage the fisheries of the Foyle area.  Licence duties payable for fishing licences in the Foyle area have been increased by the Commission for 1984 with a view to reducing its annual deficit.  I recommend this Estimate to the House.</P>
    <P>I am now going to deal with the main features of the Forestry Vote.  The nett provision for forestry activities for this year is £36.564 million and while at first sight this amount, representing a 1 per cent increase over last year's outturn, may appear low, Deputies will see that the overall demand on the Exchequer has been reduced quite substantially by receipts under subhead J &mdash; appropriations-in-aid &mdash; which are expected to increase by 10 per cent during the year.  As the bulk of the appropriations-in-aid is derived from sales of timber, the nett demand on the Exchequer should continue to fall in <Col N="341" /> future years as timber plantations established in the earlier decades reach maturity and yield increasing revenue, especially from the sale of commercial sawlog.</P>
    <P>I would like now to give the House more detail in relation to the contents of the Estimate.  I shall confine my remarks to the more important subheads, with comments on certain aspects which I feel require some further elaboration.</P>
    <P>Subhead A1.: Under this subhead provision is made for the salaries of all &ldquo;established&rdquo; staff in the Forest and Wildlife Service.  The subhead also includes a sum of £460,000 in respect of housing allowances payable to foresters. The number of staff provided for, about 1,065, comprises administrative, professional and technical staff including inspectors, engineers, surveyors, mapping and forester grades and represents a reduction of 32 as compared with last year.</P>
    <P>Subhead B. as a whole embraces a variety of elements but two aspects call for comment.  Firstly, under part (1) of the subhead, I would point out that the bulk of the expenditure on travelling is incurred domestically in connection with the day-to-day running of the widely-scattered forest estate.  While every effort is being made to effect economies in travelling expenses it must be realised that travelling is an unavoidable feature of forestry work.  The proportion of expenditure incurred on foreign travel is small and arises mainly from representation at EEC and other inter-governmental meetings abroad.  Secondly, the provision of £540,000 in subhead B.2. refers to the cost of postal, telephone and telegram services provided by the newly-established Post and Telecom Boards &mdash; services which were hitherto provided by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>Subhead C.1.  &mdash; Grant-in-Aid for acquisition of land: Under this heading a sum of £3.5 million is provided which, when added to a balance of about £1 million in the fund since last year, will make a total of £4.5 million available for the purchase of land for afforestation in 1984.  At the end of 1983 contracts between my Department and landowners for the purchase of land for forestry purposes stood at over 9,000 hectares and it <Col N="342" /> is estimated that some 6,000 hectares, about 15,000 acres, will come into the possession of the Forest and Wildlife Service in 1984.</P>
    <P>I would be less than honest if I said that I was satisfied with this level of land intake, especially when the existing plantable reserve is so low.  While the clearfelling of existing plantations is now making an increasing contribution to the pool of land for planting each year I will spare no effort to ensure that the maximum possible amount of funding for new land acquisition is provided in the years immediately ahead.</P>
    <P>Subhead C.2. for which a total of some £26.6 million is being provided, is the focal point of the Forestry Estimate and relates to the development and management of the entire State forest estate which now comprises a total area of almost 400,000 hectares, of which about 350,000 hectares have been planted to date.  The work involved embraces the extensive range of activities which inevitably arise in the management of a national forest estate.  These include the production of nursery stock, implementation of the planting programme, the provision of forest roads and buildings, maintenance and protection of plantations, the purchase, hire and maintenance of machinery and various aspects of timber harvesting and conversion. The development of forest amenities, which I will be referring to in more detail in a moment, is also provided for under this subhead.</P>
    <P>The pay element represents about 72 per cent of the funds in subhead C.2. and the overall increase in the subhead this year is attributable mainly to wage increases for forest workers.  It may not be generally realised that the Forest and Wildlife Service is one of the biggest employers in the country, with a labour force of about 2,500 men working in some 250 widely-dispersed forests which are located for the most part in areas where alternative employment prospects are scarce.</P>
    <P>In the current year the total area of new planting is expected to be 4,980 hectares and this will be augmented by the reforestation of some 1,680 hectares of <Col N="343" /> clearfelled land, that is, areas from which a final timber crop has already been taken.  I am particularly pleased to say that the area earmarked for the current year's planting programme includes some 300 acreas in various parts of the country which are being specially planted with ash to mark the GAA Centenary Year.</P>
    <P>With the increasing emphasis nowadays on timber harvesting I should like to refer to the FWS Machine Operator Training Centre which has recently been provided at Mountrath at a cost of £115,000.  As well as a training workshop, the centre includes office, canteen and leisure facilities.  Training programmes will commence there within the next few months and while, initially, the main concentration will be on training the Department's own machine operators in the use of specialised harvesting equipment, such as forwarders, skidders, skyline units, etc., it is hoped at a later stage to expand the facilities to include training for private sector harvesting personnel.</P>
    <P>In relation to amenity the funds required for the development of State forest amenities are also provided under subhead C.2.  The policy of encouraging greater amenity and recreational use of State forests is continuing.  The difficult financial climate in recent years has inevitably affected the provision of new facilities but I am glad to say that all existing areas are being managed to the traditional high standards.  We now have a total of 11 forest parks throughout the country, apart, of course, from a range of lesser amenity developments at more than 400 other forest centres.  The most recent of these forest parks was opened last week at Doneraile, County Cork. The beneficial effect of these amenities is amply manifested by continued public interest and it is gratifying to be able to say that more than 1.5 million visitors, many from abroad, now visit and enjoy the State forests annually.</P>
    <P>During the past year a new caravan and camping park was opened in Currachase Forest Park, County Limerick, on a site provided by my Department.  This development, undertaken by the MidWestern Regional Tourism Organisation <Col N="344" /> (Shannonside) with the assistance of Bord Fáilte, has significantly enhanced the attractive facilities already available in this particular forest park.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most spectacular amenity development in the current year is the provision of a holiday chalet complex within Killykeen Forest Park, County Cavan, on the shores of Lough Oughter. This innovative and exciting venture, initiated by my Department &mdash; and, incidentally, using native timber throughout &mdash; is being financed jointly by the Government and the EEC Regional Development Fund.  Contracts for the work, which is being undertaken by the Office of Public Works on behalf of my Department, have been finalised and construction is under way.  I am confident that this project, when completed, will make a major contribution to the tourism potential of the region.</P>
    <P>Subhead C.3. provides funds for the sawmills operated by my Department at Dundrum, County Tipperary, and Cong, County Mayo.  The level of financial provision this year, which is approximately similar to that for 1983, will permit continuation of the on-going programme of modernisation of equipment and machinery and the general improvement of facilities at both sawmills.</P>
    <P>I should add that the basic function of the sawmills is not to compete commercially with the private sawmilling sector but rather to provide the FWS with its own domestic requirements in a miscellany of sawn goods many of which are outside the normal range of items produced in the trade generally.  In addition, the mills are increasingly engaged in research work in the sawing, grading and drying of timber as part of the ongoing FWS Research Programme carried out both by its own staff and through the IIRS.</P>
    <P>The amount provided under subhead C4 &mdash; provision for Grant Assistance to Chipboard Products Limited &mdash; is intended merely as a token provision.  I am pleased to announce that negotiations on the restructuring of the chipboard plant at Scariff, involving my Department and the Industrial Development Authority, have been sucessfully completed. <Col N="345" /> A totally new private company, to be known as Finsa (Ireland) Limited, is being formed to acquire the assets of Chipboard Products Limited.  It is expected to commence production in August next.  By the end of 1984 Finsa plans to employ 110 people directly.  As many as 60-70 jobs will arise in the harvesting and haulage of timber and as the project develops as Scariff further job opportunities are expected to arise.  A long-term timber supply agreement between my Department and Finsa (Ireland) Limited has been concluded. This agreement, as well as assuring the new company of a proportion of its pulpwood requirements from State forests, will also facilitate the proper development of the forests.  The agreement provides for payment of a positive price for State forest thinnings in contrast to the former arrangements whereby CPL not only received free timber but also enjoyed a harvesting subsidy of £7 per cubic metre.  The arrangements are such as will afford a substantial outlet for sawmill residues and roundwood from private sources to meet the balance of the new company's requirements.</P>
    <P>While the provision for private forestry grants in subhead D shows a slight reduction on last year's provision, this should not be interpreted as any dimunition of commitment by the Forest and Wildlife Service to private planting.  Every encouragement will be given to applicants under the Department's planting grant schemes to undertake the afforestation of suitable lands and the FWS will continue to place its technical knowledge and expertise at the disposal of people interested in establishing forestry plantations on all or part of their lands.</P>
    <P>I may say, however, that I am particularly disappointed at the lack of response by farmers in the west to the very generous grants available under the EEC Western Package for the afforestation of land marginal for agriculture but suitable for forestry.  These grants amount to 85 per cent of the appoved costs of planting, subject to a maximum of £800 per hectare.  I would strongly urge farmers to give serious consideration to planting any part of their holdings which <Col N="346" /> is not capable of being used for agricultural purposes.  Independent studies have shown that on certain types of lands higher rates of return may be obtained from forestry than from alternative land uses.  Indeed EEC thinking also appears to be moving on these lines and a current draft EEC regulation strongly advocates engaging in forestry on land which is withdrawn from the production of agricultural commodities in over-supply.  I may say that I am currently exploring some new possibilities which I hope will lead to a substantial expansion of the national afforestation programme through closer co-operative arrangements between my Department and private landowners.</P>
    <P>I am, of course, only too well aware that there are historical, social and economic reasons for the relatively slow development of private forestry in Ireland in comparison with many other European countries.  With a view to identifying the reasons for the lack of expansion of our private forestry sector the Forest and Wildlife Service recently held a very successful workshop entitled &ldquo;Investment in Forestry &mdash; New Horizons&rdquo;. There was a full and frank discussion between the groups represented at the workshop of the factors inhibiting the expansion of the private forestry sector estate in Ireland.  The Forest and Wildlife Service also took the opportunity during the workshop to launch a new brochure entitled &ldquo;Investing in Forestry&rdquo; which provides basic information relating to forestry operations and should prove helpful to those contemplating an investment in forestry but having no specialised forestry knowledge.</P>
    <P>It is sometimes suggested that a special high-powered publicity drive should be undertaken to stimulate private forestry. While I would not rule out such a possibility, I believe that on-going promotion efforts will gradually produce better results.  My Department are involved in activities such as advertising, publication of leaflets and brochures, media articles, exhibits at shows, contacts with rural organisations and so on.  This campaign will be continued and intensified as much as possible and, in addition, greater <Col N="347" /> emphasis will be placed on consultation with those other State agencies who have regular contacts with landowners with a view to promoting the forestry option as a worth-while form of land use.</P>
    <P>Subhead E &mdash; Forestry Education &mdash; provides for the salaries, wages and allowances of inspectorate and domestic staff attached to Kinnitty Castle Training Centre and Avondale Extension School, as well as the general management expenses of both establishments.  It also includes allowances for trainee foresters at Kinnitty up to March 1984.</P>
    <P>The funds for maintenance and upkeep of the John F. Kennedy Park near New Ross, County Wexford, are provided under subhead F.  The Park was opened in 1968 and now comprises 623 acres laid out and landscaped to provide facilities for education and research as well as for leisure and recreation.  It includes an extensive arboretum, a forest garden and also a number of signposted scenic and arboreal walks, picnic sites, a visitor centre, car park and a combined cafe and shop.  A total of 25 persons are employed in the park.  To date 4,450 species and varieties have been planted and it is expected that this will increase to 6,000 ultimately.  An average of 100,000 visitors visit the park each year.</P>
    <P>The main provision in subhead G of the forestry vote relates to the remuneration of the wildlife ranger service which is very much involved in enforcing the hunting provisions of the Wildlife Act. For many years prior to 1983 subhead G also included a measure of assistance to regional game councils and others as a contribution to the cost of their game development schemes.  Last year it was not possible to make any such provision but for 1984 &mdash; despite the continuing difficult economic situation &mdash; I felt that some provision, however modest it might have to be, in aid of the game movement was warranted.  Accordingly, subhead G includes a sum of £10,000 which I trust will go some way towards defraying the organisational costs of game development. The Department will also continue to provide an advisory service for hunting <Col N="348" /> organisations and others concerned with the development of game resources.</P>
    <P>Funds for the wildlife conservation programme are provided for in subhead H, the provision for 1984 being £170,000. The Forest and Wildlife Service is making steady progress in this sphere despite the constraints imposed by the present economic situation.  Research into wildlife habitats and species is a major element of the wildlife programme.  The conservation of representative samples of sites of scientific importance is of particular concern, given the several competing land use demands.</P>
    <P>The Forest and Wildlife Service has identified a number of such sites, of different types of ecosystems, around the country, particularly peatland areas, which are recommended for conservation as nature reserves.  Most of them are privately owned and, having regard to the cost of either acquiring them or entering into management agreements with the owners, progress in affording them statutory protection will inevitably be slow.  However, I am examining the possibility of securing some allocation of funds that would permit the conservation of at least the most vulnerable habitats in a systematic way.  I am pleased to say that to date 19 nature reserves have been established and are being managed by my Department.  This number is likely to be increased during the year.</P>
    <P>Research on a number of what may be termed as &ldquo;problem species&rdquo;, such as seals and mink and studies on species such as the Greenland whitefronted goose for which we have international responsibility, will continue.</P>
    <P>Public demand for information on wildlife and conservation is extremely keen and my Department continue to update and expand their educational leaflets for distribution to the public, especially school children.</P>
    <P>On the international front, nature conservation has wide implications.  The FWS continues to participate in various international organisations at EEC, Council of Europe and other levels and every effort is being made to fulfil this country's obligations under the many directives, regulations and international <Col N="349" /> conventions which have emerged in recent years.</P>
    <P>The Wildlife Rangers corps, which, as I have already stated, contributes to the enforcement of the protective provisions of the Wildlife Act, 1976, also plays a significant role in fostering an enlightened approach to conservation by their efforts at local level.</P>
    <P>I would like, at this point, to pay a very special tribute to the work of the Wildlife Advisory Council.  I have now appointed the members of the council who will hold office for the next three years.  This is a voluntary group whose advice on a wide variety of wildlife conservation topics is of tremendous value to me and to my Department.</P>
    <P>The bulk of the funds in Subhead I are allocated to the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards for research on behalf of my Department.  A major forestry objective is to ensure that the State timber resources are utilised to the best possible national advantage and to encourage import-substitution.  This necessitates the continued utilisation of the expertise of the IIRS in the fields of timber technology and the promotion of native timber.  The rapidly increasing output from State forests in the years ahead makes it imperative to have a continuous programme of research into the strength and durability of Irish timber, the development of preservation and drying techniques and the study of trends in timber usage &mdash; including the potential of timber-framed houses.  This programme, funded by my Department, takes into account the forecast production of the large volume of wood, in different size-categories, which will come on stream during the 1980s and 1990s.</P>
    <P>I referred briefly at the outset to the appropriations-in-aid of the forestry vote which are shown in Subhead J and which indicate the income accruing to the Forest and Wildlife Service.  The substantial anticipated increase this year reflects the increasing buoyancy of the sawlog market and also the revenue from the sale of pulpwood through various outlets including the new medium density fibre-board plant at Clonmel.  While obviously timber sales are and always will be the main <Col N="350" /> source of income I may say that receipts from other sources &mdash; in particular some sporting rights lettings &mdash; have shown a welcome improvement in recent times.</P>
    <P>Before concluding there are one or two general matters on which I would like to comment.  While, as I have frequently stated, the public are always very welcome to avail themselves of the recreational and amenity facilities of the State forests, I would again stress the need for care in the prevention of fires.  A fire can destroy in a few hours, not merely a very valuable public amenity but, even more important, an investment in the form of a plantation which will have taken many years and considerable public funds to develop.  The Forest and Wildlife Service appreciates the co-operation given by the public down the years and which, thankfully, has kept fire damage to forests to a relatively low level.  However, I make no apology for stating once more that many forest fires result from sheer carelessness or lack of thought and I would appeal for continued vigilance by the public particularly during periods of dry weather.</P>
    <P>Apart from the fire and disease hazards which pose a threat to our forests, Deputies will no doubt be aware of an increasing concern which is being expressed in some continental countries, especially West Germany and Scandinavia, about the alleged damage to forests caused by acid rain.  Acid rain is produced when sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide, released into the air after the combustion of coal or oil, mix with moisture in the atmosphere and fall back to earth as dilute sulphuric or nitric acids.  While, in our situation, the lack of heavy industry and the prevailing westerly winds have reduced the likelihood of Irish forests being affected by acid rain, we cannot afford to be complacent and steps have been taken to monitor the rainfall and provide an early warning system should any deterioration occur.  Incidentally, this monitoring system is being extended to cover lakes, as there is some evidence that acid rain can also be damaging to fish life.</P>
    <P>I have now dealt at some length with the two Estimates involved in the Department <Col N="351" /> of Fisheries and Forestry.  If there are any other aspects which Deputies feel I should have mentioned and on which they require information I will only be too pleased to furnish it in my reply to the debate.  Meanwhile, I commend the estimates to the House and look forward to the comments from Deputies from all sides.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard for some time idealistic speeches from various people about the need to develop our natural resources and to create a situation, where from within our own resources, many of our unemployment and economic problems can be resolved. While we have heard all this before it is scarcely possible for the present Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, or indeed any Minister, to effectively operate in the two key Departments of which he has charge and work miracles, with a budget of less than 1 per cent of the total national expenditure.  Could we at this stage get the message across to all of those who have made these very dramatic speeches &mdash; and some of them are present Cabinet Ministers &mdash; that, unless they are prepared to match the percentage of national expenditure with what is needed to exploit our national resources, we cannot deal effectively with these two key areas or indeed with any of the other areas which concern our natural resources. Both Departments have done magnificent work within the limits of the financial constraints which are upon them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we did not have a debate on the Estimate since the retirement of the previous Secretary of the Department, Mr. Power, could I, on this occasion, on behalf of this side of the House, express my good wishes to Mr. Power on his retirement.  He has given dedicated service in the Department over the years and I would like to wish him a very happy retirement.  Could we equally welcome the new Secretary of the Department, Mr. Whooley, and assure him of our co-operation and advice in the future.  I know he is capably assisted by two very able assistant secretaries, Mr. Kerin and Mr. Callanan.  I have no doubt that he <Col N="352" /> will get good advice from them.  Could we take this opportunity to wish him every success in the Department.  We have had a very high level of competence and expertise in the Department over the years and we look forward to a continuation of that with his guidance and assistance.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately I have to take a different line in relation to the Minister, because I am tempted to quote here from the IFO news for the first quarter of 1984 which sums up in the first few sentences the Government's policy on fisheries.  It says: &ldquo;live horse and you will get grass&rdquo;. That appears to be the Government's policy for the fishing industry.  The IFO had some meetings with the Minister.  In one, held on 8 May, they were expressing extreme dissatisfaction.  The Minister, on almost all the subjects discussed, was vague, ambiguous and at times totally incomprehensible.  This is the IFO view which I do not totally share but it is an indication of the general view there is throughout the industry and the economy in the area of sea fisheries.</P>
    <P>With the completion of the Common Fisheries Policy, it is necessary that the Government should now come forward with a detailed comprehensive plan to deal with the developments that will take place in the industry immediately and over the next ten to 20 years, which is the term of the Common Fisheries Policy agreement.  We have been watching very carefully developments since the Common Fisheries Policy was concluded and there seems to be a lack of an overall strategy and coherent plan within the Department to deal with problems in the industry.  It is true to say that the policy which is being operated at present, both by the Department and by BIM, is largely a policy which was developed 20 years ago or thereabouts and which has been relatively successful in dealing with the difficulties experienced by the industry at that time.  It is equally true to say that circumstances have dramatically changed.  The whole industry is changing. The whole industry worldwide and within the EEC and here at home is changing. There is a need to look at that policy in the context of the overall Common Fisheries <Col N="353" /> Policy agreement and see where we can, within the terms of that agreement, put down our own policies, plans and national strategy in the various areas which need to be dealt with.  We want to see an overall approach being followed to deal with the industry in the future which involves people other than the Minister, the Department and BIM.  It involves people, in the catching sector and in the processing and marketing areas.  We can, with them and if necessary in consultation with the representatives of the fishermen, lay down a detailed policy to deal with some of the issues that are arising now and that will arise in the future as the Common Fisheries Policy begins to operate.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to isolate any one problem in the industry at present from the overall industry itself.  In my estimation many sectors within the industry are interdependent, and while you may resolve a difficulty in one area you create another one some place else.  Because of the fact that there are so many interrelated problems in the industry it is difficult to identify the areas that need urgent attention.</P>
    <P>Perhaps what comes to mind most is the claim, made on numerous occasions by the representatives of the fishermen and by many individual fishermen, that a sizeable proportion of those engaged in fishing activities are now in severe financial difficulties.  It has been stated that up to 80 per cent of the skippers and boat owners are in financial difficulties.  I do not accept that figure.  I think it is less than that; but, nevertheless, it is a cause for concern.  I think the Minister is rightly concerned about it.  We know from recent statements he made that there is a problem there which needs to be dealt with very quickly unless all confidence in the industry is to be undermined.  We must avoid that.  The problem seems to be that some people, for one reason or another, do not seem to be able to be viable now or do not appear to have any prospect of being viable in the future.  If that is the situation then let us identify those people, and let us see whether the problem can be resolved or not.  If it cannot be resolved and if there is no place for them within the industry, then some <Col N="354" /> other place must be found for them within the overall fishing activity here that will ensure that they remain within the industry.</P>
    <P>I do not think we can afford to lose anybody from it.  We have suggested previously that there are ways of dealing with that.  There is a possibility of arriving at a situation through the organisation of BIM and the Department whereby people who, for whatever reason, are not viable in their operations are directed into other areas where work needs to be done, such as research into new techniques, species or fisheries.  They can through the assistance of BIM, be directed in such a way that they will have a part to play in the industry.  They can help to identify new fisheries, species, new fishing grounds and new methods of fishing.  They could also get involved in research into trying out new cost-saving techniques.</P>
    <P>All these matters can have a very important bearing on the remainder of the fleet.  I do not share the view expressed by many people that the situation now in the industry is that you have too many fishermen chasing too few fish. I do not accept the view that if you take out some of the fishermen and share out whatever fish they are catching with the others, that would necessarily solve the other peoples' problems.  I do not think that is the case at the present time.  I feel that for many of these people there is a very valid reason why this situation has come about.  They have a valuable contribution to make within the industry as a whole, if this can be recognised and identified and if the necessary funding can be arranged through the State and BIM or, indeed, through some fishermen's fund of their own, which I think is essential at this time.  It has been mentioned in other contexts that there may be need for a fisherman's bank which will be self-financed by fishermen themselves, perhaps with some investment by the State or investment by other people involved in the industry.  This idea has been looked at in other countries when similar crisis situations arose there.  Perhaps there is a need for that type of arrangement here now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="355" /> In addition, some new initiatives might well be tried out which would not only ensure that you would have capital available for further investment in every sector of the industry but that you would have a financial &ldquo;kitty&rdquo; which would tide people over the very difficult patches.  We all know that one of the difficulties in the industry is the seasonality of it and the fact that at times people do pretty well and at other times have lean periods.  In order to balance that out across the board, perhaps over a one-year, two-year or a five-year period, it would be necessary to have some type of fund of that kind that would ensure that there was continuity in the fisherman's income at a time when he meets difficulties.</P>
    <P>The discontinuation of welfare payments to fishermen has been raised from time to time.  We have seen how successful the enterprise allowance scheme has been in the creation of job opportunities, because under it a man's unemployment payments are continued while at the same time he is endeavouring to start a new enterprise.  We have had a very successful story there.  We have seen many new jobs created and many industries survive. Many new industries have been started up under that scheme which has been just newly organised.  If we could have some type of similar scheme in relation to the fishing industry to enable people get over the very difficult periods, it would be very useful.  It would apply also in a situation, which we have had on many occasions here, in which many fishermen were forced because of bad weather conditions to abandon their efforts.  You would then have some overall fund which would compensate people for loss of earnings whenever they were unable to continue fishing activities.</P>
    <P>These are all ideas that can be passed around within the Department.  You can look at what has been done in other places.  For instance the Task Force on Canadian fisheries identified a whole range of options of this nature which could be undertaken.  They, like ourselves, had similar problems in the coastal communities of Canada, where an enormous number of people are <Col N="356" /> dependent on the fishing industry.  We can learn from the experiences in other places lessons we can apply to our situation here.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the need to embark on research into new species and to exploit new species.  In relation to the stock situation at present no one can be totally satisfied.  People in the business have experienced stock problems with the traditional species which have been fished here.  Conservation measures will have to play a key role in any national policy developed in the future.  At the same time, there seems to be a variety of species which are relatively unexploited. Opportunities exist in the non-traditional areas which have not been exploited to date.  We need as a matter of urgency research facilities to identify these areas and species.  We need research vessels. The <i>Lough Cultra</i> is doing some magnificent work under the guidance of the National Board of Science and Technology. I would like to compliment them. We have an economic zone with huge potential relatively unexploited in fisheries and many other areas also and while the <i>Lough Cultra</i> is doing some magnificent work it is not a research vessel as such.  We need a modern, sophisticated fisheries research vessel with the full back-up services such a vessel requires. This can provide opportunities not only for fishermen but in many other areas also.</P>
    <P>In the last couple of years the situation has been that hundreds of foreign research vessels from all over the world, Polish vessels, Bulgarian vessels, East European and American vessels have been operating within our economic zone.  I know there is an arrangement whereby information can be obtained from them in particular areas but we need to give a lead in this regard; we need our own research vessel and our own expertise. Of course we can learn from the experience of others operating in our waters but we need our own research facilities.  The sooner we have them the better.  Even though people may say that there are economic constraints which make it impossible at present, all of us <Col N="357" /> know that unless one is prepared to make major investments of this kind, unless there is the will and the commitment to do this we cannot complain if we are failing to exploit the opportunities that are there.  If you point out the usefulness, benefit and importance from a national point of view of such a facility, and can clearly demonstrate how important it is to have that type of research vessel available, most people would readily agree that the funds should be provided for it.</P>
    <P>We all know that fishing is a highly skilled and technical area now.  It is no longer a case of going out and throwing a net down for a couple of hours and hauling it in and then selling your catch. It is a completely different ball game now.  As Minister I went on a fishing trip with a fisherman from the south-west coast and it was, indeed, an education and an experience.  I do not know whether the Minister has been on a fishing trawler since he took up office but I would thoroughly recommend it, especially in the summer.  Despite the feelings of the IFO at present I am sure they would not throw the Minister over board and it would be a worthwhile exercise &mdash; as important as the Minister's visit to Japan.  It would be a worthwhile exercise to see how fishing activity operates at present.  It is certainly an exercise which would give an indication of the type of training and expertise that is needed. Fishing would provide job opportunities in a native industry.  With proper training and expertise young people can play a very important and useful role in that industry.  They will also have very useful and gainful employment at home in their own regions.</P>
    <P>In both the regional context and in the employment context development of fishing activities along the regional areas and extreme coastal communities would secure job opportunities there for young people.  The Minister, coming from a western constituency, like myself, fully appreciates the need to do this.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need now to invest heavily in the training of young fishermen. This is an area in which the Youth Employment Agency must become more involved.  Perhaps it is not the function of <Col N="358" /> the Department of Fisheries and Forestry or, indeed, of BIM, to become involved in this kind of activity.  The training and educational facilities which exist must be utilised and directed to a greater extent into that area.  Bodies like AnCO, the Youth Employment Agency, National Manpower, the vocational schools and the educational system generally with assistance and guidance from BIM can get involved in a far more constructive and positive way than has been the case up to now.  They can demonstrate clearly to the people involved what needs to be done, what must be done and what can be done and where useful employment can be found in that area with proper training, skill, incentive and guidance in the future.  This is an area that needs to be looked at very carefully and it cannot be done under the present financial constraints in the Department of Fisheries and Forestry.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the Minister's trip to Japan, which I welcome.  It is important that we exploit fully the market opportunities for fish abroad.  At the same time it is depressing to find that the Minister has to embark on these initiatives &mdash; I had to do the same in Egypt and other places &mdash; to seek markets for Irish fish abroad.  It is depressing to read the report of the monitoring committee on food imports which was recently issued by the Department of Agriculture.  They have a section dealing with fish imports.  Imports under the heading of fish preparations generally, such as fish fingers and other products, amounted to £25.5 million in 1982.  They include relatively low grade canned Pacific pink salmon.  I suppose there is a market for that here but I do not know whether we can supply that ourselves.</P>
    <P>The Minister must surely explain to the House why herring and mackerel imports were valued at £5.2 million in 1982.  Perhaps some of these were Irish fish which came across the Border.  I am not sure about that.  Some of these figures relating to imports are alarming.  The Minister is embarking on campaigns in Japan, Sierra Leone and recently in Paris to seek markets for Irish fish.  We are importing enormous quantities of fish.  There must be <Col N="359" /> scope for import substitution.  There must be scope in the area of white fish because we imported £12 million of white fish in 1982 of which £8 million was spent on fish fingers which are usually manufactured by the multi-national companies like Findus and Birds Eye, who have big markets. There must be scope for us in joint ventures with multi-national corporations so that we can utilise our fish products to gain useful jobs, very valuable revenue for the State and above all security for our industry at a time when industry is not secure.  This can be achieved by import substitution, exploiting our own home markets, utilising our own products and more secondary processing. It is important that we look at this whole area.  We need the foreign markets. Our aim should first of all be to satisfy as far as possible our own market demands with our fish products.  If investment is needed to achieve this then let us make the investment.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that there is a need to refurbish some of the boats.  If we are to satisfy the white fish market we would need larger boats.  These are all policy issues on which we would like a clear direction from the Department.  There is no clear-cut policy to deal with a situation where some people at the present time need further fishing capacity and others are going out of business.  Is it a fact that we do not have sufficiently large boats to exploit the deeper sea areas? Is it that we have not sufficient investment in the larger boats? Can we at this stage refurbish, remodel and rebuild some of the smaller boats in order to make them more effective? There is great need for the Department and BIM to look very carefully at the question of modernising and refurbishing the fleet with a view to both future and the present needs.</P>
    <P>We must be very cautious about marine pollution.  I will refer to pollution in more detail when dealing with inland fisheries.  We recently passed a motion approving the terms of the Convention on the Prevention of Pollution from Land Sources.  On that occasion I expressed the view, especially in the area of the Irish Sea that the problem in Windscale <Col N="360" /> has become so complicated, possibly so enormous, that there is only one solution and that is to close it down.  While that may seem alarmist and unrealistic, we must recognise that when the British government felt there was a danger of pollution they closed down the beaches. It would be far easier to close down the source of pollution.  There is evidence to show that there is no danger to fish in the Irish Sea at present; nevertheless we cannot be complacent about this.  We must utilise our fisheries Department and defence and our naval services in the fight against marine pollution in the Irish Sea or any place else.  I would urge the Minister very strongly to take control of the whole marine pollution question.  We have far too many Departments and bureaucracies involved in this matter.  The Departments of Communications, Environment, Health and Fisheries are all involved in this area.  There is bound to be confusion.  There is a need at this stage to give responsibility for the whole marine pollution control to one Minister and he should have close contact with his counterpart in the UK.</P>
    <P>Even though the evidence indicates that there is no danger to fish in the Irish Sea, at the same time we must be very cautious about this.  I do not think we can allow the situation to continue much longer where the uncertainty about Windscale is causing uncertainty in our markets.  People are not buying fish because of this.  It needs to be monitored very carefully.  The responsibility should be with the Minister.  If he had that responsibility and if he could utilise the fishery protection services as he does the Naval Service, a more determined effort could be made to stamp out the risks that might arise from any marine pollution.</P>
    <P>We recently had some controversy about the situation in Castletownbere. Perhaps the Minister would indicate what the situation is now in relation to the Eiranova plant in Castletownbere.  There are reports that it is closing down.  There has been some concern about the plant for some time.  It is important for the fishermen that job opportunities would be created in places like Castletownbere. It is possible within the present legislation <Col N="361" /> to find a solution whereby the jobs can be saved at the plant there.  I would urge the Minister to look very carefully at the situation and not rush into any decisions which could unnecessarily close down the plant and to give us some indication of the situation.  It is important that people other than those engaged directly in fishing activities be considered.  The fish processing plant in Castletownbere is, for many fishermen and their families, their only source of income.  This situation should be analysed very carefully to see in what way, if any, the closure can be avoided.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the need for vigilance in relation to the stock situation and the need to conserve our stocks.  We all know that the situation regarding many species of fish is unpredictable. Prices can be drastically reduced without very much notice and this creates a certain amount of chaos for fishermen, processors and marketers.  We should educate people to realise that where you over-fish or damage the stocks you are damaging the prospect of renewal of the resource and damaging your long-term survival in the business.  There could be a far greater awareness by people in the industry of the importance of conservation.  People in the industry must be educated as to the importance of fish conservation and the need for greater investment in the area which would give us a better awareness of what the true stock situation is.  The unpredictable situation has led to many problems in fishing activities over the past number of years.  We saw it in the Celtic Sea in relation to herring and it is not too clear now what the stock situation is in relation to herring.  People say it is not as bad as it would appear but it seems to be getting worse.  We are unsure of what the stock situation is in relation to mackerel. It is vitally important, especially now, because of our dependence on mackerel fishing that we would know accurately and precisely what the mackerel stock situation is.  If there are any fears about the future of the mackerel stock position we should know in advance so that steps could be taken to deal with that.  We must exercise more pressure in seeing that the Community and the members of the <Col N="362" /> Community abide by the regulations and obey the laws.  There have been complaints from time to time that while we are strictly enforcing our own conservation measures here other members of the Community are not abiding equally by their regulations.  We would need to look at that and see if it can be resolved if there is a problem.</P>
    <P>Many fishermen are concerned about the accession of the Spanish fishermen into the EEC.  The organisation which represents the fishermen has already complained at the way the negotiations have been handled.  They feel, rightly or wrongly, that there is not that willingness on the part of the Minister for Fisheries and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to deal effectively with this issue.  They are concerned also because of the fact that during Ireland's Presidency the terms for conclusion of the Spanish entry to the Community are likely to be finalised and there is a genuine fear to see if Spanish accession will mean an invasion of Spanish boats into Irish waters.  I have noticed that up to now the negotiations seem to be reasonably satisfactory; certainly, in relation to Portugal they seem to be reasonably satisfactory.  But there must be a very firm decision taken by the Government, and especially by the Minister, to oppose any Spanish entry into Irish fishing areas.</P>
    <P>There have been controls and limitations on the Spanish activity up to now but we have seen time and again breaches of the legislation by Spanish fishermen. We have seen time after time Spanish boats being taken in and charged in Castletownbere, Rossaveel, and other areas along the coastline for breaches of the existing regulations, which are reasonably satisfactory.  In the event of Spanish entry into the Community, I can see major problems arising with any watering down of that arrangement and especially on the south-west coast if there is any weakening of our position.  I would like to express to the Minister our concern to see that he would take a firm line in relation to the negotiations on the Spanish entry with regard to the fishing industry and ensure that whatever final arrangement is concluded there will be <Col N="363" /> no watering down of our position.  There should be a very strong line taken in response to any attempt by the Spanish government to seek fishing rights within the Irish fishing zone.</P>
    <P>One area which has been the subject of much discussion in the last number of days has been the area of maricultural fish farming developments.  I would like to compliment the Department on the enlightened approach which they have adopted up to now in relation to this. Later in the year inquiries are being held to identify the areas where licences will be granted for the maricultural operations. That is a very timely and important step.  We all know about the valuable work that has been done already in relation to the development of our maricultural fish farming activities.  We recognise that there is a huge potential here which can be exploited only with very careful management and development.</P>
    <P>We must be cautious of pollution and cautious of people's rights.  We must also be cautious to ensure that any development which takes place is evenly spread out between the various people involved and who are interested to become involved.  We can direct investment in order to create job opportunities in many of the isolated areas through an enlightened and dynamic maricultural development programme.  We feel that any investment there would be a worthwhile one.  A lot of research has been done; a lot of the scientific examination and whatever is necessary to develop the fisheries has been undertaken.  What now needs to be done is to identify clearly where it is to be done, who is going to do it to get it under way.  I know that some useful developments have already taken place and I would encourage the Minister to press ahead with the developments in these areas which will have very beneficial effects on the prospect of creating job opportunities and a very useful service in bringing new ideas and new technology into areas which will satisfy the demands that are there for fish and fish products and create the environment where we can have more fish farming than we have had up to now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="364" /> Before I leave the sea fisheries area there are one or two things I want to mention.  One is in relation to the need to invest in the development of our harbours. In many cases the harbours are in a deplorable state.  In my own constituency we had the collapse of Doolin Pier. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Clare County Council and the county engineer, Mr. Gleeson, and the members of the county council and the Department of Fisheries for the magnificent job they have done at Doolin and which was completed recently.  Tragically there was a loss of life before this happened. An excellent job has been done at Doolin and at very little expense.</P>
    <P>The experience at Doolin would give a very clear indication to the Minister of what can be done with a small investment which is well managed and with the involvement of people other than the Department of Fisheries and the Board of Works.  I made the point on a previous debate of the importance of a harbour or pier in an isolated area from the point of view of aspects other than fisheries aspect.  One such aspect is tourism but there are other interests who have a contribution to make in the development of harbours.  The development of harbours should not be totally left to the Department of Fisheries.  Other interested parties should invest in the development of our harbour infrastructure especially the small harbours.  Doolin is an excellent example of what can be done with an enlightened county engineer and an enlightened council such as we have in County Clare, deciding to do a job in a very short time and very efficiently.  It shows what can be done in many of these areas.</P>
    <P>There is a need in many of the smaller areas to deal with harbour developments. Deputy Faulkner and I, along with the leader of our party, Deputy Haughey, met a deputation from Clogherhead and they are rightly concerned about the pier there.  Examinations and studies have been going on for years, but the pier is deteriorating further day by day.  Eventually, we will have a situation where we will have the total collapse of the pier, which will cost an enormous amount to <Col N="365" /> have replaced; but the money will have to be found then.  I would ask the Minister to look again at the subhead in relation to investment in harbours, and especially smaller harbours, to see if it would be possible to get some assistance through the FEOGA Fund or the Regional Fund to supplement the moneys he has for undertaking harbour development work in order to make these places safe and adequate for the needs of the fishing industry.  Like Doolin, Clogherhead can be of very beneficial advantage to many other sections of the community there. Louth County Council have taken a lead and have done research and employed consultants.  At this stage what needs to be done is to identify very clearly the requirements and to get the project under way as soon as possible before the Clogherhead pier collapses.  The amount of damage that would be done to industry there would be almost unbelievable.</P>
    <P>Clogherhead brings home to me also the further menace of submarines at sea. We have seen what happened in the Clogherhead area with the sinking of the <i>Sharelga</i> in April 1982 and the <i>Oriel</i> in 1984 and others like the French boat which was sunk in 1983.  Can we get some indication from the Minister and from the Minister for Foreign Affairs as to how they propose to deal with that issue and would they not at this stage take a very firm stand?  There is some backing there from the United Nations Law of the Sea Convention which can give some authority to introduce legislation here, at least to control the operations of these submarines within our territorial waters. While accidents have in some cases been outside territorial waters, nevertheless there have been complaints from time to time of unidentified submarine activities within our territorial areas and we can through the Law of the Sea Convention control that activity.  At least we should do that much and see what we can do by way of our involvement in the United Nations or the Common Market to finding some other way of dealing with the position.</P>
    <P>I might also mention in relation to the sinking of the <i>Sharelga</i> that, to the best of my knowledge, Mr. McEvoy, the skipper <Col N="366" /> of the boat, has not yet been compensated by the British authorities even though the British Ministry of Defence admitted liability and responsibility and said that they would pay compensation. On the information I have got from the Deputies from that area, and Deputy Faulkner in particular, he has not yet been paid.  He has suffered severe loss of earnings since his boat was sunk due to the loss of his boat and the loss of his gear.  At this stage it should be possible to get the British authorities to compensate him.  If not the Minister here should do it and try to make some arrangements with the British authorities.</P>
    <P>The whole area of marine infrastructure, communications and development is very essential for the proper development of our sea fisheries.  The final word I would say on that is to try and impress upon the Minister the need to co-ordinate the activities of different Departments. For instance, would it be possible for the Minister to use his influence to improve telecommunications, because they are important for the whole community and the fishing ports?  It is important to have boat facilities; it is important to have water facilities; it is important to have facilities for refrigeration.  All these things are vitally important for a thriving industry and there must be investment in them if we are going to see the industry thrive.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to compliment BIM on their activities in dealing with the industry.  I have found them in my experience to be understanding and to have a very great knowledge of the problems in the industry.  What they seem to be lacking is the overall policy direction. Here could I express regret at the departure of Vivion Murray who was chairman of the board.  He demonstrated a very mature and realistic and confident approach to the development of our sea fisheries during his term of office.  I would like to see that position in BIM filled.  I have a suspicion that one of the reasons it has not been filled is that the Minister has been awaiting the outcome of the election in the Connacht-Ulster Euro constituency. I sincerely hope that is not the case as there are many people of expertise and <Col N="367" /> ability to fill these positions.  I sincerely hope that the Minister will fill that vacancy soon and that he will realise how important it is that a man of the stature, ability and competence of Vivion Murray be appointed to that position.</P>
    <P>I would like to speak now about inland fisheries and the need to invest both in manpower and in resources.  The people on the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards, which were restructured, must be the most disillusioned people in the business. They have been short of staff and short of money and they have been unable to make any worthwhile plans for the development of the whole inland fishery structure.  In the regional boards they have had the same problems &mdash; shortage of money and shortage of staff, hopelessly equipped to deal with the hazards of poachers and pollution and the countless other problems they have.  They have had difficulties in their relations with their employees which I hope are resolved now and will not recur.</P>
    <P>One thing we do not need at this time is a strike of fishery protection people at the height of the inland fishing season. When the pressure is on from pollution and from poachers and the whole industry is in a very precarious position, the one thing we do not want is a strike and every effort must be made to avoid that. There are still grievances arising from the last dispute.  Let the people who have responsibility to resolve those resolve them.  If it is a question that they are not satisfied with the outcome of their recent discussions and deliberations then surely the way for them to approach it is to talk to the Labour Court.  They should go back and find a solution rather than put the whole valuable inland fisheries in jeopardy by taking strike action at this time.  I would appeal to them not to go ahead with a strike.  A strike can only do further damage to an already damaged industry.</P>
    <P>The Estimate clearly shows there is little prospect of dealing with the difficult areas they have to deal with.  We have heard from time to time that salmon stocks are in danger and are likely to be wiped out.  I do not subscribe to that <Col N="368" /> view.  I think salmon stocks are in jeopardy the same as many other stocks are. With proper management, control and proper development policies the stocks can be preserved and expanded.  There are indications, if one can judge by the catches that have taken place, although I would not always go by that, that there is a very urgent necessity for the Minister for Fisheries to give the fullest backing to the Central Fisheries Board and especially now to the regional and fisheries boards to press ahead with the development policy for inland fisheries so that we can see clearly what their targets are, how they are going to go about that and so that we will not see developments being held up in certain regions because of the absence of a central overall policy to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>I would encourage the Minister for Fisheries to make the necessary finances available.  He certainly has not made provisions in this Estimate for the work that has to be done at this time.  We all know that the central board and the regional board were caught up in the staff embargo.  We know they were left hopelessly short of staff.  I feel at this stage a case can be made to seek some deviation from the ongoing embargo to enable them to take on the people they need so badly.  I would urge the Minister to seek immediately some derogation in that embargo on recruitment for the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards so that they can endeavour to hire people and pay them to do the job that needs to be done at this time.  It is useless talking about controls in fishing activity, controlling nets or whatever, unless you can give the manpower and resources to the boards to do what they know needs to be done.  Otherwise you are putting the industry at risk.  It is essential that we should do this at this time.</P>
    <P>I would like as well to say how I regret the untimely death of the late Christy Deasy who was chairman of the Central Fisheries Board.  He was a man who gave a life-long service to the development of inland fisheries.  He was the man who impressed upon me, when I took office, the need to go down and buy a particular fishery in the west.  He said, &ldquo;You will <Col N="369" /> find the money some place for it whether it is by way of the fisheries Vote or the forestry Vote or a combination of the two.  You cannot allow a fishery like that to pass into foreign ownership or out of the control of the Irish Government.&rdquo; It was mainly through his work and his involvement that fisheries like that were acquired by the State.  It has been a magnificent achievement and will prove to be one of the wisest decisions that has been made in inland fisheries in recent times. We need to do more of that.  We regret the death of Christy Deasy and I hope his position as chairman of the central board will be filled as soon as possible.  We need people in these positions if they are going to give any direction to the whole fisheries programme.  It is important and essential that these key vacancies be filled at the earliest possible opportunity with men of the expertise and the ability and the knowledge of the late Christy Deasy who can chart the future course of inland fisheries for us.</P>
    <P>We have been totally devastated in recent days by reports of fish kills all over the place.  There is scarcely a day you pick up the paper that you do not read of a fish kill in Ireland north, south, east and west of the country.  It is most depressing.  As Minister I was harassed with the same complaint.  There was scarcely a day during the summer months while I was Minister that we did not either have it in the <i>Evening Press</i> or the <i>Evening Hearld</i> or the daily papers a report of pig slurry flowing down a river or other damage being done to a fishery.  They have been built up at enormous cost in labour and resources by local people in their own areas.  They invested money out of their own pockets in stock and development programmes and even, in some cases, hired their own private people to protect the fisheries for them. It is terrible to find that they were wiped out overnight through carelessness, neglect or ignorance or a combination of all three.  I do not think we can afford that kind of situation in this country at this time.</P>
    <P>I was appalled recently to see a report of a mountain of pig slurry moving down a fishery in County Limerick and devastating <Col N="370" /> the river from one end to the next. This must be avoided.  We have to get co-operation between the local authorities, the farming organisations, the cooperatives and all who are involved.  We must give the direction back to the Minister for Fisheries to control the situation.</P>
    <P>While I have the greatest regard for the local authorities and the greatest regard for the work and dedication of the people in those areas, I feel that it was a mistake to hand over the control of water pollution to the county councils and the local authorities.  The control should have been left with the regional fisheries boards who had been dealing with it since they were established, who knew exactly how to deal with it effectively and quickly.  There is a need at this time, if we cannot change the regulations, to bring the fisheries boards and the local authorities together so that we can avoid these situations.  This is a disgraceful situation and I do not think we can allow it to continue any longer.  Every effort must be made to ensure that this type of wanton destruction is prevented and no effort should be spared by the Minister and the Department.  I would urge him immediately to call in the regional fisheries boards managers and ask them to go out now and undertake a campaign in each of their areas to see where the danger spots are and to take action immediately to see that the effects of those are avoided.</P>
    <P>I have ranged over a number of areas. I would put them all in a nutshell by saying that what we would like to see is a comprehensive policy to deal with the future of the industry, to set out clearly for everyone to know, in consultation with the people involved what the policies are in relation to the development of our industry for the next 20 years to tie in with the Common Fisheries Policy agreement, to embark on a comprehensive training scheme for young fishermen to get them involved in new technologies and new techniques and new areas and new methods of fishing, to do a crash programme of development in the harbours, to repair and reconstruct them and if necessary to seek aid from the Regional Fund and FEOGA funds to <Col N="371" /> do that.  We should provide our own research vessel now and increase investment in research and development here which will have support, I am sure, from the National Board of Science and Technology, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and many other agencies also, and go out and identify the new species and the new fishing areas so that we can have other species and other fishing grounds to back up our present traditional fisheries.  We should develop the aquacultural and maricultural fish farming areas where I would see prospects of 4,000 to 5,000 jobs in the next two to three years if this is done properly and supervised and established effectively. There is a need within the Department for a new aquaculture unit which would deal specifically with the aquacultural section and embodied in that aquacultural unit there should be a grant scheme to cover projects like this and to cover loans especially, because people engaging in these kind of activities will find there is a fairly sizeable investment which can be funded from the EEC but they will need to get loan facilities.  There is a need for the Department to come in there with a loan scheme which will help in undertaking those projects.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we develop secondary processing if we are to create the job opportunities and make the whole industry sound.  We need to create something like 2,000 jobs there and this can be done if we do the secondary processing and not export our fish in the primary stage.  For one job at the primary stage you can have seven to ten jobs at the secondary stage. One has only to measure that against our fisheries to see the number of jobs that can be created.  We need a dynamic chairman for the Central Fisheries Board and for BIM.  If those areas are dealt with we will be going some way towards dealing with some of the problems we have in the fishing industry at present.</P>
    <P>I would like to speak for a few minutes about the other section of the Minister's speech today dealing with the timber industry.  Timber production is a labour intensive industry and a more vigorous policy here would certainly play a very <Col N="372" /> major part in reducing our present critical employment situation.  Development of our timber industry is very important because of its very nature.  The wood industry, like fishing, is situated in isolated areas, close to the rural communities where job opportunities can be provided in scattered locations right across the countryside.  It has a very important bearing on our whole regional development so it is essential that we look clearly at our timber policy.  It would have an ongoing effect on a whole range of other related industries, from furniture to papermaking.  In 1979 we imported in the region of £300 million worth of wood and wood products.  Eighty-six per cent of this could have been produced at home. Because of our climate we can produce timber at a faster rate that any other country in the European Community.  It has been estimated that the growth rate here is even higher than the forecasts which were originally made.  It is also estimated that a pound's worth of timber in the forest in value added can be worth up to £20 from a chipboard plant and up to probably £30 or £35 from a paper mill. The rate of return from the processing of our timber both in the pulp processing and in the further stages of processing is enormous.  We have not exploited that. We have not even scratched the surface.</P>
    <P>It is indicated that the UK will be importing 75 per cent of their domestic needs well into the next century.  We should not ignore that market.  The consumption of wood and wood products in the EEC is expected to rise, probably double, in the next five to ten years.  Here we have the EEC with enormous demands for wood and likely to have enormous demands over the next number of years.  We have the timber here.  What we need to do now is to exploit that timber resource which has been built up to its present state through investment over 40 to 50 years.</P>
    <P>A sum of £400 million to £500 million has been spent by the taxpayer to develop the forest industry to the stage at which it is.  It is, at this stage, important that we would continue the investment which has been made.  It would be a mistake for people to think that because we have <Col N="373" /> invested so heavily up to now and because we have reached a certain stage that we can pull back now and not invest further in the processing and exploitation of the investments which we have made. It is essential that we have the courage now to continue the cycle and continue to invest so that we can exploit the benefits of the investment we have made and that we can, through the development of our timber, provide jobs here at home for ourselves and save ourselves the enormous bills we have been paying out to import timber which we can successfully grow here at home.  It does not make sense and it is important that we would recognise this as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed at the decision last June not to continue the investment which the Government made in Scariff. It was a mistake.  There is no need to go into it in detail now.  We went through it all before.  The decision to withdraw the Government investment in Scarriff was a major mistake on the part of the Government.  We have now allowed a situation to arise where a foreign company, welcome and all as the company is, has been allowed to come in and take up where the Government were not prepared to make an investment themselves. It does not sound right to me that at a time when there are economic problems all over the European Community and where communities everywhere are having difficulty that a foreign company can come in here and recognise that there is potential in the development in Scarriff for a chipboard mill and where our own native Government did not have the courage or the wisdom to invest in it themselves.  The Scarriff project is welcome. I am disappointed that the work-force there is about a third of what was there in the previous company.  It is disappointing also that some Irish companies claim they did not get an adequate opportunity to invest in the project themselves. They claim they would have been prepared to come in themselves had they known that it was possible to make a satisfactory arrangement.  It is a cause of concern to people that native companies who appear to have the capital, who appear to have the expertise and the will <Col N="374" /> to get involved in the company for some reason did not get an opportunity, or at least they claim they did not get the opportunity, to get involved in the restructured operation at Scarriff.  It can be debated later on when we get clearer information as to what did actually happen. Certainly the new plant in Scarriff will be welcome there and it will be supported by the people of Scarriff.  We will give it every support.  It certainly would be much easier to support our own Irish companies had they been involved in restructuring that company and reinvesting in that company and reopening that operation and getting much needed jobs back into that area.</P>
    <P>In the whole timber area there is a need now for a new Government policy. I have said this in relation to fisheries.  It is equally true in in the case of forestry development.  There has been widespread criticism of the timber marketing arrangements in the Department, not that people are critical of the Department, they are critical of the mechanisms and the procedures with which the Department are tied down.  These are established procedures involving every Government Department involved in a similar situation.  People feel now, at this stage of development of our forestry, that there is a need for a more dynamic approach within the whole marketing area and that there is a need for new structures to deal with that.  There is a need for a new agency, a new type of commercial orientated mechanism which will exploit fully the commercial possibilities of our forests.</P>
    <P>We have already said there is a need to establish a review body which would identify the best method of organising the timber marketing organisation in the area.  Other people would claim there is a need for a new commercial semi-State operation, something like An Post or Telecom Éireann, to handle our timber marketing areas.  This is something the Minister will have to make a decision on pretty soon because one thing that is quite clear is that regardless of the difference of opinion that may exist as to what is the best possible procedure or solution for dealing with the issue now or in the <Col N="375" /> future, there is a general acceptance throughout the industry, and perhaps by the Minister as well who recognised this by setting up an inter-departmental committee to look at the system, that the system we have at present is not adequate. There is a need to do something and to do it soon.  I would urge the Minister to get about that fairly soon.  That should be central to any fisheries development policy we would see emerging over the next number of years.</P>
    <P>I think the present situation where the State planting programme is in decline and has not reached the stated objectives must be remedied whether you remedy that by way of getting more joint ventures &mdash; more farmers and people to go in with you where they will jointly lease with the Department and make some kind of joint arrangement to get more plantable land available &mdash; or otherwise.  There is a crisis in relation to the land bank which is at the disposal of the Department.  Measures have to be identified and taken fairly quickly in order to deal with that situation. The position cannot be allowed to continue where the land bank is declining and where the targets which have been set down and which had been broadly maintained over the last number of years are not being maintained now.  We must look at this very carefully.</P>
    <P>All of us share the Minister's disappointment that the western package is not being maintained.  It is hard to direct people away from what they have been traditionally doing in fisheries or in agriculture or in any other sector.  In less favoured areas there are sizeable amounts of marginal land not suitable for agricultural purposes and never will be suitable but which are suitable for planting. These plantable land reserves must be utilised and arrangements must be made which will ensure that they are utilised in the future.  This can be done if the Department can embark upon a scheme of joint ventures with farmers who have plantable divisions of land and ensure that during the early stages, when a farmer might not see a worthwhile return, that some return would be given in the short-term until such time as the <Col N="376" /> forestry itself begins to make returns from the investment.</P>
    <P>In many cases the Department should make the investment and carry out a leasing arrangement which would not involve the farmer in any major investment in the early stages.  One of the failures of the western package has been that farmers tend to look on their return from their working endeavour on a year-to-year basis whether it be from oats, potatoes or milk.  They do not take a long-term view of an investment of this nature and forestry is a long-term investment.  Nevertheless, there are indications which show that they can get a return after about five years.  The Department must, in those first five years, supplement the farmer's income to enable him to continue while the plantation is forming and get him to the stage where there would be a worth-while investment from it.</P>
    <P>It has been proven that forestry is a suitable use for this available land.  There are some indications that the return from State plantation in marginal land in areas which are not suitable for agricultural purposes can be something in the region of five, six, or maybe ten times greater than the return got from trying to eke out a living on that type of land by normal agricultural activities.  From the point of view of forestry development, I do not think the Department, up to now, have been able to get the message across to the farming community and to the owners of these marginal areas of land that this is an investment which will pay them well in future years and of course pay the Government and State well also.  There is a need for a revitalised, vigorous and ambitious new forestry policy.  That kind of policy would make the country self-sufficient in its timber needs in a very short time.  It would stimulate economic growth.  It would make the optimum use of marginal land to distribute income more evenly throughout those areas.  It would improve substantially our balance of payments.  It would create wealth here. It would be the basis for further industrialisation. It would save us foreign exchange.  It would earn us much needed foreign currency also.  It would improve <Col N="377" /> our tourism.  It would improve our habitat and wildlife areas.</P>
    <P>All of us would acknowledge the work that has been done in the Forestry and Wildlife Section in the preservation and development of amenities and wildlife. Many of us would wish that the Department could do more in the acquisition of habitats and places of important national value and European value.  We feel there is a need for the Department to pay more attention in the future to the preservation of these habitats and areas which are suitable and indeed are unique in Europe now.</P>
    <P>Another area which would be greatly enhanced by a vigorous land policy would be the whole area of forestry research.  It would create many new jobs especially jobs for young technicians and people with scientific and other qualifications who are coming out of schools and colleges now and finding it very difficult to obtain employment opportunities.  It would spread out the jobs into the areas where jobs are needed most.  I think that is absolutely essential.</P>
    <P>In relation to forestry, what we on this side of the House would see as important would be to embark on a vigorous new policy.  This should be a policy which would revise upwards our planting targets, undertake private and State venture plantation schemes, expand our research and development areas, invest more money through industrial research and standards, promote more home grown timber and more home grown products, identify new product ranges that can be filled from our timber resources, embark on a very vigorous policy of substituting Irish timber for imports, expand our saw-milling sector.  The policy should develop probably in the region of 2,000 to 3,000 additional jobs in this whole area of saw-milling and related activities through an enlightened and vigorous approach in that regard and establish a new marketing agency with the possibility of having a commercially orientated organisation which would exploit to the fullest possible extent by way of jobs and revenue from the State the timber and wood industry. We should not lose sight at any time of the need to preserve our wildlife habitat <Col N="378" /> and to designate further nature reserves and to continue on with the magnificent work which has been done by the Forestry and Wildlife Service in this whole area.  Overall we are seeing here two Departments working at half capacity. They are capable of doing an enormous amount of work.  They have done tremendous work in the past but they are restricted hopelessly and totally through a lack of the necessary finances which would enable them to do the job which they have to do.  They can do it if they get the money to do it.  We cannot expect to get the kind of results that we would all expect from these two Departments unless we are prepared to make the investment that is needed.  I would support the Minister in the efforts he is making to bring it home to his colleagues in the Government that they cannot continue to make the idealistic speeches that I mentioned at the very outset about the possibilities of creating employment opportunities and developing our national and natural resources unless we are prepared to make the type of investment that needs to be made to carry that through.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few brief words in relation to this Department, this Estimate and my constituents.  I do not believe that the Department of Fisheries and Forestry should be confined to considering fisheries in a marine sense, fisheries in the seas only or in large inland fisheries.  I do not believe that they should be confined to considering forestry on such a large scale, mountain forestry or whatever.  There is a large area within my constituency which would benefit greatly by one or two small approaches and efforts by the Department perhaps in conjunction with the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I represent a constituency of 120,000 people.  It reaches to the foot of the mountains and it reaches to Merchant's Quay a half mile or so from the opening to Dublin Bay.  I do not have a very large forestry or marine area in my constituency. Nonetheless, I think that this Department have great relevance to my <Col N="379" /> constituency and I would like to suggest one or two things to the Minister.</P>
    <P>First, with regard to the whole question of tree planting, the Minister will be aware that the local authorities, particularly Dublin Corporation through the schools have been encouraging a tree-planting programme very successfully. The children are taught to identify different types of trees and how they mature and various aspects of horticultural life attached to tree growth.  They are also taught to appreciate trees and to appreciate the environment generally.  Dublin Corporation's tree planting programme on roadsides and within parks has been very successful.  Whereas in the initial stages it was highly vandalised and tree planting did not survive very well, now large numbers of trees are surviving and in fact the majority of trees planted are surviving.  This I put down largely to the attempts made by Dublin Corporation to get schools and school-children involved in tree planting.  I would hope that the Minister would consider that there is a role for his Department in encouraging all local authorities to expand their role in getting school-children in particular but even retired people, many of whom have very little to do except to walk in the park in the afternoon and in the early evenings, involved through the local authorities in appreciation of trees and horticulture through tree planting and tree identification.</P>
    <P>I believe there is a very important role here for the Department of Fisheries and Forestry.  This should not be left only to the Department of the Environment which is an enormous Department and which has so many other priorities, roads and traffic and areas like that.  I really believe that the Department of Forestry has a contribution to make in that area. Dublin Corporation's successful tree planting programme has improved the environment greatly, and I think this Department has a role to play there.</P>
    <P>In regard to horticultural services generally, within the county committees of agriculture there is very good horticultural advice available and that applies to the county of Dublin.  Any resident in the <Col N="380" /> county of Dublin who for instance wants to plant a tree in the garden or has a problem with a tree growing in the garden or shrubbery or whatever it happens to be has the benefit of the advice of the horticultural staff of the committee of agriculture.  They can be called in and asked for their advice on things like this. Within the city of Dublin that service is not available.  We have the general problem of the environment in the city which is being dealt with successfully by Dublin Corporation.  In regard to this one specific area of horticulture, trees, I would ask the Minister &mdash; perhaps his officials when he goes back might present him with a little memo on this &mdash; to consider the role that his Department might have in improving the general appreciation and environment of life just in this area of tree planting and horticultural services.</P>
    <P>I want to say a brief word about stocking of fish, again in so far as it relates to my constituency.  I happen to have a particular interest in fishing.  I remember from my days as youth leader before I came into politics that one of the sections of the youth club for which I happened to have responsibility for was fishing. This had great interest for people in urban areas.  You could take people away to Blessington Lake or off to Lough Melvin in north Leitrim or off to Lough Sheelin and take them out for a day or a week-end fishing.  For many people that interest in fishing has been a great character-builder and has given people the opportunity to meet people from other walks of life and to appreciate an aspect of life which they normally would not have the opportunity to appreciate. Many of those people when they come back want to continue to practise their fishing, to develop an interest in fishing and an appreciation of fishing in the environment.  Where are the waterways that are available to them?  There is the Liffey, but that requires a licence if you go beyond the polluted sections.  There are other waterways.  There is, for instance, the River Camac which is polluted very badly from Clondalkin right into the Liffey and in fact is a contributory source polluting the Liffey.  At the <Col N="381" /> rere of Clondalkin Paper Mills there is a trout river and the plan is that that river will be cleaned up and will be depolluted at least physically in any event.  I would hope that the Minister would consider that his Department would have a role to play in ensuring that rivers, particularly within large cities, are depolluted and that they are subsequently stocked with fish.  Our young people in this enormous city &mdash; at least enormous in proportion to the size of our population and indeed enormous in proportion to most European cities &mdash; should have an opportunity to appreciate fishing and fish life.</P>
    <P>There is a great opportunity for us together with the various fishing boards and the local authorities, to encourage the complete stocking of the Grand Canal and of the Royal Canal.  The Grand Canal stretches for quite some distance within my own constituency.  On a summer's evening you see many young children and adults trying to fish in the Grand Canal, but there is very little fish life there. There has been an attempt made to stock it with fish.  I would encourage the Minister to consider just this area &mdash; the Grand Canal, first, and the Royal Canal &mdash; just those two canals which stretch right through the heart of inner Dublin from Ringsend through a variety of housing estates where there are very few leisure facilities.  Fishing could make a simple contribution, not just as a leisure-time activity but also as a boost to the general appreciation of the environment, which will have a benefit for us all because the people will appreciate the importance that fishing and forestry have for our economy if they can see it at a local level.  I would urge the Minister to accept that suggestion and to let his Department assume responsibility for co-ordinating this project.  Do not just leave it to the local authorities, to the Department of the Environment to the Department of Communications or to the Department of Public Works &mdash; all of whom have some responsibility, for instance, for canals.  It needs somebody to take specific responsibility for it.  I have almost finished my contribution; I just wanted to make those two suggestions.  I would implore the Minister to consider <Col N="382" /> that his Department has primary responsibility to co-ordinate, to develop and to promote the appreciation of trees and fishing and the development of trees and fishing in what could be a very inexpensive way.  He could thus perform a good task for his Department and for his brief on fishing and forestry generally.  To that end, I hope the Minister will consider within his Department assigning an officer to be responsible for urban fishery and forestry who would be in regular contact with the community and environment departments of local authorities and in particular the larger local authorities like Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council.  I would ask the Minister to appoint somebody specifically in his Department as an urban fisheries and forestry officer to co-ordinate, to promote and to develop the two areas that I suggested to him today, through the local authorities, the Department of Communications and the Office of Public Works.  It needs somebody centrally to co-ordinate the work to promote the suggestions I have made.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Department can be of vital importance in promoting the enormous potential of the tourism industry. When we talk about forestry and fisheries we seem to think all the time on the grand scale; we are talking about fishermen and their living.  That, of course is important and particularly so to the Deputies who represent marine constitutencies.  Could I just say one thing to the Minister? Coarse fishing is frowned on by inland fisherman in this country; they look down their noses on it; they are not interested in fishing for pike.  It is a lowly thing in the eyes of some anglers to fish for pike. For people in Germany and on the Continent generally, they are very much into pike fishing and in many cases more so than they are into salmon fishing or trout fishing.  We have lakes full of pike and I would hope that the Minister might consider, in conjunction with the Minister of State responsible for Tourism, the promotion of inland pike fishing here, promote it particularly in areas like Germany and continental countries where there is a specific interest in that aspect of coarse fishing.  They are very devoted to pike <Col N="383" /> fishing and any Germans who have come here are very taken by the quality and quantity of pike.  They are also amused at the Irish attitude with the exception of a small number of anglers towards pike, throwing them back, not wanting to catch them.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider if his Department in conjunction with the Department of Tourism have a role to play in promoting this in countries such as Germany.  I hope that he will consider that there is room within his Department for innovation.  It is not for ever that parties are in Government.  We are in Government now for nearly two years and presumably we will be there for another three years.  I think it is important that every Government in their turn should look back and say, &ldquo;When we were in Government we did that.  We went into Government because we wanted to change some things and we left our mark.&rdquo; Within the Department of Fisheries and Forestry there is more potential for doing that than there is within many other Departments.  It need not be very costly and it can be done in areas where a very large number of people can be reached and a very large number of people can appreciate it.  I recommend those suggestions to the Minister. I hope he will find it possible to consider them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to refer to the fact that the Minister said that the moneys available for the Department of Fisheries this year was 6 per cent on last year's outturn.  That is very true but it is more important to refer to the fact that the Estimate this year is down on the Estimate for 1983. So 1984 is a reduction on 1983 on the Estimate and if the outturn last year is any indication of what the outturn this year is going to be, we are going to have less and less money spent in this vitally important Department where there is tremendous potential.  If we are to overcome the problems of unemployment, particularly along the western and south-western seaboards, then it is only through a greater input into fisheries and a greater <Col N="384" /> amount of money being made available to this Department that the problem can be resolved.</P>
      <P>Deputy Daly referred to other Ministers who at times referred to the potential that is in fisheries and forestry but unfortunately when the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry requires money he is on his own and he does not have the support of the other members of the Cabinet and instead of increasing the Estimate for Fisheries and Forestry they have reduced it drastically this year.  The future of the industry is based on the quotas which are available to us.  We were told at the beginning of this year when the various quotas were made known to us that there was an increase in a number if not all of them.  I accept the fact there was an increase in mackerel and herrings but the impression was given to us by the Minister that we were obtaining an increase in quotas which the other Governments were not getting.  The fact is that the quota which we have from the total allowable catch for all of the species is exactly the same quota as was available in the previous year, the same percentage of the total allowable catch.  I refer in particular to mackerel when we had 80,000 tonnes in 1983, increased to 85,300 tonnes in 1984.  As an actual fact while our quota was increasing all of the quotas within the EEC were increasing as well, our share being 21.3 per cent of the overall total allowable catch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mackerel is causing great concern to the industry at the moment and no doubt to the Minister and his officials in the Department.  It is now approaching the end of June and we see ahead of us the commencement of the next mackerel season and all of the cold stores in Donegal and many of the public cold stores in Dublin at present are full of mackerel.  It is particularly worrying for the industry and for all of us who are anxious to see this problem resolved.  I can appreciate that the Minister has no magic wand that he can wave and that he also would like to see this problem resolved immediately. If it is not, then I shudder to think of the repercussions from the fact that we might not be able to sell these mackerel; and if we sell them, then they must be <Col N="385" /> sold on to other markets at a much-reduced price and consequently at a serious loss to the producers.  If they are to continue in business then they obviously must pay a lower price for the fish next year and as a result the fishermen are at a great loss also.</P>
    <P>On 4 April last I got a cynical remark when I suggested to the Minister that he should go to Nigeria to try to resolve this problem.  I believe sincerely that the Minister must go urgently to Nigeria and try to work out an agreement whereby this problem can be resolved.  I cast no aspersions on any officials who have been sent to Nigeria at the request of the Minister to try to resolve the difficulties but I believe the only one who can carry enough weight to resolve this problem is the Minister.  I again propose to him that even at this late hour he should go there and try to have the problems resolved.  It is true that these fish can be sold in other markets but if they go on to the European market then they will obtain only the floor price which is there.  The Minister is aware I am sure that if we are to sell to Egypt where there is a demand for them they will only accept mackerel within 60 days from the date on which they are caught.  Egypt is not a market which can be used for this stockpile in cold stores at the moment.</P>
    <P>The herring market is also a problem but I understood from the Minister of State that soon after 4 July he would visit the Eastern bloc countries to try to obtain mackerel and herring markets.  Hopefully we will hear from the Minister at the end of the debate whether this is being done, or we will be told at a later stage if the Minister has been there and if so what are the results of his visit.</P>
    <P>White fish is causing serious problems at present.  The problem of continuity of white fish has been one which has been with us for some time.  As a result of this it is difficult for processors to get more deeply involved than they are in the white fish market while the raw material is not available to them.  I believe there is a solution which will solve two problems; it will solve the problem of continuity of white fish and it will also solve the problem which I believe is the most serious at <Col N="386" /> the moment, that is the fishing vessels in the 60ft. to 90ft. range.  These boats are experiencing severe difficulties at the moment because the traditional type of fish which they land, herrings, particularly off the west coast, is not available to them as of now.  Even if they were available to them the market is not available. Consequently, they find themselves in serious trouble.  There is money available from FEOGA for the refurbishing and conversion of such boats.  If this money was made available by the Government and by the EEC, all skippers of fishing boats in the 60ft to 90ft. range would take advantage of the national and FEOGA grants.</P>
    <P>I note that the grants which are available from FEOGA for this type of modernisation or conversion work is a maximum of £14,500.  I contend that this would not be sufficient.  The Government would have to make up the shortfall to ensure that fishermen could be attracted to refurbishing their vessels.  They owe BIM a considerable amount of money at present, but 99 per cent of those honourable fishermen are not in a position to meet their repayments to BIM because they are not landing any significant quantity of fish.  They are barely able to pay their overheads which must be paid: their fuel costs, their insurance and the maintenance necessary to ensure that the boat is kept in a reasonable condition.  I propose to the Minister that moneys should be made available for the conversion and refurbishing of these boats.</P>
    <P>If we go back a few years we can establish the reason for having so many of these boats.  During the late stages of negotiations in relation to the Common Fisheries Policy it was necessary then to try to ensure that we had the maximum landings here and BIM and the Department of Fisheries felt the necessity to increase the investment in fishing boats and thereby increase the landings which would give us a much larger percentage of the total allowable catch.  But then it was seen that we had gone a little bit too far, that boats were being made available too easily at that time, that there was not sufficient fish available to ensure that fishermen and skippers could meet their <Col N="387" /> repayments.  It was necessary then when negotiations were almost completed to put the brakes on and ensure that no further investment would be made in this size of boat.  It is not too late as yet.</P>
    <P>The Minister will learn from BIM and his officials in the Department that this problem can be overcome now that there is no money necessary for investment in new boats.  If there is any money available it would be very little because the industry has lost confidence for a number of reasons.  Moneys that would be available at other times for new boats should now be made available for the refurbishing of secondhand boats together with the aid which could be forthcoming from BIM. First of all, before we do this we must try to ensure that confidence is instilled into the fishermen.  We cannot continue to repossess boats from fishermen who are in difficulties.  The practice now is that if they are repossessed, they are sold off to someone else &mdash; to people, I would say with due respect, who would not have the same expertise.  At the end of the day those debts will have to be written off.  In theory, BIM and the Department can follow individual skippers to obtain repayments but in practice it does not happen because the money is not available.</P>
    <P>We should have a new look at the whole situation in relation to repayments and try to ensure that fishermen who have expertise in the industry should be retained.  We should try to work out a system whereby arrears of repayments could be brought forward and spread over a much longer period.  Then the fishermen would start anew, could make their repayments, providing that the boats which they are using could be refurbished.</P>
    <P>In the short term we must seriously consider some form of fuel subsidy.  The country at large benefited earlier this year when there was a reduction of 9p on petrol.  Unfortunately, this was not passed on in relation to diesel for fishermen. A reduction such as this would certainly help fishermen in the short-term. We must also ensure that there is a much greater investment in market research. <Col N="388" /> As was pointed out by the Minister of State or the Minister in the debate some weeks ago, a moneys committee was investigating this.  I look forward to the outcome of research which is being done both in the country and outside.  I should add that the research which is being done within the country will certainly help, but it will not in the short term help us to overcome the serious problems we have. It is important to look at the reality of the situation.  I welcome the Minister's visit to Japan and note that there is potential that a number of business people from Japan are coming to the country.  But, by the same token, I am correct in assuming that they would be interested in a processed product rather than in the type of product we have available at the moment.  The nearest thing we would have at present would be something in the herring roe and smoked salmon line.</P>
    <P>The question of mackerel, as we would like to sell them at the moment in a frozen state, is a number of years hence, hopefully when we will be in a position to smoke our own mackerel, to can them. As far as canning is concerned there is a very viable business being carried on in my own constituency at the moment where smoking and canning of mackerel and herring is taking place.  As in all industries, I would expect that this company could have difficulties at the outset in trying to get off the ground.  But it has been proven and I hope that within the not-too-distant future the lines in this particular factory can be expanded in order that more unemployed people in west Donegal can be employed there.</P>
    <P>There is tremendous potential for this. If we are to provide processed fish for places as far away as Japan, then it must be a product that is well up the added-value scale.  As I said at the outset, a big problem in relation to white fish is the continuity of supply.  I expect that if 60 ft. to 100 ft. boats were available for the landings of these fish it would be necessary also to ensure that these boats would explore other areas than the areas that have been fished already.  They would be much bigger than the boats which are using the grounds off the coast.  We should insist that these boats would go <Col N="389" /> further off.  But prior to that we should make more moneys available for research of the fishing grounds.  That could be done in the meantime and at a later stage, when the boats are ready to fish and they know precisely where these fish are. There is an opportunity out there for us by way of blue whiting.  If we could establish precisely where they are then these other boats should be in a position to fish them.  If they land these fish then I foresee a very serious problem as no market research has been done in relation to blue whiting.</P>
    <P>I respectfully suggest to the Minister that we embark immediately on this course; that moneys are made available for the conversion and refurbishing of these boats and that the research of the grounds is carried out immediately.  As I have stated, market research is of vital importance.  We saw where a short time after landings of mackerel in bulk commenced that it was necessary to send a considerable quantity of these mackerel to the fishmeal plant in Killybegs and to the Mornington plant which was closed some years ago.  Over the years the processors, in conjunction with BIM, secured various markets abroad and now very few of these mackerel are being processed for fishmeal.  I do not want to go back over the ground that we will have plenty of mackerel for fishmeal if the Nigerian problem is not resolved at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned harbour development.  I must say I was disappointed that the only money made available to Donegal, where indeed we have the highest rate of unemployment &mdash; it is something in the region of 27 per cent in County Donegal &mdash; and the majority of those people are under 24 years of age, was to complete Portevlin pier and a small grant made available to Donegal County Council to repair the fendering at Rathmullan.  I had hoped that Donegal would receive a fair and equitable amount this year, particularly for Burtonport. I was disappointed to learn even before this, that the Minister had advised the people of Burtonport some few days ago that no moneys would be available there this year and that the position <Col N="390" /> would be reviewed during 1985.  I am realistic to know that if the moneys are not there and if the Minister has not made them available &mdash; I do not intend playing politics &mdash;I would plead with the Minister to have a serious look at this problem in Burtonport and hopefully he will make moneys available during 1985.</P>
    <P>All that is necessary is to make available 50 per cent of the money as I understand 50 per cent of the overall cost would be forthcoming from Roinn na Gaeltachta as well.  As I said before, the Minister has no excuse and he cannot pass the buck in this one.  He finds himself in a very difficult situation when he says, &ldquo;Twist the arm of the Minister for the Gaeltacht&rdquo;.  He is in the position that he is the Minister in charge of both Departments and hopefully during 1985 he will ensure that Burtonport will get its fair share.</P>
    <P>This morning I was on a deputation meeting with Commissioner Burke in relation to various problems in Donegal and one of those was the harbour at Greencastle.  We tried to present the picture to the Minister of the serious difficulties which Greencastle has at the moment.  In addition to Burtonport I would ask the Minister to consider Greencastle as I had thought from the Adjournment debate one night that moneys would have been made available this year.</P>
    <P>Over the last few weeks the salmon fishermen are experiencing very serious problems.  At the moment the livelihood of our fishermen is being taken from them.  They are fishing as they have been over the last number of years and, indeed, decades and this is a traditional right which they have had.  No organisation, or industry is trying more to improve their methods by becoming more efficient.  The fishermen are now using a type of net which can be used during the day.  Prior to this, the netting which was used could only be used during the night.  I think there was only one good reason for it and that is if lives can be saved.  Over the years too many lives have been lost off our coast as a result of night fishing.  These fishermen, who are fishing for salmon are fishing with small boats <Col N="391" /> from 30 to 45-foot; the maximum size is a 50-foot boat.  The fishermen can, if allowed to fish during the day, thus reduce the number of accidents which no doubt would occur if they fished during the night.</P>
    <P>The west coast is becoming extremely busy.  It is inevitable that accidents will occur.  Those large boats do not go out by the nets; they go through them and cut their nets and the fishermen lose as a result of this.  I am of the opinion that the Minister is a realist and he fully appreciates the difficulties that these fishermen are experiencing.  I appreciate the fact that conservation is very necessary.  This is a very important fishery.  It is a renewable resource.  We must ensure that fish are there for years to come.  The fishermen also realise that because they are the people who would suffer as a result of this.  Their families would suffer and their families' families would suffer.  The fishermen are prepared to make sacrifices and to compromise.  They have stated time and time again that they will adhere rigidly to a five-day week.  This is something to which the fishermen did not adhere in the past.</P>

      <P>The Minister should agree to it, even on a short-term basis. This is the only type of netting available to them at the moment, as people will not stock other types anymore.  This is the same type of netting that the Government are quite happy to take the 23 per cent VAT from.  The Government then tell us that they are going to introduce an order which will allow them to use the netting for other species.  On 14 June the order appeared in the newspaper telling us that our fishermen cannot go outside 12 miles to fish salmon.  The order did not appear yet as to where the monofilament can be used to fish the other species.  The Minister stated that he will introduce it within a week or two.  I would respectfully suggest that he might introduce it at the earliest possible date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me refer to the order made by the Minister on 14 June, in respect of EEC <Col N="392" /> Directive No. 82/86, on the convention for the conservation of salmon on the North Atlantic Ocean.  Our salmon boats, particularly off the south-west coast of Donegal, if we take our base lines on the west coast, can go much further out than from the base lines on the south-west coast of the county.  Take the fishermen from Arran Mor Island who had to go much further out to catch fish in the past; now if they go outside the 12-mile limit, they cannot fish at all.  Not alone can our protection crews go aboard but we have the serious situation where the British crews can do so.  I believe some of them are in the area already.  I understand that some moves were made by the British Government to ensure that this order would be signed.  The report states in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Thursday, 14 June that &ldquo;the British Government is frequently complaining that Irish boats operating the 12-mile limit were able to intercept fish heading for Scottish, English and Northern Ireland rivers&rdquo;.  I wonder whose interests should we be looking after.  Should it be the interests of the people within the United Kingdom or of the people within our own small country.</P>
    <P>Fishermen and their families who are depending on salmon for a living have used this traditional type of fishing for many decades.  We talk about historic rights when considering agreements within Europe.  I would plead with the Minister to appreciate the fact that the end of the season comes traditionally about the middle of July and very little fish has been landed in Donegal.  If there were any job opportunities available in Britain I have no doubt that the Derry boat would be in operation again.  All of those fishermen who came back from Scotland, England and America to build their homes on the west coast of Donegal, on Arran Mór, Inish Boffin and Tory Islands now find themselves in a very difficult situation.  It is even more difficult in so far as they obtained loans from BIM for their boats and gear and will be unable to repay those loans.  I contend that the weather can ensure that conservation takes place.  Over the last number of days the weather was so calm that the nets <Col N="393" /> would not drift.  It is pointless going out on those days.  Today there are storms off the west coast, so the boats cannot go out.  The weather almost takes care of the conservation measures which are necessary. Despite what the Minister may have heard I do not doubt his word but I am quite certain that 99.9 per cent of those fishermen would be happy to fish over the five days in the week and, irrespective of weather conditions, would adhere to the regulations in relation to Saturday and Sunday.  Before I conclude on salmon I should like to say that we must take the other theory that if all the salmon go up the river, there will be very few salmon coming down next year.  When salmon go up to spawn they need the bed of the river but if too many go up it is like planting potatoes on top of one another and at the end of the next season we have nothing.  It may sound farcical but we cannot take so many salmon out each year and ensure that the fishery is sustained.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister's anxiety about the future.  The Minister should also appreciate my anxiety about the present.  I can assure you, as can the fishermen who presented their proposal to the Minister earlier this year that they are extremely interested in the new regulations.  I hope the Minister will introduce some in the short term and have a rethink about this in the long term and not listen to people who have fixed ideas about this and who are not prepared to change their attitude in any way.</P>
    <P>The question of Spain's entry into the EEC is one which we must consider very seriously I note that the fishermen are worried about a statement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Barry, when he said that Ireland would have to maintain a tough stance against the Spanish rights at least during the transition period.  I hope that the Minister was wrongly quoted but if he was rightly quoted, then it is very serious that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is interested only in his own portfolio and not in the country at large.  If Spain enters the EEC our own Minister for Fisheries must ensure that whatever deal is agreed will not interfere with our rights off the west <Col N="394" /> coast.  The Spanish fleet is much bigger than all of the fleets in the EEC and all of these boats are working off the west and north-west coasts of our country.  The legislation introduced by the Minister in 1983 to ensure that they could not use the flag of convenience has helped.  It is difficult to keep them out but if we allow them in they will have a right here and it is the Irish boats that will suffer as a result.  As I said earlier the research and development of the grounds where the horse-mackerel and blue whiting might be is essential and some of the boats which are lying obsolete should be used to explore these grounds.  It is not necessary to have them all converted immediately. Some could commence the conversion programme.  Others could ensure that the research of the markets is carried out immediately in order that all of the fish would not go to the only fish meal plant in Killybegs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Daly referred to training and technology.  I had the opportunity of visiting the training school in Greencastle. It is an excellent school but more money is necessary to expand.  Something which is also necessary is a boat which would be available at the harbour in Greencastle and which could be used to take these young men while training out to sea where they can operate with their instructors and tutors.</P>
    <P>There are enough boats lying idle in the country and surely one of these could be made available to them.  I would hope that the Minister would ensure that the incident which occurred at Rockall some weeks ago when the <i>Salve Regina</i> was ordered out of that area by the British naval authorities does not recur.  Some of our boats are fishing in that area and doing extremely well.  We cannot accept these directives coming from the British naval authorities; however, it could have been a misunderstanding.  I would hope that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has let it be known to the British authorities our concern particularly in relation to the grounds around Rockall.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the situation in Killybegs where there is a lack of facilities there at the moment for the maintenance of boats.  When the Killybegs boatyard is <Col N="395" /> being sold by the liquidator we must, if possible, have a condition inserted that this should only be sold to someone who is prepared to carry on the maintenance and building of boats.  It is an excellent site I have no doubt that there are many processors who would be extremely anxious to obtain the freezing facilities that could be made available there.  The boats could almost take the fish directly from that plant into the freezer ships.  I ask the Minister to request that the liquidator to insist that anyone buying this would use it for that purpose; otherwise it would be necessary for the boats to go across to Girvan in Scotland for minor repairs which could be carried out at Killybegs.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude on fishing I want to say a few words about forestry.  I would ask the Minister to make every effort to ensure that the withdrawal of the £25 per ton mackerel subsidy might be re-introduced next year or this year particularly in view of the extenuating circumstances pertaining in the county at the moment in relation to mackerel.  The Minister had hoped that money would be made available in some other form to this country. He was confident at the time.  He was led to believe that but unfortunately this money was not made available.  In view of the extenuating circumstances this year in relation to the mackerel and the serious problem in Nigeria this might be made available to the industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of putting any other Deputy out.  In relation to forestry I welcome today's meeting between Dr. Eoin McKiernan, President of the Irish-American Cultural Institute, and the Minister at which Dr. McKiernan reached agreement with the Minister on an Irish-American collaboration product.  I understand that the purpose of the project is to promote through sponsorship a tree planting programme in Ireland by North American donors.  Without taking from the Minister this was initiated by the leader of my party in September-October of 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="396" /> Forestry, like fisheries, is an industry which depends on renewable resources. We can ensure that employment which is so urgently required throughout the country can be made available with greater input by the Department of Fisheries and Forestry, and with a greater expenditure by the Government on this Department.  But within this Department or this industry there are many fears that the industry are not fully aware of the supply of timber which is available to them.  In 1980 the IDA issued a report giving an indication to the industry of the timber that would be available over the years but this report was not very accurate and extremely misleading in so far as the industry is concerned.  It did not give an accurate account of the volume of timber which would be available over the years to the industry and the industry now find themselves working to a capacity of 60 to 70 per cent while in fact they should be working to a capacity of 100 per cent.  Last year was a very obvious example when the industry were advised early in the year that 700,000 cubic metres would be available to them.  The industry based their projections on that and sold their timber accordingly and found at the end of the year that only 500,000 cubic metres came on stream, thus a shortfall of 200,000 cubic metres. I suggest to the Minister that every effort be made to ensure that very accurate figures on volumes of timber available are made available to the industry.  In the not too distant future we will have to seriously consider the commercial viewpoint where forestry is concerned unless we have a drastic improvement in the near future.  The tendering programme is completely unsatisfactory.  It is so ridiculous that somebody in the south of Ireland through the tendering system could have to go to Donegal to collect their timber and somebody in Donegal or Sligo could have to go to the south of Ireland to obtain their supplies which would be exactly similar.  Something is terribly wrong when situations like these arise and it should be considered and resolved as qucikly as possible by the Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that there is <Col N="397" /> an 85 per cent grant available for people in western counties for tree planting.  We here know it but the public at large are not fully aware of it.  Over the next number of weeks the Minister might have his officials consider what could be done in order to make this information available to the people who have the sort of land which is between forestry and agriculture. They would certainly be interested because an 85 per cent grant is one which would entice many people to plant and in the long term it would ensure that there would be a future for the sawmilling industry.  I think it is a fact that over the next number of years the EEC will have to import quite a substantial amount of their timber and I understand also that we have the best climatic conditions for growing timber. Therefore, we should ensure that as much money as possible is made available and that we embark on a tree planting programme, even though it may be 30 years hence when a lot of these come on stream.  If we are interested in conservation and other aspects we should also be interested in ensuring that timber will be made available.  This can only be done by a commitment from the Government and a commitment from the Department of Forestry to carry out this tree planting programme which I have referred to.</P>
    <P>That concludes my remarks in relation to fisheries and forestry.  I would appeal to the Minister to have another look at the salmon situation and to realise and appreciate that the people whom I represent in west Donegal find themselves in the situation that if jobs become available and if there is an upturn in the UK, as we are told, all of those people will return to the UK.  Many houses will close down.  I am sure no Minister or no Government wants to be responsible for this situation. We have two weeks to 17 days left.  I would ask the Minister to accept that the fishermen would adhere to a definite five day week and I wish to ask him to permit them to continue their fishing activities. After that, that gives us 12 months to get our house in order for next year.  I am glad to note that not only am I echoing my own remarks in relation to salmon and monofilament but that I am also <Col N="398" /> echoing the remarks of backbenchers in the Minister's own party.  Not alone would the Minister be appeasing me but he would also be appeasing the Members of his own party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I was unable to be present during the Minister's Estimate speech due to the fact that together with the other Donegal Deputies we had a meeting with the EEC Commissioner, Mr. Burke.  One of the matters we discussed at that meeting was the enormous natural resource we have in the west, and particularly off the Donegal coast, in the rich fishing grounds we have there.  Indeed, if we can properly exploit them what a great advantage that would be to the west and to Donegal.  At the moment in Donegal we have the highest unemployment rate in the country.  It is in excess of 26 or 27 per cent whereas the national average would be 12 or 13 per cent.  There is a great potential in the west if we develop the fishing industry, especially onshore fishing by establishing processing industries.  In that way much extra employment can be created.</P>
      <P>A figure which has been quoted in this House and elsewhere is that in this country at the moment the ratio between those engaged on sea and on land in the fishing industry is on a one to one basis whereas in some of the continental countries such as Denmark the ratio is one to seven or one to eight.  Bearing these figures in mind we know what a great potential there is there.  I would hope that in the next few years every effort will be made not alone to help the fishing fleet but also to establish these processing plants onshore to provide much-needed employment in the west particularly in Donegal.  We did discuss it with the EEC Commissioner today and his reaction was very favourable and he recognised the potential there is there also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, I was not present for the Minister's speech but I think it is fairly common knowledge now that the fishing industry at the moment is in a fairly serious state, not of the Minister's making, not of the Government's making, but due to an accumulation of difficulties over the years.  We have costs escalating and the <Col N="399" /> price of the produce at a standstill.  Very often the price the fishermen get for their produce now is lower than what is was a number of years ago.  The major cost factor is the significant increase in the price of fuel in the last few years.  I understand that the cost of fuel to Irish fishermen is much higher and much greater than it is to fishermen in other EEC countries. I understand that in some of the countries there is some sort of subsidy available to the fishermen there.  I do not know whether or not it contravenes EEC regulations but perhaps some consideration should be given to this question. Perhaps the idea of a VAT rebate to fishermen should be considered.  I remember two or three months ago when we had an opportunity of debating fisheries in this House before the major oil companies in the country had reduced the price of petrol the previous day by anything up to 10p a gallon.  I remember remarking at that time that the price of diesel was not reduced.  I was glad to see in the last few days that the price of diesel has been reduced by 2p or 3p a gallon.  I hope that this will be passed on to the fishermen and that it might give them some marginal relief.</P>
    <P>In regard to mackerel, we are experiencing difficulties on the Nigerian market where I understand the issue of licences has not so far materialised.  When the political situation changed there last year I was in contact with the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry and, indeed, the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  On that occasion I expressed my anxiety that any change of Government or policy in Nigeria would affect the fishing industry and the exporters in this country.  I know that both Ministers have been monitoring the situation very carefully.  So far I understand the licences have not been issued and that all storage facilities in this country are choc-a-bloc.  I am sure the Minister is giving this matter his attention. I hope some arrangement can be arrived at shortly so that we can get rid of these stocks which are costing a lot of money to store for the last six months. The Minister visited Japan recently to extensively promote our fish exports.  I <Col N="400" /> understand the reaction to his visit was very favourable and I hope we will be able to exploit the Japanese market further in years to come.  They import billions of fish every year and I hope they will find our products to their liking.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher mentioned harbour facilities in Donegal.  We have the foremost fishing port in Ireland at Killybegs which is in need of further development. For some time they have been requesting the facility of a synchro lift and I hope something can be done in that respect before the end of the year.  The third most important port in Donegal is Burtonport which is near my own area.  For a number of years they have been requesting to have it dredged and to have the pier extended.  A promise was given in 1980 during an election campaign that it would be seriously considered.  I would hope that, if not this year, then next year that serious consideration should be given to the dredging of this harbour to facilitate a significant number of boats from that port.  Burtonport is one of the ports in Donegal depending on salmon fishing.</P>
    <P>Last year we had difficulties during the salmon fishing season.  I compliment the Minister on the number of meetings he has had with salmon fishermen since that time.  They had two or three meetings in Dublin, where they discussed the difficulties and the problems.  A fortnight ago the Minister visited Donegal and had a further meeting with about 30 salmon fishermen and I am sure he found them, as I did, to be reasonable men who were concerned with this season and seasons to come and who are interested in conservation. Had their fathers and grandfathers not been interested in conservation they would not have the livelihood of the salmon fishing they have at the moment, and they are concerned for their own children.  We had a constructive meeting that evening.  The Minister understands the case the salmon fishermen put to him and that they understand the Minister's decision.  From the feedback I am getting compared to last year the salmon catches in Burtonport, Bunbeg, and all around the north west are drastically down on last year's by about <Col N="401" /> 75 per cent to date.  The Burtonport Fishermen's Co-Operative would have four or five extra people employed during the season.  They have not got them employed this year due to the small number of salmon.  I do not know what the reason is.  Perhaps the salmon are running late but I would hope that this year they would have an opportunity of earning their livelihood.  Entire families are depending on this.</P>
    <P>The complex question of monofilament arises.  I have been advocating that it should be examined seriously because it is a more efficient and safer method of fishing.  It enables the fishermen to fish during the day instead of at night.  If the Minister and the Department would see their way to legalise it, I would also advocate that there would be very strict controls on the length of gear and on the number of days fishing during the week. The fishermen realise this and they have made that point in their submission to the Minister.  I hope that when this season is over there will be further opportunities and that we will resolve this problem to everybody's satisfaction before next year's season.</P>
    <P>Another grievance the fishermen have brought to my attention and to other Deputies' attention is the introduction of a 12-mile limit.  The salmon fishermen are not allowed to go outside the 12-mile limit.  This regulation applies to salmon fishermen not alone in Ireland but in all other countries &mdash; Canada and Iceland. It might not suit us 100 per cent here but if the rule is applied in every other country, especially in Canada and Iceland, if they are not allowed to go outside the 12 mile and if they abide by that regulation it will give the salmon an opportunity of returning to the Irish coast.  Of all the natural resources we have in the west, fishing has a great potential and is the one that needs to be developed.</P>
    <P>Many people who have fishing boats through BIM have difficulties with their repayments.  The repayment for anyone who bought a boat ten years ago would be comparatively low compared to people who have purchased their boats in the past few years.  It is on record and it has been said before that almost 80 per <Col N="402" /> cent are finding it impossible to meet their repayments.  Many skippers are worried because they do not know what the future holds.  We could renegotiate the loans or extend the period of repayment. It needs to be looked at seriously.</P>
    <P>The industry is important.  We now have a Common Fisheries Policy under the EEC.  What I would like to see is a national fisheries policy where fishermen, the processors, the exporters, the buyers and the Minister could sit down and work out a national policy and see how we can gain most out of this valuable resource.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer very briefly to the forestly aspect of the Minister's responsibility and point out that our climate is very favourable towards the growing of trees but in spite of all that we have the lowest percentage of our territory under trees, lower than any other country in Europe with the exception of Iceand.  We will have to adopt a vigorous policy of afforestation.  This would be of benefit in the west where we have vast tracts of land in my own county and in other western counties that would be suitable for very little else besides growing trees.  It is an investment for the future.  I hope we will be able to initiate such a policy in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The Minister is in charge of these two Departments at a very difficult time when the fishing industry is going through a crisis because of external factors not of our making.  We are left to try and solve them as best we can.  The potential is there and I hope the Government will be able to get us out of the difficulties we are in.  It will be to the benefit of the entire economy of the country, not alone that of the west and Donegal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate the Fisheries estimate. In the opening line of the Minister's speech, he asks that a sum not exceeding £17,476,000 be granted.  In the opening line of the Minister's speech on the Fisheries Estimate 1983 the figure was £18,752,000.  I am disappointed.  Reference was made to the out-turn later on in his speech.  I do not accept that he was unable to spend the money given to him <Col N="403" /> by the Government.  On reading through the two scripts I find that on page 7 of this year's Estimate speech the wording is more or less the same in relation to one particular item: &ldquo;... the scheme at Kilcummin and Killala are expected to be completed this year.&rdquo; The very same line was in the script last year.  Is that going to appear in the script again next year?  Reading through the two scripts one can see very many parallels, so it appears that not alone are the Government and the Department of Fisheries and Forestry running out of money but they are also very short on vocabulary.  In the last page the Minister says he is prepared to answer any questions we might have and I certainly have a few to ask.</P>
      <P>On page ten of the present issue of the <i>IFO News</i> it says that in relation to a meeting held on 8 May the Minister said he was trying, realising the problems, to impress on people who could and should help to give him the kind of resources he needed.  Obviously he did not succeed so apparently the Minister is a lightweight, and prepared to admit it, in his own Government.  This is a disappointment.</P>

      <P>The Minister will have an opportunity of replying to me and we will be delighted to hear his comments. We hope to hear that he will show some sort of initiative because as far as I see there is little or no initiative coming from his Department and he, as Minister, should be showing that initiative.  The Minister should be out there in front and not be dictated to by anyone.  He is certainly not doing this and the amount of the Estimate for this year in comparison to what we had last year clearly demonstrates that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to speak now in relation to what Deputy McGinley said.  Unfortunately he has left the House.  We all know that the use of monofilament netting is a bone of contention and has been for some time.  Deputy McGinley is on record as having said that he favours the use of monofilament netting and today he also said that he has asked the Government <Col N="404" /> to have a serious look at this.  I felt that this was a dilution of previous statements made by him.  I would like the Minister to comment on the erratic stance by his own backbenchers on this matter. I would like to know clearly what the Government view is.</P>
    <P>I am in full agreement with the IFO editorial comment in this month's issue, and I read from it:</P>
    <P>It is clear that neither the Minister nor his senior advisers have any appreciation of the magnitude of the problems facing the fishing industry or of the potential which exists if the industry is properly handled.</P>
    <P>Indeed, Deputy McGinley subscribed to that view by quoting figures of having a one-to-one situation here, one on the sea, one on the shore, whereas in other European countries the ratio is as much as one to seven.  Their main consideration appears to be to ensure that nothing happens which is outside departmental control or which might upset the <i>status quo.</i> This is precisely what I am saying about initiative, that the potential is there and I am fairly confident that the Minister is aware of this.  He has been told it often enough but there does not seem to be anything happening.  No serious attempt has been made to come to grips with the realities of the fishing industry.  It is also clear that no serious effort has been made to come to grips with the requirements of the industry despite the fact that this is the fifth continuous year of depression. We are not even availing of the EEC finance under the terms of the Common Fisheries Policy.  We have no programme prepared to avail of the Common Fisheries Policy funds despite the fact that a year-and-a-half after the initial three-year period has already gone.  For example, we have no national scheme for the temporary or permanent cessation of vessels, no scheme for exploratory fishing and so on.  When the Common Fisheries Policy documents were signed the catch phrase was &ldquo;development&rdquo;.  What development has taken place since?  In my opinion and in the opinion of the IFO absolutely none.  What is the official solution to the fishermen who find themselves <Col N="405" /> in financial arrears?  The answer is to force the fishermen concerned to contribute 25 per cent of their gross catch towards repayment when it is clear that all such terms are impossible to comply with if boats are to stay in business.  That is exactly the situation.  Do you want to see the boats tied up, do you want to see the boats for sale and nobody using them?  Is that the Minister's policy?  I would like a clear statement on this matter.</P>
    <P>Public relations activity is certainly no substitute for performance and this through the Chair, appears to be very definitely the line taken by the Government. If a stone falls out of the pier, sometimes it is replaced and there is almost an unveiling ceremony with photographers there to say that a great job is being done and here is development. That kind of thing does not con people any more.  The least the industry expects from the Minister is a glimmer of leadership and courage.  If he is unable or unwilling to meet these requirements, then he should resign.  I repeat that we expect initiative from the Minister and from his junior Minister, and there is absolutely no sign of initative whatsoever.</P>
    <P>In relation to harbours, I would have to say that reading through the Minister's speech I was very saddened to note that no mention was made of Wexford, and even after last Sunday you would expect them to be given some pride of place, but no.  We have a junior Minister from that county for Fisheries and Forestry and unfortunately he is missing today in this, what I would have assumed would be, the most important debate on fisheries and forestry for the year.  As a representative of the people in my area who are fishermen, I believe the place to be today is here in Dáil Éireann to represent them where they can be best represented.  I would like to refer to Kilmore Harbour and to quote from the Minister.  I asked this question of the Minister of State before in a debate here on 4th April 1984. He says that I had referred to Kilmore Harbour.  There is a very accurate report of that in this month's issue of the <i>IFO News.</i></P>
    <P>
      <Col N="406" /> The Minister claimed that he had been to the pier and as a result had made something like £50,000 available to complete work that was started there.  The work that was started was started in Fianna Fáil's time.  What he was providing for was a continuation of the work which was absolutely necessary.  The work was done.  As far as that is concerned, Kilmore Harbour is relatively safe.  What he failed to say was that he had promised very recently also that the harbour would be dredged.  To date I do not know that the harbour will be dredged.  I am asking the Minister here this evening, knowing that he has already promised in his statement today that he will answer the question as to when Kilmore Harbour will be dredged.  Kilmore Harbour is one of the biggest harbours in the country, certainly not the best, but probably the best fishermen come from there.  I am asking directly this evening when it is proposed to dredge Kilmore Harbour.  There are 400 people involved in the industry there whether it be fishing or on shore.  They deserve the attention that I am asking for here this evening.  I would also like to know if there are plans to upgrade Kilmore Quay fishing harbour. The amount of money that is made available to it is very small and for the numbers of boats using it, it is completely inadequate.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a brief reference to Duncannon Harbour and ask the Minister here in the absence of the junior Minister, when it is proposed to provide that £1.5 million that he promised to the Duncannon fishermen and when development, as a result of this allocation, will be carried out.  Thus on this occasion they will not succeed in the battle with the present Government.  They are seeking a figure of £7 million for development there.  The story is that the timber on Wexford Quay is completely rotten and worsening every day.  That quay is the scene of shell fish landings for a terrific company in Wexford &mdash; Lett and Company &mdash; they employ some 100 people.  It seems that if the timber is not replaced immediately Wexford Quay, for the first time in about 1,100 years will not have a landing area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="407" /> I hope the Minister will take this matter very seriously.  As I said earlier the fishing industry is an area of great job potential. We have 100 jobs in Wexford and they depend on the landing area here being kept in the condition it is in.  A proposal has been made to the Minister, Deputy Michael D'Arcy, and to the Minister for Finance in relation to the overall development of Wexford Harbour.  This would include a car park, marina and of course landing facilities and so on.  I would ask the Minister here this evening to lend his support to this development in the interests of job creation.  As I said Lett &amp; Company in Wexford have a massive mussel industry.  They sell their wares to America and to Europe.  The market is growing year by year and they must be congratulated for that.  If only the Minister would show the same initiative as Lett &amp; Company of Wexford then I would feel that the fishing industry would be in a very sound position.</P>

      <P>Could I first of all thank the members who participated in this debate.  There was a constructive and reasoned approach by all members who participated and I would hope that for everybody's sake we can do something worthwhile for the fishing and forestry industries.  Obviously time restraint prevents me from going through all the contributions to the extent that I would like and from replying to all the questions that have been put on the issues raised.</P>
      <P>All I can say about Kilmore Quay is that I will get the information for the Deputy and he will have it within a matter of days.  The Deputy asked a series of questions concerning Kilmore Quay, Duncannon, Ballyhack and Slane.  I will get the information for him under the four different headings.  In relation to Wexford Quay, I want to say that if the retention of 100 jobs depends on the condition of the quay being maintained then this will be done in order to maintain these jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have problems in the industry and these have been referred to by Deputy Daly, the Fianna Fáil spokesman, who <Col N="408" /> was very reasonable in his comments having had experience of the inner workings of this business.  He is aware of the difficulties that any Minister confronts.  I would like to refer to the policy of BIM. This policy, as the House knows, was endorsed by successive Governments. This meant putting as many boats as possible into the sea at a particular period and for a very good reason.  Many people would now say that the wrong orientation was there at the time, and so on.  The policy of BIM and successive Governments was to make a case for themselves to get the absolute maximum quota when quotas and tax were being applied by the EEC.  Undertakings were given by this country to double its catch over a short period.  We had not got the capacity to do that at that time.  Boats were made, approved, manufactured and put in the water.  We have now reached a stage where our fleet is capable of carrying out the job it has to do, which is fishing, in our own waters and, where we have got facilities, fishing outside our waters.  The problem here is that the markets have been depressed.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, nobody can point the finger at anybody else on that question.  Markets in the more popular species of fish to which we have committed ourselves have been depressed. When the rush was on to get boats into the water we concentrated on gearing ourselves up for mackerel and herring basically and also whiting and cod.  We now find that not only do quotas apply to these particular species but that the prices and the market situation is such that it no longer pays to fish for these species to the extent that it did.  In relation to mackerel I fully agree with Deputy Cope Gallagher that there is a problem in Donegal and Killybegs because of the Nigerian problem.</P>
    <P>He mentioned to me about six months ago that I should go to Nigeria.  I am in constant touch with our foreign affairs people there.  We also have CTT people there.  I sent out a BIM representative to find out what the position was and whether it would be worth my while going out there.  I am not talking politics here. I would not mind trying and if I fail, well <Col N="409" /> and good.  The advice I got was that because of the political situation out there, my presence would not mean much.  I was prepared to take the advice of the people who were there on a fulltime basis.  If that situation changes, and if it is felt by the people there that my presence might be of any use I will go there.  To bring the Members up to date in relation to Nigeria, I would say that in the last number of days import licences were issued by the Nigerian authorities for limited imports of controlled products.  This is a message that came to us very recently.  It is still very vague. There is a movement on import licences. We are not too sure to what extent or to what degree these will affect us favourably. We are keeping in very close touch with the situation.  We are hoping that we might be able to get our people to avail of whatever is out there.  Members will also be aware that we have a very substantial cover for export insurance for people exporting to Nigeria.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention another matter raised by Deputy Daly and Deputy Gallagher on the importance of research. Under the Common Fisheries Policy we have a subhead concerning exploratory fishing.  We have to look at this very seriously in this country because we are too dependent on too few species, when one considers that 60 per cent of our total catch is made up of mackerel.  Our total exports last year represented 73 per cent mackerel.  Apart from being foolish, it is very dangerous.  If anything goes wrong with the market in regard to that species, we will be in trouble, as we are this year because of the unforeseen situation in Nigeria which was our main market.</P>
    <P>Over-dependence on a narrow base is very dangerous and foolish.  We were geared towards that in order to get into volume catches.  We have reached the point where we have to impress on people the necessity to seek new species for which there is a market.  There is no point in exploring and getting something that one cannot sell at the end of the day.  The selling of a commodity or product, or species of fish in this case, is as important as finding out where it is and being able to catch it.  It is important also to sell it at <Col N="410" /> a price which is worthwhile and profitable.</P>
    <P>We have this approach and we will continue to impress on the people involved the need to avail of the moneys that are there for exploratory fishing and for the restructuring of our fleet.  We have met with modest success in the industry due to the efforts of the people involved in the industry.  Last year, for the first time, we had a very successful fishery opened in the Porcupine.  Prawns were caught there by the Rossaveal fleet.  At the moment, there is a new fishery in the north-west for hake for which there is a very good market on the Spanish fresh fish market.  These are two species which are new to us and in which progress is being made and hopefully it will be developed further.</P>
    <P>There is another area to which I would like to refer.  There is no way I can deal with all of the issues raised.  In relation to the herring issue, I think it was Deputy &ldquo;The Cope&rdquo; Gallagher who mentioned the EEC tax on quotas and questioned the accuracy of scientific data and figures produced.  We are depending on international scientific people, known as ICES, for the production of scientific data.  We are now told that the herring fishery in the Celtic Sea is in much better shape, stock-wise, than was thought earlier this year.  Consequently, we will be expecting an increase in our herring stock.  There is no point in getting an increase in stock unless one can sell that fish at the end of the day.  At our request, the Commission is examining the state of the herring market.  We have been involved in this and we hope to inquire much further to see if, through the Commission, we can make some progress on improving the herring market.  I am hoping we will be able to get an increased quota in the Celtic Sea.  If we do that and at the same time do something to improve the market, it will be of some benefit to the herring fishermen in the area.</P>
    <P>The other point raised, concerning the export refunds paid by the EEC, is something we can take up again in the light of, as Deputy Gallagher said, the circumstances which now confront the mackerel position in this country where there is <Col N="411" /> stock-piling and our storage capacity taken up.  We can definitely, because of the changed circumstances, approach them again on that issue.  I am making no promises except that I will take it up with them.</P>
    <P>The area of boat repayments is a big problem.  There is no instant or ideal solution that will satisfy everybody.  Figures are bandied about by fishermen and by their representatives and 83 per cent, 87 per cent, 89 per cent and arrears of up to 100 per cent are quoted in some categories. That is correct when one looks at the normal definition of arrears.  A skipper can be in arrears for six months on paper but, because of the seasonality of the fishing industry, with most species at least, he may in fact be waiting until the cow calves as it were before taking in his harvest.</P>
    <P>I was looking at a breakdown of this. While it looks pretty grim in the totality, looking at absolute percentages one finds in the biggest category of arrears on paper the average per head which is owned is very small.  That is not to say that we do not have a problem.  There are some categories where the indebtedness is big and where the capacity to repay is not great.  We are looking at ways and means to try to come to grips with this, which I regard as a serious problem.  BIM and ourselves have been talking about this. We are concerned about it and we will do our best to reach a solution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="412" /> I should like to mention the salmon position for the current season.  There was always the 12-mile limit prohibition which was not adhered to.  We are now in the position that there is an international convention to which we are signatories. We are depending on other people to adhere to it.  It is important for us, for the sake of the stock in the North Atlantic, and for our part of that stock. If Canada, the Azores and other places keep their side of it more salmon could be released to us.  It is an international prohibition but it has not been complied with or adhered to or indeed known to be there.</P>
