    <Title>Dairy Produce (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Amendment) Bill, 1984: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I dislike the move afoot in the EEC to squeeze the small man out of agriculture.  Big co-operatives are getting bigger.  Farmers in general are losing contact with their co-ops.  The farmer is now a number between one and 5,000. His name is in a computer and he does not get the attention he deserves from the co-ops.  Is this what Horace Plunkett envisaged for Irish agriculture?  This is the age of the combine, the multiplier and the huge co-op.  The small farmer in rural Ireland made his contribution to the development of our agricultural policy down through the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see more help given to the farmer who is in difficulties.  It is well known that many of our young farmers got into difficulties because they borrowed money to develop their farms and make them viable units.  They borrowed money at excessive interest rates to enlarge their acreage.  I should also like to see co-operation from the farmers who are in difficulties.  All the blame cannot be put on the lending associations.  If a farmer does not do his best to repay the money he borrows, he is falling down on his contract.  Any farmer who is seen to be doing his best should be given a chance <Col N="2560" /> by the lending associations and not sold out.</P>
    <P>Ten years ago, and even five years ago, the banks were offering Irish farmers colossal amounts of money.  There was no limitation when it came to buying land.  At that time the price of land was escalating.  Land was making £5,000 and £6,000 per acre in my own constituency of Cork South-West and in the fertile plains of Limerick and the midlands it was making more.  At the same time, good agricultural land could be bought 40 miles south of London for £1,500 per acre.  Was the English farmer daft, or had the Irish farmer no recognition of the value of land?  The banks contributed in no small way to the problem.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Farmers were told by bank managers that they would be given plenty of money.  This meant that farmers were bidding against farmers.  The banks and lending institutions who encouraged Irish farmers to borrow that money should show a bit of tolerance so far as the repayments are concerned.  The majority of farmers who are in financial difficulties are doing their best.  Very few of them are shunning their responsibilities. No nation of our size can achieve significant economic expansion without a great, sustained effort which must embrace all elements of the national community. There is not and never will be any guarantee of success.  Success is something we must deserve by virtue of our whole-hearted dedication to ensuring that our major industry, agriculture, will continue to play its part in the economy in the next decade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have said relates to the future of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>In a very general sort of way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2561" />
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the three million people in Ireland one million are gainfully employed and of those over 520,000 are employed in agriculture.  In an industry which has the capability for expansion it should be made attractive for farmers to continue on the road to prosperity. The contribution of our farmers to the mountain of dairy produce is only a drop in the ocean.  For years the Irish dairy farmer was curtailed in his production because he did not get the State help which was obtained by other European farmers.  The German cow and the Danish cow are producing 1,000 to 1,100 gallons of milk while in Ireland the national average is about 700 gallons.  It would mean millions of pounds to Irish agriculture if we could step up production to the level of our European counterparts.</P>
      <P>I know that the Minister for Agriculture will do his best when talks are resumed on the threatened super-levy to emphasise to the Germans, the Dutch and the French the necessity to give Irish farmers a breathing space until such time as we achieve the same rate of output as European farmers.</P>
      <P>It costs £15,000 to create one new job in industry outside agriculture but to keep a man from leaving agriculture costs only about £500.  More attention should be given to agriculture.  Directly and indirectly agriculture employs roughly 40 per cent of our total labour force.  It provides 35 per cent of gross exports and almost 50 per cent of net exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt but the Chair would wish that Deputies would confine their remarks to the dairy sector of agriculture.  If they do that, the Chair will be generous with them.  To have a debate on all sectors of agriculture is not in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Over 90 per cent of our farmland is under pasture and the majority of that land is devoted to milk production. I am a firm believer in diversifying to other products with a milk base. I agree that there is a vast potential for different utilisations of milk.  The Germans, the Dutch and the Danes are selling products in our supermarkets such as <Col N="2562" /> cheese with onion, cheese with ham, cheese with chives, cheese with peppers, cheese with crab, cheese with lobster and, cheese with smoked salmon.  This is a method of utilising the surplus of dairy products.  These are types of cheese which we could produce equally well.  We must divert our attention from direct butter production to products such as I have mentioned.  If the Germans and the Danes can do it successfully, surely Irish farmers can do so.</P>
      <P>Assistance must be given to dairy farmers. The dairy farmer is one of the hardest working individuals.  He must milk his cows twice a day for seven days a week. There is no five-day week for him.</P>

      <P>Deputy Haughey, when Minister for Agriculture, left the farmers in the frost and snow in Merrion Street and walked over their bodies every morning when going to his office.  We in Fine Gael have always shown an interest in Irish farmers and in dairy producers.  As long as the Minister for Agriculture is from the Fine Gael Party the farming community will never be forgotten.  The small farmer in the west has contributed his share to the success of the dairy industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The court made the decision.  What I am saying may not be too palatable to my friends opposite but while I am a Member of Dáil Eireann I will fight tooth and nail to ensure that the small man gets his fair share.  I was not born with a silver spoon but on a small 30-acre mountain farm in south-west Cork.  I know what it is to take the milk to the creamery every morning.  For 25 years I collected the milk from ten farmers and took it with my own milk to the creamery.  I know what it is to make a living on a small mountain farm.  Milk production is the main plank of the agriculture industry.</P>
      <P>As I said last night, I would much prefer to see our GAA clubs and our golf clubs having milk bars available in their pavilions and club rooms.  This would be preferable to having lounge bars installed in these clubs.  It has been proved that milk is vary valuable as far as building up athletes is concerned.  A great quantity of milk could be sold in those clubs if it got the backing of everybody in the House. I congratulate the National Dairy Council for their initiative in promoting the use of milk.  This was a good public relations job.  We need something like that.  I was amazed at the remark made about Tony O'Reilly from across the floor of the House yesterday evening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind my friends on the other side of the House that we did not contribute much to that huge butter or milk mountains.  Our contribution is only like a drop in the ocean. It is a well known fact that farmers from Germany, Holland and Denmark who have the opportunity of getting cheap soya bean meal and cheap concentrates to feed their cattle during the winter have contributed to the butter and milk mountains. We have a traditional pattern of producing milk which does not contribute in any great way to the butter mountain. I realise that we have increased our milk <Col N="2565" /> production considerably in the last decade but even when that is taken into consideration it still does not go within a fraction of the percentage increase the European farmers have made.</P>
      <P>The threat of tuberculosis has been a serious impediment to our dairy production. During the past 20 years this disease has robbed many farmers of fine dairy herds.  We must bear such factors in mind.  Many of our dairy farmers have gone through very bad times because their milk stock has been diminished through TB.  I suggest that, if possible, help should be given to any dairy farmers who have suffered because of this.  It is essential that the herds of every dairy farmer be brought up to peak production as far as milk yields are concerned.  Some people may argue that that is not the correct policy but I believe that our dairy farmers are entitled to the same treatment as their European counterparts. They should be put on the same pedestal as their European counterparts.</P>
      <P>We have the most natural and the finest climate in the world for dairy production. If we were ten or 15 degrees further south we could get our share of the income which can be obtained from the production of wines and tobacco.  This would be of great benefit to our economy but we have a climate which is best suitable, outside of New Zealand, for dairy production.  It is essential that we do everything possible to ensure that our farmers are given the chance to bring their production up to the same rate as their European counterparts.</P>
      <P>Dairying is damaged by excessive imports from other countries like New Zealand.  Even though New Zealand by her sovereign right enjoys preferential treatment in relation to our nearest neighbour, I believe the time has come, when cuts have to be made in dairy production within the EEC, to curtail the export of dairy products from New Zealand to Great Britain.</P>

      <P>Our milch cows do not produce as much milk as the European cows do and there is room for improvement in the breeding and yields of our dairy herds.  I was very pleased to hear that our Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes has continued the subsidy for artificial insemination to improve cattle breeding.  In the second last budget, which was produced by my friends across the floor, they took out the subsidy on artificial insemination.  Wisely we reintroduced it.  That was a step in the right direction.  Also we have retained the ground limestone subsidy which plays its role in improving the soil content of our dairy pastures.</P>
      <P>Milk production is three and a half times more important to this country than it is to the latest arrival to the EEC, Greece.  It is four times more important to the Irish economy than Danish milk is to the Danish economy.  It is six and a half times more important to Ireland than to all the other milk-producing countries in the EEC.  Therefore, if we are to survive it is essential that our dairy and milk products be given a chance to expand and to come up to the level of those of our European counterparts.  That is the policy embraced by our Minister and he will do his best to achieve it when he goes to the next Summit meeting.</P>
      <P>In conclusion I make an all-out appeal to my friends across the floor to rally behind our Minister for Agriculture to ensure that he gets our rightful share of the European cake for our dairy farmers. With that spirit, determination and co-operation from everybody in this House I have no doubt that he will be victorious in those talks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill provides for the continuance of a guarantee.  Seldom do we have a Bill before this House that is not looking for a fairly hefty subvention. This is one such instance.  The Minister in his speech stated, and I quote from the Official Report of 8 February 1984, column 2022, volume 347:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No claims have ever been made <Col N="2568" /> under the State guarantee and no question of expenditure by the Exchequer has arisen up to now; neither is any such claim likely to arise in the future. The present Bill, therefore, affords the House a timely opportunity to demonstrate our confidence both in An Bord Bainne and in the future success of Irish dairying.</P>
    <P>Certainly we have reason to compliment An Bord Bainne on the work they have done.  We all want success for Irish dairying. In that speech the Minister made it clear for the first time that the alternative to the milk super-levy would be a direct price cut which would amount to approximately 10p per gallon.  Further on in the speech the Minister said that the Greek Presidency last autumn advocated that the milk super-levy proposal was for a period of four years with a review at the end of that time.  He went on:</P>
    <P>In other words, if the super-levy proposal were to come in and to bite &mdash; as I think it will &mdash;...</P>
    <P>This is an admission that we will have either the levy or a reduced price for milk.  Is the Minister now examining the whole situation of the dairy industry on that basis of a super-levy being introduced or a reduction in the price of milk which might well mean a further reduction? If money is tight in the EEC such a provision for the reduction of 10p today might mean a further reduction of about 5p in, say, three months.</P>
    <P>We must have a realistic, in-depth look at the situation.  There is no need to elaborate on it.  Dairying is the backbone of agriculture as we have developed it over the years.  We forgot about other aspects of farming, as I have maintained for the last ten years as one involved for a lifetime in service to agriculture.  Perhaps we were right in the past, but I would like to refer to a McKinsey study which was commissioned by the Bank of Ireland and issued in 1977, seven years ago, and perhaps I can indicate how things can be seen out of perspective.  That report contained an in-depth study on agriculture, its general development and the benefits to be derived not alone from the products <Col N="2569" /> but also from the by-products and added value products.  The first chapter deals with adapting the dairy sector to changing demands.  The report stated, in regard to adapting the dairy sector to changing demands, that this growth in milk production in Ireland reflects a gradual shift in the pattern of European dairy farming that has been taking place for some time, away from high cost producers such as Germany, towards low cost countries around the periphery.  Many of the agricultural projections were based on that, that we would be the dairy producers and that the Germans, the Dutch and the Danes would not be working seven days per week and would leave it to the Irish and the Italians.  It was on that misconception that we based our future projections.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look at this and examine how the levy, and the other alternative he mentioned, will affect the 100,000 gallon-plus supplier in Leinster and Munster.  The 10,000 gallon-plus supplier in the west and Cavan-Monaghan, the constituency which I represent, will be worst hit by either of the measures mentioned.  Almost 50 per cent of Irish farmers get their main source of income from dairying but in Cavan-Monaghan, 70 per cent of farmers depend on dairying.  In fact, 73 per cent of farmers in that area last year depended on dairying as their main source of income. The Minister must take those statistics into consideration.  I suggest that he visit those areas where dairy herds produce 10,000 to 20,000 gallons of milk annually.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should cover the two counties and discuss the problem with the management of the co-ops.  He should call to the co-ops including Killeshandra, Bailieboro, town of Monaghan and Lough Egish and he should consider calling to a number of <Col N="2570" /> the small co-ops.  In north Monaghan we have two independent auxiliary co-ops that are managing to survive in the midst of stern competition although they take in a small amount of milk.  Those independent co-ops provide the full range of services to local farmers.  Other groups serving the area include Virginia Milk Products Ltd. and a number of milk processing plants that do not operate as creameries. In the course of his visit to that area the Minister will have to examine all the relevant information presented to him so as to ensure that at the end of the day he will be able to put forward a policy to safeguard small suppliers who are totally dependent on milk because of the type of land they have and the size of their farms.  Such farmers are unable to branch out into grain or beef production, and milk and cattle production are their only two outlets.  We are all aware that the return on cattle production is not great on small holdings of 50 or 60 acres. Following this investigation the Minister will have to consider tier and other systems to ensure that the first 20,000 gallons of milk is not caught in the embargo or subject to the super-levy.</P>
      <P>We have heard a lot about factory-type farming on the Continent which is creating many problems here.  Under the CAP the Danes, the Germans, and others carry on factory-type farming rearing up to 3,000 cows on imported cereals.  Those animals never see the light of day.  It is very difficult, if not impossible, for our small farmers to compete against those people.  We must also contend with the weather.  The report on Border regions issued yesterday stated the County Leitrim had 77 dry days annually compared to four times that number in continental countries.  Our milk production accounts for only 4½ per cent of the EEC total and that is an indication of the unfair competition our farmers face.  In my view it is contrary to the Treaty of Rome.  We were to have a system that ensured that areas on the periphery of the Community would be helped.  As time progresses we will find that the bigger farming projects will get greater to the detriment of those living on smallholdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to production of milk Ireland <Col N="2571" /> accounts for about 4 per cent of the EEC total; France, 24 per cent; Germany, 23 per cent and Great Britain, 15 per cent. That is a clear indication of the injustice being done to our farmers.  Admittedly, we were slow at the start and we had to start at a low base.  We did not make very much use of our first ten years in the EEC.  Our co-ops and milk processing plants are working under capacity now. In May and June they deal with a high volume of milk but there is little production in winter months.  Prior to our entry into the EEC when our cattle population was in the region of seven million we were told that in a short number of years it would increase to eight million and, eventually, rise to ten million.  We have moved up and down from that target.  In spite of all the incentives available we have not had a big increase in cattle numbers.</P>
    <P>The McKinsey study of 1977 took an in-depth look at production, marketing and the opportunities for development of dairying, beef production, pork, tillage and vegetable growing.  The emphasis was on the downstream manufacturer. Recently on looking at the report I noticed that in 1977 I remarked that if the suggestions in it were implemented we would be a lot better off.  There was reference to animal by-products such as hides.  The report outlined the number of jobs that could be provided in the leather industry.  At that time 45 per cent of hides were being exported and the report suggested that this should change with the development of the tannery industry.</P>
    <P>I had a parliamentary question yesterday about the percentage of our hides being exported and I was told it was 96. In other words, we are processing only 4 per cent of our hides at home.  In reply to another question I was told that £40 million worth of farm machinery is being imported at a time when we are capable of making all our machinery at home and indeed when we could be exporting £8 million worth.  If the McKinsey Report had been implemented in full we would have saved private enterprise.</P>
    <P>There are many milk by-products we could be making and I suggest that the <Col N="2572" /> time has come to move away completely from butter production.  We should be diversifying.  I can give an example of our concentration on butter making.  During a by-election campaign in Cork not so long ago I asked for cheese and I was told by the hotel waiter that it was not on the menu.  I was in the heart of the dairying industry, yet I could not get cheese.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Deputy ask for lobster cheese or crab cheese?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not know they were putting lobsters and crabs into cheese.  I thought on that occasion how badly we were missing the boat.  We should be diversifying to cheese and other by-products.  It is well known that 85 per cent of our milk is being concentrated on butter making and the manufacture of such things as chocolate crumb, and a recent IDA report on food production indicated that that percentage could be reduced to 65 by 1990.  If we could do that quickly there would be no need to fear the super-levy.  In 1980 only 17 per cent of our milk was utilised for products other than butter and chocolate crumb making whereas that could be increased to 35 per cent.  That would put the dairying industry into a much more favourable position.</P>
      <P>The Department will have to look seriously and quickly at this.  They should not be waiting for work study reports or such things.  They should immediately consider alternative uses for milk.  The creamery in Monaghan diversified and they are having a fair amount of success. There has been a vast increase in imports of milk by-products.  We could be making desserts and yoghurt.  These commodities accounted for 9 per cent of our imports in the past 12 months.  If we have any commodity imports accounting for 9 per cent of total imports we need to have an immediate look at the situation so that we can correct it.  If we tackled it properly, this area would produce perhaps not thousands of jobs at the beginning but hundreds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Monaghan Town Co-operative who recently invested £5 million and were grant aided by FEOGA <Col N="2573" /> and the IDA.  They have built up a partnership with a Dutch co-op with whom they have a franchise.  They believe there is also a fair opportunity for cross-Border trade.  They are able to pay a premium price for the quality milk they use.  There should be quality control in all co-ops and customers should be penalised for high residue content in milk.  I was among ten who saw the growth of the Monaghan co-op which is now one of the best in the country.  We put much hard work into it and built up a good work force under good management.  We had good labour relations and a good relationship with suppliers, committees and the farmers.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, we will have to reduce our dependence on butter and in that way we will lose our dependence on intervention. Though it can be good to have intervention, it has its drawbacks because if you have the easy way out you will go on dumping loads of produce into cold stores and will not have to worry about sales. That is one of the drawbacks of the intervention system.</P>
    <P>The sale of New Zealand butter to England has caused great conflict.  It is very hard to understand the thinking behind it.  It is time for all the Agriculture Ministers in the EEC to come together and clarify the position.  The October 1982 Community report stated that the Council of Ministers had not been able to agree to a European Commission proposal that New Zealand be allowed to export 89,000 tonnes of butter to the UK the following year.  There was a proposal to reduce that by 1,000 tonnes.  New Zealand had reservations about that proposal. It was feared it would establish lower initial thresholds for future negotiations. I fail to understand this.</P>
    <P>I understood the importation of the butter into Britain was for a certain period.  The report also stated that despite the fact that conditions for New Zealand butter entry into the market were negotiated at the time of the first enlargement of the Community in the context of temporary and transitional arrangements, at the end of 1982 New Zealand would have enjoyed ten transitional years on the UK market.  I do not understand how they can increase the <Col N="2574" /> volume of their imports.  I do not expect that trade agreements would be demolished overnight but there could be a 10 or 20 per cent reduction in the amount of produce they were allowed to bring on to the British market.  A close look must be taken at this.  It is happening at a time when there is talk of super-levies and cutbacks on production.  These measures are causing conflict between members of the EEC.</P>
    <P>As regards our manufacturing capacity we rely very much on grass for milk production. The peak to through ratio is 14:1. The only way co-operatives can be successful is to ensure that they have milk all the year round.  They should pay a premium.  The co-ops which are involved in liquid milk must pay the premium but if the others did this they would ensure a supply of fresh milk.  The ratio could be reduced to 7:1.  Our competitors have milk all the year round.  We must use better quality feed and good quality silage. Most feeds are very expensive and this is one of the problems we have.  We are at a severe disadvantage in this.  Our neighbours have low priced cereal substitutes.</P>
    <P>We do not utilise the processing capacity of the co-ops to the full.  In May or June they are at 100 per cent capacity but that falls to about 5 per cent in December and the average is 40 per cent.  It is hard to expect anyone with machinery and equipment to work at 40 per cent capacity. We do not use our equipment to the full.  The equipment in the dairy and processing plants which have been set up is among the most modern in Europe.  I visited the Mona yoghurt factory in Monaghan some weeks ago and they certainly deserve to have a continuous supply of produce to process there.  The food processing industry has been very slow to develop.</P>
    <P>We are in much the same position as regards beef.  We do not have the same amount of beef in the winter as we have in the summer to ensure continuity of supply for meat plants.  If we had a strong beef industry there would be a continuous demand for calves and we would get good prices for them.  The Minister should examine the possibility of all year <Col N="2575" /> round production in milk and beef.  Substantial sums of money were allocated for the calf to beef scheme under the western aid package.  Most of the farmers interested in partaking in this scheme as a sideline were in milk production already and so were debarred from availing of the grant aid.  That was a pity.  We must ensure we have a market for our calves and a continuous supply of animals for slaughter.  A McKinsey study dealt with every aspect of this.  They outlined their proposals not only for beef but for hides, blood and offal.  There is a great opportunity to progress in this area.</P>
    <P>As regards section 84 loans, I noted the comments of the CII on 9 February. They stated that the decision to remove section 84 loan facilities from manufacturing industry could have negative consequences where the facilities reduced interest rates from 4.5 per cent to bring them into line with the rest of Europe. This provision has helped hundreds of companies to remain in operation and to implement expansion plans.  In an agriculture-based industry such as a dairy co-operative the ban is estimated to result in a decrease in milk prices and in the prices of grain and so on to the producer. Therefore, I urge the Minister to give serious consideration to this proposal before introducing the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I had a question relating to cattle numbers and I note from the reply that at 1 June 1983 our cattle population was still below the seven million mark that was reached at one stage.  This is very disappointing.  The reply to the question indicates that in 1983 the estimated number of cattle in the country was 6,771,100 while at 1 June 1982 the corresponding figure was 6,688,300.  The increase is minimal despite the calved heifer scheme, calf premiums and so on. It is regrettable that we are not increasing our cattle numbers.  Perhaps a more important matter is that of increased milk yields, but we have had some improvement in that area though the average yield per cow is still very much below the 1,000-plus average for the Dutch and the Germans or of the 964-gallon average in Britain.  That, then, is an area to which <Col N="2576" /> we must pay greater attention if we are to ensure the required development of agriculture.</P>
    <P>Seven years ago there were 9,000 workers in the dairy industry while the estimated current figure is 11,000.  The corresponding figures for workers in the meat plants are 5,000 and 6,000 respectively. That is a yardstick by which we might examine the benefits to the community, where in a period of seven years the increase has been only marginal in terms of employment in the agricultural industry, an industry that should be in a position to take up the slack in manufacturing concerns who have faced such tough competition and who consequently have gone out of business.  An increase of only 3,000 people in the work force in the agricultural sector is not at all adequate. If we were to take account of the situation in the food-processing industry, the Sugar Company, and so on, we would find that there is a minus situation, perhaps a drop of 300 to 400 workers in the last number of years.  This is an indictment of us at a time when we are exporting cattle live and when, even if we kill the cattle here, we export the hides without processing them.  Far too much of our beef is exported on the hoof while the supermarkets are bringing in each week dozens of container loads of prepared foods, be it pork- beef- bacon- or milk-based.</P>
    <P>In the past year, in terms of yoghurts and other dairy products, our imports have totalled £14 million.  As exporters we cannot complain too much about imports to the country but we should ensure that we are in a position to meet the market requirements in every possible instance.</P>
    <P>I have asked that the House be given an opportunity of discussing the report of the Economic and Social Committee of the Community on their visit to this country during the summer.  Quite a number of those on the committee are from Ireland.  They include Mr. Thomas Roseingrave, former President of Muintir na Tíre, and Mr. Patrick Murphy, representing the trade unions.  The committee visited the entire Border region, North and South, and produced a report <Col N="2577" /> with the recommendation that £125 million should be spent on the area.  This is the first positive suggestion for this area and the committee outline in detail how the money should be spent.  They recommend that it be spent on land improvement, road structure, arterial drainage, tourism and so on.  They suggest that there should be set up pilot farms on creamery milk, beef and hill-sheep production and they have proposed, as envisaged by the southern representatives, the designation of up to eight pilot farms in the Border area &mdash; three for dairying, three for beef and two for hill sheep. They say that this is basically a low-cost approach under which the designated farmer-owner would be responsible for the enterprise with instructors from the agricultural advisory service being involved on a part-time basis and with the contracts varying from six to ten years, depending on the enterprise.  They suggest that the cost be limited to a yearly allowance to the farmers of two million units of account for his providing demonstrations on his farm and that there be an allowance of five million units of account to cover 25 per cent of the salaries of the instructors from the advisory services.  There would be a different rate in the case of hill sheep units.</P>
    <P>Having received the report only yesterday I have not had time to study it in detail but it seems to me that such pilot schemes would be very useful, both in terms of information and of education, for people on both sides of the Border, an area in which there are some very good farmers working what is probably some of the worst land in the country. Indeed, at one of the meetings held in Monaghan the committee agreed that parts of that area are among the most severely handicapped within the Ten.  It was mentioned at that meeting that there would be some overlapping as between both sides of the Border in respect of artificial insemination and so on but a far more efficient service could be provided.</P>
    <P>The Government must do everything possible to ensure the successful outcome of the proposed super-levy negotiations. We must not allow anything to happen that would hinder the development of <Col N="2578" /> our dairy industry.  In recent days we have had a clearer indication of the Minister's thinking on the whole matter than has been the case up to now.  It was that lack of information that caused so much annoyance and frustration.  The Minister must have regard to the way in which any proposal put forward would effect the various regions to ensure that they will come up with the proposal that will do the least damage to the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to place on record my appreciation of the tremendous work of An Bord Bainne since it became a farmer-owned co-operative in 1972.  The fact that it has operated since then within the limitation of generating its own resources is most commendable.  At various stages the State guaranteed funding. It began in 1972 with assets of between £2,500,000 to £3 million but that was insufficient and it had to borrow.  Were it not for the influence, expertise and ability of a central marketing agency such as An Bord Bainne the whole dairying industry would not have developed to the extent it has developed in the past ten years.  We are still far behind our trading partners in the EEC but An Bord Bainne must be commended.  The other State agencies who are also involved in the marketing of Irish products are to be commended.  I speak in particular of the CBF who are dealing with a vitally important aspect of Irish agriculture.</P>
      <P>The extension of the guarantee scheme for a further six years is something all Members will support.  We never seriously thought about marketing of our products until it became obvious that unless we could present a saleable product there would not be a market for it. The difficulties confronting the dairying industry at present are a matter of concern not only to farmers but to the economy generally.  Much has been said about that in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to draw attention to the influence of possibly one of the largest dairy co-operatives in the country which is in my constituency and to give some idea of the scale of growth of that co-operative since it was founded some years ago.  In 1982 the intake was 128 million <Col N="2579" /> gallons of milk, a significant increase on the 1981 figure.  If we were to apply a super-levy on the 1981 figure it would be totally unacceptable.  It is about time the EEC considered the possibility of a super-levy having regard to the very high level of production in European countries but Ireland must be exempt from that super-levy because of our low level of productivity.  In 1982 there was an increase of 13 per cent on 1981 in respect of milk intake in the Avonmore area and in the two years 1981 and 1982 there was a cumulative increase of 14 per cent.  That was a significant increase.  Perhaps the Greek proposal that would take account of milk production at 1983 levels is an advance but it falls far short of what is acceptable on the Irish scene.</P>
    <P>We had a further difficulty in relation to milk production in Ireland.  This is true not only of Avonmore but also of the rest of the country and is true to a lesser extent in respect of Europe.  In 1982 there was a ratio of 14 to one in respect of valley periods of milk production in the Avonmore area: in other words, in the period May-June, the high peak period, farmers got 14 pints more than they got in the January period and naturally this created enormous problems.  As a result of re-organisation and the maintaining of higher price levels during the winter period that ratio was reduced to six-and-a-half to one.  On the other hand, Holland is able to maintain a milk production average almost the same throughout the year and that is a marked improvement on what we have achieved.</P>
    <P>In the Avonmore area they take in an average of 350,000 gallons of milk each day and in mid-May in 1982 that had increased to 650,000 gallons per day. Avonmore claims to account for 12½ per cent of national output.  The value of the performance at Avonmore and the investment by farmers in that enterprise is seen in the total value of milk which was approximately £90 million in 1982. Of that amount £15 million goes back in wages and salaries and any attempt to undermine that progress would have a disastrous effect not only on the region but also on the State.  That indicates the <Col N="2580" /> importance of a favourable solution to the super-levy problem so far as we are concerned.</P>
    <P>Of the £15 million going back on wages, approximately £7 million goes directly into Government coffers in PRSI and in direct taxes.  Much more goes back in indirect taxes because of the level of VAT on inputs by farmers.  The State will benefit to an enormous degree by any further increase in milk products.  The firm in Avonmore can cope with a further 15 per cent increase in the next two years without extending the plant.  In 1982 Avonmore was one of the top ten businesses in the country and that is some indication of the growth in a number of our co-operatives.  I draw attention to Avonmore because I am familiar with the situation there.  Some 60 per cent of the business of that organisation is concerned with milk.</P>
    <P>Co-operatives were designed originally to help farmers to utilise their resources, to provide them with investment capital they might not have been able to acquire elsewhere.  Perhaps co-operatives are moving slightly away from that original concept and one cannot blame them for doing so because they had to borrow money at high interest rates.  We do not have available money at low interest for the development of our dairying industry. We have a unique position <i>vis-à-vis</i> our trading partners and we have difficulties in transporting our products to the major European markets.  I give the example of Holland which is the size of Munster and which has a level of milk production that provides liquid milk or the various processed forms for a population of about 15 million people while we provide for a population for approximately three million.  We are producing only about 4 per cent of the overall EEC milk production, yet we are experiencing serious problems.</P>
    <P>Since we joined the EEC a number of our farmers have made profits from milk production.  There are various risks involved in this industry because there is a high level of disease associated with the production of milk, either through tuberculosis or brucellosis.  Happily we have <Col N="2581" /> made significant progress in the elimination of brucellosis but the tuberculosis problem keeps cropping up in unexpected areas and it is difficult to explain why this happens.</P>
    <P>Our milk production will increase and we must make the necessary provisions to market the increased production.  This is where An Bord Bainne have an enormous task ahead of them.  Because there is a growing surplus of milk and milk products, one can only assume that a super-levy will be imposed by the EEC but we did not create the problem and it would be extremely unfair and unjust if this levy was imposed on our farmers. The only EEC country favourable to Ireland is Greece, a relatively new member. There are eight other nationally minded countries in the EEC and unless they go back to the original concept of the Common Market there is a serious danger that the Common Market will fragment and become totally disrupted. That would have serious effects for Ireland because we have benefited from membership in the agricultural and industrial areas.</P>
    <P>Let us compare our figures with those of Holland.  I chose Holland because she is one of the major factory milk producing countries.  Holland imports cheap cereal substitutes while using the mechanism of the EEC to her own advantage.  We get about 700 gallons per cow, and Holland gets in excess of 1,100 gallons, and is increasing.  In Ireland we feed about half a tonne of meal per cow, in Holland they feed 2½ tonnes per cow.  That cheap food is being imported and converted into milk.  The EEC has seriously to examine this development.  While we object to this situation, at the same time it must be recognised that a super-levy is definitely needed to deal with this high level of productivity.  Perhaps the cereal substitutes could be devoted to some other type of production.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the surpluses in the EEC which have developed because of the central marketing and intervention systems. A great deal of energy is used storing that food while many millions of people are dying of starvation every day.  One wonders if there is any Christianity left in <Col N="2582" /> western Europe.  Have we adopted a purely economic survival attitude?  There must be some way to dispose of these products.  We have to assist Third World countries.  We have to buy some of their products because only by doing this can we help them develop.  If the United States were to unload her surpluses on Europe we would be engulfed in dairy products and it would take us years to recover from the recession such a move would create.  It is awful to think that the present situation should have developed.</P>
    <P>A number of people mentioned diversification. Liquid milk, cheese, butter and skimmed milk powder appear to be the main profitable products.  We do not seem to have researched other areas.  In my view we will have to examine very carefully and invest significantly in those areas, otherwise there will not be a market for the extra milk produced.  That cannot be done on a national scale only; it must be co-ordinated on a European or universal level.  There is no point in one country doing this if others ignore the rules and regulations.</P>
    <P>In the Avonmore area cheese production is a loss-making enterprise.  A greater level of milk can be utilised in the manufacture of cheese.  A previous speaker mentioned that he asked for cheese in a certain hotel in west Cork and Deputy Sheehan mentioned crab and lobster cheeses.  I have not gone into this question in such great detail as those Deputies, but it was interesting to hear that there are so many ways of presenting this product.  When one walks around a supermarket in Waterford, Kilkenny or Dublin one can see the number of foreign cheeses available.  The answer lies in diversification. We have seriously to examine agricultural imports and try to devise ways and means to counteract the present situation.  This can only be done successfully if we pay attention to presentation, quality and competitiveness.  We cannot stop the flow or we will undermine the Common Market.  Bord Bainne, irrespective of where they get the funding, should ensure that every county contributes equally towards the diversification of milk and milk products.  Admittedly this would be very desirable and it would <Col N="2583" /> be extremely difficult to achieve but the enormity of the problem should not deter us from attempting it.</P>
    <P>The EEC subsidise milk for schools.  I do not know how much milk these pupils drink but I believe it is a sizeable amount. I know of a few national schools I visit around 11 o'clock in the morning where there are to be seen creates of small bottles of milk all over the place, some half drunk and so on.  We have entered into a new dimension in milk processing through yogurt.  Most children introduced to yogurt seem to like it; it has a special flavour.  It is different from drinking milk and I think they should be given an option between the two, that there should be a crate of yogurt available for those who would prefer it.  The idea may not necessarily be to dispose of the milk &mdash; although perhaps that was at the back of the minds of those who promoted the scheme &mdash; but it should be remembered that it is important also from a food protein point of view.  We should examine that aspect.</P>
    <P>I do not know what is the level of milk in, say, Bailey's Cream.  I suppose if alcohol could be added to milk there would be a tremendous market for it and it would be sold in most of our ale houses if we could blend it in such a way and produce it at a certain price.  It has been done successfully both by Avonmore and Waterford Co-op.  Bailey's Cream is an extremely palatable drink.  Perhaps there has been insufficient investment in that area.  Undoubtedly there is need for a marketing fund in order to get rid of much of the surplus of dairy produce.</P>
    <P>Another area to which I have given consideration is that of milk/butter products.  Recently we heard a lot about the increase in cholesterol in the human system from an intake of butter.  But there has been much variation of opinion as to what does or does not cause heart disease, what does or does not increase cholestorol levels.  There have been many books written on the subject, some contending that one should not eat potatoes or butter while others contradict that theory, which is having a definite effect on the marketing and consumption of butter <Col N="2584" /> especially on the home market.  There are a lot of polysaturates on supermarket shelves manufactured in Third World countries.  They are on the increase to the detriment of the sale of butter.  Surely there should be some attempt made to extract fats from butter, presenting it in a different way so that at least we would be consuming a product we manufacture ourselves.</P>
    <P>There was a great scare created recently about antibiotic residue in milk which gave rise to an almost immediate 12 per cent reduction in sales of milk to urban areas from the Avonmore Creamery. That scare was initiated at a certain seminar.  I do not think it was properly researched on a national scale.  Perhaps there are cowboys who would over-use antibiotics, disposing of them into various milk outlets.  But there is very accurate, day-to-day monitoring of the level of antibiotic residues in milk coming into the Avonmore area and if the milk is found to have a content of antibiotics over and above an acceptable level that milk is put aside.  Even in the manufacture of cheese it will show up.  The cheese will not ferment if it has a high level of antibiotic residue.  The people who create such scares should think about the damage done.  If there is found to be an abuse of the use of antibiotics, by all means it should be counteracted but we should be careful before creating such scares.  Indeed the question might well be posed: was the creation of such a scare an attempt to get a monopoly of the dispensing of antibiotics from the farming point of view pushing up the price so that people in a certain marketing agency would control its dispensing?  I am not sure.  Perhaps the Minister would have that matter investigated.  The whole area of milk is vital to our economy.</P>
    <P>I might reiterate my views with regard to a super-levy as far as Ireland is concerned and reassure the Minister of support for his approach which has been exceptionally eloquent, authoritative and useful as far as this nation is concerned. While some Members of the Opposition would like to think that the Minister's contribution to agriculture and to his portfolio is less that they would contribute <Col N="2585" /> in similar circumstances, I might remind them that his rating amongst the farming community is higher than it was during many of their Minister's terms in office.  It must be remembered that he is serving in a very difficult period.  He may well be faced with finding the most difficult solutions that have faced any Minister for Agriculture in the history of this State.  Nonetheless he is capable of the job and I extend him my full support.  I am confident that, when the final negotiations are over, he will have achieved for us that to which we are entitled. Indeed there is a measure of justice associated with our position.</P>
    <P>I said, and I did not develop the point, that we are in a unique position.  I should like to think that we would be given a subsidy for the export of our products to Europe where there are the major urban growth centres and all the milk producing areas adjacent to them.  But they do not have our problems.  Our exports must cross the most difficult section of the channel from Rosslare to Le Havre at difficult times of the year, which is extremely costly.  Therefore, we should be seeking a transport subsidy that might be utilised to lessen the impact of any attempt at imposing levies so far as milk productivity here is concerned.  Whether or not a derogation of four years would be to our total advantage is questionable &mdash; certainly it would be advantageous &mdash; but if it can be achieved that would be a significant step.  Nevertheless we should examine the levels of milk production and endeavour to equate them taking into account our unique geographic position. If the Common Market is to survive, if it is to advance the concepts on which it was founded originally &mdash; which were to help and support the less well-off nations &mdash; then surely we come into that category.  Under no circumstances can we accept a situation that would in any way diminish our level of profitability in agriculture.</P>
    <P>Another matter detrimental to the development of agriculture is the high level of prevailing irregular interest rates. In Germany, Holland and other European countries there are low interest rates obtaining.  We have introduced <Col N="2586" /> interest subsidies and rescue packages for our farmers who over-borrowed.  They have been successful to a point in that the Government of the day allowed the banks to control those interest rates.  But the banks have crucified farmers who borrowed, invested, on advice.  Interest rates have risen and certain farmers have been crucified as a result.  Even those whose farms are still viable are being discouraged and being asked to sell land. Surely we cannot tolerate that in the case of those who have always worked on the land and know no other way of life.  Some banks have been reasonable, but others unreasonable in their approach to farmers. There is a long-term investment in farming to the advantage of the economy. If a farm's viability is assured a subsidy should be given in the nature of low interest rates, having regard to the level of added value to be derived by the economy.</P>
    <P>Inflation has been a major bone of contention, but happily we are taking steps to reduce it.  Unless we can keep down the level of inflation, we cannot compete with our European neighbours.</P>
    <P>Last year, food imports amounted to £700 million to £800 million.  We have the CBF and Bord Bainne and we are now talking about a central potato marketing board, for which money has been provided in the current budget.  It is so vital that Bord Bainne adopt the correct approach, otherwise we cannot survive in the dairy area of agriculture.  The dairy industry is going through an extremely difficult period at present.  There will not be confidence in that industry until a favourable solution, or at least an indication towards that aim, is found.</P>
    <P>We are becoming too reliant on interventions. With all the surpluses and the cost to the taxpayers, whether to the European Fund or to the Common Agricultural Policy, the stage will be reached when that level of subsidisation cannot be maintained.  In the past, surpluses were reduced because of devastating wars, but I certainly do not wish that situation to arise again.</P>
    <P>There are jobs in agriculture, provided that the proper research is made.  However, there do not appear to be the numbers <Col N="2587" /> of jobs anticipated when we entered the Common Market.</P>
    <P>I applaud the efforts made by Bord Bainne to date.  Without their expertise, we would not have achieved the present productivity in the dairying industry. However, much more remains to be done.  I also applaud Bord Bainne because they are working within their own wealth growth.  They are not depending on the State, even though the State guarantees them.  They are able to operate within the growth of their own assets and borrow on that basis.  There is a long, difficult road ahead for the dairying industry and under no circumstances should we accept the super-levy.  If the Minister fights the EEC on that proposal, he will have the support of all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  Yesterday and this morning many Members spoke at length about the importance of the dairy industry to this country.  Bord Bainne, as the marketing agency for the industry, have over the last number of years played a very important role in the marketing of dairy produce.  Many speakers have emphasised the importance of this industry to the well-being of our economy and this is something which cannot be overstated. That industry can generate national wealth, create employment in the food processing end, the co-operatives and the ancillary industries.  The dairy industry has been of vital importance to the development of the economy generally.</P>
      <P>Our existing farm structure has a predominance of small holdings and with good and prudent management many farmers have managed to rear their families on relatively small holdings and have become involved in milk production prior to and since our entry into the EEC.  The farm family unit has been an integral part of milk production for many years now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This could well be an ideal opportunity to examine the evolution of the dairy industry generally since our entry into the Community.  At the time of entry, with hindsight, we may not have been in the right state of preparedness to take <Col N="2588" /> advantage of the opportunities presented to us by membership.  Those markets were then undoubtedly there but, unfortunately, for historical reasons Irish agriculture was not sufficiently viable to take full advantage of those opportunities.</P>
    <P>Agricultural development is a slow process.  It needs the availability of expertise, managerial skill and the necessary finance to get on with the job of development of farms, co-operatives and processing facilities.  When they realised the opportunities presented by the new market, many of our progressive farmers got on with the job of developing their holdings. Perhaps many started too late and found that they had to borrow too much at the one time.  When the farming industry moved into the present recessionary period which has been prevailing for some time now, the difficulties with repayments and the attendant problems dramatically increased.</P>
    <P>Since our entry into the Community, investment in farm development and in farm buildings has been very considerable. Significant employment opportunities have arisen as a result for the building and construction industry.  The small builder whose base was mainly in rural areas benefited greatly from the investment made by many farmers throughout the country.  The co-operative movement gave a very helpful and guiding hand to farmers and there have been many investments by the many fine co-operatives in existence.  Their role in the development of the dairy industry was essential.  The farmers were involved in the primary producing end and the co-operatives were involved in butter and cheese production and also in liquid milk.  They were essential to take the produce from farms and, through Bord Bainne and other agencies, to market them for our agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>The development of rural Ireland has been an integral part of agricultural development generally.  The small, medium and large holdings have worked together and have dovetailed with the commercial community in towns and villages throughout the country in a collective effort towards developing rural areas.  That development process really <Col N="2589" /> took off since our entry into the EEC with the money that flowed from increased production and from the increased prices available from the produce which made a very significant contribution to development.  I sincerely hope that that development process will continue.  Perhaps we are in a valley period now but if we can sort out our difficulties the development process will take off once again.</P>
    <P>Many young people are employed by the co-operatives and ancillary services generally who in years gone by would, unfortunately, have been forced to emigrate. They found relatively secure, stable employment at home and were able to settle down in their home environment. The house building industry and the communities in which they lived benefited as a result.  They were part and parcel of the new development process that was revitalised with our entry into the EEC not alone in the dairy industry section of the agricultural industry but right across the whole spectrum of agricultural production.</P>
    <P>The prospect of the super-levy being imposed on the dairy industry here and the threat that that poses to the farming community and the economy generally cannot be overstated.  Many people have become aware of the over-production which was taking place in the Community. There was a restricted market for the ever increasing level of production. As a relatively under-developed member state, we were lagging behind the more efficient producers in the Community. The dairy industry had begun to expand on the basis of imported substitute cereals. The importation of these cereals was very much against the spirit of EEC membership.  Perhaps it is unfortunate that the proper mechanism which would have been necessary to discourage this importation which was and is creating the imbalance in the Community and which threatens the long-term prospect for a viable Community, was not introduced earlier.  Perhaps as a young and small member of the Community we had not got the necessary clout to convince the other states that in the longer term the extra production as a result of importation <Col N="2590" /> was gradually but surely undermining the foundation of the Common Agricultural Policy and the dairy industry generally.  It has long been recognised that an increasing national cow and beef herd and better methods of grass production were the passports to greater prosperity. If we analyse the employment figures here, we can see that a very large percentage of our working population are directly or indirectly involved in the agricultural industry.  If the stagnation that would set in as a result of the imposition of a super-levy should have an effect on the opportunity for increased employment levels by greater and more efficient methods of production, it would be very serious indeed.</P>
    <P>As many other speakers said, the vital importance of the dairy industry to the overall development of our economy cannot be overstated.  The employment prospects of many of our young people, whether they live in urban or rural areas, could well be blighted by the advent of a super-levy.  I believe that with the proposals for the super-levy, the prospects for the expansion of our national cattle herd would be seriously affected.  The beef industry is interlinked with the dairy industry.  Dairy farmers sell calves to other areas where stores are produced, they develop into beef cattle and perhaps later on some of them are exported on the hoof.  The close relationship between the dairy and beef industries inevitably must have a knock-on effect on beef production if a super-levy is imposed.  It would also affect the very important source of export material in our meat plants which is so vital for employment and also to keep our balance of payments at the proper level.</P>
    <P>All in all the future appears to be bleak.  The dairy industry and the integrated development from the cow in the field to the market place has brought about an economic and social revolution in rural Ireland.  If stagnation were to set in, its impact would be tremendous. Expertise in dairying resided very much in the southern part of the country.  In latter years milk production in the northern half of my constituency and neighbouring constituencies took off. <Col N="2591" /> When people recognised the potential they moved in.  It takes time and experience to build up the know-how so essential for success in that area.</P>
    <P>The agricultural advisory services and the co-operative movement spread throughout the land as a result of that expansion into virtually every county in Ireland.  The ancillary services and the attendant employment for many of our young people grew along with the dairy industry.  Important employment opportunities were created.  If there had not been an expansion in the dairy industry employent opportunities would not have been created.  Many people who thought they were in secure and stable employment must feel threatened.  It would be very sad if they were to be added to the unfortunately increasing list of unemployed. There was a time when people from rural Ireland with no prospect of employment at home took the emigrant boat and went abroad.  That option does not exist any longer.</P>
    <P>The Coalition Government and the Minister must realise that a great weight of responsibility rests on them.  The dairying industry has made an important contribution to our balance of payments and to employment opportunities for our people in the ancillary services, the advisory services and the co-operative movement. Their future depends on the outcome of the negotiations on the super-levy. Many people negotiated house mortgages on the basis that they had secure stable employment for many years to come.  Unfortunately the picture has changed.</P>
    <P>The super-levy will threaten the basic fabric of our community if we allow it to be imposed.  We cannot allow the other member states to impose it because of overproduction and imported cereal substitutes from outside the Community. One third of the dairy needs of our neighbour, Britain, are being supplied by New Zealand and that country is certainly outside the Community.  In the negotiations the British have succeeded in maintaining an inflow of dairy products from New Zealand.  Britain is the nearest market place to us.  Having regard to transport <Col N="2592" /> costs and so on those market prospects should favour us.  That market is being taken up by New Zealand dairy products. It would be very unfair if a small open economy like ours were to be penalised and the New Zealanders were allowed to market their dairy products within the Community to the exclusion of ours.</P>
    <P>Going back to the early years of our membership of the Community, State and Community investment in the dairy industry was an indication of the confidence the Government, the Commission and the other agencies involved had in the future of the dairy industry.  A colossal investment was made.  We were the victim of a British cheap food policy in the past and because of that expansion and development in the agricultural industry was retarded and inhibited, The wherewithal was not available to enable us to reach the state of development we should have reached.  The investment made after our entry into the Community was essential to put us on the road to prosperity.</P>
    <P>Investment alone does not guarantee success.  It takes time to develop expertise and experience.  We were not sufficiently geared to take advantage of the opportunities which presented themselves on our entry into the Community.  The Farm Modernisation Scheme was the guiding vehicle for investment by farmers in their industry.  It is easy to be wise in retrospect. Perhaps because of the structure and the land tenure of our holdings the rate of development was not sufficiently fast to enable us to expand our output and production.  The Farm Modernisation Scheme did not have the effect it was intended to have, perhaps because of our small holdings and a lack of capital. Many of our farmers were getting older. Quite a few of them were unmarried and unwilling to commit themselves to the effort and the investment needed.  It is unfortunate that we were not in a position to take advantage of the opportunity which presented itself to us.</P>
    <P>In the main the investment I speak of was financed on the basis of long-term borrowings.  Loans were negotiated on the basis of what appeared to be future prosperity.  Undoubtedly things have <Col N="2593" /> turned sour.  Tens of thousands of farmers find themselves in financial difficulties today.  Investment decisions taken on the advice of their agricultural instructors, bank managers and managers of other lending institutions, appear today to have been unwise.  If the super-levy is imposed many people will regret having made those decisions.</P>
    <P>The development of the co-operative movement has been strongly linked with the development of rural Ireland.  Many co-operatives began with four or five employees and then expanded, giving increased employment.  I compliment the men of vision who started the co-operatives before the prospect of entry to the EEC opened up new markets.  We owe a debt of gratitude to the collective togetherness of those who formed the co-operatives.  People who found employment there were enabled to settle down in their own environment instead of taking the emigrant ship to Australia, America or Britain.  It would be an unfortunate day if the people who took the decision to stay at home were directly affected by the imposition of the super-levy on the dairy industry.</P>
    <P>The dairy farmers who expanded their enterprises are not to blame for the dilemma in which we find ourselves.  The level of milk production per cow lags far behind the production levels on other member states.  In the current depressed environment it is difficult to imagine farmers taking decisions to improve management, to improve grass production, to better their expertise or to take decisions regarding cattle breeding.  It is difficult to imagine them having the heart to take those decisions in the light of the threat to hold our production levels at 1981 figures.  Milk production comes mainly from small holdings having herds of less than 30 cows.  It would be unfortunate if small farmers were to be put out of business because of factory-type dairy units on the Continent.  The Minister and the Government must bear in mind all these factors on negotiations on the super-levy. The social implications are horrendous. We have not the opportunity to provide alternative employment for people who would be cast out of their small holdings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2594" /> I referred earlier to the fact that New Zealand is supplying one-third of Britain's dairy produce needs.  This might be an opportune time to ask why this is being allowed.  Why has Britain obtained such exemption?  On entry to the Community the position regarding dairy products was a prime consideration.  New Zealand was given time to look for alternative markets but Britain has succeeded in ensuring that New Zealand still retains its access to the market place.  If that market place were available for our dairy products or those from mainland Europe it would be very useful, especially at a time of overproduction of dairy products in the Community.  Is it the case yet again that we are to be the victims of Britain's cheap food policy which for too long prevented the development of our nation? Our state of development was such that we were unable to take advantage of the opportunities which presented themselves on our entry to the Community.</P>
    <P>These are the considerations the Minister must keep in mind during negotiations of the super-levy.  Will it be a case of shutting off too many valves to the heart of our economy?  The Minister for Agriculture must bear a great weight of responsibility.  The implications of insufficient political clout and know-how in the negotiations are too great to be lightly dismissed.</P>
    <P>The importance of a proper co-ordinated breeding programme cannot be overstated.  The quality of our stock has been improving all the time.  This is an area which has not, perhaps, been getting sufficient emphasis.  Is an adequate amount of money being made available for research?  Have the efforts of cattle breeding associations been sufficiently co-ordinated to ensure the importation of new bulls to improve our herds?  This may be an opportune time to examine their position and consider the possibility of making further moneys available to them.</P>
    <P>When we think in terms of increased production we must recognise that diversification of our products is essential. This is a theme on which many speakers have dwelt at length.  We need to do something about diversification immediately <Col N="2595" /> because there seems to be a reaction against dairy produce.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to section 84 lending and the effects this will have on the financing of the co-operative movement.  The withdrawal of this in the budget was a serious mistake and its effects on co-operative investments will be significant. If there are further interest increases because of its withdrawal, this will have to be passed on to farmers.  It is very unfortunate that the Minister for Finance felt that this lending scheme should be cut off.  I have covered most of the areas in relation to the dairying industry and its importance to the development of our economy, the impact of the super-levy and areas we could look at to increase production and expand output.</P>
    <P>There is one thing which involves difficulty for people involved in the dairying industry alone.  Reference has been made to disease eradication, not alone the cost to the Exchequer but the dramatic impact on many of our dairy herds as a result of being infected by disease.  There are many people who committed themselves and their families to building up dairy herds and found that when brucellosis or TB suddenly struck their lives were in ruins.  I believe we are making progress in relation to the eradication of TB and brucellosis.  When we consider the threat of those diseases the possibility of having two-enterprise farm holdings instead of all the eggs being in one basket should be considered in the context of the Farm Modernisation Scheme.  There is a total commitment, in many cases throughout the country, of the farmer and his family to the output from their farm.  Some of those people when their herds are affected by brucellosis and TB have absolutely no income.</P>
    <P>I believe we should encourage the two-enterprise farm to minimise the great hardship causes by dairy herds having to be slaughtered because of disease.  The two enterprises on any farm holding would have to complement each other. For many years the dairying industry and the pig industry went hand in hand on farms.  In recent times pig production has <Col N="2596" /> tended to be in the hands of large units with a reduction in the number of people involved.  I believe the passage of time will prove that this is not to the advantage of the industry generally.  When there is a 500 or 600 sow unit in one area, even if the management and control are good the risk of disease lurks around the corner. When disease strikes in a unit like that the impact is traumatic.  If we had small pig units to complement dairy production on small and medium sized holdings we would overcome many of the problems which have arisen in relation to the large pig production units.</P>
    <P>The availability of the by-products of the dairying industry for pig producers is very important.  Cereal costs have risen steeply in recent years and many pig producers are in financial ruin now.  Those engaged in processing for the pig industry will find themselves well under full capacity before this year is out because of the number of pig producers who have gone to the wall.  This is a very unfortunate development.  I would like the Minister to consider giving greater encouragement to people to set up small pig units on their smallholdings and making larger grants available to encourage this development.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's concern but he is moving slightly away from the terms of the Bill under discussion.  I appreciate that there is relativity between dairy production and pig production but I would like the Deputy to go back to the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The relationship between the two is very important and I am quite sure the Minister will accept that there should be a very close link between them. I was about to deal with the question of dairying by-products being made available to pig producers.  The convenience of pig producers to creameries and co-ops is very important in relation to having the by-products available to them.  It is important that this is looked at to ensure that every possible benefit is channelled back to pig producers.  I will not say any more on this matter, although it is a very broad subject and its importance cannot be overstated.  However, there are other <Col N="2597" /> speakers who wish to get in.  With regard to the Minister's negotiations on the super-levy, I look forward to a complete derogation for Ireland.  I look forward to Bord Bainne, who have done very fine work in the past, being able to play their part in the future, particularly in relation to diversification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other speakers I welcome the extension of the guarantee to Bord Bainne.  We are all very proud of the great work they have done in the past.  They have a worldwide reputation in regard to the marketing of our dairy produce.  We all hope they will continue to do this work particularly when we read about the massive imports of dairy produce. I believe that giving the extension of the guarantee is showing our confidence in them.</P>
      <P>The IDA carried out a study on supermarkets throughout the country.  I will not go into the merits or demerits of supermarkets.  The figure given for food imports in 1982 was £750 million.  That study pointed out that 70 per cent of those imported products are in direct competition with products already made in Ireland.  Those imports include dairy produce.  It is important that we look at our food industry when we talk about the great work An Bord Bainne are doing. The study stated that Irish producers could take a 25 per cent to 50 per cent share of the market currently held by imports under all of these categories and it identified 30 new consumer food ideas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many speakers here today and yesterday have spoken about the dairying industry and the thing that concerns all of us, the threat of the super-levy.  The proposal to restrict our output to the 1981 level is the most disturbing announcement that we have heard on the super-levy. Also important is the proposal to have a flat rate of 75 per cent of the target price.  That second proposal if implemented would be catastrophic for our dairy farmers, particularly small farmers, when the yield per cow for this country is lower than in Denmark, the Netherlands and other countries and the price paid to the Irish farmer is lower also.  As other speakers have said, our contribution <Col N="2598" /> to the milk mountain is very small. I hope the Minister will continue to fight against the use of the cereal substitutes that other countries are allowed to get. When we see the British Government banging the table and making so much noise looking for what they call their money while at the same time importing butter from New Zealand, we must see that this whole area is exposed by our Government and particularly by our Minister.</P>
    <P>ACOT have published a survey referring to the serious impact of cutting back on milk production here and they have stated that the total quantities of milk delivered to processing plants was expected to rise from 964 million gallons in 1981 to approximately 1,116 million gallons at the end of last year.  That increase is in the region of 16 to 18 per cent, and assuming a price per gallon of 70p and relating that to 1981 levels, you are talking about a fall in value of milk output of about £99 million.  That shows how serious the problem is.  We hear a great deal of talk about people getting out of dairying and going into other enterprises.  That is fine for the experts and people who have all the theory, but the business of dairying yields a far higher return per acre than does any other enterprise, particularly in the west where holdings and cow herds are small yet people have been able to make a living from the dairying enterprise.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words about dairy farmers who have been in financial difficulties.  In 1983 the ACC sent receivers into farms and one farmer was in gaol because of farmer debt.  I put it to the Minister that this problem was being recognised by the EEC in 1982 when an EEC interest subsidy of 5 per cent was allowed, and also by the Government who in 1982 brought in a national interest subsidy.  This point must be hammered home by the Minister and the Government at EEC level.  ACOT have given figures which show that of the 4,500 farmers in the rescue package two-thirds &mdash; 3,000 &mdash; are in dairying.  These farmers are planning to increase their output by up to 50 per cent and they will be hoping to have a five- or six-year period to do <Col N="2599" /> that.  They are working with their ACOT advisers to get themselves out of financial debt through expansion of their dairying business.</P>
    <P>If the super-levy is to be introduced on a 1981 base, farmers who are working with their advisers to get out of that farmer debt will suffer very grave loss indeed.  They will be in a very bad financial situation.  The total indebtedness of the dairy farmers covered under the rescue package is approximately £200 million and in many cases the dairy farmers have debts equivalent to about £1,000 per cow.  Seen in the light of these figures the consequences of the super-levy are almost too terrible to contemplate.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider some of these points and especially to realise that the British Government seem determined to dismantle the CAP, and when that policy and the dairying industry are so important to this country that attempt by the British Government must be resisted at all costs.  The EEC seem to be trying to give global treatment to this problem which was created by certain countries.  I cannot agree with proposals that have been made to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Regarding the consumption of milk, the dairy council have done very good work and it is encouraging that milk has been launched in our Dail bar, whatever about other bars throughout the country. The school milk scheme should have been more successful.  Speaking to teachers and parents concerning this scheme I have been disappointed at the presentation of milk which in many cases has not been done very well.  I am disappointed also that the Department of Education have not been more involved in this scheme.  In larger schools perhaps one teacher could be given responsibility for administering the scheme within a school.  I am concerned also about the scare-mongering about antibiotics in milk which has led to a general drop in milk consumption.  The Minister has introduced measures to deal with defaulting suppliers of milk to creameries and co-operatives and there will be penalties in future for persistent defaulters.  I am surprised that an effort is not made to <Col N="2600" /> look at the primary reason for the use of antibiotics.  When replying I hope the Minister will give the House some information on the measures being taken to control mastitis.  I am aware that ACOT deal with this as a matter of importance.  I suggest that that organisation arrange intensive courses dealing with mastitis control.</P>
    <P>Another aspect I should like to deal with &mdash; it is outside the control of farmers &mdash; relates to the withdrawal time for drugs.  For example, if a product states that milk should be withheld for 48 hours after the drug has been administered, how sure can a farmer be that in the next milking after that period his milk will be free of antibiotics?  What results have been obtained, if any, from the testing being carried out by An Foras Taluntais and the veterinary college?  When we have a good product like milk we should do everything possible to ensure it is up to standard.  I noticed recently that creamery lorries and vans in the west carried signs to the effect that the milk was antibiotic free.  I also noticed that some cartons stated that the milk did not have any antibiotic residue.  It is sad that we have reached the stage that such information has to be printed on milk cartons.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the options for extra production by our farmers, particularly our young farmers.  One matter that militates against small farmers is the difficulty they have in getting extra land.  I was glad to hear the Minister of State say that a Bill on land leasing will be introduced next month.  Access to land by young farmers is important.  I was disappointed that the Minister for Finance in the budget did not provide any money for land leasing.  I hope the Minister for Agriculture succeeds in getting money for this because people will be asked to pay high rents for such lands. The question of land leasing, and the group purchase of land, has been with us for many years.  The Land Commission do not get involved in the group purchase of land.  They give technical assistance to farmers only after they have purchased land.  The permission of the Land Commission, or the Minister, is not necessary but I am concerned that when group purchase <Col N="2601" /> schemes break down, as they often do, the Land Commission are not prepared to intervene on behalf of small farmers so that they can increase production. It is disappointing to note that only £1 million has been allocated for acquisition and division of land in the Estimates. It is obvious that that money will be spent on land division with the result that there will not be any money for land acquisition in 1984.  It is important that those involved in the dairy industry get land from the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that the EEC are not disposed towards helping us with our farm modernisation scheme which was restored recently.  With the benefit of hindsight it is obvious that it was a mistake to suspend that scheme last February.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to make the point that the western agricultural package is not geared for dairying.  I hope the Minister will ease the uncertainty about the farm modernisation scheme when replying.  I hope the Minister is aware of the problems of dairy farmers with regard to the cost of inputs into farming, the cost of manures and feedstuffs.  We cannot have subsidies for inputs into farming and the Minister should consider giving special treatment to the many areas that have been left out of the scheme for severely handicapped areas.  If extra headage grants were given to such areas in the west they would be a great incentive to farmers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of inputs for the dairy industry has increased in recent years and in the absence of a subsidy the Minister should seek extra money from the EEC for headage grants.  In Galway two-thirds of the land is not included for such grants and the Minister should seek to change that position so that those farmers can cope with the increased cost of inputs for dairying.</P>
      <P>I hope the Government will recognise that farmers work seven days each week. The dairy industry should be expanded and, with that expansion, farmers should be rewarded for their work.  I am concerned that the farm modernisation scheme will not prove as suitable as we thought it would for dairy expansion.  I should like to compliment Bord Bainne on the works they have done for the diary industry.  I hope they will be successful in the future.  They deserve the praise of all Members and an extension of the guarantee outlined in the Bill.</P>

That is as I would expect given the importance to the industry of the role of An Bord Bainne.  In all 14 Members contributed to the debate and I heard excellent contributions from both sides.  It is unfair to single out a particular speaker when complimenting Members because all contributors were good but Deputy Joe Walsh made an outstanding, educational and well thought out speech.  I accept that he is possibly the Member who is best acquainted with the industry.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if extra funds will be made available to the Southern Health Board for the current year to avoid a reduction in the standard of services and the level of health care as otherwise there will be a potential loss of 400 jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the restrictions on public expenditure which the Government found it necessary to impose in the current year have affected the health services as well as other public services.  The non-capital allocations approved for the Southern Health Board and other health boards are at the maximum level that could be made available on the basis of the overall resources provided by the Government for my Department for 1984.  There will be no extra funds at my disposal which would enable me to increase the allocation for any health board.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is presumably aware that, in addition to the allocation for on-going services in 1984 amounting, in total, to £150.97 million, of which £112.55 million is for services financed directly by the board, a special allocation of £2 million has been provided to enable the new general hospital in Tralee to be opened within the year.</P>
      <P>I have been informed that at a meeting of the health board on 3 January, 1984 a resolution was passed proposing that the necessary reductions in expenditure be realised in the pay area without disemploying staff.  The feasibility of taking action along the lines proposed by the board and the full range of possibilities for achieving cuts in expenditure both in the pay and non-pay areas are at present the subject of correspondence between my Department and the health board.</P>

      <P>I cannot give any guarantee about anything in terms of the health services at this time.

      <P>I want to make a very clear statement to Deputies on this matter.  At a meeting of 3 January 1984 the Southern Health Board adopted the following resolution, I might stress, by an overwhelming majority:</P>
      <P>We hereby agree to reduce the cost of supplements to basic pay as indicated in the report, dated 29 December 1983, from the Chief Executive Officer, by three-fifths for the purpose of recovering a shortfall of £4.6 million in the allocations for non-capital expenditure in 1984.</P>
      <P>Then they went on to say that, in the event of any proposal to eliminate or reduce supplements to basic pay which had been negotiated traditionally at national level either through conciliation and arbitration or Labour Court procedures, that such proposals should be renegotiated on a national basis.  My Department have been in detailed consultation with the board as to the implementation of that decision of the board. I would recommend to the Southern Health Board &mdash; as indeed in the case of the North Western Health Board covering Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, an outstanding health board &mdash; that they should be able to absorb this reduction without much difficulty.  Indeed I would make the point that it is not a cutback, as such; it is a reduction in the demands of health boards put to the Department.  I have no information whatsoever on any services in the Southern Health Board which are proposed to be eliminated or reduced.  I would be interested in hearing from Deputies in that regard.</P>

      <P>It has always been the arrangement that the various bed complements would be phased into operation, namely, that of a total of 425 beds, 312 will be brought into operation initially and the remainder at a later date. For example, the 50 psychiatric beds will take time to get under way; then there are 30 geriatric assessment beds, eight hostel beds and 15 beds which have not yet been identified for any speciality.  The board approved of all that arrangement in April 1982.  I am glad to say that at long last, about 25 April next, we shall have the first patient transferred over.</P>

      <P>Yes, they have been very difficult negotiations.  I mentioned a total of 350 staff.  Initially 160 additional staff will be necessary to open the first phase.  These will be recruited by April and the remaining 174 will be recruited during the remainder of this year.  Therefore, by the end of 1984, there will be 650 people approximately employed in the hospital.  The equipping of the hospital is now being completed and we do not envisage any difficulties there.  I should like to put on record my thanks to Mr. Walsh, Mr. O'Sullivan and his colleagues and to Denis Dudley, in the Southern Health Board, for their co-operation in the staffing arrangements.

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of the concern expressed at the Irish Medical Students Association annual meeting in Galway on 22 January 1984 regarding the low level of reporting by doctors of drug side effects; and if he has proposals to meet this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the concern expressed at the recent annual meeting of the Irish Medical Students' Association concerning the apparent low level of reporting by doctors of drug side effects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since their establishment in 1966 the National Drugs Advisory Board have had responsibility for obtaining and assessing reports on the adverse effects of drugs in use in this country.  The board operate the system by communicating with doctors <Col N="2616" /> and pharmacists on a regular basis and impressing on them the need to report all side effects to the board.  The rate of reporting is significantly higher in this country than is the case in many other countries.  The rate increased from 3 per cent of expected reactions in 1969 to 20 per cent in 1982 and the rate for 1983 is expected to be about 22 per cent.  These figures compare very favourably with those of other countries, where the average rate tends to be between 8-15 per cent.</P>
    <P>I accept that the rate of reporting of adverse reactions should be much higher and I can assure the Deputy that the National Drugs Advisory Board will continue to urge all doctors and pharmacists to report all side effects, whether expected or not, and those of which there is only a suspicion as to the cause.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be possible to list specific drugs where the danger of side effects is greater and to make it mandatory for doctors using or prescribing them to report any side effects?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In many instances doctors get an unfair amount of stick. Since 1980, medical practitioners and pharmacists are the principal sources of reports of adverse reactions.  Medical practitioners account for almost 60 per cent of the total.  I am a bit worried about the situation in hospitals as they report only about 25 per cent of adverse effects despite the fact that the majority of such effects occur in hospitals.  As shown from the intensive monitoring of the National Drugs Advisory Board, about 10 per cent of patients in hospital experience some sort of adverse reaction to their medication while only 1 per cent of patients outside hospitals have side effects from drugs.  Psychiatric, maternity and children's hospitals have a particularly poor reporting record.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of hospitals, it is obviously much easier to make it compulsory to record side effects.  In view of the low returns now operating, will the Minister issue a directive to the hospitals to step up the rate of reporting?</P>

In the United States, for example, doctors are actually paid to report adversary actions, yet their rate is about 15 per cent.  I shall bear what the Deputy says in mind and try to encourage further reporting. The psychiatric, maternity and children's hospitals have a poor reporting record and we should address ourselves to this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The practice is not unique to Irish doctors.  Changes in the way in which doctors prescribe can be brought about only by the doctors themselves. While there has been some increase in generic prescribing in the general medical service and in hospitals, there is still room for further action by doctors to promote economy in drug costs.  The need for restraint in prescribing will continue to be emphasised to all doctors.  As part of this campaign a further set of bar charts will shortly be issued to them.  These illustrate the comparative costs of products in various categories to <Col N="2618" /> enable doctors to have regard for costs when issuing prescriptions.</P>

      <P>I would like to draw two facts to the Minister's attention before I ask a supplementary question. Firstly, in the United Kingdom it is estimated that surplus quantities prescribed could come to about 10 per cent, so that drugs could be cut by 10 per cent.  In Ireland it is found that one-third of the patients do not actually take the drugs prescribed.  In view of those facts and the problems of generics, would the Minister not consider introducing a list system where deviations from the list would require to be justified on clinical grounds?  That would more or less change the prescribing system which he says only the doctors themselves could alter.  It would put the onus on them in the first place to prescribe generics and only in special circumstances to go for brand names.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic difficulty is that the proprietory drugs are protected by patents for 16 years.  By the time the generic versions come on to the market the brand names are long established. As the Deputy knows, after that it is an uphill struggle to persuade doctors to change to what one might call the official or generic name.  Every encouragement is given to doctors to prescribe generically whenever possible.  The bar charts will be issued in the coming weeks &mdash; they are probably out by now.  I am certainly interested in having that matter brought within the framework of the review of the general medical services and having in-built into the agreement a greater emphasis on the use of generic and cheaper drugs, not necessarily inferior, in fact quite equal to the brand names.  I am reluctant, however, to issue a formal direction on this.</P>

      <P>Did the Trident Report on prescription practices not draw attention to the possibility of using such a list for promoting the use of generics, not only in hospitals but through the GMS and other schemes as well?  It seems that they, at least, have raised the possibility. <Col N="2619" /> Would the Minister reconsider the possibility of a list, at least in the commonly used generic drug areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am certainly prepared to consider it.  My current agreement with the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries comes up for review next year and I intend to concentrate on that aspect.  I would also point out that to an extent, contrary to the Trident Report, generics in this country &mdash; domestically produced, if one might use that phrase &mdash; are not at all that cheap.  The differentiation in price might run to 5, 6 or 10 per cent at most.  The actual saving which the producers of generics claim would be made are not so self-evident and the matter is being examined very closely by my Department.  Very often we can import brand products at lower than the price of the generic domestic product.  This may come as a surprise to some, but it is of interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Minister's reply to Deputy Richard Bruton's last supplementary, is the Minister aware that whatever the cost effectiveness of using generic drugs, officials of his own Department are regularly urging doctors to use more generic drugs?  Is he further aware that doctors who for cost reasons have decided to use some generic rather than brand name drugs have subsequently found that these generic drugs have been ineffective and on analysis it has emerged that the generic drugs are not what they are described to be? Finally, could the Minister indicate if he regards it as desirable, if he is urging generic drugs to be used, that some effective quality control be introduced so that those drugs are not sold which, because of their inadequacy, may pose dangers to patients for whom they are prescribed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have some doubts about the assertions of the Deputy in that regard.  If anything, some of the brand name products probably overstate their claims in terms of the powers residing within them.  The National Drugs Advisory Board and my Department keep a very close eye on the reputed claims of all drugs, including generics.  I am not aware that where generic drugs were prescribed for particular conditions they proved to be inferior to the brand product.  They are almost as good, if not better.  I would be glad to give the information to the industry concerned.  We have a great deal of contact with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board propose to operate Geraldstown House as a family resource centre.  The board's objective is to provide a resource for vulnerable families from the area and, in particular, the special needs of their children.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that the centre will provide the following range of services:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2621" /> (a)  support for and involvement of parents;</P>
    <P>(b)  day care for children of pre-school age and flexible day care for children in families who are unable to provide adequate continuous care;</P>
    <P>(c)  special project for four to twelve year olds for after school activities.</P>
    <P>The board are currently considering applications for the post of project leader which was advertised some time ago.  Following on the appointment of the project leader the board will proceed with the finalising of their plans for the use to which Geraldstown House will be put.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is a fairly active local development association in existence with an interest in involvement in the development of this centre?  This is a fairly precious resource in that area, there being no other similar type of building with the possibility of developing a full range of community services.  The local management groups and interests are keen to see whether the centre could be developed to perform a range of services beyond the child care area.  Does the Minister feel this request could be met in the context of the very desirable services which the board are proposing to develop?</P>

      <P>I have been assured by the health board that they will finalise their programme of proposed services at Geraldstown House as soon as the project leader has fully assessed the needs of the area and has recommended to the board the services most likely to be effective in meeting those needs.  I had some informal discussions regarding the proposed services in the area.  As of now, the health board are quite definite that they will have services to support the involvement of parents, a day nursery for babies of up to two years of age, and a flexible day care arrangement for children and families who are unable to provide continuous care, together with a special project for four to 12 year olds for after school activities.  I indicated that in my reply.  Eventually it is hoped to provide an emergency residential facility for children <Col N="2622" /> attending the centre.  The detailed proposals have not yet been finalised.  I am urging the Eastern Health Board to finish the work and to make the arrangements. I do not know to what extent they have liaised effectively with the local development association.  I met a deputation in July 1983.</P>

The post of project leader was advertised and a short list of applicants has been prepared for the appointment.  I will be urging the board to go ahead and complete the work.

      <P>My major concern is to ascertain whether in the operation of this <Col N="2623" /> centre, which I repeat is a unique resource in the area with quite an amount of accommodation, the board will operate with the maximum possible openness to the other needs of the community which might be served by a facility such as this.  I refer to possible meeting places and other adult related activities.  Can the Minister indicate that so far as is feasible the board will be willing to co-operate fully and that there will not be anything in the operation of the centre which will close it off from the community as it becomes a specialised centre?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give every encouragement to the board to operate on an open basis and to discuss with local advisory groups how best the needs of the area can be looked after.  It is a family resource centre.  It will be 100 per cent funded by the Eastern Health Board and staffed by health board personnel.  I hope the facility will be available to local organisations.  The board had difficulty in considering whether portion of the building or the outhouses should be vested in a local association.  They came down against that proposition.  The association acquired alternative premises and workshops. I will be encouraging the health board that, if a family resource centre is to work locally, it will have to be on a local basis and not with health board personnel arriving every Monday morning at 9.30 a.m. and leaving at 5 o'clock in the evening.  That is one of the big problems we have with our health services.</P>

      <P>The person in question applied to the Eastern Health Board for dental treatment in December 1983 and her name was placed on the board's waiting list.  Due to the limited resources at their disposal the health board give priority to certain eligible persons over others.

In consequence eligible persons outside the priority groups have to wait some time for treatment. The health board are unable to say when treatment can be provided for the person in question but deny that a waiting time of up to five years was quoted by them.

      <P>(a) The number of dentists employed by the Eastern Health Board at present is 85.  This figure is made up of 58 permanent dentists, 8 whole-time temporary dentists and 19 dentists who work for the board on a part-time or sessional basis.  The total work commitment of these part-time and sessional dentists is equivalent to 9 whole-time <Col N="2628" /> posts so that the total dental manpower of the board at present is equal to 75 full-time posts.  On the same basis the total dental manpower of the board in January 1979 was equal to 65 full-time posts.  This was made up of 55 permanent dentists, five whole-time temporary dentists and 13 part-time and sessional dentists with a work commitment that would equate in total with five full-time posts.</P>
      <P>(b)  There are 11 vacancies for full-time posts of dentist in the Eastern Health Board, but eight of these posts are filled at present through the use of temporary and part-time staff.  All vacant posts are with the Local Appointments Commission for filling.</P>

    <P>These figures do not of course reflect the strength of the dental service in the different areas since they do not take account of the service provided by those full-time dentists who serve in more than one area of the board or of that provided by staff working on a part-time or sessional basis.</P>
    <P>(f)  By relief dentists I take it that what the Deputy has in mind are those full-time dentists who serve in more than one area of the board and those dentists who work part-time or on a sessional basis. There are 15 full-time dentists in the board who serve in more than one of the board's dental areas and, as I indicated earlier, a total of 19 dentists work for the board on a part-time or sessional basis.</P>

      <P>The embargo in terms of total overall control of my Department's commitment for staff has had a loose application in the past few years.  I am glad to say that the Minister for Finance in this year's budget confirmed that basically it is a cash control measure and within that the various health boards have reasonable flexibility. In relation to the Ballymun area, on the basis of general inquiries I have made I can assure the Deputy that the waiting list is minimal and that any transfer of staff from Blanchardstown to Ballymun has been done to ease waiting lists in other areas.  It has been done for no other purpose.  The overall complement of the <Col N="2630" /> Eastern Health Board dental staff is not reduced by virtue of the embargo.  Of the full allocation of 11 vacancies for full-time posts eight are filled at present through the use of temporary and part-time staff and all the vacant posts are with the Local Appointments Commission for filling.  The control over my work by the Department of Finance to that extent is not as pervasive as might have been felt.</P>

If the waiting list fills up I have no doubt that the health board will again examine the matter. There was a build up of a waiting list in Blanchardstown and for that reason there was a transfer of staff to that area.  The health board will examine the matter very closely.</P>

      <P>I was saying at the conclusion of the debate before lunch that I was very impressed with Deputy Joe Walsh's contribution. He is probably the most knowledgable Member of the House regarding dairying matters seeing that he has long practical experience of the business.  A number of the comments he made had a great deal of significance.  It was a most enlightening speech.  He is a very modest Deputy as he does not attempt to force his points too strongly.  He is most forthcoming in relation to the knowledge he possesses on the issue.</P>
      <P>Deputy Walsh spoke in particular about the need for better marketing and research in dairying in this country.  This is a very interesting point.  He said we had gone into the mass production of two commodity items in the dairying sector, butter and skimmed milk, without paying sufficient attention to the production of other products.  He said we were placing undue reliance on the EEC's intervention system.  He is quite right in that.  It is rather late in the day for us to admit this fact but it is as well that we should admit it.  We are producing commodities which are in vast oversupply and vast overproduction in the Community.  The sooner we get away from this type of production the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EEC intervention stocks of butter at the moment amount to 765,000 tonnes of which 53,000 tonnes are stored in Ireland.  The intervention stocks of skim milk powder amount to 970,000 tonnes of which 124,000 tonnes are stored in Ireland.  One can see that there is an enormous surplus of the two commodities which we are primarily producing and manufacturing here so there is a great need to get away from this system. Deputy Walsh was quite correct when he said that we have not paid proper attention <Col N="2664" /> to marketing.  When the system lends itself to vast production of these commodities and placing them into intervention he is dead right that we should have got away from those two commodities and be producing a wide range of dairy produce.  You need money to do that.  It requires a considerable amount of money to diversify into new products.</P>
    <P>In my area the Waterford Co-operative Society are now manufacturing yogurt. To market that on one-sixteenth of the British market I believe it has cost them well in excess of £2 million.  It cost that huge sum of money to promote that one product.  I believe they are manufacturing the product at Inch in County Wexford under licence from a French company so the cost to actually research and develop it would be greater than that.  That leads to the point I raised in my opening address, which was referred to by a number of speakers, the fund which Bord Bainne have advocated for research and development of new products.  They mention a figure of £5 million initially.  It is a very commendable suggestion by them.  We need a whole range of new products and it takes money to produce them.</P>
    <P>We have not got the reserves in this country, whether it is technologists or research facilities to do this kind of work. I noticed recently that a number of the major co-operative societies in the country are undertaking their own research and development projects.  That is a very costly item for any of our co-operative societies.  They may look very big but in an international context they are not very big at all.  It would be much more logical if they had one central research agency rather than having ten or 12 different co-operatives doing their own research and development projects.  We must look at this aspect of it from a national point of view not from the point of view of each individual co-operative society in the country.  There are about ten or 12 very big co-operative societies and a larger number of smaller co-operative societies. If there was one central development agency the research could be done on that central basis.  I know of no funds available for research at the moment, <Col N="2665" /> because of the usual problem, division of responsibilities between Departments.  It is not clear whether that responsibility lies with the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism or the Department of Agriculture.  As we have always said, that responsibility has never been given to one Department and I intend to look further into that.  Exceptionally fine research facilities for dairy development are available in UCC, and I intend to pay a visit to the university shortly to see for myself the capacity and potential of the resources available with a view to developing the type of research I have been speaking about.  The production of new commodities is a very costly item which needs very thorough investigation and planning and it would be far better if it was synchronised and done on a central basis than to have a number of individual groups doing it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leonard in his very outstanding contribution showed his objectivity and his practical approach to the problem facing us in the dairy industry.  I agree with what he had to say about the sensationalism attached to the recent stories about the level of antibiotics in milk in that it did a great deal of damage to the dairy industry here and it was blown up out of all proportion.  Of course, 80 per cent of milk here is processed by the co-operatives and they have their own penalty system whereby they penalise people who deliver milk with a level of antibiotics which is not acceptable.  The test in question is very sensitive and the result is that the milk used by the co-operatives is almost invaribly free from any antibiotics. There was a small level of abuse by some suppliers who were delivering liquid milk to dairies, but as a result of measures taken by my Department in the past nine or ten months the degree of abuse in that area has been considerably reduced if not eliminated.  As Deputy Dowling said, it is unfortunate that the consumption of liquid milk in his co-operative area dropped by some 12 per cent because of the publicity given to what was a relatively small abuse.  Nevertheless, it was an abuse, and we should be very vigilant in seeing that any abuse, no matter how small, is eliminated <Col N="2666" /> because it entails an inherent danger to health.  In the country as a whole the level of milk consumption at that time dropped by 12 or 15 per cent.  I am glad to say that there has been a considerable recovery and milk consumption is virtually back to normal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kirk, who spoke shortly before the break, gave a very reasoned and outstanding run down on the state of the milk industry and again I thought his a very objective contribution.  He made a number of statements with which we could all agree.  One was that the major development of agriculture would be a very slow process.  We will not get results overnight or in a matter of weeks or months.  We must be prepared to spend a considerable time adapting our approach, whether in producing new products or adopting new policies.  The Deputy made the point, which I have made in this Chamber previously and which some people chose to ignore, that we would not be under the threat of the milk super-levy if action had been taken to correct the problem of overproduction of milk several years ago.  Deputy Kirk was quite adamant that such action should have been taken in good time, and of course he is right.  Here we are in 1984 trying to resolve a very serious problem which originated in the 1970s, and it is grand to be so bland as to come in here and say, &ldquo;Go out to Brussels and veto the super-levy proposals.  We did it before, why not do it again?  There is no problem&rdquo;.  Of course there is a problem. If some restriction is not put on milk production within the EEC we will have desperate problems in the future because the people who contribute to the EEC budget have made it quite clear that they will not increase their contribution until there is reform of the CAP and some reason is brought into areas where at present overproduction and therefore surpluses are vast.  You cannot compare the present situation with that which pertained when previously a super-levy on milk was proposed.  You cannot make comparisons because previously there was still money in the EEC budget. Today there is not.  The EEC budget was absorbed fully in 1983 and, therefore, the <Col N="2667" /> method of financing with an increasing production pattern is not adequate for us to carry on as before.  Something must give.  Either we cut back on production in the EEC as a whole or we increase expenditure.  The net contributors to the budget, the British and the Germans, have stated emphatically that they will not increase the budget unless we rationalise spending in the agricultural sector. It is quite ridiculous, unrealistic, stupid to say that the situation is similar or parallel. It is quite different and it is so serious that it must be treated in that light.  We have said at the talks in Brussels, Athens and Luxembourg during the past seven or eight months that we appreciate there is a difficulty.  The people we are dealing with are not fools and it would be very silly of us to insinuate that they are.  We are all adult enough to know that there is a serious problem and that a cut in production must take place.  We must put our finances in order as a result. Because of that severe financial budgetary situation we had a set of proposals from the Stuttgart summit last June. Those proposals were published by the Commission in July, and there are dozens of them.  The milk super-levy proposal is the one upon which all the attention is focused and there are dozens of others not quite so serious but some with fairly serious implications for this country.  One relates to the abolition of the calf premium, which was advocated by the Commission. It would cost the country £38 million in one year.  That is one of the subsidiary proposals from the Commission.</P>
    <P>I will direct my attention now to the proposal for the super-levy on milk.  Last week I was accused of having changed my approach to the milk super-levy.  That is untrue, absolutely incorrect.  I have always said that I would not want to insult the intelligence of people in Europe.  I appreciate that something has to be done about the overproduction of milk.  There is a need for corrective action but that corrective action would not have to be so drastic if it had been taken five or six years ago.  However, such action will have to be taken and we are facing this <Col N="2668" /> showdown in Europe.  There is need to take corrective action.  The super-levy proposal should apply to the countries who have caused the problem by their intensive method of producing milk; the proposal should not apply to us.  There should not be any question of a super-levy proposal applying to us until we have reached the same level of production as our partners in Europe.  There is no question whatever but that we are seeking a derogation from any such super-levy proposal until that time arrives.</P>
    <P>The reasons for the underdeveloped state of our industry are well known.  We have infrastructural problems and there has been underfinancing going back 60 years.  Those matters have been major factors in the failure of Ireland to attain European production levels.  Another factor is that some of our European partners have been using huge quantities of cheap imported cereals to produce milk on a massive scale.  Such importation must be cut back.  There is little point in Members telling me that I should stop this immediately, because it should have been stopped years ago.  I will give a simple statistic which explains the reason why there has been such a dramatic increase in milk production in the Community. In 1976 the Community imported six million tonnes of cereal substitutes and that figure has risen to 16 million tonnes by 1982.  There is little point in pointing the finger at me and telling me I should stop that completely; it should not have been allowed reach that level.  Probably the greatest contributory factor to the milk surplus in Europe is that cereal substitutes were allowed into the Community for a long period.  I do not wish to play politics on this issue but it is not fair or correct to point the finger at the Government and accuse them of being responsible for the position that exists.  That is not playing the game; it is not true.</P>
    <P>A serious problem is confronting us and if we do not succeed in getting a derogation from the proposal we will suffer a terrible set-back, not just in agriculture but economically.  The economy of the country will be affected.  However, I am confident that we will get the derogation <Col N="2669" /> we are seeking.  I should like to explain the progress made so far.  I am sorry if I must repeat myself but my greatest difficult in this super-levy debate is to get people to understand the issues involved, because they are extremely complex.  There is considerable misinterpretation and misunderstanding.  At times I believe the misinterpretation is accidental but on occasions it appears that it is deliberate.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of people do not understand the full implications of the super-levy proposal.  The simplest way to explain it is in terms of figures.  Milk production in the Community in 1981 was 96 million tonnes and Community officials estimate that the consumption of milk and milk products rises by ½ per cent each year.  Taking into account 1982 and 1983 they set the figure for the milk super-levy at 1981 production levels, plus 1 per cent.  The 1981 production level was 96 million tonnes and if 1 per cent was to be added it would be 97 million tonnes. A figure for milk production for the future was fixed at 97 million tonnes annually.  Milk production in 1983 was 103 million tonnes.  At the rate at which milk production is increasing, and if we do not do anything about it, by the end of 1984 it will have increased to approximately 105 million tonnes.  The self-sufficiency of the Community is approximately 80 million tonnes of milk. Considering those figures Deputies can see the massive surplus of milk we have in the Community.  If we continue as we are at the end of the year we will have 25 million tonnes more milk than we need. People have the cheek and the nerve to come to the House and tell me that we do not have a problem, that all we have to do is to go to Europe and shout &ldquo;veto&rdquo; and the problem will go away.  Do such Members take the people to be fools? There is a very real problem.</P>
    <P>The Community are satisfied that it will be possible to get rid of 17 million tonnes of that surplus on traditional markets. It is not easy to get rid of that amount of milk but it will be got rid of even if the Community have to pay to get rid of it.  However, once we go over that 97 million tonne level we are in dead <Col N="2670" /> trouble.  We might as well pour that milk down the drain.  It would not be possible to get rid of it even if we wanted to give it away.  We would be as well off pouring it down the drain.  Hence our problem. Considering those difficulties I believe we made a lot of progress between July and December to be offered by the Greek Presidency to be allowed produce milk not at the 1981 level but, initially, at the 1983 level and, finally, at the 1983 level plus 10 per cent.  That amounted to considerable progress in the face of tremendous difficulties but we were not satisfied with that and we sought complete derogation bearing in mind that the Greeks quantified the original Commission super-levy proposal as being for a four year period with a review after three years and not forever.  We made it known that we were not satisfied with the 1983 levels plus 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>Some countries would not agree with the Commission's proposals.  Their position from day one has been: the super-levy proposal for everybody, no exceptions, no exemptions.  Three countries continued to adopt that attitude up to the conclusion of the Athens summit.  At present we are negotiating again and the Council of Agriculture Ministers are debating agricultural questions, primarily the milk super-levy.  We had an inital meeting where we adopted procedures, we had a meeting last week, another meeting on 27-28 of this month, the next meeting will be on 5 and 6 March, another meeting on 12 and 13 March and the summit will be on 19 and 20 March. Contrary to what Deputy Byrne said, the summit will not be in Paris but in Brussels. The French have the Presidency of the Council at the moment but there will be two summits during their presidency and the first summit will be in Brussels.</P>
    <P>Besides the milk super-levy proposal there are many other controversial proposals involved.  Positive MCAs cause considerable trade distortion in the agricultural marketplace.  The Commission and a number of countries, including Ireland, want those positive MCAs to be dismantled over a period of years.  We would be delighted if they could be dismantled <Col N="2671" /> immediately because they would put our farmers in a more superior trading position than they are in at present, but the Commission proposed that they be dismantled over a three-year period. The Germans are opposing the elimination of MCAs, they are fighting this move tooth and nail because their farmers will suffer a considerable reduction in income if the MCAs are abolished at a time when price increases within the Community are minimal or nil.  We can all see their point because they are major net contributors to the Community budget.  We can understand the Germans saying: &ldquo;Why should we pay for other countries, why should we subsidise them and take a cut in prices ourselves?&rdquo;  In my view it is very logical that they should object, but I am hoping a solution will be worked out.  The French Presidency is working very hard trying to resolve such difficult problems.</P>
    <P>There were other major issues: one is the problem I mentioned some minutes ago, the importation of cereal substitutes. We want the importation of cereal substitutes to be reduced.  The countries which have been using them and which have caused the milk problem &mdash; the Dutch, the Germans and the British &mdash; do not want them reduced; they do not even want them stabilised.  They want cereal substitute imports to continue to increase.  The contradiction in their attitude towards the milk super-levy and the increased importation of cereal substitutes defeats me.  I do not understand it. It does not make sense.  They want a cut-back in milk production and they want a vast increase in the commodity which is causing that increase.  Like ourselves, the French are demanding that there be a cut-back.  The Commission are suggesting that the level of importation of cereal substitutes be stabilised, and that is as far as they will go.  As I said earlier, the importation of cereal substitutes should never have been allowed to reach that level.</P>
    <P>Another issue being debated is a tax on intensive milk producers &mdash; in other words, factory-type farms.  If the milk production is deemed to be unnaturally promoted in factory-type farms a tax will <Col N="2672" /> be levied on the production of that milk. We fully support that move, but again the people who caused that problem are fighting to stop that tax being imposed.</P>
    <P>Another burning issue is the tax on vegetable oils and fats.  The idea is to make milk products, in particular butter, more competitive in the face of products such as margarine and other vegetable oils and fats.  That could bring in a considerable amount of money to the Community &mdash; 600 million ECUs was the estimate, or about £400 million &mdash; which would go quite a distance to pay for the milk surplus which is at present causing a problem.  Countries with large numbers of consumers are opposing that tax vigorously because they feel it would increase their cost of living.  The tax is at a very low rate &mdash; I think it varies from 0 to 6 per cent &mdash; and it would not have a major impact on prices.</P>
    <P>Those are some of the major bones of contention.  The Commission advocate that the calf premium be abolished.  This would hit us very hard.  They have not recommended that the variable premium which is damaging our cattle trade and meat factories be continued and we support their attitude.  I hope they stick to their guns because this is causing a lot of problems for our meat factories.  Some factories have to lay off hundreds of workers and others are threatened with closure.  There is also the attendant danger to our export markets.  Markets which Ireland traditionally held are now being threatened by meat exports from Northern Ireland and Britain who are not traditional meat exporters.  The variable premium is a subsidy for the export of beef which is being partially financed by the EEC &mdash; in other words, it is partially financed by the EEC to put our factories out of business.  This is inconsistent and I am glad the Commission have not proposed that the premium be continued.  It should never have been allowed to do that damage, but we will wait to see if the Commission go through with what they promised.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to New Zealand butter which is causing problems not just in this country but within the Community as a whole.  This is probably a suitable day to <Col N="2673" /> refer to New Zealand butter because the New Zealand Prime Minister, Mr. Muldoon, is coming to Dublin tomorrow. With a name like Muldoon he will get a typically Irish welcome, but that is as far as it goes as far as I am concerned.  Contrary to what has been said here in the last week our attitude to New Zealand butter is not ambivalent or contradictory and never has been.  I traced the background of New Zealand butter within the European Economic Community.  In 1972 the Community agreed to allow the continued importation of New Zealand butter because New Zealand has been a traditional supplier of butter to Britain.</P>
    <P>I have here a copy of the Accession Treaty and the relevant regulation relating to New Zealand.  It is Protocol 18 of the Accession Treaty of 1972.  Under that regulation New Zealand were to be allowed import in 1973 165,000 tonnes of butter into the Community.  That amount was to decrease over five years so that by 1977, the amount was to be down to 138,000 tonnes.  At the end of 1977 that agreement was continued on a decreasing basis, but nevertheless was continued; it was not phased out completely.  They were also allowed export cheese to the EEC, starting off in 1973 with 68,000 tonnes coming down to 15,000 tonnes at the end of 1977.  An interesting thing about the cheese, which as the House knows requires a lot more milk for its manufacture than does butter, is that the imports into the Community from New Zealand stopped at the end of 1977.  For some mysterious reason I can never find out they were allowed resume those imports into the Community in 1980 &mdash; admittedly a smaller quantity &mdash; but they are still allowed that quota of cheese.</P>
    <P>In 1983 New Zealand had a quota of 87,000 tonnes of butter into the Community. It has been a diminishing quantity ever since 1973 but it has always been there.  The Commission have put forward proposals reducing that quantity of New Zealand butter further to 75,000 tonnes over the next four years.  What I have said at the meetings of the Council of Ministers in Brussels is that I will not agree to any long-term arrangement for the importation of New Zealand butter <Col N="2674" /> into the Community.  First of all, I want to see the outcome of the talks on the super-levy proposal.  New Zealand's concession ended on 31 December 1983; but, because of the traditional market they have had in the Community, the Commission put forward at the end of 1983 a proposal that they be allowed continue at a reduced rate coming down to 75,000 tonnes.  What I said then, what I have said since and what I am saying now is precisely the same: that I will not agree to that until we see the outcome of the super-levy talks.</P>
    <P>Therefore, what has been happening is that New Zealand have been given an interim allocation originally on a two-month basis &mdash; we agreed that in January &mdash; while what the Commission proposed was a five-year agreement.  Those two months will expire at the end of this month.  I think Members of this House will agree that our attitude has been entirely consistent and is what the public would expect of us in this matter.  The situation is far too serious to allow New Zealand butter to come into the Community without any qualification.  There is that qualification; it is being done on this bi-monthly basis until such time as we will have seen the outcome of the super-levy negotiations.  In connection with those super-levy talks I might mention that President Mitterand of France is paying a visit to Ireland next Tuesday. As the House is aware, he is an exceptionally important person in the context of these talks because he will be chairing the summit of 19 and 20 March next.  I must say that throughout these super-levy negotiations we have found the French to be extremely helpful and sympathetic to our case, as we experienced with the previous host nation, the Greeks.  The French are traditional allies of ours in EEC matters, particularly in agricultural matters.  As I said, we found them extremely helpful and hope that will continue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hugh Byrne in the course of his contribution said that the average milk yield in Europe &mdash; he was drawing a comparison between Ireland and Europe &mdash; was in excess of 1,000 gallons per cow per annum.  That is not absolutely <Col N="2675" /> correct.  The average yield within the EEC in 1982 was 926 gallons per cow per annum.  That increased slightly in 1983.  Deputy Hugh Byrne may have been thinking about what we call the Northern European average, the intensive producers about whom I have been speaking.  If one takes Britain, Germany, Holland and Denmark one will get an average in excess of 1,000 gallons per cow per annum.  But if one takes Italy, France, ourselves, Greece, Belgium and Luxembourg, then the average is 926. We would be closer to 700 than 800.</P>
    <P>A most important thing about the final decision on the level of production in the milk sector allowable in each country is our increase in the last two years.  One might ask what was our average annual milk production increase in the first ten years in which we were members of the EEC, from 1973 to the end of 1982.  I bet I would not get the right answer from anybody in the House.  Some people might say it was 10 per cent, perhaps others 8 per cent or 9 per cent.  The average increase in our milk production per annum has been as low as 4 per cent. Everyone is surprised at the mention of that increase and does not believe it.  The fact is that in 1980 and 1981 there was no increase at all in our milk production.  In one of those years the level actually decreased.  Everyone has the notion that we have zoomed up, year by year &mdash; we have not.  The average has been 4 per cent, which is a rather sobering statistic. Our increase in 1982 over 1981 was 8.1 per cent and our estimated increase &mdash; because we have not yet a definite calculation &mdash; in 1983 over 1982 is 8 per cent.  We have increased slightly over 16 per cent in those two years.  That is why it would be so terribly damaging to us if we were tied to the 1981 production level.</P>
    <P>To be recognised as having a very real difficulty and to have a proposal put that we be allowed milk production at 1983 level plus 10 per cent is an absolutely massive improvement over a 1981 proposal for this country, particularly by comparison with any of the other countries. Most other countries in those two years instead of having had a 16 plus <Col N="2676" /> percentage increase in milk production would have had an increase of somewhere around 5 per cent.  Their industries were so developed that there was not that same massive potential for considerable increase.</P>
    <P>The final proposal put forward by the Greek Presidency in Athens was that instead of a general production level of 1981 plus 1 per cent, people should have an option as follows &mdash; and this may be a little difficult to follow: 1981 plus 2 per cent, or 1983 minus 5 per cent.  If we were in that league &mdash; and we are not &mdash; it would suit us to take 1983 minus 5 per cent because that would be the same as 1981 plus 11 per cent.  It just illustrates the point that most countries had quite small increases between 1981 and 1983. You might say that that option was not too bad, that it was a little improvement on the original offer.  However, that offer creates problems.  Instead of sticking to the figure of 97 million tonnes, which was the original super-levy proposal, that offer would allow countries to increase their production so that the overall total would be not 97 million tonnes but 99 million tonnes.</P>
    <P>There was an added complication in the Greek proposal.  The Greeks were to be totally exempted.  Of course, their milk production is irrelevant in European terms because they produce a very tiny amount and actually import most of the milk used.  The Italians were to be given the 1983 level of production.  The proposal was for us to get 1983 plus 10 per cent.  Might I say that those exemptions and the choice allowed as between 1981 plus 2 per cent or 1982 minus 5 per cent did not just bring the figure up to 99 million tonnes; it brought the figure from 97 million to 101 million tonnes.  Therein lie considerable difficulties for the Community and the Commission.  The difficulty is in getting back to 97 million tonnes and at the same time giving out complete exemptions.  At recent meetings the French were looking for exemptions for their small farmers, of whom there are many tens of thousands, especially in the mountainous regions and in the south.  Luxembourg is looking for an exemption also because all that country <Col N="2677" /> is classified as a disadvantaged area under Directive 159.</P>
    <P>There would be so many exemptions that the Heads of State may say &ldquo;To hell with the super-levy proposal.  We will do the easy thing, that is just cut prices and save the money we need to save by doing so&rdquo;.  That would be a much worse solution as far as we are concerned.  It would put approximately 10p on a gallon of milk.  It would be a simpler but a drastically unfair way to solve the problem. Too many people seeking, demanding and getting exemptions cause us all sorts of problems.  We are the only country singled out for special treatment.  That point is repeated time and time again in the Commission documents.  We are not too madly happy when we see other countries seeking to knuckle in on our bit of the action.</P>
    <P>I want to re-emphasise how the Community are financed.  1 per cent of all VAT receipts in the Community form the major part of the Community's financing, together with customs and excise duties receipts on goods imported into the Community and also import levies on agricultural goods.  The Community have advocated that that level of finance be increased by increasing the rate of VAT from 1 per cent to 1.4 per cent.  This is our greatest difficulty.  What makes the whole problem so complex and the resolution of the surpluses so absolutely necessary is that the large countries will not agree to increase their VAT proceeds from 1 to 1.4 per cent until the Common Agricultural Policy is reformed or overproduction brought under control.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer now to some of the points made by other speakers this morning. Deputy Jimmy Leonard told how he had come across an hotel in Cork which would not provide him with cheese on request.  Unfortunately, that is all too frequently the case in this country.  We are not noted for being high consumers of cheeses or dairy products in general. I hope that yesterday's initiative of the National Dairy Council will bring about an improvement with regard to milk and related products.  Our consumption of cheese is not as high as it might be.  I should imagine also that the availability <Col N="2678" /> of several varieties of cheese is also a factor in the low consumption rate.  Deputy Sheehan absolutely bemused me today with the variety of cheeses which he had come across or knew about.  I had never heard of lobster cheese, periwinkle cheese or crab cheese.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sheehan does fine. There is a definite need for more study of the position with regard to cheese.  It has been said to me &mdash; and this may sound like bad English &mdash; that the co-operatives do not co-operate sufficiently as far as the manufacture of cheese is concerned.  I do not want to be unfair to them but I should like to study this matter further.  As milk is a seasonal production, virtually all the cheese plants in the country close for over half the year.  There is a very poor market at present in Britain for Cheddar cheese which means that some of the plants are closed all year.  If they pooled their milk resources in winter some of those cheese plants could remain in operation on a 12-month basis.  It would be far better if we had one centralised agency for research and development rather than each co-operative society going their own way in that regard.  I will try to bring most of the heads of our co-operatives together with representatives of the ICOS to rationalise the situation.  We should try to have an internal marketing system, not just for milk and its attendant products, but also in regard to cheese.  That should <Col N="2679" /> overcome the problem to which Deputy Leonard referred.  It is a poor look out if we cannot market these products at home.  How can we expect to sell them in huge quantities abroad if we cannot overcome the problems of selling them at home?</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the school milk scheme and it is regrettable that it was not a success.  I have had discussions with the Minister for Education and I am also meeting the teaching unions.  The first of those meetings will take place tomorrow morning when I meet representatives from the ASTI with a view to getting their co-operation in ensuring that the free milk scheme gets off the ground. Actually, &ldquo;free&rdquo; is a misnomer; milk is provided at 50 per cent of the normal price.  Yogurts, cheeses and milk shakes can also be obtained under that scheme and I have invited the National Dairy Council to discuss the matter with me in the coming weeks.  Again it is a poor reflection on us if we are not utilising that scheme properly, as it is heavily subsidised by the EEC.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan made a good point when he referred to diplomatic lobbying and the use of the Department of Foreign Affairs for selling our products abroad. I fully endorse what he said and I have said privately and semi-privately that our diplomatic corps should be used much more than at present to promote our goods around the world.  New Zealand do this very effectively.  They travel constantly to the capitals of the western world.  Shortly before Christmas, the Minister for Foreign Affairs in New Zealand visited us to promote his country's agricultural produce and tomorrow, as I said earlier, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Mr. Muldoon, is coming here also having already toured the other EEC capitals.  Every three or four months a New Zealand Minister visits capitals in the western world and perhaps also in the Eastern Bloc and non-aligned nations. We often come up against them in North Africa; they take markets from us but we also take markets from them and that is fair competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must compliment Deputy Dick Dowling <Col N="2680" /> on his typically strong direct contribution this morning.  He pulled no punches and stressed the unreasonable commotion caused by the antibiotic scare and the problems it created within the industry.

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to update penalties for the wide range of offences prescribed by the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 1978.  These penalties still stand generally at the levels fixed in 1961 and 1968, the main exception consisting in drunken driving penalties which were revised in 1978.  Custodial penalties for road traffic offences are immune to the effects of inflation and only very limited changes are being made to these in the present Bill.  The fall in money values over the past two decades has, however, seriously eroded the impact of monetary penalties under the Road Traffic Acts and the Bill increases all of these.</P>
      <P>It is well that the House should realise the extent of Garda and courts activity generated by the Road Traffic Acts.  In 1982, the latest year for which full details are available, nearly 425,000 prosecutions were taken by the Garda for road traffic offences.  This represents some 75 per cent of all cases brought by the Garda to the District Courts in 1982.  If we add to this figure prosecutions relating to motor taxation and to the Road Transport Acts, which are roads-related but do not come under the Road Traffic Acts, then nearly 92 per cent of prosecutions before the District Courts are involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2681" /> It is imperative that this wide area of law enforcement activity, and the system of on-the-spot charges which parallels it, should not be limited in the sanctions at its disposal to fines which have become trivial in relation to the offences involved.  A realistic level of fines must be maintained to provide proper support for the Garda, traffic wardens and the courts in their task of upholding road traffic law, and I am bringing this Bill before the House to do this.</P>
    <P>The importance of an improved law enforcement framework was emphasised by the Prices Advisory Committee Report on motor insurance published in December 1982.  Arising from that report, the then Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism announced in October 1983 a series of steps decided upon by the Government, including the undertaking that fines for road traffic offences, and particularly uninsured driving, would be substantially increased as a matter of urgency.  The present Bill fulfils that undertaking.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the detail of the Bill, I would like to comment briefly on the basic purposes of road traffic administration and of the place of enforcement within this.  Road traffic regulation exists primarily to enable roads to be used safely and efficiently and to a lesser extent to minimise the environmental inconvenience caused by vehicles.</P>
    <P>The safe use of our roads is self-evidently desirable: road accidents are the sixth highest cause of death for the whole of our population and the single most likely cause of death for all Irish people under the age of 35.  The human suffering caused by death and injury on our roads is incalculable.  In impersonal actuarial terms, however, road accidents are estimated to cost our community some £200 million per year at present prices.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, there is an internationally known correlation between increased motorisation and a reduced rate of fatal and serious injury accidents per vehicle. Ireland has been benefiting from this: although the number of vehicles registered in 1982 was nearly three times the level of the early sixties, the number of fatal road accidents in that year was <Col N="2682" /> actually lower than any year since 1969. The rate of fatalities per 10,000 registered vehicles is now less than six compared with just over ten in 1961.  There is no room however for complacency.  An Foras Forbartha have estimated that road accident counter-measures, including enforcement, still have the potential to reduce the rate of accidents considerably and we must continue to work to this end.</P>
    <P>The other fundamental purpose of traffic management is to rationalise the use of our roads and, especially in urban areas, to maximise their capacity.  The physical mobility of Irish society depends almost entirely on our road system which carries some 94 per cent of all inland traffic.  The vehicle population has trebled from the early sixties to its present level of around 900,000 and is forecast to further double by the year 2000.  Effective traffic control methods are more than ever needed, then, to cope with increasing traffic and to get the best use both out of new and existing roads.</P>
    <P>Traffic management is not a negative enterprise.  It involves planning, engineering and educational inputs as well as those of regulation and enforcement.  The programme of major and normal road improvements now in progress is enhancing both the mobility and the safety of the Irish road network.  Traffic law enforcement, which the present Bill has been drawn up to support, is itself mainly positive in intent: its primary objective is to promote voluntary observance of the rules of the road.  The Bill is concerned almost exclusively with increasing the maximum monetary penalties applying to offences under the Road Traffic Acts.</P>
    <P>The only other matters dealt with consist in a number of new custodial penalties for heavy goods vehicle offences specified in sections 3 and 4 of the Bill and in an extension from six months to one year specified in section 3 of the period of mandatory disqualification from driving for a second or subsequent motor insurance offence within any period of three years.  While disqualification is not a penalty in the strictest sense, the opportunity has been taken to include this particular provision.  As <Col N="2683" /> regards increased maximum fines, with which the Bill is mainly concerned, it will be more convenient to summarise these broadly for the House than to follow the rather complex detail of sections 2 to 5 which is fully described in the Appendix to the Explanatory Memorandum which I have circulated.</P>
    <P>The increased monetary penalties proposed in the Bill fall into three categories. The first involves the most serious road traffic offences, namely, those connected with dangerous, drunk and uninsured driving, and the maximum fine applying on summary conviction to all of these is being increased to £1,000.  This is currently about the heaviest fine which can be imposed within the jurisdiction of the District Courts.</P>
    <P>Responsible motorists, who form the considerable majority of the driving population, will not complain at these increases.  Recent figures show that some 46 per cent of drivers killed in road accidents in Ireland had a high blood alcohol level compared to a corresponding 20 per cent of drivers in Britain.  Claims made to the Motor Insurers' Bureau in 1982 as a result of accidents caused by uninsured drivers amounted to over £13 million. The reckless and anti-social pattern of behaviour indicated by these figures is unfortunately quite prevalent in our society.  In 1982, the Garda had to take over 9,000 prosecutions against drunk driving and over 62,000 prosecutions in relation to insurance offences.  The maximum fine for the latter, having stood at £100 since 1961, has long been outstripped by the cost of annual motor insurance cover and its increase to £1,000 is fully justified.</P>
    <P>The maximum fine for dangerous driving not resulting in death or serious bodily injury is also being increased to £1,000.  Where these do result, the offence must be tried on indictment and the maximum fine is being increased to £3,000 with the present five-year maximum term of imprisonment remaining unchanged.  I should explain to the House at this point that the present Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill, 1983, which is otherwise comprehensive in its revision of penalties, <Col N="2684" /> does not deal with sections 112 or 113 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961.  These are concerned respectively with taking a vehicle without authority and unauthorised interference with the mechanism of a vehicle.</P>
    <P>The reason for not dealing with these provisions in the present Bill is twofold: penalties under section 112 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, are already being increased by section 12 of the Criminal Justice Bill, 1983, now before the Dáil and, following on this, the Minister for Justice intends to move Committee Stage amendments to that Bill which will transfer sections 112 and 113 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, from the road traffic to the criminal justice code.</P>
    <P>The second broad category of maximum fine which the Bill is increasing relates to moderately serious offences under the Road Traffic Acts.  In general, these have been punishable up to now by fines not exceeding £50; the Bill increases this maximum to £350.  Careless driving, dangerous parking, driving a defective vehicle and most offences relating to the testing, certification and loading of heavy goods vehicles come within this second category.</P>
    <P>The heavier fines which apply to heavy goods compared with other vehicle users are justified.  As representatives of the road haulage industry will acknowledge, they reflect the need for firm sanctions where breaches of the law may offer considerable commercial or financial advantage. Permissible weights and dimensions of heavy goods vehicles have recently been increased in this country subject to additional controls over axle spacings and loadings.  While these increases are justified economically on grounds of the more efficient transport which they should promote, I am concerned that infrastructural costs should not be added to arbitrarily by failure to observe the regulations designed for heavy goods vehicles.  I intend, in consultation with other appropriate authorities, to see that they are enforced.</P>
    <P>The third category of increase contained in the Bill is set out in section 2. This revises the amount of the maximum fine arising under the &ldquo;general penalty&rdquo;<Col N="2685" /> for road traffic offences from £20 to £150, in the case of a first offence, and from £50 to £350 for certain second and subsequent offences.  The so-called &ldquo;general penalty&rdquo; is laid down in section 102 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, for all offences under the Road Traffic Acts and Regulations to which no other specific penalty applies.  Among the many offences covered by it are excess speeding, non-wearing of seat belts and most traffic and parking violations.  The District Courts encounter varying degrees of culpability in dealing with these offences. The new maximum fine of £150 will give them much greater discretion than the present £20 limit to relate penalties to the seriousness of the circumstances involved.</P>
    <P>While the road traffic offences belonging to this category may be trivial in the legal sense, they are far from this in their impact on general road safety.  An Foras Forbartha's Road Accident Facts, 1982, comments adversely on the high proportion of trucks exceeding speed limits, especially on the approach routes to towns, and suggests that better observance of these limits would prevent many accidents.</P>
    <P>An Foras have estimated moreover that as many as 50 lives could be saved annually by universal wearing of seat belts, yet the rate of wearing here is no more than one in two, compared with 19 out of 20 in the UK, where mandatory wearing was introduced only in January 1983.  Four out of five car drivers and front seat passengers killed in Ireland in 1982 were not wearing seat belts at the time of the crash.  Finally, proper observance of parking regulations would bring obvious benefits to the flow of buses and other traffic in our large urban areas.</P>
    <P>The Prices Advisory Committee Report on Motor Insurance, to which I referred earlier, recommended that minimum penalties should be applied more extensively to offences under the Road Traffic Acts.  This recommendation has not been followed in the present Bill because of the difficulties which it would involve in regard to the courts' constitutional prerogative of administering justice. Road traffic offences, as I have <Col N="2686" /> already explained, comprise some 75 per cent of all cases dealt with by the District Courts and present a wide variety of different circumstances.  Applying minimum penalties across a wide range of these offences would usurp unduly the courts' role in evaluating the degree of culpability involved in each case.  So-called fines-on-the-spot, incidentally, are not legally fines but a fixed payment in lieu of prosecution which a person may opt for in the case of certain alleged offences. The amount of these payments is determined in regulations made by the Minister for the Environment and is not appropriate to the present Bill.  When the Bill becomes law I propose to review the fines-on-the-spot system.</P>
    <P>The exclusive concern of the Bill is with revising penalties.  I am well aware of the case for other desirable amendments to the Road Traffic Acts some of which arise directly from undertakings given by the Government in October 1983 on the Motor Insurance Report.  I intend, therefore, to bring another Road Traffic Bill before the Oireachtas in the present year, but am seeking the speedy passage of this one for the reasons which I have been outlining.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesNFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can be assured that we will not delay the passage of this Bill through the House.  We welcome much that is contained in the Bill. While we agree with it in principle we have some apprehensions, as in the case of the Criminal Justice Bill.  We accept the Minister's statement that the level of fines has not kept pace with inflation. There is some concern that there is a slight chipping away at the rights of the individual and this again recalls the Criminal Justice Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much depends on the administration of the law and the dispensing of justice. One would hope that the principle of commonsense would prevail when this legislation is being administered.  We have some apprehension because justices do not think alike in relation to the administration of the law and if that principle were applied more often the man or <Col N="2687" /> woman in the street would have greater respect for the law.</P>
    <P>It can be said with some justification that this is another exercise in collecting revenue, that very scarce commodity. The Bill is related almost entirely to monetary penalties and we have no great objection to that.</P>
    <P>There are three main aspects in this Bill as outlined in the excellent explanatory memorandum.  I compliment the Minister and the civil servants on that document.  We are all concerned about the numbers of uninsured drivers, drunken drivers and dangerous drivers.  We must consider the reasons for these problems. I live 30 miles from this House and drive that distance on most days.  I see such an amount of dangerous driving that it is incomprehensible that there are not more accidents.  It behoves us with legislative responsibility to deter dangerous drivers.  I wonder whether lenghtier disqualifications would have more positive effects than increases in fines and endorsements.  We must have a deterrent and perhaps a longer disqualification would be more beneficial in enforcing the law.</P>
    <P>The number of uninsured drivers is appalling.  Why is this so?  The answer is the high cost of insurance, especially for young people.  This is very much in the area of commerce but it is undoubtedly true that the high cost of motor insurance premiums is due to the fact that awards made in court are in many cases far too high.  Is the jury system the best system for such civil actions or should the decision rest with a judge alone?  Awards should be realistic and in keeping with the rights of all parties.  We know of awards that have been made from time to time which have caused insurance companies to increase their premium substantially.  If you are a politician and you go to get your car insured you are regarded as a risk with the amount of driving you do in relation to coming to and from this House, looking after your constituency and all the meetings you have to attend.  Some way will have to be found which will be mutually beneficial to the insurance companies and consumers <Col N="2688" /> of insurance.  Legislators will have to find a way around this.  I know this refers to commerce and trade rather than to the Department of the Environment but the cause of so much uninsured driving is the cost and unavailability of insurance for people, particularly young people, today.</P>
    <P>I am sure most Members have come across constituents who come to them with the problem of trying to get car insurance.  The PMPA tried to assist in this regard.  They have that to their credit. With regard to insurance and the non-insurance of drivers while we have a tax disc on our cars which lets the Garda authorities, traffic wardens and the general public know if our cars are taxed why can there not be a disc on the windscreen of cars to indicate that they are insured and the duration they are insured for?  I am subject to correction but I believe that system is in operation in some continental countries.  I do not believe it would be very difficult to implement this. If one had to display an insurance disc on one's car one would not feel inclined to take that car on to the public road unless the disc was displayed on it.  I would like the Minister to give some thought to this.</P>
    <P>There is not a second car in my house and the cost of a second car is the main reason for this.  It is amazing how many cars there are in the country when cars cost so much in the first instance and on top of that you have to add the cost of insurance, petrol and maintenance.  My wife uses a bicycle to do her shopping.  It would do no harm if we had a slogan in the Department of Environment that it is time to go back to the bicycle.  It is important to have something like this in relation to saving energy.  It is amazing how people can afford a second car.  I know it is an essential in many houses to bring children to school and to do shopping. It all depends on where one lives. I am fortunate that I live in an urban area and I can get by with buying my wife a bicycle instead of a motor car.</P>
    <P>I am very apprehensive about the provision in the Bill where the minimum fine for ordinary parking offences and small offences like the non-wearing of seat <Col N="2689" /> belts is being increased from £20 to £150 for a first offence.  I do not agree with that.  One of the problems for a car driver in this city and in every town and village throughout the country is the problem of where one can park one's car.  It is very difficult to park a car in a legitimate parking area.  I am sure almost every Member of the House has got a parking ticket at some stage.  The suggestion now is that a person is fined £150 for a first offence and if one gets a second parking ticket there is a possibility that the fine could be £350 and for any offence subsequent to that another £350.  We are going too far with that.</P>
    <P>I have received parking tickets on several occasions and paid the fines.  I had to accept that I was wrong.  If one is wrong one should pay the fine.  Many people have come to me, as they have come to other Deputies in the House, asking me to quash a parking fine.  My reply is I could not quash it for myself and I would not do it if I could because if one is wrong one must pay the fine.  I am questioning the severity of increasing the fine from £20 to £150.  It is very difficult for a person coming into Dublin to find a space in one of the official car parks.  It is almost impossible to park one's car near shopping areas without parking on a single yellow line or a double yellow line.  I was talking to a man this morning who told me he had five parking tickets.  When I told him if this Bill is passed what he would be paying for the five parking tickets he was astonished.</P>
    <P>There are large shopping centres in many towns and villages throughout the country which have large parking areas. In the main streets of the towns and villages there are single yellow lines and double yellow lines and the small shopkeepers, who are the backbone of our community and are liable for rates and taxes of all descriptions, are suffering because there are very active traffic wardens about.  I am not blaming those people because they have guidelines to follow from their local authorities.  There are complaints in many areas that the traffic wardens are far too vigilant.  The Minister should send guidelines to the local authorities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2690" /> The main point should be that the function of the warden is to keep the traffic flowing in the town or city and to use common sense.  It should prevent what happens frequently and every Friday in every town outside every bank where people are trying to make their lodgments for the weekends or whatever have parked their cars and when they come out they find dockets on their windscreens. A butcher told me recently that a customer who used to spent £23 in his shop every Friday on one occasion was in the shop for a few minutes collecting a small parcel of meat and when he went out he found a docket on his windscreen. The butcher has not seen that customer since then.  A person may be shopping and if he is not causing blockage and is not a traffic hazard the warden, the garda or whoever is involved should use common sense in the allocation of parking tickets.  Recently in Navan we had a very well publicised, active trade fair and two people who got out of their cars to go into a shop to ask the way to the trade fair found when they came out that dockets had been placed on their windscreens. Is that what this is all about.  The Minister should set a guideline based on common sense for traffic wardens, local authorities, district justices and gardaí in the interest of communication between the public and the authorities.</P>
    <P>We all agree that the legislation regarding seat belts is proper if, as we are told, it saves lives and is helpful in traffic accidents. Some people dispute that, but I go along with the general thinking that it is only proper that we get into the habit of using seat belts.  If one adopts that habit say every morning one will find it quite easy.  However, people who suffer from claustrophobia, for example, have apprehensions about putting seat belts around them.  They feel caught, tied.  If a person can be fined £150 for not wearing a seat belt, then the Bill should contain some provision to allow the district justice to use his common sense and apply the Probation Act in the case of persons suffering from claustrophobia.  I know of people who were victims in accidents where cars went on fire and they found it difficult to loosen their seat belts.  Eventually they <Col N="2691" /> escaped and from that day to this they will not use seat belts.  While in the main it behoves all of us to act as much as possible within the law and use safety measures, where people cannot bring themselves to do so because of circumstances such as I have mentioned, then that principle of common sense should be observed.</P>
    <P>In regard to excessive speeding, I would say that not a Member of this House has not broken the 30, 40 or 50 mile speed limit.  Considering the state of our roads it is amazing that speed limits are not broken more often.  Of course when coming to a town or village where a speed limit applies it behoves us to comply with the law.  One wellknown Member of this House always claimed that when anybody came to him seeking advice about a fine incurred for excessive speeding his reply was, &ldquo;I have got those myself in my time and I paid them up and that is what you must do&rdquo;.  He is right.  It is not the duty of politicians to get people out of such situations, but here again common sense should prevail.  Probably there is not a father in this country who has not broken the speed limit on his way to the maternity hospital at all hours, perhaps at midnight.  I do not doubt that the Garda use their common sense in such cases.  However, I must express some concern about the speed at which juggernauts which are such a feature of traffic today travel along roads which were not built to carry them.  The speeds are frightening.  I am a careful driver and frequently I am passed by these things which can blow you off the road.  Some check-up should be provided to deal with them.  Express buses travelling from the city to the furthest part of the country have a speed limit which they are supposed to observe, just as the juggernauts have, and which they do not observe. When a State body has to provide transport to, say, the Fanad Peninsula, then clearly the time factor should be considered within the legal situation.</P>
    <P>In regard to wandering stock, while driving through Phoenix Park today on the way to this House I saw horses wandering all over the place.  Especially at <Col N="2692" /> night these can be a danger and I do not know how we can control that.  As far as I am aware if the driver of a car runs into an animal of any description &mdash; I am subject to correction on this &mdash; he is responsible.  Wandering stock is prevalent all over Dublin and other counties. Some legislation should be introduced to protect the drivers of vehicles in this situation.</P>
    <P>We are apprehensive about many other aspects of the Bill and we will deal with them on Committee Stage.  While in general we welcome the principal of the Bill, we have some reservations about it. Of course, we will comply with the wishes of the Minister to have as speedy a passage of the Bill through the House as possible.</P>

      <P>I welcome the legislation under discussion and compliment the Minister on the way he has presented it.  It is very clear.  Before dealing with the provisions in the Bill I should like to make a few general observations.  Some of the points made by the last speaker are interesting.  Given that we do not have an underground system in Dublin or an efficient public transport system, it is inevitable that people will bring their cars, those who can afford to do so, to the centre of the city.  That presents a huge problem especially when one considers the need to complete Dublin Corporation's plan for an outer and inner tangent road.  I hope the Minister will insist that the eastern by-pass is proceeded with.  The city needs such a by-pass.  It is very important that it be completed for the proper control of traffic in the city. The inner tangent roads that have been completed in the city have meant a better distribution of the traffic crossing the Liffey from north to south.  Heretofore about 80 per cent of the traffic crossed on two bridges but that traffic has been distributed now between four or five bridges with the promise of an additional toll bridge.  I hope those developments will proceed speedily and will help ease the traffic problems in the city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the last speaker who said that discretion should be exercised by some of our traffic wardens when applying their energies.  I am aware of a person who when he got a puncture in Cork Street drove to a filling station where he pulled in on the footpath and got assistance from an attendant to change the wheel.  While the work was <Col N="2694" /> being carried out a traffic warden gave him a ticket.  One week later another man told me that when he stopped his car at James' Street to help an elderly lady across the road he got a ticket.  It transpired that the same earnest traffic warden was involved in the two instances.  It can happen when people are too dedicated to their duties that they can create more problems than they solve.  There was a similar problem at Inchicore where a traffic warden caused havoc with business life.  Banks could not accept lodgments, licenced premises were not doing a lot of business and building societies complained also.  The business people involved got together and pointed out that the person involved would have to be reasonable about this, that the system was supposed to be in the interest of the community but because of the way it was operated the community was suffering.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister asks the gardaí and the traffic wardens to use their discretion in Dublin city in applying the law.  Any law needs the support of the people if it is to succeed and if the officers involved antagonise people they will not be too happy.  The Minister gave some interesting statistics today.  If one takes the number of traffic offences mentioned by the Minister and adds to that the figures for other offences under road traffic legislation one will see that 92 per cent of the work of the District Court is taken up by traffic matters.  Is it any wonder that some of the more serious matters such as drug related crimes and crimes of vandalism and burglary are not being dealt with speedily because the entire system is being clogged up with traffic control matters? The Dáil Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism should investigate this matter and issue a recommendation. Is it not time that we had a special court to deal with traffic offences so that all such offences can be taken away from the District Court?  I accept that some of the cases involved are serious but the majority could be dealt with in a traffic court outside the mainstream of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is little point in one having to wait to go to court to pay a fine for a parking offence.  The chances are that the <Col N="2695" /> fine would be increased.  Only in a few cases are they reduced.  People should be encouraged to pay fines a short time after they commit an offence.  In the Dublin area we have a traffic committee of Dublin Corporation, a traffic study group for the city consisting of representatives of Dublin Corporation, CIE and the Garda, a traffic study group for Dublin county under the local authority, a separate traffic arrangement for Dún Laoghaire, the Garda Commissioner who has statutory powers under traffic regulations, the transport task force, the Department of the Environment, and, to some extent, the Department of Communications, all involved in dealing with traffic problems.  In fact, under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Bill the Department of Justice will be involved also.  One of the reasons we are not being successful in dealing with our traffic problems and offences is because so many groups are looking after these matters. Many of these matters could be left to local authorities and it should not be necessary to involve the central authorities. For instance, I do not see any reason why Dublin city council could not decide tomorrow to introduce fines similar to those mentioned by the Minister.  They should be given the power to deal with such matters.  We should stop the nonsense of up to seven Government Departments, the head of the Garda force and other groups being involved.  Local authorities should be given power to decide on parking regulations, the provision of double yellow lines and the amount of the fines.  I accept that the Minister must update the law but for the future we should ask local authorities to decide on traffic offences within their areas and give them power to make the necessary by-laws.  The extra tiers should be eliminated.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave the House details of the number of people killed on our roads and injured in car accidents.  It is interesting to note that in Northern Ireland more people were killed on the roads than have been killed in the troubles since 1979.  It is extraordinary, bearing in mind the value we put on life, that that can <Col N="2696" /> happen.  We all take this in our stride and we have not tried to deal with the problem. This legislation goes some of the way by introducing penalties.  We will all be obliged to adhere to this legislation. Deputies and Senators are no different to the rest of the population.  When this law is passed the community will have to take more seriously their obligations concerning traffic-related deaths and accidents.</P>
    <P>Some of the main thoroughfares in this city have been turned into mini-Mondelo Parks.  In parts of my constituency where there is a network of roads people deliberately steal cars and in many cases they drive past the gardaí looking for a chase. They drive into the housing estates and go skidding around corners hoping the gardaí will follow them.  The difficulty facing the gardaí is that if they give chase these people might crash and kill somebody and the Garda car may do the same. I am very glad that the Criminal Justice Bill will deal with this problem because it has got out of control.  During the Dublin West by-election a garda and I were crossing the road when a Volkswagen Golf car came skidding around the corner.  There was nothing unusual about this.  I am glad to see legislation is being stiffened and that extra penalties are being introduced to deal with people who steal cars and with the deliberate offences which endanger the lives of our citizens.</P>
    <P>We import cars which cost in the region of £30,000 or £40,000 and in many cases they have Lego-type locks.  These manufacturers should be obliged to put safety locks on those cars which will make it very difficult for them to be stolen.  Fast cars are being stolen because the Garda cars cannot catch them.  The manufacturers should be obliged to put decent locking devices on these cars to make it almost impossible for them to be stolen.</P>
    <P>I had a particularly bad experience on one occasion.  It was twilight.  I was coming along a road and found a young man lying there with his forehead badly gashed, pumping blood, and a bicycle lying on the side of the road.  He had come around the corner with his head down and had not seen a trailer parked without lights.  Luckily he survived.  If <Col N="2697" /> you drive along the quays or in certain areas in this city you will see a number of parked trailers left without lights, abandoned, punctured, with ripped tyres and so on.  These trailers are left there and nobody does anything about them.  The owners of these vehicles are registered and should be called to account for abandoning their trailers in an area where they could endanger the lives of our citizens. It is time we provided parking facilities for these trailers because if we do not, people will park their trailers all over the streets.  The present situation is causing grave concern.  Reports have been made of three, four or five abandoned vehicles and the owners are well known.  Such people should be prosecuted for abandoning their vehicles in a dangerous way. I can tell the House that it is not a very pleasant sight to come across an injured person with blood pumping from his head.</P>
    <P>In Britain they have the MOT where vehicles are tested for road worthiness after so many years.  There are many vehicles in this city which should not be on the roads.  During the period of Idi Amin, dictator of Uganda, I remember hearing of him pulling in beside a broken-down Volkswagen with two wings hanging off, a number-plate hanging off and a sign on the back saying &ldquo;Ugandan Ambassador&rdquo;.  That was supposed to be funny: but why are vehicles like that allowed on our roads?  This would not happen in Germany or Britain. We accept vehicles on our roads which are obviously dangerous and which are so old that they should be on the scrap-heap. I cannot understand why we have not followed the principle enshrined in the British legislation which requires cars to be tested frequently.  I hope the Minister will consider this and amend this legislation before it passes through this House.</P>
    <P>The objective of this Bill is to make this country a safer place for all our citizens. We purport to be tackling this problem under this legislation and parts of the Criminal Justice Bill, but the reality is that we do not have an overall policy &mdash; our approach is piecemeal.  We do not have a central reference as to the road-worthiness <Col N="2698" /> of cars.  We do not test people properly before issuing driving licences. A person could be half blind or have a weak heart and still he will be given a driving licence.  Our driving test is very unsatisfactory and must be scrapped.  If there is resistance from any quarter it must be overcome.  We must introduce a proper driving test.  Nobody can defend the present situation where a person whose health is so frail that they could do themselves an injury can still qualify for a licence.</P>
    <P>There should be some type of testing of people in that category before they do themselves and others grave injury. There are people driving around in cars who cannot differentiate between yellow and green lights, who cannot see traffic signs and yet they are issued with a driving licence.  If the Minister and his Department are really serious about the whole area of traffic offences, about making our cities and countryside safer places in which to drive, then surely they have an obligation to do more than simply index fines.  Why are we not tackling this area?  Why are we not tackling the problem of unroadworthy cars?  The whole of this problem needs to be examined in context and until we do so we will not be attacking the kernel of the problem.  The Minister says that he intends introducing a further Road Traffic Bill before the end of the year.  I hope he will consider incorporating those matters in that Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to An Foras Forbartha in the course of his introductory remarks.  I have serious misgivings about the standards being laid down by An Foras Forbartha.  From my experience of local matters in Dublin Corporation I know those standards have been used, for instance, to deny proper traffic control systems in areas where they are blatantly necessary.  I have one case in mind &mdash; I mentioned this probably three times before this incident happened and a couple of times since &mdash; where traffic lights were asked for on a roadway in Crumlin on which there had been a number of accidents, where there had also been a number of near misses, where at the crossroads three of the four walls of gardens had been knocked down at various <Col N="2699" /> times by people speeding along in cars, which had something to do with a difficult section of the road.  Various tests were carried out by An Foras Forbartha, road checks, the accident record and so on.  An Foras Forbartha came up with the conclusion that there was no problem whatsoever with that particular crossing. Local councillors insist that there is a problem there and they were so petitioned by local residents.  On the day that the corporation eventually agreed that they would send the councillors' representations to the traffic study group there were three people killed and one person seriously injured in a car accident on that very crossing, that on a crossing we were told complied with An Foras Forbartha standards.  I have always doubted the standard itself or its application and I have expressed that reservation publicly on a number of occasions.  Certainly it was confirmed on that occasion.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is serious about having our roads rendered safe he should ensure that the Garda Síochána perform their duty, keeping records in Garda stations of the number of accidents that take place.  Whenever there is an accident the first thing anybody asks is: how many accidents occurred at that point before, or how many people have been killed there.  When they check with the local superintendent he may well say &mdash; nobody &mdash; but all the locals will be able to tell one: yes, there were ten, 20 or 30 accidents there and that the Garda were called to the scene.  Surely the least we can expect is that, if these standards are to be applied, they will be based on information scientifically collected. Surely also the agents of the State can take their responsibility seriously to ensure that what happened in the case of three of my constituents does not recur, in other words that the Foras Forbartha standard is scrapped or that all relevant information is kept up-to-date in the case of somebody wanting traffic lights provided at a certain point or whatever.</P>
    <P>The overall thrust of the Bill is that to be severe, to penalise, to put in the boot is likely to lead to success in rendering our roads safer.  To some extent that may <Col N="2700" /> be true but it does not entirely cover the situation.  We must endeavour to get people to realise some of the things they do.  There are responsible members of society who, through thoughtlessness or otherwise, park their cars in wrong places, do not or are somewhat late observing signals or whatever.  Take the example of a person not wearing his or her safety belt, of minor indiscretions, say late signalling of turning left or right. Would it not be more beneficial had we the old courtesy type of cop service for that purpose?  Rather than fining somebody on the first occasion would it not be preferable that they would pull somebody over to the side of the road and ask them: do you know what these laws are all about, you are supposed to signal in time, you should give way to somebody else on the road, or you are supposed to wear a safety belt.  For minor traffic offences that would have greater effect and a person will remember next time round. But if people find tickets stuck on their windscreens they will go off and pay the fines, forgetting thereafter.  But if, say, a courtesy cop takes the time to draw the offence to their attention there is a better chance of generally improving courtesy on our roads, improving safety of drivers and pedestrians and of reducing the number of offences.  I hope that the Minister, together with his colleague, the Minister for Justice, will give consideration to that concept of the courtesy cop, particularly in urban areas.</P>
    <P>I welcome the general approach to the Bill.  I hope the Minister will bear in mind some of the contributions today when introducing Committee Stage and the further legislation he has promised later in the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett (Dublin North-West) Mr. Barrett (Dublin North-West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-West):</i> I welcome the opportunity of making a brief contribution on this Bill whose main purpose is to increase penalties for offences. While we on this side of the House agree there is need to increase some of those penalties, I have certain reservations in relation to the increase from £20 to £150 for what might be described as a minor parking offence or an offence such as that of a person not wearing a safety <Col N="2701" /> belt and which appears to be much too severe.  With regard to the wearing of seat belts it must be remembered that there are a number of people whose day-to-day work may involve them in deliveries of various kinds, in, say, milk deliveries.  There are people who act as insurance collectors and many others who go from door to door.  It can be a nuisance to such people to have to put on a seat belt each time.  Yet, in accordance with the proposals here, a motorist who is not wearing a seat belt is liable to that fine.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the ordinary parking meter offence in this city at present is £5. However, I do not understand what is meant in the Bill by a minor parking offence.  I know there is a great problem with parking, that many motorists ignore the single or double yellow lines and continually park on them.  There has been reference here also to parking tickets being placed on cars.  We are aware also that this is the main function of traffic wardens.  Perhaps the Minister would draw the attention of his colleague, the Minister for Justice, to gardaí going along roads placing parking tickets.  This job should be confined to traffic wardens.  I know that when Fianna Fáil were in office they increased their number and that there is a panel of them that can be called on to do the job.  In the age in which we live, with the amount of crime being perpetrated in cities, it is an appalling waste of manpower to see a garda spending his day placing parking tickets on cars. Indeed this increased fine could be seen as a further penalisation of the already hard-pressed motorist.  There has been mention already of the increase in road tax, in the price of petrol and indeed of insurance cover.  It may well be contended that we have the highest cost car insurance cover in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Displaying of an insurance disc on cars has been mentioned, but the PMPA have for a considerable length of time followed the rule that where you insure your car with them they give you a display disc. Every other car insurance company should follow suit and, in fact, it should be obligatory.  It would make it a lot easier for the Garda Síochána to identify <Col N="2702" /> the uninsured cars.  The car can no longer be described as a luxury, it is a necessity.</P>
    <P>The increase in the penalty for dangerous driving, has also been mentioned, but just driving along our roads can be hazardous. At times the roads resemble a battlefield.  Many drivers ignore the white or double white lines and overtake at dangerous corners.  Something should be done about this and I hope that the increase in the fine will help.</P>
    <P>The number of defective vehicles on our roads is increasing.  Many even break down and have to be towed away.  One wonders how so many are allowed on the road.  In Britain and other European countries such vehicles would not be allowed on the road.  These countries have strict regulations and their motorists take a great pride in their cars.  The Englishman spends a lot of time washing and polishing his car and there it is easy, unlike here, to identify number plates. Many of our number plates are obscured by grit and dirt.</P>
    <P>Driving without a licence has become quite usual.  The Minister is going to increase the fine for this offence from £100 to £1,000.  This has to be done because it is very unfair that some should have to obtain a licence while others drive around unlicensed.  The Minister is also going to increase fines from £100 to £1,000 for those who apply for a licence while already disqualified from driving.</P>
    <P>The fine for driving while under the influence of drink is going to be increased to £500 and for a second offence to £1,000.  Drunken drivers are a menace on the road and everybody would agree that something should be done about this, because a great number are killed by them.  Much has been said about the number of innocent people who have lost their lives in the North of Ireland since the troubles started up there, but they do not compare in any way with the numbers killed on the roads in the South of Ireland through drunken driving.  Our law with regard to this offence has never been seriously enforced.  The Minister has given figures for prosecutions for drunken driving, but that is a very small percentage of those who drive while having <Col N="2703" /> a far higher level of alcohol in their blood than is allowed.</P>
    <P>In the North of Ireland, the RUC have a policy of waiting outside licensed premises at night time.  If a man who has drunk an excessive amount of alcohol attempts to drive a car, he is immediately taken into custody and the law is strictly enforced.  However, in the Republic you can see the number of cars in the car parks of licensed premises and observe the number who spend the night drinking and come out to drive away, sometimes along a dark, country road.  It would make you wonder that more people are not killed.  Not only do they spend the normal length of time in these licensed premises, but we have a policy of issuing bar extensions, the number of which is increasing year by year.  The English have strict laws in this respect and nobody is served drink after the prescribed time.</P>
    <P>The number of disqualified people who are still driving is also increasing.  Provincial papers report cases of this sort every week.  The strange thing is that after being disqualified, these people can get back on the roads again in a few months, if they have sufficient money to go to court.  If they have not, they can apply for legal aid and appeal the decision. Sometimes for a trivial excuse the original disqualification is removed.  I recall one case where the excuse used was that the disqualification was causing severe hardship because the person involved could not drive his father and mother to Mass on Sundays.  The Justice considered that the old man and woman should not be prevented from going to Mass, so the man got his licence back. The full length of disqualification, whether of six or 12 months, should be adhered to.  Some of these people have been drunk in charge of a car and they should have remembered the threat and inconvenience of disqualification before they began to drive.</P>
    <P>There is no mention in the Bill of the number of stray animals on our roads, which are a menace.  The number of people killed or involved in accidents with such animals is increasing every year, particularly in the case of itinerants' <Col N="2704" /> horses.  A number of my own constituents have lost their lives or been involved in such traffic accidents.  A few years ago a young man who had served a number of years in the Defence Forces and served two terms in Lebanon on a peace-keeping mission was fatally injured in a traffic accident with an itinerant's horse on the Ballymun road while out visiting relations. In my constituency, in the Finglas area, we have many green places.  One local farmer lets all his cattle out on to the greens and they obstruct traffic on the road.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-West):</i> I shall not go too far.  Nothing has been done about this problem of straying animals.  There is little the Garda can do because if they round up the animals and bring them to a pound they must provide food for them.  There is a very small fine for this offence, so it is too expensive to implement.  If a stray animal comes into your garden, if you drive it out and it is involved with a cyclist or motorist and serious damage is caused to either the bicycle or the car, the person who drove out the animal is responsible for the damage. There is no onus on the animal's owner.  If the animal is injured the onus is also on the householder who drove out the animal to compensate the owner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also concerned about the problem of unauthorised car park attendants on Dublin streets.  I have brought this to the attention of several Ministers but I will mention it here again.  These car park attendants are only there to make money and many unfortunate motorists have been tricked into believing the attendant will look after their cars.  A case was brought to my attention where a man visiting his wife in the Rotunda hospital parked his car at Parnell Square and gave 50p to the attendant to mind it.  He spent an hour or two in the hospital and when he came out neither the man nor the car were there.  The Garda are aware of the problem but say there is nothing they can do about it.  This would not be tolerated <Col N="2705" /> in any other city in the world.  As Deputy Mitchell said, the buck is being passed from one Department to another.  Dublin Corporation say they have no responsibility in the matter; they say it is the responsibility of the Department of Justice, who in turn say it is a matter for the Department of the Environment.  I hope the streets will soon be cleared of these unauthorised collectors.</P>
    <P>There is also an increasing problem with regard to cyclists riding unlit bicycles. It is compulsory to have a light on a bicycle but the law is never enforced. These people are not alone risking their own lives but the lives of other people as well.  Many an unfortunate motorist has had an accident involving a cyclist whom he did not see.  There is also the problem of cyclists on paths.  When this is brought to the attention of the Garda they give a sympathetic hearing but that is all.  They say that many of these cyclists are young children on their way home from school and that if you force them to cycle on the road they may be involved in an accident. I do not know what the answer is but many people are concerned about the problem.</P>
    <P>There is great concern about heavy commercial vehicles parked after dark in narrow, unlighted roads.  The vehicles have no lights on them and have been the cause of many accidents.  I know this matter has come before the traffic department of Dublin Corporation.  The corporation were asked to provide parks around the city for these vehicles, but so far nothing has been done.  These vehicles are using roads which are not suitable for heavy traffic and there should be a limitation on the size of vehicles travelling on some of our roads.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the Minister for introducing this Bill and I hope it will have a speedy passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to increase the penalties for the offences under the Road Traffic Act, 1961.  The intention is no doubt that the extent of offences committed under that will be cut down.  There is a grave doubt as to whether that will happen and whether it <Col N="2706" /> will be adequate to increase the penalties and thereby achieve a reduction in the number and extent of road traffic offences committed.  As far as I know it is rarely that even the existing maximum penalties provided for are applied.  In the overwhelming bulk of prosecutions under road traffic legislation a penalty is imposed far below even the existing maxima laid down in the Road Traffic Act, 1961, as amended.  That being so, simply providing for increases is unlikely to have much effect on the extent and numbers of offences committed under this legislation. A different approach will have to be made if we are to achieve positive results.</P>
      <P>The major problem arises from the fact that our whole transportation system generally is geared far too much to private and road transport.  We should ensure that there is a proper and efficient public transport system &mdash; fast, reliable, cheap bus and rail services catering for densely populated areas like Tallaght, which is awaiting its link with Bray.  Until a reliable service is provided the pressure will be on people to bring their cars into the centre of cities to congest them, to create traffic jams, to give rise to all sorts of unlawful parking, unauthorised parking and dangerous parking &mdash; all the things the increased penalties provided for in this Bill are designed to avoid.  I do not think that will work.  It is like trying to hold back the tide.  If the pressures are there to use private transport, which is the case largely because of the inefficiencies and inadequacies of the public transport system, it will not be possible to hold back that tide.  The cars will still come in and willy-nilly commit the petty offences for which penalties are provided here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to meet the problem and we have not done that.  Juggernauts were referred to by previous speakers.  They have become an increasing fact of life in our society.  Our transportation of goods is geared to these juggernauts.  Dangerous parking is laid down as an offence under the 1961 Act and the penalty for it is increased here.  The parking of a juggernaut on any public road would meet the description of dangerous parking.  It is impossible to park one of those vehicles <Col N="2707" /> on any public road anywhere in such a way that it could be regarded as safe.  Yet they have to be parked somewhere.  They have to be parked during daylight hours from time to time, and they have to be parked at night.  In few areas, if any, do the local authorities insist on the provision of public parks where these vehicles can be put safely at night.</P>
    <P>The drivers of these vehicles usually live in suburban estates.  They usually make a start at 5 o'clock or 6 o'clock in the morning.  Understandably, they park the juggernauts near the ordinary residential suburban estate where they live to be ready for an early start the next morning.  There is nowhere in any of those estates that they can park those trucks with any degree of safety.  The parking of them is extremely dangerous. An increasing number of the offences under this category arise out of the use of these vehicles, particularly when they are driven at night without lights &mdash; a very common offence &mdash; and a car coming up behind them can go underneath them causing serious injury to the driver.  We have to direct our local authority arrangements to meet that problem.</P>
    <P>We have come a long way from the very first Act ever passed dealing with motor cars which was the Locomotives Act, 1861.  That included the generic description of motor cars.  The preamble to that Act was quite prophetic.  It said: &ldquo;Whereas the use of locomotives is likely to become common on turnpikes and other roads...&rdquo;.  In that Act the maximum lawful speed was fixed at ten miles an hour on the public highway and five miles an hour going through any city, town or village.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  It is observed there.  That situation pertained in 1861 in a very different context and in many respects we have not geared our town planning and our road planning to meet the problem.  Until that is done it will remain with us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the insurance of vehicles <Col N="2708" /> and prosecutions for driving without insurance was referred to by the Minister and by some previous speakers.  This is a matter of the utmost importance and the emphasis given to it is well placed.  Reference was made to the urgent need for a new scheme under which insurance discs would be required to be affixed to the windscreens of cars.  I entirely support that view.  It would go a long way towards dealing with the very wide extent of uninsured driving we are faced with at present and which the Garda, with the manpower at present available to them, seem to be quite incapable of controlling.</P>
    <P>It is very important too that knowledge of whether a car is insured should be easily accessible to the public.  While that might appear to be the case at present, the reality is that it is not.  When a person is the unfortunate victim of an accident and sustains an injury, on occasion it can be quite difficult to ascertain (a) whether the car is insured and (b) if it is insured which insurance company carries the cover on that car.</P>
    <P>It should be obligatory on the car registration authorities to note in their records the full particulars of the insurance when they register a vehicle.  It should be obligatory on the insurance companies to provide a central computerised register and a simplified procedure whereby any member of the public could by means of a search ascertain whether a particular vehicle had insurance cover.  This can be quite a problem in many cases where people receive injuries.  I know the Garda are supposed to investigate these things and get the insurance details but, very often due to the pressures on the Garda, that is not done.</P>
    <P>While another offence is referred to in the Bill and an increased penalty is provided for it, the penalty is not harsh enough.  I refer to the offence of the hit-and-run driver.  That offence is very much on the increase in our society, regrettably. All too frequently a person is left quite seriously injured lying by the roadside. The car driver, possibly drunk, drives off leaving the person lying there abandoned.  Anybody who does that should be liable to a mandatory custodial sentence.  It is the most unforgivable <Col N="2709" /> thing to do &mdash; to hit someone for six with your car and leave him or her lying on the roadside.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate victim &mdash; and there are many of them &mdash; is doubly unfortunate. First, very often the motorist concerned is not traced.  Secondly, the unfortunate victim is unable to get compensation for his injuries from any source.  The Minister referred to the Motor Insurers' Bureau.  Under the agreement, which has remained unchanged for some 40 years, the Motor Insurers' Bureau have a cop out.  Under that antiquated agreement they are enabled to escape paying any compensation to the victim of a hit-and-run accident.  That is scandalous, and the sooner it is remedied the better.</P>
    <P>We have to look for new ways to try to control some of these offences, and particularly the persistent offence of driving an uninsured vehicle.  A possible new method of tackling it which the Minister might wish to consider would be this.  In the case of a person who has been convicted on two or three occasions of repeated offences of driving without insurance, it should be open to the District Court to make an order impounding the vehicle for a certain length of time, a month, two months or three months.  In some circumstances that sanction might be found to be a helpful addition to the armoury.</P>
    <P>Many of the range of these District Court prosecutions which the Minister analysed as occupying so much of the time of the District Court should be taken out of that ambit.  The Minister said the courts have a role in evaluating the degree of culpability involved in each case.  I can assure the Minister that very many of those cases are dealt with on a very speedy basis and a district justice may go through 60 to 100 cases in an hour.  There is very little evaluation of the degree of culpability in those cases. It is more reminiscent of an administrative process than a judicial process.  It would be a good idea to give some thought and attention to the question of expanding those offences that might more appropriately be dealt with on the fixed fine basis.  This would take many <Col N="2710" /> thousands of petty cases of that nature out of the ambit of the District Court which is not geared to deal with them in the numbers that come before it.</P>
    <P>Attention is given in the Bill to the increases in monetary fines.  One factor that is not referred to in the Bill, although it should be a factor in the minds of district justices, is the financial position in life of the person who has to pay the fine.  A fine of £50 on one person could be a very heavy penalty but could be a trifling matter to another.  Some directives ought to be available to the Judiciary when the briefing scheme comes into operation.  They should have regard to the status and position in life of the person on whom a fine is imposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation. I am glad that the Minister recognises that any legislation can merely support the process of law enforcement. Without the co-operation of the citizens and the support of the Garda, as well as the constructive work of the judges, legislation on its own cannot solve the problem of road traffic accidents and offences. I am pleased that the Minister recognises the deficiency in existing legislation and I look forward to seeing the further legislation he has promised for later this year.</P>
      <P>I now turn to the question of the uniformity of sentencing under road traffic legislation.  The divergence in sentences from one end of the country to the other in the District Court and Circuit Court is undesirable and leads to a lack of faith in the law, as well as bringing the law into disrepute.  The time has arrived when a general arrangement for uniformity should be brought into operation, whether through a training course for judges or some other means.  As an immediate measure the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court, the President of the Circuit Court and the President of the District Court should hold urgent talks with the judges under their responsibility with a view to devising some system of uniform sentencing.  We have a ludicrous situation at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To highlight the position I want to give the House a record of what I consider to <Col N="2711" /> be a scandal.  No other word could fully describe the circumstances I will outline. The problem in relating this case is that the circumstances were so horrific and the family tragedies and agony of the parents so terrible that to continue to debate it could be seen as merely carrying on the torture of the parents.  I feel it is important that this House be told of the case and this is the first opportunity I have had to place it on record.  It is appropriate now because we are approaching the anniversary of the accident.</P>
    <P>This accident took place on 19 February last year just outside Drogheda.  It was a horrific accident in which five young people aged between 18 and 21 were killed and two others seriously injured. A truck hit a mini van in which the young people were travelling and the force of the impact drove the van approximately 90 feet from the point of impact.  The case was brought to court and there was a jury trial.  The driver of the truck was charged with dangerous driving causing death and with leaving the scene of the accident, as well as a number of other offences.  The jury considered the case for a period of between two and three hours and brought in a verdict of guilty.  The judge complimented the jury on their work and indicated that they could not have brought in any other verdict.  He said it was as serious a case as ever he had before him.  He also indicated that because he felt so strongly about the incident he would not pronounce sentence on that day in case he would impose too harsh a sentence. He put back sentencing for a number of weeks.</P>
    <P>Eventually he pronounced sentence. He said he would base it on the fact that the individual concerned had no intention to kill the young people and said he would also take into account the condition of the road.  My understanding is that there is no requirement to prove intent in a dangerous driving charge.  If there was intention to kill it would be manslaughter. The jury had already considered the case and the road conditions were taken into account.  They decided that the man was guilty of dangerous <Col N="2712" /> driving.  That judge, having considered the verdict, merely suspended the individual from driving and bound him to the peace for a number of years.  A financial fine was also imposed but not a prison sentence.  A prison sentence would not have brought back to life one of those young people but justice demanded some form of prison sentence due to the loss of life of five young people and the terrible injuries suffered by the other two.  This judge on the day the jury brought in their verdict decided he did not want to impose sentence because of how strongly he felt about the case, but then imposed this totally ludicrous sentence which brings the whole process of the law into disrepute.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the feeling in my constituency about this case is that respect for the law has been seriously undermined.  This sentence was imposed last autumn and this is the first opportunity I have had to refer to it in the House. I am calling for some accountability by our judges.  The President of the Circuit Court should call the judge in question before him and ask him to account for this judgment.  The Minister should ask the President of the Circuit Court to make public the result of his hearing with this judge.  It is necessary to clear the air about this case.  It is a scandal in my view and in the view of many people in my area.  I do not use that phrase lightly.</P>

      <P>Before the Acting Chairman came into the Chair I was making the point that the introduction of legislation and listing a series of fines is only one part of the whole process of law making.  I appeal to the Chair to allow me finish this particular point.  The problem will not be solved on its own by merely introducing legislation.  It can only be solved by the Garda enforcing the law, respect for the courts and by proper judgments.  The judgment and the sentencing in this case would not bring back those young people and would not have healed the wounds of the parents, the brothers and sisters of those young <Col N="2713" /> people and the community in which they lived but at least justice would have been seen to be done.  It is necessary in order to have respect for the law that this judge is asked by the President of the Circuit Court to account for the judgment and that the President of the Circuit Court make public his decision on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have finished what I want to say on that aspect.  With regard to the Bill before the House and the Bill which the Minister is preparing I feel it is time to give serious consideration to the imposition of mandatory custodial sentencing for drunken driving offences when there is a death.  I know that a good case can be made that mandatory sentencing is not such a good thing but I feel it is time to give serious consideration to it, just as in the case made by the previous speaker for mandatory custodial sentencing for hit-and-run incidents.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of the road traffic legislation is the civil area.  I referred to the tragic case in my constituency of the five young people who were killed.  There is also the civil action involved and the mathematical calculation of compensation. The actuarial method used for calculating compensation in civil cases is such that if a young person is killed the law says that the parents gain by the death of the young person because the parents have no longer to educate, care or clothe that young person.  There is compensation for mental distress.  The whole system of compensation for the death of young people should be looked at by the Minister.  I am grateful to the Chair for allowing me to make the case about the particular judge.  It is not my form to mention specific cases in the House but I feel very strongly about this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would now like to refer to the wearing of seat belts.  With regard to the figures given by the Minister, I do not accept that one in two use seat belts.  That is a fairly optimistic figure.  I believe that fewer than one in two use seat belts.  We should see greater enforcement in relation to the wearing of seat belts, not <Col N="2714" /> necessarily through fines.  Gentle warnings and advice should be given by members of the Garda Síochána.  They have been very sucessful in relation to respect for pedestrian crossings.  They have also been very successful with regard to respect for bus lanes.  Motorists generally respect bus lanes.  If the Garda put in a concentrated effort to protect the public from themselves with regard to wearing seat belts, a lot of good will be created. There should be some co-operation between the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Justice, in relation to making a special effort about wearing seat belts.  It is not just wearing seat belts we have to consider but the dreadful injuries caused to people who sit in the front of cars and do not wear seat belts. We should introduce a provision in our legislation that any parent who allows a young child to travel in the front seat of a car should be fined.  It is ludicrous to take such a risk with a young child.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not deal with car insurance, but when we are dealing with any Bill which deals with road traffic people will talk about car insurance because it is a very important aspect of the matter.  It is time to take a fresh look at the whole car insurance market rather than tinkering around with existing methods of car insurance.  We should have a look at the system of car insurance and the cartel in relation to it.  There should be another inquiry into car insurance like the O'Donoghue inquiry in the sixties, in view of the extra cars and traffic generally on our roads now.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill but I hope that those who are charged by the State with enforcing the legislation in our courts will take note of the general intention of this Bill which is to tidy up offences under road traffic legislation and that there be uniformity and accountability and some system of training for those judges charged by the State with enforcing the law.  Having been a member of a Government I know that names come before those in Government for appointment as judges. When they are looking for appointment they are the greatest, most knowledgable people you come across.  I wonder where that knowledge goes when they are sitting <Col N="2715" /> on a bench.  From experience it is obvious that somewhere along the line from the time they leave the Cabinet table to the time they arrive in the District and Circuit Courts they lose a great deal of that knowledge.  It is like sand going through fingers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Members, I welcome the Bill, the purpose of which is to increase penalties for offences under the Road Traffic Acts, 1961-1978.  These increases relate almost entirely to the maximum monetary penalties applying to road traffic offences.  Enforcement of road traffic legislation is primarily a matter for the Garda Síochána but the belief long entrenched in the public mind is that enforcement of the traffic laws falls well short of being fully effective.  Practices commonly observed such as the persistent leaving of cars on clearways and double yellow lines are not consistent with rigorous enforcement of the law.  There must be a suspicion at large that a proportion of the prosecutions for infringement come to light only following accidents. I appreciate that the Garda are under certain constraints.  For example, if check-points were to be established in Dublin rush-hour traffic the resulting traffic jams would cause intense public resentment, but I believe that the Garda are reluctant to prosecute for minor offences because of the trivial amounts of the fines.  At present for lesser offences the norm is a fine of up to £20 for a first offence and £50 for subsequent offences. Some of these monetary fines have not been revised and have lost most of the deterrent effect which they were intended to have when introduced over 20 years ago.  Whether or not this acts as a disincentive to bringing proceedings, it certainly diminishes the fear of prosecution on the part of the motorist and consequently enfeebles the law.  A revision of penalties to a realistic level would appear to be a necessary step for that reason.  Unlike Deputy Fitzsimons, I welcome the section of the Bill which increases the maximum fine attached to general penalties under the Road Traffic Acts from the present £20 to £150 in the <Col N="2716" /> case of a first offence and from £50 to £350 for the second and subsequent offences.</P>
      <P>Many accidents are due to a momentary relaxation of vigilance or to bad judgment.  These are accidents in the full sense of the word and we must accept that we will always have accidents of that nature, but there is plenty of evidence to show that deliberate law-breaking adds to the road traffic toll.  The most serious of such cases is the scandalous flouting of the law in relation to drink and driving. In an unremitting stream of accidents the drivers concerned have more than the legally permissible amount of alcohol in their blood.  These accidents occur mostly during the hours of darkness particularly on Saturday and Sunday nights.  Taking the four years up to 1982, fatal accidents during the hours of 9 p.m. to 3 a.m. were no less than two and a half times the number that occurred between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. when the numbers of cars on the road were much higher.  Ireland has proportionately a higher night time accident problem than other European countries have.  Six out of ten people killed in accidents are killed during these hours. While we cannot give a precise reason for this exceptionally bad record, we can be certain that alcohol impairment, fatigue and visual problems coupled with Irish social habits play their part.  The number of cases of death and serious injury occurring especially on Saturday and Sunday nights as a result of drunken driving is little short of a national scandal.  For this reason I welcome the proposal in the Bill which increases the penalty from £500 to £1,000 for driving under the influence of drink and I regret that the custodial penalty and disqualification penalty remain the same.  Drunken driving is a most serious offence and should be dealt with accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this section of the Bill the permitted alcohol content in 100 mm of blood is 100 mg which is higher than in most countries.  In Britain for example, the permitted level is 80 mg.  The suggestion for some time past has been that 100 mg may be an acceptable level for drivers aged 25 years and over and a case has been made for a different level for <Col N="2717" /> younger drivers.  It is significant that each year a large proportion of drivers involved in serious accidents between 9 p.m. and 3 a.m. are very young.  The implication would appear to be that a differential in the levels of blood-alcohol content according to age should be fixed. I ask the Minister when he is bringing in the new legislation promised later in the year to decide the level of blood-alcohol content on age.</P>
    <P>Still on the subject of driving under the influence of drink a problem which is yet statistically unimportant but which may become serious is driving under the influence of drugs and the Minister might like to take this into account in the new legislation.</P>
    <P>Uninsured driving is so common on our roads at present that it has become a national scandal involving wholesale disregard for the law and causes grave injustice to those motorists who insure their vehicles and in doing so are obliged to carry the uninsured minority.  Naturally no statistics are available of the number of people who drive without insurance. We have figures only for those who are prosecuted.  In 1980 the number of people prosecuted for this offence was 50,500. In 1981 it was 47,600 and, according to the latest figures available, in 1982 the number charged with this offence was 62,264.  I believe that people in the insurance business understand that last figure to be much higher but they cannot support that belief.  Whatever the numbers, we know from experience that uninsured drivers imposed an extra £8.9 million in claims on insured motorists in 1981 and between £14 million and £16 million in 1982.  One would imagine that the volume of prosecutions would be a greater deterrent to uninsured drivers, but obviously this is not the case.  The reason why it has failed in the past is very obvious.  The maximum fine prescribed by section 56(3) of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, for driving without insurance is £100.</P>
    <P>There is also a provision for imprisonment of up to six months but I understand that the question of imprisonment seldom arises, and the fines imposed are often a lot less than the maximum. Deputy Taylor dealt with that issue at <Col N="2718" /> length.  The result is that the penalty for being caught for driving without insurance cover is often between £25 and £50, in any event not exceeding £100.  Since the annual cost of insuring a vehicle can be anything from £200 to £1,000 the risk of being fined carries little or no weight with a person prepared to neglect insuring his or her vehicle.  I am pleased to note that there is provision in the Bill to increase the fine for such an offence to £1,000.</P>
    <P>I am a little concerned that the Bill deals only with maximum fines.  The reason most of the fines imposed are a lot less than the maximum is that under section 43(2) of the Administration of Justice Act, 1914, a court is required when imposing a fine to have regard to the ability of the person convicted to pay.  In the past some district justices have taken a consistently indulgent view of traffic offences.  I would be much happier had the Bill prescribed a minimum penalty. I accept that the Minister in the course of his speech told the House that there were constitutional reasons against that.</P>
    <P>I would like if section 43(2) of the 1914 Act did not apply.  My justification for seeking a withdrawal of the protection of that Act is based on the principle that a person who is wealthy enough to put a car on the road must be wealthy enough to pay the insurance cover for that vehicle.  There can be no exceptions to that.  A person driving an uninsured car is a menace to society and should be dealt with accordingly.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that the maximum fine for failure to remain at the scene of an accident is being increased from £100 to £1,000, but that may not be high enough.  Deputy Taylor dealt at length with that point.  A person who fails to stop at the scene of an accident which he or she is involved in is guilty of a serious offence and should be dealt with accordingly.</P>
    <P>It may be of some interest, and amusement, to the House to note that the fine for driving an animal-drawn vehicle while intoxicated is to be increased from £20 to £150.  I note from the Garda report on crime for 1982 that no prosecutions were brought under that heading.  The maximum <Col N="2719" /> fine for a pedal cyclist found in charge of his bicycle while intoxicated is increased from £50 to £300.  The Garda report I referred to indicates that 11 people were charged with that offence last year.  The offence is serious but the person involved is more of a danger to himself than to anybody else.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with section 48 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961.  For the offence under that Act the maximum fine has been increased from £20 to £150. Many defects make people unsuitable to drive a car and those who suffer from these defects should show a greater sense of responsibility in accepting that they may be a danger to the public if they drive.  I have in mind those who suffer from epilepsy, heart complaints, diabetis or any handicap which may impair their judgment.  I suffer, unfortunately, from one of those defects and that is why I mentioned this matter tonight.  I find it a great inconvenience not being able to drive a car but, nevertheless, for the past 28 years I have felt it would be irresponsible of me to do so.  I hope other people suffering from similar defects will feel the same.</P>
    <P>Another serious defect that is often overlooked in road accidents &mdash; it plays a major part in some accidents &mdash; relates to the ability of the driver to see.  Leading opticians have warned that poor eyesight among motorists is a serious factor that is sometimes overlooked in many accidents. The association of opticians have stated that there is widespread public ignorance of eye care.  I understand that the association, at the request of the Department of the Environment, undertook a survey of drivers.  That survey was carried out on the basis of a standard deemed necessary and desirable.  They found that 29 per cent of the 6,000 surveyed did not meet the required standards which were not unreasonable.  The Minister should take that into account when preparing the traffic Bill to be introduced later this year.  That association made the reasonable request that drivers should be requested to produce a certificate before being granted a provisional driving licence to prove that they have <Col N="2720" /> passed a vision test.  To date the Department of the Environment have not taken cognisance of that suggestion.  Drivers are still tested by the placing of a number plate ahead of them during their driving test and that is most unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>Fines and custodial sentences are not the answer when dealing with people who drive without insurance, drive recklessly or dangerously, those who fail to remain at the scene of an accident or those guilty of other serious motoring offences.  The only penalty is to take a licence away for a period.  For some time in England the totting-up procedure of licence endorsements for driving offences has been replaced by a more discriminating system whereby drivers are given penalty points, varying in number according to the severity of the offence, and are liable to disqualification from driving for a period if they incur a set number of points which I understand amount to 12.  Under the British Transport Act, 1981, there is a schedule of such offences and each offence carries a certain number of points. When people accumulate the 12 points they lost their licence for a period.  We could incorporate into our scheduled offences such as parking in prohibited places like bus lanes, parking on double yellow lines or clearways, driving without seat belts and failing to remain at the scene of an accident.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that the parking of juggernauts and large lorries on roadways is a serious hazard.  At a recent meeting of a sub-committee of Dublin Corporation this matter was debated and the Garda informed members of the sub-committee that if such vehicles are parked on public roads that are lit there is no need for the lorries to display special lights.  In my view lorries parked on public roadways at night should have a special type of lighting at the rear.  A number of Deputies mentioned that the Judiciary failed to understand the necessity in some cases to pronounce severe sentences on those who drive while drunk, while uninsured or who fail to remain at the scene of an accident.  I should like to impress upon the Judiciary that it is the view of this House that those who continue to <Col N="2721" /> break those laws commit serious offences and should be treated accordingly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">

      <P>The motion before the House calls on the Government to take &ldquo;immediate action&rdquo; to protect the interests of depositors in finance houses, provident societies and similar institutions.  The inspiration for this motion is a number of reports in recent months of failures of businesses involved in financial dealings.  I use these words with some deliberation because it is not evident from the reports or from the information available to me or to my colleague, the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, that all these businesses were engaged in taking deposits from the public nor that their clients were in all cases depositors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proper that the House should wish to express its concern about these events. <Col N="2722" /> It is a concern which the Government and I readily share.  Deputy O'Kennedy in his remarks on moving the motion last evening expanded on the motion's rather generalised wording.  He confirmed that its primary motivations are concern that members of the public should have been put at risk of substantial losses and that investors' confidence should be maintained.</P>
    <P>In my view, the motion needs specification for three reasons.  Firstly, too much could be read into it.  It could be interpreted as calling on the Government to do things they cannot do and ought not to do, or to incur expenditure that, while it might bring relief to a limited number of people, would not be conducive to the proper development and regulation of our financial institutions in the longer term.  Secondly, for the House to adopt this motion could give the people at risk in these failures unjustified expectations. Thirdly, approval of the motion in the terms in which it is put down might give the false impression that the regulation of our financial institutions is somehow less than adequate and that depositors are at some degree of risk.  It is for those three reasons, which are very specific and have to do with the impressions people would get, that the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and I have tabled an amendment while making it very clear that we fully agree with the concern expressed in the motion and in the speeches made by Fianna Fáil last evening.</P>
    <P>The amendment we put down asks the House to note that deposit-taking institutions are subject to regulation and that it is the Government's intention to take such steps as may be necessary to strengthen that regulation.  This is the area that can be properly addressed.  The taking of deposits from the public in the sense of banking business &mdash; but of course not all the institutions involved are actually licensed banks &mdash; has long been subject to official control in varying degrees.  That control was exercised lightly when the main outlets for savers were the associated banks and the Post Office Savings Bank.  The situation changed in the sixties.  Rising living standards <Col N="2723" /> and rapid economic growth made it possible for many more people to save. Old institutions became more active, new ones came on the scene and the range of financial services on offer to the general public expanded and became more sophisticated.</P>
    <P>Official control in the public interest had to move with the times.  In the mid-sixties legislation was passed to confer a legal status on and to provide a regulatory framework for the rapidly growing credit unions.  The Central Bank Act, 1971, instituted a new and tighter system of control over deposit-takers.  This was supplemented by the Building Societies Act, 1976, which modernised the law regulating building societies, institutions which had become, and remain, major repositories of the community's savings and a key force in the housing programme. Finally, the Industrial and Provident Socities (Amendment) Act was enacted in 1978 to control and, ultimately, to ensure the termination of the banking activities of provident societies. Unfortunately, that control and termination have not been achieved in as orderly a manner as was hoped, but nevertheless the Act will ensure that this group of deposit takers will cease to exist in the not too distant future.  The Minister, Deputy J. Bruton, spoke in more detail on the situation with regard to those particular institutions last evening and illustrated very clearly that the concerns which gave rise to the Act and the system provided in that Act, are still real and that the objectives of the Act are very much the objectives of the Government today.</P>
    <P>As a result of these measures the main private sector deposit-taking businesses were brought under active supervision in the public interest.  By and large these legislative measures have achieved their objectives.  The regulatory authorities, that is, the Central Bank and the Registrar of Friendly Societies, have used the powers vested in them to ensure as far as possible that the institutions in their care are safe repositories for the community's savings.  In the banking sector, for example, there have been substantial dynamic <Col N="2724" /> changes and there are now over 40 licensed banks, yet the difficulties that have arisen in the banking systems of some other countries have largely been avoided.  The building society movement has co-operated with the Registrar of Friendly Societies to ensure that investors have been protected.</P>
    <P>I have thought it well to recall these events in order to place on record the fact that there are modern arrangements for the supervision of deposit-taking institutions, arrangements promoted over a period by successive Governments and which it would be appropriate to develop further, should that be found to be necessary. When I answered a parliamentary question last week related to the subject of this debate I observed that the controls exercised over banks were cited in the question as an indicator of what is necessary in the area of deposit-taking generally. That in itself seems to me to be an eloquent testimonial to the way the Central Bank have carried out their functions, to the licensed banks for the manner in which they conduct their business, and to the controls themselves.</P>
    <P>The basis for the regulation of deposit-taking businesses is in the Central Bank Act, 1971.  Under that Act, the soliciting and taking of repayable deposits from the public without a licence from the Central Bank is generally prohibited. There are some exemptions, notably the building societies, the savings banks and public sector institutions such as the ACC and ICC.  As a result of regulations made in 1979 for the purpose of giving effect to an EEC Directive, the prohibition of unlicensed deposit-taking now applies also to the taking of other repayable moneys from the public.</P>
    <P>A new Central Bank Bill is being prepared in my Department.  The system of licensing and supervision set up in 1971 has worked well but inevitably practices and ideas change.  Major technological developments are in train, the range of services is constantly being expanded and new groups of the population are becoming bank customers.  Harmonisation and the progressive internationalisation of banking are changing the parameters within which the Central Bank and the <Col N="2725" /> banking system must function.  The new Central Bank Bill will be a comprehensive measure dealing with many aspects of banking and currency law.  I appreciate that this legislation has been a long time in the making &mdash; it was originally announced in 1977.  Since I became Minister for Finance I have taken steps to expedite the measure and I expect to bring proposals to the Government in the near future.  As I have said, this will be a comprehensive measure in a very important field.  Subject to the completion of consultations and the exigencies of drafting, I hope to be in a position to introduce a Bill towards the end of this year.</P>
    <P>I think it is generally known that the Bill will provide for a limited scheme of deposit protection, that is for some degree of compensation for depositors in banks that fail.  I shall return to that matter in a moment.  There will also be provision to strengthen the Central Bank's powers to regulate banks and to take timely action to safeguard the interests of depositors.  The House will appreciate that I am not in a position to be specific at this stage.  I can say, however, that one of the issues my Department and the Central Bank are addressing is the raising of repayable funds from the public in forms other than repayable deposits.  It is necessary to &ldquo;flesh out&rdquo; the prohibition on the raising of moneys in such forms. This is pertinent to our present discussion because reports on some of the recent failures suggest that funds have been solicited from the public, for example, by the issue of short-term bonds, and the proceeds were then applied for investment purposes.  I think there would be general agreement in the House that there is a gap which should be closed. However, I would have to say that the matter is somewhat complicated and I must be careful not to bring forward legislation that might unduly restrict the raising of capital by businesses in the productive and non-financial service sectors. Therefore, there would be a question of defining fairly clearly and tightly the particular target of this measure so that it will have the effect we want it to have in terms of the protection of the general public without adverse effects on <Col N="2726" /> the legitimate raising of capital by businesses and by enterprises involved in the non-financial service areas.</P>
    <P>At present the penalty on conviction for an offence under the Central Bank Act is low.  For a summary offence it is only £100.  I intend to recommend to the Government that the penalties should be increased substantially.  I propose also to consider whether the penalty for unlawful deposit-taking should include a term of imprisonment.</P>
    <P>I said at the beginning of my remarks that it was not evident that all the institutions that had collapsed were deposit-takers or that all their clients were depositors. Certain businesses raise money from the public for a variety of purposes and largely escape official regulation at present.  They may be insurance intermediaries or providers of financial or property investment services.  The Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, when he spoke in the debate last night, referred to these bodies and informed the House that he was re-examining the possible need to subject them to some degree of official regulation. What I want to add to that is that if any of these people are taking deposits or raising funds from the public on their account in the manner of banks, rather than as agents providing a service, then they are acting illegally.  I want to make that perfectly clear so that there is no doubt in the minds of Members of this House or in those of the general public that this is the case.  I am looking at this area in that context but the nature of the activity is not always easy to establish. Some care is required, otherwise we could move into the area of regulating not deposit-taking but investment business. I would not like the House to draw the conclusion that I think investment business may not require some regulation. I simply want to make the point that the philosophy that might underlie any action in that area might be quite different from that which applies to legislation in relation to deposit-taking.</P>
    <P>I said that the proposed Central Bank Bill would include provision for a scheme for the protection of depositors on the basis of part compensation for any loss <Col N="2727" /> they might sustain in the event of the failure of a licensed bank.  What I have in mind is an arrangement financed by the banks which would provide part compensation of depositors with a fairly low &ldquo;cut-off&rdquo; point.  The scheme would apply to licensed banks only and there would be no retrospective application.  It is wise to provide for a scheme of that kind although I am convinced that, given the success we have had so far in control legislation and my expectation that our controls will be able to keep up with further developments in banking as we foresee them, the necessity to invoke the scheme will hardly ever arise.  Indeed I hope it would never arise.  Nevertheless I think it prudent to make this kind of provision.</P>
    <P>I am mentioning these points because I do not think it would be fair to allow any suggestion to develop that this proposal, which has been common knowledge now for some time, might be adapted or modified in some way to cover those people caught up in the recent collapses. I would see the strongest objections to associating the licensed banking sector with other institutions, some of which were set up to evade the obligations of the Central Bank Act.</P>
    <P>As my colleague, the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, pointed out last evening, this Government are not going to repeat the Irish Trust Bank precedent and provide public moneys to repay depositors.  I acknowledge that recourse to the public purse has not been advocated in this debate but I feel it necessary at this point to make the Government's position absolutely clear.</P>
    <P>A point that might reasonably be advanced is that two Ministers, the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and myself, have responsibilities in relation to deposit-taking institutions. That might be used to argue that there is room for greater co-ordination to ensure greater uniformity of supervision.  I am aware that in other countries with larger economies and a wider range of financial activities the barriers between institutions are tending to break down.  It is <Col N="2728" /> becoming less easy to classify some businesses as banks and others as something else, say, securities houses or thrift institutions. The pace of technological change will probably accelerate this tendency.  In response to these emerging trends there is a view that supervision should be related more to function than to the category of institution.</P>
    <P>It may be that in time this is the road we will have to follow.  However, the position here is that we still have a diversity of financial institutions with their own specific forms, businesses and traditions. Some are companies.  Others have mutual or co-operative types of organisation. Others still are closely linked to the public sector.  They all perform important functions.  We should be slow to force all deposit-takers to conform to one mould or one particular model. There is co-operation between the relevant Government Departments and the supervisory authorities.  This will be continued and expanded as necessary to ensure that a high standard of supervision is constantly applied to all such institutions.</P>
    <P>I would like briefly to touch on a number of points made earlier during this debate.  The position of depositors as unsecured creditors arose.  That is a well-established principle of law.  Depositors rank ahead of ordinary shareholders but in general they have no priority claim on any part of the assets.  There is a limited exception to this legal principle. Licensed banks and building societies are required to keep a statutory sum related to the size of their business on deposit in the Central Bank.  Should the institution fail, that deposit would be reserved for the benefit of depositors.  When I remind the House that this deposit may be as small as £20,000 and that the maximum for the largest bank is only £500,000, it will be seen that these arrangements are little more than a token acknowledgment that depositors are exposed to risk.  It is for this reason that a compensation fund in relation to licensed banks is envisaged in the context of the new Central Bank Bill.  That is, in my view, the proper way to cushion depositors.</P>
    <P>That arrangement would not have <Col N="2729" /> been feasible in the case of provident societies.  It requires that the businesses should be reasonably cohesive and well-run. It is fairly clear at this stage with hindsight that many of the provident societies did not fulfil those criteria. They lacked a solid foundation and their collapse could not be prevented despite the strict measures enacted in the 1978 Provident Societies Act.</P>
    <P>The question of publicity was also referred to.  I agree that not everybody is in a position to appreciate the distinctions between different types of businesses. Less sophisticated savers may find it difficult to resist attractively presented offers and to identify inherent weaknesses in a business.  There are limits to what can be done to help such people. Members on both sides have spoken on this problem at different times.  Only last week in replying to a parliamentary question I advised people to be careful. That was a sentiment echoed at the other side of the House.  Last night my colleague, the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism demonstrated to the degree to which people were warned about investing in provident societies. We would also have to acknowledge that the media in general have taken a very responsible line in this matter.  In numerous articles and advice columns they have consistently advised their readers to be on their guard in approaching institutions of this kind.  The National Savings Committee, for example, also perform a useful function in this regard, with publicity and savings campaigns which consist partly of advising people on how to invest their savings in safety.</P>
    <P>The fact is that there are many safe ways to invest.  The State itself provides a number of attractive savings media, such as the Post Office Savings Bank, Trustee Savings Bank accounts, savings certificates, national instalment savings and index-linked bonds.  The small saver who wants a safe home for his savings with a good return need look no further than those institutions and he has the satisfaction of knowing that his money will be put to good use in the public capital programme.</P>
    <P>In so far as gilt edged securities are <Col N="2730" /> concerned, while it is true that prices fluctuate from time to time in line with interest rates and other considerations, these movements are generally of a short-term nature and are part and parcel of the normal operation of the gilt market which in no way take from the basic solidity of Government paper.  I would conclude from that that there are a number of avenues open to small savers who want a high degree of security on their savings without having recourse to institutions such as those which have created a problem recently and which have given rise to the motion which we are discussing this evening.  Deputy O'Kennedy indicated that one of his reasons for putting down the motion was to create a reassuring climate for investors generally and to restore confidence in the investment climate. He referred also to the need to present a reassuring front to the outside world.  I would like to acknowledge the careful way in which the Deputy presented the motion.  We are all in agreement in our wish to promote investment. It is particularly necessary to encourage productive investments that will enhance output and enable more employment to be created.  I feel therefore that it might have been a little unfortunate to associate the failure of bodies such as those which have given rise to this motion with confidence in investment generally or with our appearance in this respect to the outside world.  I would think it essential that the idea should not go out from this debate that the demise of some minor financial concerns whose operations can only be regarded as speculative has affected in any way the overall investment situation in this country.</P>
    <P>I know that to the people affected the failure of the enterprises which we are discussing is not a small matter, but in the totality of our financial sector they were minor operations.  As I have said, it would be wrong to let the impression gain currency that they have in any way brought about any kind of qualitative change in the investment scene in this country.</P>
    <P>We must maintain a sense of proportion. There is over £10,000 million invested on deposit in Irish financial institutions. <Col N="2731" /> Very large sums are invested in our insurance companies and there are a great many responsible intermediaries operating in the stock exchange and other sectors.  The message is that all these moneys are being managed responsibly. Investors at home and abroad can rest assured that this country is a safe location for their funds.  The Government intend to maintain our excellent reputation in that respect.</P>
    <P>I would like to repeat my appreciation of the responsible way in which the debate has been approached.  I feel that Deputy O'Kennedy and his colleagues would agree that they have elicited a positive response through the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and myself.  The Government are firmly committed to doing whatever may be necessary to maintain and enhance public confidence in our financial institutions.</P>
    <P>Reference was made during the course of the debate last evening to the situation of particular individuals who have suffered losses as a result of the events which we are discussing.  Those were given as illustrations and to put on the record the effect of these events which, while they are very small in the total financial scene, are nevertheless ones which concern those individuals very closely.  The best protection that the State can offer to individuals, whatever their level of savings, is to ensure that our financial institutions of whatever kind and under whatever statute they are founded or organised are regulated on lines designed to protect the public interest.  The public interest clearly must have regard to the interest of depositors and of those who use the funds which are put on deposit.</P>
    <P>I pointed out this evening a number of measures which we are now developing and, indeed, which have been developed over a period of years since the mid-sixties to provide for the proper control and regulation of these institutions.  I have indicated some of the measures which will figure in the Central Bank Bill, which is one of the instruments that we have at our disposal to ensure that this regulation is properly carried out.  That Bill, which <Col N="2732" /> is the area of my particular responsibility as far as the substance of this debate is concerned, is one which, by the time it is presented to this House, will have been very carefully considered and the measures in it carefully worked out with both the regulators and the regulated.  When we come to discussing that Bill in this House, we will be in a position to clearly assume that most of the angles of the Bill have been covered from a technical point of view and we in this House can concern ourselves principally with the overall regulations of these activities in the public interest.  That is an important point because of the essential character of financial institutions towards the further growth and development of our economy.  My colleague, the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism, last week indicated the action which he is taking in the area which is his responsibility, particularly with regard to provident societies.  There again, it is clear that it is, has been and always will be a major concern of Government policy here to ensure the solidity of these institutions so that those who place money in their management or on deposit with them can feel that they have found a secure home for their funds and that those who end up borrowing money from these institutions will know that they are borrowing from a well regulated source.</P>
    <P>In view of all that, we have put down an amendment to the motion, the concern of which is to make the motion more precise and to express more clearly the nature of our concern with the events which we are discussing and what our intentions are in relation to the institutions which we are now examining.  I hope my belief will be shared generally in the House that the present debate has enabled us to make clear our priorities in relation to the regulatory approach to these agencies.  As a result of this debate, we will have made it very clear, both to the general public and to those involved in running the institutions, that our primary concern is with solidity and the continuance of promoting and ensuring the strength of the foundation of our financial system.  That has been the reason for putting forward this amendment. <Col N="2733" /> It reflects a further clarification of the level of agreement which exists in this House on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Many aspects were considered by the Fianna Fáil Party on the question of putting down this motion. Careful consideration was given to the wording, and that has been appreciated by the Minister.  The response from the Government in that regard was heartening. I do not think it would be in the interests of any party to have a division on this motion especially in view of the response of the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism here last evening and supported now by the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>One of the main reasons we considered it necessary to have this motion &mdash; I think the Minister will concur with this view &mdash; was that there was a considerable amount of public disquiet in the recent past as a result of the collapse of some investment bodies.  I am sure the Minister will agree that there were some stark headlines in the national press over the last few months with some of them referring to &ldquo;banking concerns in crash&rdquo; and mentioning a figure of £6 million.  There has been widespread reporting concerning the collapse of certain institutions which were referred to in recent articles, especially in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 9 February when it was suggested that the High Court were freezing half a million deposits and listing six other institutions that had come to grief in the recent past.  The cumulative effect was that the general public were suffering some unease as to the viability not just of those concerns but perhaps the relationship that they might have with general banking and financial institutions.  For that reason we felt it was necessary to put on the record of the House the agreed view as to how we felt about financial institutions; and that if there was a difficulty which had to be attended to we were conscious of it and that the relevant authorities would deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also felt that it is more important now than ever to maintain the confidence of the public in institutions taking deposits. While the institutions that gave rise <Col N="2734" /> to this motion might be small in an Irish sense, at the same time quite substantial sums of money are involved.  Sums of £6 million and £15 million may be small by international standards, but they are not small to many of the people who deposited money.  We also felt it was not satisfactory that any depositor in a licensed or regulated financial institution should have their investments at risk.  It is not right that investments made by the public could be in jeopardy and if loopholes exist they should be closed immediately so that there will be no recurrence of the collapses which we witnessed recently.</P>
    <P>We are pleased that the Minister was so informative this evening concerning provisions which may be brought in in the not too distant future, especially the new Central Bank Bill which he will be introducing before the end of the year. We take it that it will deal comprehensively with all banking arrangements and, more particularly, with deposit protection to a much greater degree than obtains at present.</P>
    <P>While I may not have deadly accurate figures as far as the Irish Trust Bank are concerned, it is now generally understood that the vast majority of whatever sum had to be put up by the Exchequer to protect depositors would have been recovered anyway and that a very tiny sum of money is now outstanding.  As the money has been repaid, I do not think it should be given as an example of where the State had to come to the rescue with regard to substantial sums of depositors' losses.  It is unfortunate that collapses of financial institutions should take place before the necessary tightening up is implemented.  Any demise of a financial institution weakens the confidence of ordinary, small, perhaps not too well up investors.  We should take this opportunity to reiterate that what was involved on this occasion did not have a serious effect in so far as moneys are concerned. Our financial institutions are sound, investments and assets are sound and people can invest their money with confidence.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the human face attached to these institutions is not always readily available to the general <Col N="2735" /> public and when reference was made to warnings which had been given throughout the years concerning the inadvisability of dealing with some investment bodies it was not always visible just how extensive those warning signs were. Warnings given in the House and contained in the Official Report might not be regarded as the best way to inform the public that there is a risk involved.  Warnings issued in this House may not get the coverage to which they are entitled in bringing to the notice of the public the risks they might be taking in investing money.  Perhaps if your deposits are being handled by an intermediary he might be in a position to advise and would be competent to know what was a good investment.  Of course that is not always so and in the case of the institutions that have collapsed now and left so many small depositors in jeopardy, the investments were by direct debit and did not go through an intermediary who could have given professional advice.</P>
    <P>While a Supreme Court ruling in May 1983 made it abundantly clear that certain depositors were at risk, reporting of Supreme Court rulings in the national media, while extensive, would not particularise difficulties for prospective investors in so far as this type of institution was concerned.  When there is talk of provisional liquidators, as is the case with several of these companies and provident societies, the general public suffer from a lack of confidence which is applied right across the board.  We must make it clear that this is not the case but, at the same time, what we have said here has been of very little consolation to many people especially, as in the case of institutions that failed the depositors stand to lose about £4½ million.</P>
    <P>They are being told in glaring headlines that their money will be recovered to the extent perhaps of less than 50p in the £. While the liquidator in one case currently before the courts cannot disclose the names of the depositors and the amounts deposited, it is generally accepted that about 9,000 small investors invested their money with the PMPS.  Many of those deposits were very small indeed.  I have <Col N="2736" /> had a considerable amount of post over the past few months from people involved.  The vast majority of depositors in that financial institution were very far removed from big-time investors.  That makes it all the sadder.  It is no harm for me to refer to some of the correspondence I received.</P>
    <P>I had a letter from an old lady who told me she invested her life savings with the PMPS.  She needs the money badly now to pay the hospital expenses incurred due to a fracture.  She was 40 years of age before she earned her first £1.  She is now over 60 years of age and has no way of recovering her money despite the fact that she needs it so badly.  This shows the kind of hardship endured by those small investors.  A gentleman told me that his life savings were invested with that institution. He invested in good faith.  He believed it was a wholly Irish-owned institution.  Nobody told him it was possible for this crisis to arise.</P>
    <P>Another man cannot draw the money he requires to pay for a family bereavement. This file is full of that kind of letter. Less than £1,000 was invested by a man and wife of 78 and 82 years of age.  That represents their total life savings.  The returns on that capital investment were absolutely necessary to enable them to pay for their fuel supply this winter.  I do not want to be sensational about this, but we must face the fact that we are not dealing with big institutions and big investors.  We are talking about old age pensioners and people who invested their redundancy money.  Many Irish exiles send home money for Irish purposes. Many of them hope to retire on the small investments they made in these companies.</P>
    <P>I should like to take issue with the Minister.  Last evening one of his arguments in support of the Government's position that they would not indemnify any of these depositors was that these people should have been well aware of the risk, and that the lure of high returns from these investments was the attraction. I do not accept that.  I do not accept that the statistics prove it either.  Had they put their little investments into institutions other than the ones that collapsed <Col N="2737" /> they might very well have got better percentage points in the interest rates.</P>
    <P>Many of them invested because they were not advised by professionals.  They thought these were Irish institutions.  I am referring now to the six institutions and not just one which collapsed recently.  There were thousands and thousands of small investors.  To me the widow's mite has the same significance to the widow as £1 million has to the millionaire. The hardship endured by the widow is not in direct proportion to the amount of money involved.  Neither is it in direct proportion to the hardship endured by a millionaire who loses £1 million because that is probably only a small part of his wealth.</P>
    <P>I recognise the Government's dilemma.  I recognise that a precedent cannot be established.  I can readily understand that.  At the same time, I wonder would there have been a difference in dealing with these collapses and in helping out in some way if the 9,000 investors had been 9,000 millionaires instead of 9,000 old age pensioners.  This raises many questions.  Some of these matters and some of these institutions will be dealt with in court proceedings. There is considered opinion among the groups which have been set up to try to protect the investors in these institutions that they will have a very good case in court, and may very well get considerable relief one way or the other for their investors. I thought what one of their organisers said to me was very poignant.  He said: &ldquo;We believe that in the final analysis we may succeed, but how many of our depositors will have gone to their final reward without getting satisfaction?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Many institutions have been referred to and I suppose the biggest talking point is the question of the PMPS because of their relationship with the PMPA which was the subject of an Act of Parliament last autumn.  The point is made very strongly that if the Government could virtually take over and rescue an insurance company to provide cover for hundreds of thousands of motorists and the Government can virtually own that company&mdash;I know that can be denied in strict financial terms but it is the perception <Col N="2738" /> of the general public that the PMPA were taken over by the Government&mdash; why cannot the Government honour the liabilities of the company?  Many people ask was there such a big distinction between the two?  Were they so closely related that the Government should have gone the full way and dealt with the related problems as well?</P>
    <P>These are matters which will be thrashed out in court.  Hopefully they will come to a happy ending.  Even then quite a sizeable percentage of the funds from the liquidation will have to go towards court proceedings and to pay off other expenses.  It will be difficult.  We have to understand that many of the societies and institutions are registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1893.  One of the provisions of that Act is that accounts audited each year by a public auditor must be furnished and balance sheets must be shown to the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  They should be available for public inspection on a year to year basis.  It will be asked whether there has been a breakdown in that regard.  Has there been a dimension of negligence in that area where difficulties were not foreseen?  Was corrective action suggested or taken to deal with any of those problems?  Did the registrar continue to implement the 1978 Act during the High Court and Supreme Court proceedings? There was considerable delay.</P>
    <P>We are talking now about thousands of people losing their small investments. In 1978 this House put the general public on notice that there might be difficulties and that the difficulties would be dealt with by legislation.  Certain types of institutions were given notice to quit taking deposits and to wind down their business. People will ask why they were allowed to continue during the five-year period.  Was sufficient action taken against them all to prevent these six from coming to grief? It was implied yesterday that the regulations exist, although they may need tightening in certain areas.  Were these regulations implemented to the last letter during the period?</P>
    <P>A recent British example concerns the Newcross company where £150 million was at risk.  The chief registrar in Great <Col N="2739" /> Britain put a stall on the operations of Newcross because he was concerned that if the society continued with their policy there was a distinct risk of a crisis and Newcross would not then be in a position to repay their investors.  This is the kind of activity we want.  Any licensing authority or regulatory body must take upon itself the responsibility to protect investors by recognising difficulties that may become apparent.  The registrar must protect the interests of investors.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred yesterday to the question of intermediaries and this is an important aspect.  It is interesting to note that in so far as intermediaries are concerned Governments have failed to act on the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry into the insurance industry which took place in 1976.  They stated that the existing situation was not ideal and made it quite clear that the legal relationships between brokers, insurance companies and clients were far from clear cut and that there was no control at all of intermediaries.  We know that there have been failures in that area of activity as well.  Brokers have absconded with clients' money and it was suggested on a number of occasions that some absconded with the intention to defraud. It is one thing to have a collapse due to lack of business skill and competence but the other is indefensible.  These recommendations have not been acted upon.</P>
    <P>It will be said that clients are too trusting. It was heartening to hear the Minister yesterday advising people to make cheques payable to companies rather than to brokers.  Can anybody blame the general public for being too trusting? These are well-known firms supported by widespread newspaper advertising. Quite often their standing is endorsed by the insurance companies with whom they are doing business.  The general public would do well to know that the relationship is with the broker, not with the institution. When a broker invests money, the client's relationship is with him and not with the investment company.  This often leads to difficulties when trouble arises.  Anyone can set up as an insurance broker and a consumer can be misled by <Col N="2740" /> incompetence, carelessness or dishonest advice.  These are the words used in the commission's report.  The Commission of Inquiry recommended that legislative controls be introduced to deal with intermediaries but this has not been done. The general public are at least entitled to be a little sceptical of our good intentions as expressed here.  We have not dealt with this matter over the years and thousands of investors have lost their money. It is a classical example of talking about locking the stable door when the horse has already been round the paddock not just once but a couple of times.</P>
    <P>There was a submission from the National Insurance Brokers' Association asking the Minister to set up an insurance brokers' registration council and a scheme of registration for all non-broker intermediaries.  This suggestion did not receive a good response and the former Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism gave a clear indication that he did not think it necessary.  I am pleased to hear that there is a change of attitude by the present Minister and the Minister for Finance and that something will be done. That kind of council would have to be given generous powers to bring proceedings where appropriate and enabled to impose penalties on those breaking the regulations.  It could be self-financing, so there would be no burden on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>We can all shed tears&mdash;not crocodile tears, I hope&mdash;about the 9,000 investors in one society and others who have lost small life savings.  We should at least give a commitment to them and to other small investors in similar institutions that this will not happen again and that whatever protection is needed under the law will be given.  We must have a compensation fund which will guarantee equal treatment before the law for depositors who place money in good faith, whether they be millionaires or institutional investors or those with very small savings.</P>

      <P>The loss by investors of any portion of their savings is always to be regretted.  Whenever these investors <Col N="2741" /> are old age pensioners, widows or the less well off the hardships are all the greater.  Deputy Flynn has spoken about his correspondence with a number of people who have been affected.  All of us have personal knowledge of the problem and the worries of those involved.  Naturally I have the greatest sympathy.  We must look at the overall situation in the deposit taking area before reaching conclusions. Balanced against these losses we must look at the enormous sums of money held by institutions whose record of soundness and stability is second to none by any international comparison which anyone might wish to make.</P>
      <P>When addressing the House during the debate last night the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism referred to the amount of deposits held by the licensed banks and the specialised credit institutions, namely, the Post Office Savings Bank, the Trustee Saving Banks, the ACC and the Industrial Credit Company.  These figures stood at more than £10 billion, a vast sum of money by any standards.  The Minister referred to the outstanding work and achievements of the credit union movement. I would like to be associated with these statements.  The credit unions have undoubtedly an important role to play in encouraging a spirit of saving among their members and in educating them in the proper use of their own resources, be they large or small.  The credit union movement for many years has been providing this very worth-while service.  The great growth in membership of the movement reflects people's confidence in this institution and displays a tremendous interest in community spirit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are now approximately 500,000 members countrywide and combined savings are in the order of £160 million. These figures are clear evidence not only of the vitality of the credit union movement but also of the philosophy of thrift which the movement has fostered among members all over the country.  The credit union example of pooling their resources locally and not having to borrow from external institutions is a valuable use for the nation as a whole.  The money held <Col N="2742" /> by credit unions is very significant and this creates a pressure for proper supervision and regulation.  This fact was recognised and provided for in the inclusion of specific supervisory powers by the Registrar of Friendly Societies which are briefly as follows:</P>
    <P>(1)  Power to inspect the books and other documents of such bodies,</P>
    <P>(2)  To investigate their affairs,</P>
    <P>(3)  To call special meetings of the members,</P>
    <P>(4)  To appoint a person as director, and</P>
    <P>(5)  To direct the suspension of acceptance of deposits, loans, shares or payments.</P>
    <P>In line with these powers a number of credit unions have been inspected and the necessary advice given to unions where this was considered necessary. Further inspections are being carried out to ensure the utmost vigilance in this area.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to a very important point in relation to industrial and provident societies which was made by the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism last night and which I feel must be made again.  Opposition Deputies have called for the introduction of new legislation for the strengthening of the existing legislation in the area of industrial and provident societies.  No such action is contemplated so far as deposit taking societies are concerned for the very simple reason that the Industrial and Provident Societies (Amendment) Act, 1978, removed the scope for the establishment of any new deposit taking societies and at the same time provided for the winding down of the deposit taking activities of the then existing societies.</P>
    <P>The basic underlying philosophy was that banking activity should not be permitted except under and in accordance with the provisions of the Central Bank Act, 1971.  The net result was that promoters of a would-be banking operation could only proceed to set up such an operation in company form, which form would make it liable to full compliance with the stringent controls provided for <Col N="2743" /> in the Central Bank legislation.  These societies were of course societies which were in operation prior to the enactment of the 1978 legislation.  It was the very existence of these societies and the recognition of the dangers which depositors faced when placing money with them that led to the introduction of the 1978 Act.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, reiterate that the possibility of any new societies being formed to carry on banking business has been eliminated through the enactment of the Industrial and Provident Societies (Amendment) Act, 1978.  Furthermore, this Act also provided for the winding down of deposit taking societies which existed prior to this legislation.  In all the circumstances there is no need for the enactment of new legislation or the strengthening of existing legislation so far as the deposit-taking associations are concerned.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Flynn that the collapse of the society referred to created wide media coverage and some concern among a wide variety of people but I believe that the responsive approach in which the discussion has taken place in the House last night and tonight will be nationally accepted, that we have in the country a well secured, well balanced, well controlled and supervised banking system which has all the credit, security and confidence required by people here or elsewhere.  The result of the collapse in the area concerned was tragic for many small investors, some of whom were once-off investors, people who invested redundancy or retirement lump sums, and for that reason the collapse is all the more regrettable.  I believe that the discussion here will be an education for those who up to this did not realise the risk they were taking in embarking on investments in institutions which neither carried industrial nor national security.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Minister of State for the opportunity he has given me to intervene in this debate. Before I make a couple of observations I want to join with other Members in expressing my sorrow for the people who lost money with provident societies, <Col N="2744" /> investment, insurance or intermediary brokers of one type or other who have operated in this field.  I accept the point just made by the Minister and made last night by the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism in relation to the winding down of these societies that operated in fringe banking activities.</P>
      <P>The main reason I looked for the opportunity to intervene in the debate was because of some remarks made last night by the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism when he said that the collapse of provident societies was not something which had been thrust upon us but that it was something about which warnings had been given to the public since 1978.  I was in the Seanad in 1978 when the Industrial and Provident Societies (Amendment) Act was passed and I recall warnings being given by the Minister, who was then Deputy O'Malley, and by other speakers in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I recall that those warnings appeared in the national newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the point made by the Minister last night when he said that there was a very clear warning from a High Court judge in an action when some of these societies challenged the constitutionality of the 1968 Industrial and Provident Societies Act.  The reason I want to intervene is because it is very wrong of us to compare the type of warnings that appeared in relation to these societies with the type of advertising that these societies, brokers and agents involve themselves in regularly in selling their wares.  I know that many Members of the House probably read very carefully the record of the Dáil proceedings as published in the national newspapers and I am sure we read word for word contributions which we make which are reported.  I wonder if it is fair to presume that the average Seán Citizen creeps through the columns of contributions to Dáil debates here.  I also have to question if members of the public can be presumed to read with great interest and enthusiasm the judgments of the High Court, Supreme Court, Circuit Court or whatever court and the reports of legal proceedings in those courts.  There is basically <Col N="2745" /> a whole range of types of investors, commercial investors, professional brokers who advise professional investors, and also small investors.  The small prudent investor will take advice before he invests money, but nowadays many people are inclined to be impressed by the type of prospectus and the advertising that appear in national newspapers, handouts and so on which appear to come from brokers, agents, societies or companies that appear in some way to be Government-controlled and regulated. People genuinely believe that the advertisements and their recommendations are to be taken seriously.  I will quote what I see as a most glaring example of this type of problem.  Some months ago in the business pages of the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> a small comment attracted my attention.  It concerned an unsolicited advertisement and I quote from it:</P>
    <P>Yet another giveaway newspaper has popped through the letter boxes of Northside residents.  It's called <i>Venture</i> and inside is an article about....</P>
    <P>a certain commercial society.  It quotes then from this free newspaper or magazine:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The ... society is surely one of Ireland's success stories.  In the present economic climate it is indeed a pleasure to see such an outstanding home-based achievement.&rdquo;  The fulsome article, which takes up a full page and is amply illustrated by pictures of executives, also draws attention to the fact that the group is &ldquo;offering a very attractive 11-month bond which pays the most competitive market rates.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The end of this short article informs us that this magazine called <i>Venture</i> is published by the society of which it was so fulsome in its praise.  Of course, there was no reference in the free magazine to that fact.  With all due respect due to my colleagues in this House, I do not think that you can compare remarks made by Members of this House to the type of advertising we have seen there.  At any rate, this magazine attracted the attention of a person in my constituency and <Col N="2746" /> he wrote to inquire and received a letter in reply, part of which I quote:</P>
    <P>With interest rates falling, the Eleven Month Bond is an excellent opportunity to avail of a high guaranteed interest rate for a fixed period.  At the end of the eleven month term, the Bond will automatically mature and your funds will become available.  The interest earned will be paid without deduction of tax.</P>
    <P>The security of our investors is guaranteed by investing in a Group with Assets in excess of £7 million.  Within our Group there are two Deposit taking institutions which are registered under Government enacted legislation. The State appointed Registrar is responsible for ensuring that every Society operates in a manner which is consistent with the provision of maximum security for depositors.</P>
    <P>If you examine our Balance Sheet you will notice that our prudent investment policy has achieved a blend of quality assets comprising of cash, mortgages, leased equipment and Property, resulting in the highest yield consistent with security and maximum growth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other points I would like to make.  We have seen the advertising that these people engage in with investment brokers who have collapsed in the past few months and who straight away, before the courts have determined their personal liability and before the Garda have determined the question of their liability for possible fraud, engage in other business activities. Our system is inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest firstly that the Registrar of Provident Societies control all advertising for such societies.  Secondly, I recommend strongly that consideration be given to obliging insurance brokers and investment brokers' intermediaries to form themselves into some body to ensure that in order to practise their business they must be licensed and also to ensure that if any of their members collapse <Col N="2747" /> they have some compensation fund to pay for the losses of the depositors.  I sympathise with those people who have lost money in the various ventures that have been mentioned here, but I do not think it desirable that the State should automatically pick up the tab.  The industry itself must grapple with the problem and deal with it in some way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to speak for just three or four minutes.  I attended the first meeting of the PMPS depositors at Liberty Hall last October when the crash came and I was face to face with many people who lost in many instances, their life savings.  As has already been stated in this House, some of them were very small investors indeed.  In some cases they had come from abroad with their life savings to settle down and retire here, to discover suddenly that their money was gone.  I stated at that meeting that I could not understand how people could be gullible as to put all their eggs in one basket, but some people, particularly small investors, will do that.  When one suggests that maybe they should talk this over with an accountant or some such person there is a tendency almost towards laughter and a query as to how they can afford to pay an accountant when some of their deposits are so small.  They feel that it is the person with a large amount of money who gets the bank manager or the accountant to advise him.  They are not in big-time investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House can do a service for the small investor of the future by the introduction of this legislation which is being welcomed on this side of the House and to which we are making a very quick response.  I feel somewhat sceptical and sorry about the fact that although warnings were being given some considerable time ago about the PMPS in particular, money still continued to flow in to them. It is important that the small investor watch very carefully for the society or whatever financial institution it is that is offering that 0.5 per cent higher than anyone else.  That is the time to proceed with great care.  The Minister for Finance in his speech tonight has listed many of the safe institutions for the small investor <Col N="2748" /> and it is far better for a small investor to invest at perhaps 0.5 per cent less than the going rate in the knowledge that his money is there safe for him.</P>
    <P>Many lessons can be learned here.  The tragedy is that by the time the receiver has gone through the affairs of the PMPS many of these depositors will have passed on because they are very old.  I may be incorrect but I believe that I read that the receiver could at his discretion settle any claims under £5,000 or any case of hardship involving a small amount.  I hope that some such thing can be done.  I would like to see closer supervision of all these societies.  Deputy Molony made a very good point when he referred to the advertisement in the newspaper and the magazine <i>Venture</i> purporting to represent one of these companies.  He referred to prospectuses.  Very few people know how to read a prospectus; indeed it is amazing how many sophisticated people do not know how to read a prospectus properly. Much investment is a gamble on the larger scene.  The PMPS seem to have been used simply as a back-door bank. The Central Bank Bill introduced in 1971 cut off any more licences being issued other than by the Central Bank.  The terrible dilemma which many of the depositors of the PMPS found themselves in was that in proceeding against many of the companies owned by the PMPA they were putting themselves out of work because many of them had invested their life savings in their own company.  I hope that as a result of this debate other people will benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In introducing the motion yesterday I indicated that one of my primary targets was to evoke a response from the Government.  Secondly, I was anxious to create an awareness among the public, particularly those who are not as well informed as we would wish them to be, of the hazards involved in placing deposits with certain institutions. I should like to put on record that I am pleased that we have got this response from the Government.  Seldom can one have received such a comprehensive statement from the Minister for Finance this evening and from the Minister <Col N="2749" /> for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism yesterday on the regulations governing the range of institutions, those licensed under the Central Bank Act, building societies, the Post Office, trustee savings banks and provident societies.  I am not suggesting that in grouping them together now that they are all of a kind or that they are subject to the same type of regulations.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that the two Ministers put the position in a comprehensive way.  It suggests, as the Minister for Finance has implicitly acknowledged if not expressly so &mdash; he made the point that some of them might argue this as a consequence of the regime that operates in different cases under various Ministers &mdash; that there is a case for continuing and greater co-ordination of the statutory controls. Of course, in a sense that means having another look at or an even broader review of the whole range of societies such as the Minister mentioned last night as well as those subject to the Central Bank Act to try to bring about a certain norm of security for depositors.  As Deputy Molony said, they are at a certain disadvantage in some cases.  I did not make that statement as a political point because, as the Minister for Finance said, the review of the Central Bank Act has been going on for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second purpose I had in moving this motion was to create an awareness among depositors.  I was concerned about those who invest their life savings.  One does not like to engage in the argument <i>ad hominem</i> to underline the case but the reality is that those who have been most hurt are those who are most gullible.  I do not think that they were lured, as the Minister seemed to suggest last night, by the attraction of higher interest rates in every case.  In fact, they might have got higher interest rates in life assurance funds than from provident societies. Some people were lulled into a false sense of security and a certain attraction. Deputy Molony gave an example a few moments ago.  As a practising solicitor he is aware that a lot of people are influenced by presentations of the type he mentioned.  Not all people are prudent enough to take the advice of a solicitor <Col N="2750" /> or an accountant and not all of them can afford to do so.  For that reason we should not overstate the effect of the debate.  As Deputy Molony stated, few people will read Supreme Court judgments.  It must be stated that the Press presented the issue in this debate fairly.  I have no doubt that the report of the debate in the Official Report will not be read by many people.  For those reasons there is still a need for a greater degree of co-ordination to ensure maximum protection for depositors who are influenced by the presentation of the advantages by depositing with certain societies.</P>
    <P>It was evident from what the Minister said last night that if one looks over the whole range &mdash; he mentioned banks, building societies, the Post Office, the ACC and State bodies, the trustee savings banks, credit unions, industrial and credit societies, financial brokers, insurance and insurance brokers&mdash;many of them have sprung up not because the Government of the day promoted their creation but because of opportunities people would have seen either in gaps or lack of control in legislation.  If there was from time to time a certain amount of investment potential people were encouraged into what they saw as a safe haven investment pool.  I suggest to both Ministers&mdash;and the Minister for Finance in particular&mdash;that there is scope, having concluded the updating of the Central Bank Act, for a tightening of the controls generally.</P>
    <P>I wish to make it clear that I endorse totally what the Ministers said in regard to the general climate for investment here.  The collapse of the type we saw in some of the provident societies must be put in its proper context.  Unfortunately, as the Minister pointed out last night, the experience there has been a pretty bad one.  Of the 16 all but about four got into some type of trouble, liquidation or whatever else.  We should not overstate the significance of that in the context of our total financial structure.  That said, I do not think we should minimise the obligation we have to protect people who bona fide, under the impression that these things are controlled by statute and, perhaps, that they may be compensated <Col N="2751" /> through some fund or another, invest their life savings.  Since the debate opened &mdash; I did not seek contact with anybody prior to the debate although Deputy Briscoe representing our party attended a meeting of depositors in one society &mdash; I heard of the experiences of three people.  I do not know how many more will contact me about this but I propose to make the information I have available to the Minister.  There are some tragic cases and it is our obligation to protect such people in the future.  If we do not do anything more than that we will have discharged a certain degree of responsibility in the House.  We undertake to engage in active consultations with the Government, if necessary, for the purpose of reaching any degree of consensus towards introducing legislation and passing it through the Houses as quickly as possible.  If the occasion arises that there is need for consultation we will be glad to co-operate.</P>
    <P>Another area for concern is the delay in legal procedures which the Minister referred to last night.  It is quite ridiculous that we can have a five-year delay in respect of cases that go before the courts in respect of some of the provident societies, two or three years in one court and two years in the Supreme Court.  During that time it is possible that there is not control over the assets or protection for the depositors.  The law must not be seen to be an ass.  No one respects what the Judiciary have achieved in their independent functions as much as I and my colleagues do, but the reality is that there is a risk that the investors, and sometimes the business community, might feel they are not as effective or as relevant as they might be.  That is something we might also look at.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's response and in view of that we are prepared to accept their amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Motion, as amended, agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughConaghan" hpid="Mr. Conaghan Mr. Conaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this subject on the Adjournment and the Minister for coming here this evening.  The last time any substantial sum of money was expended on the port of Greencastle was in 1963. In 1978 the estimate for the development works on the pier was £840,000 and Donegal County Council agreed to pay their 25 per cent contribution.  Unfortunately, because the situation has drastically changed since then and costs have escalated, the council will find it difficult to meet their contribution.  In 1979 a revised estimate gave the cost at £1.5 million, in 1981 that increased to £2 million and the total cost is now estimated at more than £3 million.  At 1983 costs the local authorities' contribution will be in the region of £60,000 per annum for 30 years.  This will be a very severe imposition on the local authority.  However, the Minister told me he was not responsible for that aspect and that I should get in touch with another Department.</P>
      <P>There is a dire need for the development of this fishing port.  Fishing is a very extensive business in Donegal and the economy of the county, and the country, depends on fishing.  Killybegs serves the west of the county, Burtonport the north-west and Greencastle the east.  The Department have spent a considerable amount of money developing another part on Lough Swilly, Leenan, which will complement the Greencastle port.  There is extensive fishing in the North Atlantic and these ports are very important to the fishermen.</P>
      <P>There is an estimated turnover of £4 million in the Greencastle port.  Over the last three or four winters our fishermen fished for mackerel in the North Atlantic and these fishermen had to go to the port of Derry to discharge their catches.  This meant they lost money because they had to travel 25 miles to and from Greencastle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not need to stress the importance of developing this port.  In fairness to the present Minister and his predecessors it <Col N="2753" /> must be said that they have shown a willingness to develop this port.  The time has come to take action, otherwise fishermen who are prepared to invest in larger boats will be denied the opportunity to expand.  Statistics show that every fisherman at sea can create three onshore jobs.  In Greencastle there are approximately 150 to 200 fishermen fishing from that port and the onshore jobs are limited. There could be an expansion of processing catches if the proper facilities were provided.  Unemployment in the Inishowen Peninsula is the highest in the country and there is a great need to create jobs in that area.  Here is a golden opportunity for the Government to help.  They could provide the money which should have been spent over the past five or six years.  This would be an investment in the future of the fishermen of Greencastle, the young people who would get onshore jobs and enterprising people would be prepared to invest in the fishing industry if the proper facilities were provided.</P>
    <P>I understand that Donegal County Council wish to send a deputation to meet the Minister and that the Minister has had consultations with the fishermen's co-operative.  I would be interested to hear what will be done for this area in the future.  I would be very concerned if there was any cut-back on the planned development because this development was to make this a prosperous and enterprising fishing port.  Any cut-back in the planned development would not be to the benefit of the fishermen or of anybody who wished to invest in the fish processing industry.  If we have to go back to the drawing board there will be a delay which should not be allowed, because we all know how urgent it is to develop our ports.  As I said, here is an opportunity for the Government to take action.  I hope we will hear some good news from the Minister tonight and that he will give a commitment that something will be done to help Greencastle in 1984.</P>
    <P>I am giving way now to Deputy Gallagher.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to add my voice to that of my colleague about the necessity to <Col N="2754" /> develop the harbour at Greencastle. Donegal County Council have given a definite commitment to contribute 25 per cent of the overall cost.  That contribution was available in our estimate a few years ago and we hoped that money would be forthcoming.</P>
      <P>Our main purpose this evening is to impress on the Minister the urgency of providing moneys out of this year's capital allocation for harbour development. I understand that most of this money would be going to Howth and a small percentage to Killybegs.  I was heartened to hear the Minister of State at the Department of Fisheries and Forestry, while answering questions in relation to harbour development, say that there had been no definite decision taken yet as to where this money would be spent.  I would hope that Greencastle would be one of the ports that would definitely be considered for development during 1984. As was pointed out by Deputy Conaghan, Greencastle is a port which could be used extensively by the larger boats for fishing off the north-west coast of Donegal and the west coast of Scotland, boats which at present go as far north as Stornoway.  Were it not for these enterprising fishermen who invested money in larger boats there would be no mackerel at all landed in the country.  It is unfortunate that these people must steam back to Killybegs, some 24 hours steaming, as time and fuel at sea are so costly. We must consider making a facility available to them at Greencastle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Greencastle basically is a white fish port, the reason being that the larger boats could not use it.  The progressive fishermen of Greencastle have proved themselves over the years.  I can say without fear of contradiction that the quality of fish coming out of Greencastle on to any market in Ireland, the United Kingdom or any continental one&mdash;where they are shipping some of their fresh fish at present &mdash; is as good as any other fish leaving the United Kingdom or Ireland.  If the moneys are given for the development of this harbour certainly these progressive fishermen will take advantage of it.  The boats based in Killybegs <Col N="2755" /> will also take advantage of the facilities at Greencastle harbour.</P>
    <P>Greencastle is noted for its quality salmon which can compete with the best quality in any part of the world.  This port has proven itself through its quality white fish, salmon and enterprising fishermen. If given the opportunity I believe they should be given and the commitment on the part of the Donegal County Council to ensure that the moneys are made available it can only lead to success.  I think we can speak on behalf of Donegal County Council and guarantee that if the Minister provides the moneys this year we can match every £3 with a £1 from Donegal County Council.  A port with a turnover of £4 million each year&mdash; without taking into consideration at all any of the larger boats&mdash;needs to be seriously examined by the Minister.  If this harbour is not taken into consideration this year Greencastle, like many other harbours in need of development in Donegal, such as Burtonport, will deteriorate further.  If moneys are to be spent by the Department of Fisheries and Forestry then it is abundantly clear that they must be spent on the development of Greencastle harbour and on the dredging of Burtonport harbour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I visited Howth recently.  I hope the Minister, a man from the West, will look very seriously at the ports in the west which are providing jobs.  The expenditure we are requesting this evening will ensure added value for those ports and greater job opportunities for the people in this area.  Greencastle harbour where I have worked for many years, particularly during the salmon and white fish season, has not improved one iota in recent years.  We should now offer incentives to these fishermen in the 65 to 80 foot boats category, who are at present experiencing severe difficulties due to lack of white fish and the fact that that size boat does not have the power to work the grounds where mackerel are to <Col N="2756" /> be found at present.  We are endeavouring to entice people to take advantage of the new regulation under which FEOGA grants are made available for boats up to 33 metres.  I welcome that development but I had hoped that boats of up to 40 metres would have been considered also.  The larger boats should definitely be considered.  While I welcome this development on the one hand I might say it is nearly impossible for the fishermen to invest in these larger boats because, as I understand it, the deposit required is in the region of 20 per cent.  It should be remembered that this size of boat costs something like £2,500,000 and that a grant of 20 per cent leaves £500,000 deposit to be met by the fishermen.</P>

      <P>I was unaware that this debate was taking place until it was brought to my attention by Deputy McGinley.  While I welcome the interest Deputy Gallagher has taken in it I could not help but hear him say that Greencastle had not developed at all in the last few years.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Greencastle has developed.  I know there is need for further development there but, if it has not developed in recent years, one might well ask who has been in power here in recent years, who is responsible for this?  I might remind Deputy Gallagher that the money identified as being needed for the development of Greencastle harbour came as a result of an in-depth inquiry into cross-Border communications, known as the Donegal/Derry cross-Border survey which was put forward for EEC money. The person who pushed that most was the present Taoiseach as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Under the Deputy's then Government there was identified a need of £50 million by the EEC.  Part of that £50 million was to be spent on Greencastle.  The EEC Commission mentioned that £50 million was needed, that the Dublin Government would pay £12,500,000 and the Westminster Government the other £12,500,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. O'Toole)</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed scheme for Greencastle is estimated to cost about £4 million over a three-year period.  It has to be said that Donegal County Council would be expected to provide 25 per cent of that sum.  As we all know, the financing of a scheme of this magnitude must be spread over a number of years and before the scheme is commenced the necessary funding must be available to meet the contractual commitments which must be entered into.</P>
      <P>For several years, the major part of the provision in the Fisheries Vote in the harbours area has been taken up by major works in fishery harbours like Killybegs, Castletownbere and Howth, with the result that many other ports badly in need of development have been neglected, or at least their development has been deferred.  This has come about as a result of the decision taken some years ago in relation to designated fishery harbours&mdash;something with which I happen to agree, even though it was carried out by another Government.</P>
      <P>The Greencastle proposal has been in the Department for, I think, about ten years and while many plans have been conceived in that time, I would hope to act as midwife on the delivery of at least some of these plans in the not too distant future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  I fully accept that improvements are necessary at Greencastle, when one considers the level of activity taking place there.  It has hard working and very progressive fishermen who deserve somewhat better facilities than they have at present.</P>
      <P>The major works at Killybegs are nearly completed.  We are talking here about the provision of a synchro-lift which will complete the job there and the Howth works will also be completed very shortly.  These projects were soaking up the major part of our finances for harbour development.  We shall then be able to turn to the proposal at Greencastle, which has been agreed on the basis of an amended scheme.  The original scheme was for the construction of a pier which would provide 200 feet of berthage and water depths of up to seven feet at mean low water at spring tide and the extension of the existing pier to provide 400 feet of additional berthage and at least 12 feet water depth at mean low water, spring tide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were other matters, for instance, deepening 400 linear feet of the existing berthage to nine feet from the present depth of seven feet and provision of approximately 8,000 square feet of an additional reclaimed area to provide working space for the fishermen.  There was also provision for improved lighting and extension of oil bunkering facilities on the extended pier.  They were the original proposals.  These proposals have been scaled down from a previous proposed scheme because of the cost factor. The scaled down version only pertains to the reduction of the cleared area necessary <Col N="2761" /> and also the omission of an auction hall.  This has been discussed with fishery interests in Greencastle and with the management there.  They agreed that there was no need at present for the major facility of cleared area, which can be reduced, or for the auction hall. Deputy Conaghan's fears, it is hoped, will not be realised in that any changes will not entail delays from the point of view of the Board of Works with regard to planning and redesigning, because we are talking about specific matters which are being taken out.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works have been asked to furnish up-to-date estimates of the expenditure for 1984.  The problem here is that, as the Deputies will realise, there are contractual commitments outstanding in relation to works which are on-going.  We are awaiting the details from the Board of Works to see what our contractual commitments are out of a total sum of £2.7 million this year for harbour development.  We have not yet received these details but when we get <Col N="2762" /> them, we shall prepare a scheme of work which will take in the balance of the money left out of the £2.7 million.</P>
    <P>There are several urgent projects to be looked at and, indeed, I can tell the House that Greencastle figures as one of the priority projects on that list.  The Deputies can take it from me that I will do everything possible to facilitate improvements at Greencastle.  I finish by saying that I hope to be able to commence work there in 1984.</P>

The Department have written to the <Col N="2632" /> orthodontists on this question and are awaiting their response at present.</P>
    <P>A full-time post of consultant orthodontist in the Western Health Board is expected to be filled shortly and this will provide a new source of treatment for fixed appliance cases in the area.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the foregoing, I am not in a position to say when the treatment of the person referred to can be proceeded with.  However, I am most concerned at the delay in treating such cases and the Deputy can be assured that I will do all in my power to see that treatment is provided at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <P>Under the Prices and Charges (Notification of Increases) Order, 1979, importers with a turnover in excess of £250,000 per annum are required to make application only where they propose to increase their cash margins.  I am advised by the National Prices Commission that they have not recently had any notification for an increase in margin from any importer of chipboard.

      <P>I am not aware that recent imports of chipboard into Ireland are of inferior quality. I would point out that legislation already exists which protects the interests of consumers who purchase unsatisfactory goods.  The Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, provides that in general there is an implied condition in every contract of sale that goods are of merchantable quality i.e. that they are fit for the purpose for which goods of that kind are commonly bought and as durable as it would be reasonable to expect having regard to the price (if relevant) and any description applied to them.  If the goods are not of a quality that could reasonably be expected, the consumer may seek redress from the seller.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> An examination of the policing requirements of Galway which was carried out last year indicated that there was a need to improve the level of Garda service to the eastern side of the city and I am informed by the Garda authorities that in fact extra Garda mobile and foot patrols have been provided in that area in response to this finding.</P>
      <P>A final decision has not yet been taken concerning the provision of a Garda station to service this location.  The provision of an extra station is not necessarily the best way to improve Garda service to an area.  Apart from the major capital and maintenance costs that can be involved, there is the difficulty that the manning of an extra station absorbs considerable Garda manpower resources which might be used to better effect on patrol duty in the area.  The matter however is being kept under review.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The particulars relating to the District and Circuit Courts to the extent to which they are reasonably available are being compiled and I will forward them to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>As far as the High Court is concerned it would not be possible, without the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of staff time, to provide the information sought.  It may be taken that the numbers dealt with in the High Court are small, relative to the numbers dealt with in the District Court.  For instance, the total number of summonses issued in the High Court under the relevant Act (not all of which would necessarily relate to barring orders) was 21 in 1981 and 27 in 1982.</P>

      <P>The main lesson of the Rutland Street Project is that the effectiveness of educational intervention is likely to be increased if accompanied by radical change in the total environment.  The operation of the project provided clear evidence of the importance of an active role by parents in a disadvantaged area in the educational development of their children.</P>
      <P>The findings also revealed the differential effects of the out-of-school environment on the development of school-related skills in young children.  The experience gained from the project has, among other sources, provided the basis for innovatory practices in curriculum development, the in-service training of teachers and the active involvement of parents in the educational process.</P>
