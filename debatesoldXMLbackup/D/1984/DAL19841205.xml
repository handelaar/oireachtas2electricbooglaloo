      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I ruled that <Col N="1551" /> matter out of order yesterday.  It is undesirable &mdash; I do not want to use stronger language &mdash; that the matter should be raised in this way.  I ruled it out of order and did not give an opportunity to anyone to reply.  That is not the way it appears in certain reports this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the problem from my point of view.  In certain reports this morning it is reported that the Minister for the Public Service suggested I was misleading the House.  I am entitled to have myself cleared on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that, not through your fault or my fault, the statement by the Minister for the Public Service was reported I ask the Taoiseach, to clear my name, if he will make a statement today or issue a statement through the Government press secretary some time this morning either denying or confirming that the Government have taken a decision to increase the income from local authority rents by 20 per cent for 1985.  I just want a statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in the House but outside it.  I am asking that the Taoiseach take the opportunity outside the House to issue a statement through the press secretary either confirming or denying it. It is as simple as that.  The Chair regrets the report the same as I do.  I would like to have the matter clarified by the <Col N="1552" /> Taoiseach.  He should either deny or confirm that it is a 20 per cent increase in local authority rents with overtime and bonuses taken into account for the first time ever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to indicate that I cannot find any reason for the Deputy's objections to the provision.  The Deputy does not object to the provision for the consent of the Minister for Education to the appointment of a person who is experienced in the field of education.  In effect we are talking about two people who are experienced in that field.  In my view the inclusion of a provision for the consent of the Minister for Education to their respective appointments is a conventional matter. It is no more than one would give in terms of due regard to the role of the Minister for Education and because of that I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to return to the specific point I made in relation to <Col N="1557" /> midwives.  The Minister assured me that &ldquo;nurses&rdquo; is inclusive of midwives but the intention was to make sure that midwives were exclusive of all others.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister pointed out that subsection (d) (vii) which concerns the appointment of the Minister's 12 nominees states that one person shall be a person who is experienced in the field of education but my amendment refers specifically to subsection (d) (viii). That subsection states that one person shall be a representative of third level education establishments which are involved in the education and training of nurses.  The reason for the amendment is that I believe the Minister for Health is in as good a position as the Minister for Education to make a decision as to who the person appointed should be.  For example, if it was to be somebody from the College of Surgeons the Minister for Health would be in a better position, due to his close links with the college, to make the appointment than the Minister for Education.  I do not see why the amendment should not be accepted.</P>

We devoted almost all last Wednesday to discussing section 9 which deals with the composition of the board.  Anybody who was here then will recognise that this is a very important section.  There was great interest among Members in the composition of the Nursing Board.  It is extraordinary that when this Bill becomes law this Minister or any future Minister for Health can change the composition of the <Col N="1558" /> board without coming before this House with amending legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has put down an amendment which, in my view, aggravates the situation and makes it considerably worse because in the original Bill as circulated the Minister would have the powers to make these regulations with the consent of the board, but under his amendment, he can change the composition of the board after consultation with the board. There is a tremendous difference there. In other words &mdash; and I do not agree with it because in my view we need amending legislation to change the composition of the board &mdash; under the original section the Minister would have to have the consent of the board to change its composition, but now he can change the composition after consultation with the board.  I fail to understand why the Minister would want to tighten his grip on the Nursing Board.  Running right through this Bill the Minister has taken to himself phenomenal powers which do not appear in similar legislation.  I cannot understand why he put down an amendment to take from the board consent for any change in its composition, and substituted consultation, because consultation gives the Minister a further power.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to the whole idea of any Minister for Health changing the composition of the board without coming back to this House with amending legislation. This point was made very well last week when we spent almost the whole day discussing the composition of the board. This shows the fundamental importance of the composition of any board of this nature, not just the Nursing Board.  I strongly hold the view that we should have amending legislation if we want to change the composition of this board, and we should have very good reasons for doing so.</P>

      <P>Last Wednesday we had a very long discussion on the composition of the Nursing Board.  It is clear that if subsection (3) is passed in its present form the Minister can change the provisions of subsection (1) without coming before the House.  The Minister may have some <Col N="1559" /> explanation for this, but as the subsection stands he will have the power to make whatever changes he wishes.  It appears that even after the very long discussion which took place last week on particular changes in subsection (1), some of which the Minister agreed to, it is not logical that after the Bill becomes law the Minister could change the terms of subsection (1) without any reference to this House.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he was divesting himself of some of the powers he has under the present legislation, that is, appointing the president of the board, but he is taking far too many powers to himself under this Bill, so much so that one could get the impression that he does not have any confidence in the board he is setting up.  As Deputy O'Hanlon pointed out, the Minister's amendment aggravates the situation.  In the original subsection the Minister could only make changes with the consent of the board and that has been changed to &ldquo;after consultation with the board&rdquo;, but he does not have to accept whatever advice the board give him.</P>
      <P>Departments are always very anxious to retain as much control as possible. They find it very difficult to give away any powers but this is a matter for the Minister to decide.  As I said, it appears that the Minister does not have very much confidence in the board he is setting up.</P>
      <P>Another aspect the Minister referred to the last day and which may not directly relate to this subsection was the very large sums of money being paid by the State to the voluntary hospitals.  From that one would get the impression that as the State was paying so much money to these hospitals the State could impose whatever it wished on them.  I look at this from a different point of view.  The money used is taxpayers' money and it should be used in the voluntary hospitals providing the services the people of the area want.  I strongly urge the Minister to reconsider his position in respect of these subsections because under this Bill the Minister is taking too many powers to himself.</P>

      <P>I will not delay the House very long.  I endorse everything that has been said by our spokesman and by my colleague, Deputy Faulkner.  Last week the Minister took the attitude that there should be no discussion in this House on the recommendations made to him by the study body.  I do not know if this was a recommendation made by that body but even if it was I would not be happy giving any Minister the powers sought here, more especially having regard to his contribution last week.  He said that as far as he was concerned most of our hospitals did not enjoy the ethical standards he would wish.  That is what he said.  He need not deny it or shake his head because this is in the Official Report.  I regard this as something sinister.  If the council were not doing what he wished, he would rejig it and put his own people on it.</P>
      <P>There is much more in this legislation than meets the eye.  We have heard the Minister expressing his unhappiness with the situation existing at present in the nursing service and hospitals generally. Since his appointment, the Minister for Health has demonstrated his lack of suitability in interpreting what is required in our hospitals.  Last week he praised Deputy Richard Bruton's contribution when he said that we should only be concerned here with the taxpayer.  I am also concerned about the taxpayer, not just about their monetary contribution but with the standards they would wish to see in our hospitals which should be preserved and not destroyed.  I do not want to labour this point as I appreciate that we deal specifically with the function of the board in section 52 (2).  It refers to giving the board permission to establish these standards and I hope the House will realise that the Minister and certain people in his Department are trying to dismantle the medical services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the constitution of the board, I indicated last week that we can be quite sure that there will be very little representation for the religious.  I am unhappy in that regard because hospitals which have a religious presence have benefited from it and I do not want to see <Col N="1561" /> it removed.  The Minister indicated last week that he was getting vibes throughout the country that this anxiety was shared.  He has an opportunity now of assuring the House that, apart from manipulating the whole service in respect of the establishment of this representation given to the nurses, he will accept the representation as prescribed under the section.  It is not given to the Minister or his successor to change legislation passed in this House.</P>
    <P>Our hospital services are vital.  Their standards must represent the wishes of the taxpayer.  I approve of the ethical standards which are there at present and I want them preserved.  What is proposed here is a back door method of changing the spirit of this legislation and allowing a Minister to have the power to take away from this House what has been ordained by it.</P>

      <P>Like my colleagues I find the Minister's amendment incredible and I support my party's request to delete subsection (3).  Last Wednesday we discussed the composition of the board at length.  We made a plea that the representatives of the nursing profession should be increased from 16 to 18.  The Minister appeared to concede that point and he raised the level from 16 to 17. Why did he bother?  There is no point in continuing with the discussion because, if he gets his way in relation to his amendment, he can decide what the total composition of the board will be.  He does not have to refer to anyone; he can decide on the composition of a new board after making a simple telephone call of consultation with the board.  This is an amazing decision.  The Minister will probably refer to subsection (4) which says that a draft proposal of regulations shall be laid before each of the Houses of the Oireachtas but, in relation to that, there should be amending legislation before any decision is made in relation to the composition of the board.  The Minister should concede that point.</P>

      <P>I can allay Deputies' fears in regard to this question.  The Dentists Bill is currently going through the House, it received the support of the Opposition parties in very full measure in Seanad Éireann and this arrangement was discussed at great length.  This is a precise repetition of the provisions in the Dentists Bill and I have seen no reaction from the dental profession or the Dental Council in relation to it.</P>
      <P>We are talking about legislation which will last for several decades and we must remember that those years are bound to bring developments in medical and nursing education and in practices and procedures which we cannot anticipate at this stage.  We owe it to the profession and to the people for whom they care to make provision for these developments, in so far as we can foresee.  I am merely making a provision that, following consultation with An Bord Altranais, the Minister of the day may bring in a variation of section 9.  I fail to understand the tautology surrounding this when the Minister of the day must put the draft resolutions before the House.  Any variation on section 9(1) must be put before both Houses of the Oireachtas and the regulations cannot be made until a resolution is tabled specifically approving each of these draft regulations.  It cannot be more explicit than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ormonde apparently wishes to see a new Bill brought in.  One could have a new Bill but the parliamentary draftsman and the Attorney General, men not known for their excesses in terms of devolving powers on Ministers, recommend that it should and could be done by way of regulation.  I do not want to bore the House but if I were sufficiently argumentative, I am certain that I could dredge up a list of 30 or 40 statutes where this prospect remains in terms of varying the membership of State agencies and boards.  The words of a Minister in terms of this Act will be subsequently interpreted by the courts in terms of elaboration as to the intent behind the sections.  It is inconceivable that any Minister would <Col N="1563" /> walk into this House and bang down regulations without first going to his Government where the matter would be discussed and approval given.</P>
    <P>To vary the membership of a board requires a Government decision, the regulations would have to be submitted to Cabinet first of all and they would be subject to the scrutiny of the Minister for the Public Service, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Finance. Then the regulations would be tabled and there would be 21 days in which a nullifying resolution could be put down.  The matter would be debated on the floor of this House as in the case of a new Bill. The fears of Deputies in this regard are unfounded.  I realise I was especially trenchant in my views last week but those fears have been stirred up by the kind of contribution made by Deputy Tunney this morning.  He referred to the fact that there is no provision in the Bill for representation of the religious.  There is no provision in any legislation enacted by Houses of the Oireachtas for representation of the religious.  There is no such representation in any statute dealing with education or health.</P>

      <P>I refuse to enter into an argument as to when I last beat my wife.  That is precisely the kind of innuendo we have been hearing.  I am sick and tired of listening to a number of Deputies in this House imputing motives to me as Minister for Health with regard to the role of religious in the health services, the role of voluntary hospitals and representation.  I bitterly resent it and I know there are people stirring it up deliberately in relation to this Bill.  It has nothing whatever to do with the role of the religious, non-religious, doctors or anyone else as a particular group.  There will be elections and 17 nurses will be elected: there will be five on the training <Col N="1564" /> side, five on the administrative side and seven on the clinical practice side.  I have no doubt that members of religious orders, as well as others who are not members of religious orders, will go forward for election on that panel.  That is their democratic privilege as registered nurses on a Bord Altranais register.  If they are elected I will not be examining if they are members of a religious order. They will be elected as nurses.  The Deputy should disabuse himself of his prospects of gaining narrow political advantage over me as Minister for Health on an imputation of that nature.</P>

Lawyers have advised religious orders that I am up to something and that, if they do not keep an eye on me, I will be running voluntary hospitals.  They say that as I am paying 98 per cent of the cost of running the hospital I am now going to decide on ethics regarding nurses, despite the fact that most of the hospitals do not have ethical guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those observations were made in defence of the need for clear national guidelines regarding ethical conduct to be applied <Col N="1569" /> on a national basis by the nurses themselves. In this legislation we cannot have disciplinary provisions unless we have a code of ethical conduct applying across the board in the profession.  This does not exist on a national comprehensive basis as in the medical profession.  It was against that background that I made the point.  I hope that disposes of the issue. It is untrue that I indicated that the hospitals do not have the kind of ethical standards that I would wish to impose.  I never said that.</P>
    <P>I have indicated to Deputy O'Hanlon that I cannot accept amendment No. 7. It is essential that we should have a provision for the decades ahead so that, if the board come to the Department of Health and the Minister of the day indicating that they think the composition of the board should be revised, the Minister following consultations with the board can bring in appropriate regulations. There is nothing unusual at all about that provision.  Accordingly, I commend the section to the House, assuring Deputies that if I thought I would be devolving excessive powers on a successor I would hesitate very much before doing so without coming back to the House to put the amended regulation through the House, after a vote if necessary.</P>

      <P>The Ceann Comhairle is very anxious that we should confine ourselves to the specific sections of the Bill as we go through them.  That is my desire.  Last week and today it is the Minister who has been deviating from the section we are discussing.  That is of particular concern to me in relation to this section because in the last 15 minutes we have been debating sections further on in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I accept that, but the <Col N="1570" /> Minister responsible for piloting the legislation has been deviating each day from the sections we are debating.  We were having a reasonable debate on these two amendments but we got away for 15 minutes to a section which is much further on.  I do not intend to get involved in discussing matters in other sections because our function in Opposition is to ensure that we will play our part in seeing that this legislation will be good in the interests of the public and the nurses, legislation that will be a credit to the House.  That cannot be if we allow the Minister to deviate from the section.  I appeal to the Minister to stay with the section before us.</P>

      <P>On the amendments before us the Minister replied that the reason why he inserted this subsection is so that he can change the composition of the board by means of regulation.  Originally the Bill provided that it should be with the consent of the board but now it is &ldquo;after consultation with the board&rdquo;. His reason is that it had appeared in previous legislation, but he would not take up the time of the House to cite the legislation.  He referred to the Dentists Bill.</P>
      <P>This is a Bill relating to nurses and its aim is to regulate the nursing profession. Therefore, it is a sad thing to come into the House and find that the reason a subsection appears in the Bill is that it appeared in previous legislation.  The Minister told us this was done on the advice of the Attorney General and the parliamentary draftsman.  We as the people responsible must ensure that the legislation when passed will be good and I do not believe subsection (3) is good legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ormonde suggested that the Minister would bring in amending legislation rather than regulations.  I do not see anything wrong with that.  Last week we spent an entire day discussing the composition of the board, which is very important. Indeed it is most important when <Col N="1571" /> one looks at the functions of the board, like the power to regulate ethical conduct. There is nothing in this legislation to stop the Minister saying he will consult the board and then abolish all 27 members. Some Minister in the future might decide to do that.  I do not suggest that this Minister will ever find it necessary to communicate with the board to tell them he intends to change the membership.  As he said, perhaps in 20 years a Minister by regulation may change the composition of the board by abolishing all 27 members and replacing them with appointees he himself might feel would do the job as he might like it done rather than giving power to a board set up by statute.  When we pass this legislation I hope to have confidence in the board and their composition. I would not want to see the board changed otherwise than by amending legislation.  Regulations are a very simplistic way of making such a fundamental change in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why a Government could not bring in amending legislation to change the composition of the board if that were necessary.  I am sure the Oireachtas will be the same in the years to come as it is now and will facilitate the Government of the day if amending legislation is necessary.  Legislation has gone through this House in an hour.  I cannot see why there is such objection to amending legislation.  Why did the Minister submit his own amendment to tighten ministerial control over the Nursing Board and to provide that instead of with the consent of the board it will be after consultation with the board that the Minister by regulation can change the composition of the board?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I misunderstood the Minister.  I hope I did not.  He appeared to suggest that the alteration in the composition of the board will be initiated by the Nursing Board and not by the Minister.  We would probably find that acceptable.  Like Deputy O'Hanlon I am worried about the Minister's amendment. It gives the impression that he is determined to strengthen his own hand. <Col N="1572" /> I am worried about an ulterior motive. The Minister appears to suggest that an alteration should be, or could be, or would be initiated by the board.  If we could get a guarantee on that it would allay our fears to a great extent.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that if approached by the board he would bring in regulations.  Are these the only circumstances in which he would bring in regulations?  The other point raised by Deputy O'Hanlon relates to amending legislation.  Having discussed subsection (1) for such a long time, various views having been expressed on it and relative agreement reached on it, it seems to me that amending legislation is the only way in which any change should be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether the board initiate a proposed change in section 9 or whether the Minister initiates the change himself &mdash; and if the Minister initiates the change he is obliged to consult with the board &mdash; this would follow consultation with the board as proposed in the amendment. That is a formal statutory obligation on the Minister.  In either case the Minister will have to explain himself to the House if there is the slightest contesting of the proposed change in the regulations. We brought in the amendment because we considered it inappropriate and undesirable that an exclusive veto should devolve on the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the heel of the hunt, the Oireachtas should have the authority to determine the composition of the board as we are determining it today in this Bill.  That is why we propose to change from &ldquo;with the consent of&rdquo; to &ldquo;after consultation with&rdquo;.  I have not met any hostility to this in the various representations we received.  There is a strong view that this is the most appropriate way to deal with the matter.  Many other sections in the Bill contain provisions for rules and regulations, for example, the rules relating to the conduct of the election.  A question could arise about the method of election, whether it should be by proportional representation or by a direct vote.  These <Col N="1573" /> rules and regulations will have to be drawn up subsequently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">

      <P>They will have to be laid before the House.  I was asked a specific question by Deputy Faulkner, whether other sections of the Bill contained regulatory aspects.  There are other sections under which regulations will have to be laid before the House.  It would be inappropriate to have new legislation to make purely technical amendments to the constitution of the board, such as increasing the number of nurses on the clinical side of the board, or reducing the number of ministerial nominees.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I respect your view, a Cheann Comhairle, that I should confine myself to the section.  I welcome the undertaking given by the Minister to increase the nursing representation by a further two members.  I am particularly pleased that one of the positions is to be given to the psychiatric nursing profession. For too long that section has not got the recognition it deserves.  Unfortunately it will have to play a greater role in terms of health care in the future. There is an increase in the demands on the services provided by the psychiatric hospitals and the people who work in them.</P>
      <P>Perhaps on Report Stage the Minister might consider the appointment of a doctor from the psychiatric services to the board as one of his own nominees. Psychiatric nurses need a strong voice in the formulation of board policy in relation to the future organisation of our health services.  I would respectfully suggest that the Minister should not become too impatient with Members who wish to tease out and seek clarification on and amendment of sections which they feel are not in keeping with the expectations of the Irish people and, in particular, of the nursing profession whose members have made the service what it is today. The Minister is doing neither himself nor this Bill justice in reacting as he has been doing over the last couple of days.  There is still a long way to go before this Bill will appear on the Statute Books.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We on this side of the House will try to assist the Minister &mdash; that is, if he is in a receptive mood &mdash; to bring in legislation which will do the nursing profession proud in the years ahead.  That is what we are here for and that is why our approach to this Bill has been so responsible. I do not wish to be cynical, but the Minister would do well to take a lead from the example of our spokesman, Deputy O'Hanlon, who has confined <Col N="1575" /> himself to the various sections for the purpose of ensuring that every word and line in this controversial legislation &mdash; and whether the Minister likes it or not, it is controversial &mdash; will be teased out.  I see the Ceann Comhairle smiling at me.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 9, we are trying to get the foundation right.  Everything that will happen from here on will be totally dependent on the board's effect on the formulation of policy.  If we do not get the base right, nothing can go right after that.  Section 9 is one of the most important sections of the Bill.  The proposed new board will decide the future of our hospital services.  The Minister has said that he hopes the legislation will stand for 20 years and we echo that hope. That is why we are going to the pains of tediously teasing out the various sections. The composition of the board and the values and attitudes of its members will be of paramount importance.  I suggest that the Minister is likely to get a more balanced and more representative view from Members from all sides of the House than from some of the extremists who appear to have his ear and who would impose their minority view on our society, if given the opportunity.  That is why it is vitally important that the backbenchers from all sides of the House, representing grass roots opinion &mdash; a happy phrase &mdash; be taken into consideration in the formulation of this legislation. The Minister should treat these views seriously and not cynically.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for the Minister to say that the Members who express views which are contrary to his own are paranoid, and it is a pity that he used that phrase.  His welcome decision to increase board representation for the nurses is a direct result of the logical arguing of the so-called paranoid Members for this increase.  Before we leave section 9, I appeal to the Minister to go all of the way, perhaps on Report Stage, to bring the level of nursing representation on the board up to the two-thirds majority which the nurses' organisations have requested and for which they have made such valid <Col N="1576" /> representations to Members on all sides of this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred on a number of occasions to unease about this legislation. Whether he likes it or not, there is unease in that respect.  That unease is reflected in this debate and I have no doubt that it will continue to be reflected as long as the debate lasts.  I do not wish to attribute any allegations to the Minister, one way or the other.  I am sure that he is a dedicated and committed man, anxious to do as he sees best to organise our hospital services for the future.  His assurances here in relation to certain sections are welcome and I respect him for giving those assurances.  However, I am sure that even he would agree that this is not legislation to cover his term of office.  It will be the governing legislation for the future under which different Ministers and different Governments will operate in the years ahead.  The Criminal Justice Bill, if I may take an example, was very tediously debated here.  It has ended up as a vastly different document from that originally presented.  It would be my hope that the Nurses Bill will leave this House incorporating many amendments representing the views of the people who speak here.</P>
    <P>As I said, under section 9 the establishment of the board will be of vital importance. The composition of the board will have an important contribution to make with regard to hospital staffing levels. Our concern is more relevant than ever before, given the reduced level of hospital staff, now at an all-time low level.  The personnel of the board would need to have a commitment to retaining, indeed increasing, that level and the opportunities for young student nurses for whom this country has a great tradition.  We are not at present providing employment for these in our hospitals.</P>

Last week I heard members of his own party and of Fine Gael make very reasoned and compelling arguments as to why the Minister should bring in certain amendments to this legislation.  We are determined to ensure that the inevitable result of this debate, which will go on for many months, will be that we will have a Bill of which we, nurses and medical people generally can feel proud and free to operate under.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>If any of the ground I mention has already been traversed I can only apologise.  I did not take any part in the debate on the amendments.  I would be grateful if the Minister would clarify some points which I need not tell the House did not occur to me spontaneously but were put to me by people representing the nursing profession in my constitutency. I am sure other Deputies have received representations to the same effect.</P>
      <P>With regard to the election of members of the board by nurses, is it intended that nurses are to have a vote only in one of the divisions of the register, or if a nurse is registered in several divisions will she have a vote in each of them?  I hope this ground has not been covered before and would be glad if the Minister would reply to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was also put to me &mdash; it seems a reasonable point &mdash; that there should be a minimum experience qualification, it need not be a very exacting one, for any nurse before she is eligible for membership of the board.  No one suggested what that minimum ought to be but the Minister might tell us if he intends that a <Col N="1578" /> nurse immediately after qualifying will be eligible for election to the board or if she has to have some minimum experience before that can happen.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 9 (1) (b) it has been put to me that the clause (i) in (b) might be expanded in order to make it clear that nurses who are engaged in general nursing administration are nurses engaged in this administration at any level so as to include, for example, ward sisters.</P>
    <P>I will now put before the Minister some matters which were represented to me as being omissions from this section.  It appeared to those who advised me that it was an unfortunate omission that in subsection (1)(c) the Minister did not mention nurses in the occupational industrial field or nurses in the private hospital field.  These points seem to be reasonable. I do not have enough experience to add much rhetoric to it but I should be grateful if the Minister would indicate his views on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hyland was preoccupied about the need for two-thirds of the nursing profession to be represented on the board.  If one takes the 17 elected members, and I have indicated that I intend to appoint a nurse adviser from the Department of Health to the board, that makes 18.  Under (d) I have power to appoint a nurse, most likely from one of the specialist areas just mentioned by Deputy Kelly who would not have a separate division on their own. That makes a total of 19 and if there were no other changes 19 out of 29 gives two-thirds. As I indicated in reply to comments made about the section the last day, we should not play a numbers game in terms of the running of An Bord Altranais.  They are an integrated profession working together.  They are self-regulatory. I hope there will be real professional interaction between all 29 members of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon was anxious that a psychiatric doctor should be appointed. There is provision for that.  One of the medical practitioners will be employed in <Col N="1579" /> a hospital approved by the board for the training of psychiatric nurses.  I will not be appointing a person as such in terms of selecting a person.  I hope the nomination will come from the faculty of psychiatry and that the psychiatrists will nominate one of their eminent consultants for appointment by me.  After consultation with such bodies I will make the appointment. If I have appeared to be impatient it is because I do not want repetition in terms of section 9.</P>
    <P>Regarding the points raised by Deputy Kelly I appreciate that there are specific categories of the nursing profession who might feel they should have representation on the board.  However, I have followed as closely as possible the report of the working party.  They did not give separate designation, for example, to nurses employed in private hospitals on the occupational side, on the physical handicapped side or those specialising on the geriatric side.  The divisions are broad ones and it was felt that in having a board one should not specially designate areas for division.  I assure the Deputy I will take the points he made into account in any consultations I will have with the future board and hope the board take them into account also.  At this stage I can only broadly make the point about the categories.</P>
    <P>The provisions for election will be set out in the rules relating to the election. The rules must be drawn up.  I take the Deputy's point in that regard.  It is a valid one but it will be necessary to formally draw up the rules of the election. For example, we do not specify the method of election, whether it should be by way of proportional representation or whatever. That would have to be done.  The Deputy has a valid point, but it is difficult to cope with and on Report Stage I will be more prepared to elaborate on it and endeavour to help as much as possible in that regard.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputy Hyland that the board has no function whatever in regard to the levels of staffing in the hospitals or elsewhere in the health services.  He will be <Col N="1580" /> happy to note that that will reside with him as a member of a health board.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Effectively it would work out like that.  Two-thirds of 29 is 19.4 or something like that, but anyway they would have 17 elected members, one additional nurse, as is provided in the section, and one nursing adviser. Whether nurses would regard nursing advisers from the Department of Health as being nurses I do not know but I presume they would agree that they would be classified as nurses.  I hope to appoint a nursing adviser from the Department of Health.  That will bring up the numbers and it would enhance the point at issue which, incidentally, I do not take to be a point.  I see nothing meritorious in the concept of two-thirds any more than I see in the concept of 51 per cent.  That is an erroneous professional criterion by which to judge a Bill.</P>

There would be 29 members on the board, and I compliment the Minister on giving an extra place to nurses in general nursing and in psychiatric nursing.  At least that was one worthy change in the Bill, but did the Minister say that a nursing adviser from the Department of Health would be a member of the board?  The Minister did not accept our amendment which asked <Col N="1581" /> that the nursing adviser from the health board be automatically a member of the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I can help the Deputy there.  I was reluctant to write it into the legislation because we have only one nursing adviser in the Department of Health and if at any time that post was vacant because of embargo or otherwise the section of the Bill would be affected. I did not wish to write it in formally, but I have given an assurance to the House and to the representations I have received that where I will have power to appoint two persons representative of the Department of Health I hope that I will appoint the nursing adviser and that my successors will continue to do so.  If I write it formally into the legislation, with the very limited staffing structure we have we might finish up with the post vacant for six months with nobody on the board for it as a consequence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister has told us that he will appoint the nursing adviser from his Department. It is vital that the nursing adviser should be on the nursing board.  After all, she will be advising the Minister and it is important that she will know the thinking of the statutory body representing the nurses and their function.  I ask the Minister before Report Stage to look at the possibility of including in the Bill that the nursing adviser would be officially a member of the nursing board.</P>
      <P>I take the Minister's point that there is only one nursing adviser in the Department at the moment.  There were three nursing advisers but because of the embargo when two posts became vacant they were left unfilled in keeping with the Government's policy, but I cannot envisage any Government even a Coalition Government such as we have at the moment, doing away with all posts that would become vacant and that they would be left unfilled.  I believe that in the foreseeable future, and certainly for the lifetime of this legislation, a nursing adviser post in the Department of Health will be filled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1582" /> On the question of the two-thirds majority, the nurses were anxious that they would have a two-thirds majority and I would see 20 out of the 29 as being the practical two-thirds majority.  I take the Minister's point that if the board has 29 members he can get into percentages. As a practical application, to give the nurses a working majority on the board they would need 20.  I compliment the Minister on increasing the number of nurse representatives on the board, but they will still not have the majority that they asked for.</P>

Does he intend that nurses to be eligible for election here, particularly under paragraph (c), should have some minimum experience?  That does not arise under paragraphs (a) or (b) because it is clear that a nurse would not be training other nurses nor would she be engaged in nursing administration unless she had a great deal of experience.  It arises under paragraph (c) and if the Minister has made up his mind about this I would like him to let the House know.  The Minister may have intended that this point would be covered in regulations.  Subsection (3) provides authority for the Minister to make regulations which would vary the provisions of subsection (1).  Will such provisions cover the imposition of a minimum experience requirement?  Perhaps it would, but I warn the Minister that clauses such as this which empower a Minister to make regulations to vary this and that can be quite tricky.  Should litigation arise the courts are quite capable of holding that something which the Minister has done is not just a varying of a statutory provision but something which flies in the fact of it or which effectively annuls or negatives something which the Houses of the Oireachtas have resolved. I would not like to pronounce off the top of my head what is meant by the word &ldquo;varying&rdquo;, but if I were in the Minister's boots and had an idea in the back of my mind that I would impose a minimum experience qualification which would, for <Col N="1583" /> example, exclude nurses with under two or three years experience from eligibility for membership of this board, I would feel that if I intended to do it by regulation this would be going rather further than simply varying the provisions of the subsection.  If I had the idea of minimum experience in my mind I would prefer to state it here in the section.  I do not want the Minister to reply in detail to this now if he would prefer to think about it and say something about it on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I do not want this board to become unwieldy, but in the interests of the demands of the nursing profession and their request that they have a two-thirds representation on this board, the logical step under these circumstances would be to increase their representation to 20 and following on that to increase the total on the board to 30.</P>
      <P>One glaring omission in relation to this board is the absence of a student nurse. In this day of worker-director involvement an important aspect of the board would be that this major section of the nursing community, the student nurse, should have representation on it.  This might get around the Minister's dilemma in relation to nursing representation. There are a number of significant problems concerning student nurses which should be voiced.  I accept that the instructors, trainers etc.  Of the student nurses are represented but there is no representation <i>per se</i> of the student nurses.  The hospital in Ardkeen in Waterford has a nurse training school, and when the nurses finish their training they have no opportunity to get work experience before they go out into the world.  They are barred from applying for jobs in other hospitals because they have not work experience following their qualifications. They are in a catch-22 situation. Because of such problems perhaps the Minister could get around his dilemma in relation to this by adding a student nurse on to the nursing representation and increasing the number on the board to 30.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ormonde has made the point that I intended to raise.  I said on Second Stage that there was a need to have a student nurse on the board.  I am not going to go into the cases that have been brought to our notice of student nurses and the difficulties they have had which have been explained to us many times.  Section 9 of the Bill needs attention and I support fully the case that Deputy Ormonde has made that a student nurse be appointed to the board. The Minister may well say that the board will be representative of student nurses but I submit that there should be a student nurse on the board.</P>
      <P>The debate on this section has clarified a number of points that were causing concern.  The discussion has been useful and worthwhile and I am confident that the board will now be a better board and a more useful one.  I take this opportunity of appealing for more interest to be taken in the board.  In the past there seems to have been very little interest in elections to the board.  It is important that the nursing profession realise the importance of this new board and the importance also of having suitable people nominated for election to the board.  It is in the best interest of the profession that the best possible people be elected and that interest in the board's operations be maintained.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's indication of his willingness to accept many of the points raised and to incorporate them in amendments on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to return to a topic I have raised on a number of occasions.  I refer to the need to have a specific reference to midwives as distinct from nurses.  The trend in the Bill has been to use the term &ldquo;nurse&rdquo;.  There have been a number of areas in which we have encountered problems as a result of the use of generics because what is interpreted as being included in a generic heading can be quite different in respect of specifics.  I am sure the Minister is aware that 2,000 of the country's 22,000 nurses are engaged directly in the practice of midwifery, <Col N="1585" /> mostly in our nursing hospitals but perhaps in the future in a mix both of these hospitals and of the community.  Those 2,000 midwives have found that their identity and their separate specialisation has lost some of its impact since the Nurses Act of 1950 whereby they lost their separate registration but maintained a separate sub-committee within the board.  However, that has not proved to be adequate protection in terms of their specific skills, interests and standards of practice.  For the past ten years no recommendation forwarded by the sub-committee has been accepted by the board.  These recommendations might be very wide ranging in terms of disciplinary measures and also of education matters in which they have a specific interest.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, therefore, to consider this aspect carefully and to ensure that this Bill will not add to the problems I have outlined.  There is a need to consider how the identity and special skills of midwives are recognised in the Bill.  There is a tendency to assume that every nurse has a qualification in midwifery but is that training necessary when many of these people will move into such areas as theatre work, coronary care specialisation and so on?  Therefore, I am asking the Minister to have regard to this lack of clear thinking in relation to the role of the midwife because this lack of clarity has led to waste not only in the Department but also perhaps in the training of nurses.  Even more important, it has led to a failure to recognise the special contribution of the midwife to the health services.</P>
    <P>I am not advocating that we follow Britain in any respect but I would remind the Minister that the corresponding British Act is entitled the Nurses, Midwives and Public Health Visitors Act &mdash; in other words, the different groups are clearly distinguished.  While I can see the value in having the legislation as simple as possible, I am concerned that the term &ldquo;nurse&rdquo; is, to say the least, minimal in so far as midwives are concerned.  Where the term, &ldquo;midwife&rdquo; is meant, it should be used.  I trust that on Report Stage <Col N="1586" /> the Minister will be able to introduce amendments to cover these points.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an open mind on that issue.  I have received representations from, for example, the ICTU indicating that that section are interested in putting forward names.  With deference to Congress, I have acknowledged the interest of the ICTU in that regard but it would be improper for me to take further action pending the enactment of the legislation. I consider that there is a need for ordinary members of the public and for non-professionals to be represented in this area.</P>
      <P>Regarding the point raised by Deputy Flaherty, I do not consider that there is any need for a statutory midwive's committee having regard to the inclusion of the fitness to practise provisions which apply to nurses whether with or without a midwife qualification.</P>
      <P>However, there is nothing to preclude the board, should they so wish, from establishing a midwife committee under section 30 of the Bill.  Compared with the UK legislation, I regard the inclusion of midwife within the general definition of &ldquo;nurse&rdquo; to be more appropriate.  If one were to include in any title of a Bill references to every group who come within a general heading, one could have a very long title.  I consider our procedure to represent a much more effective framework for statutory definition.</P>
      <P>Deputies Ormonde and Daly raised the question of work experience.  I assure them that, again through An Bord Altranais, we are considering this aspect. The board are completing a survey of the work experience of recently qualified nurses and when that is to hand we will be in a position to assess more accurately the extent of the problem and perhaps be able to make some proposals in that regard, proposals which might in some measure relieve the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure Deputy Kelly who referred to the period of qualification prior to voting, <Col N="1587" /> that the existing provision is for only three months and there are pros and cons as to excluding newly qualified people.  I will have a look at that issue between now and Report Stage.  The 1953 provisions relating to nurses rules approved by the then Minister says that all persons registered at least three months prior to the last day for receiving nominations are eligible in terms of qualification of persons entitled to nominate or to take part in elections.  On Report Stage we can tease out some of these issues in greater detail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not here for the debate on this section so the Minister might have covered some of the points I am going to make.  The main point is that this is a nurses board and that the nurses should be in control of the board.  The general nursing staff, in the original draft of the Bill, had not got a fair representation in five.  The Minister has accepted that to a certain extent and has increased the number to seven.  However, when the Minister did that last week he also said in relation to ministerial appointments that paragraph (ix) would be eliminated and paragraph (ix) says: &ldquo;one shall be a nurse&rdquo;.  The Minister said he would have a look at the new representation and see if subsection (ix) could be left in.  I do not know whether or not the Minister has made any decision on that.  I hope that the Minister will leave that paragraph in and if the membership of the board is still too high he could drop off two of the doctors.  I do not see why three doctors must be appointed to a nurses board.  I doubt very much if the Minister would have three nurses appointed to a medical council or to a dental board.  This is a nursing board.  We seem to be under the impression that nurses are not capable of carrying on their own business in a professional way without interference. The purpose of this should be to establish nursing as a profession and let them decide on their own professional standards as others do.  Rather than eliminating paragraph (ix) I would ask the Minister to eliminate two of the doctors. <Col N="1588" /> In his appointment of a nurse I would ask the Minister to consider two areas which have not been covered, paediatric nursing and those engaged in the care of the physically handicapped.  That would strengthen the board and everyone would be represented.  Nurses would be strengthened in regard to their profession.  If the Minister must eliminate some people from the board in order to maintain the number at 27 he should eliminate the two doctors and keep the two nurses.</P>

      <P>In relation to student nurse representation and the work experience situation I respectfully submit that should we await the setting up of the board to look into it it will be too late because at that stage the board will have been set up and there will not be an opportunity to ensure that student nurses get representation.  The Minister appears to have some goodwill in relation to this section, so if he intends to do something about it, now is the time.</P>
      <P>In relation to what Deputy Mac Giolla has said, I feel strongly about the doctor representation on the board.  The doctors, as much as anybody else, are involved in the training of the student nurses. They have already been reduced from six to three on this board and it would be a pity to go any further.  We can still ensure that there is a two-third representation for the nurses if we increase the composition of the board to 30 members and increase the nursing representation by giving one to the student nurses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 11 gives the Minister power to set up the electoral process for the first election to the board and in it he can specify the class of nurses who may vote in any election.  Last week I asked the Minister in relation to the three categories of elections for nurses, if he could say in relation to the administration section how the nurses entitled to vote would be classified and he told us that in relation to general nursing in hospitals, nurses from ward sister upwards, and in public health senior public health nurses who would be regarded as being in the administrative structure would be eligible.  That is a broad classification.  We should spell it out fairly clearly and take a liberal interpretation of that administrative section, section 9 (b):</P>
      <P>five nurses resident in the state and who are engaged in nursing administration</P>
      <P>because the bulk of the nurses in practice are general nurses.  In order that there would be a fair and balanced representation, we should have a fairly broad and liberal interpretation of the type of nurse who would be allowed to vote under that section.</P>
      <P>The other question pertinent to section 11, raised under section 9, is the system of voting, whether it would be a direct voting system or a proportional representation system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other point I should like to raise with the Minister in relation to replacements on the board.  On the health boards, as at present constituted, the Minister has the power to appoint a replacements of anybody from the elected categories, the professional interests on the board.  The Minister has the power to replace if a member were to leave the board for any reason, whether through death or any other circumstances.  I hold the view that it should be the norm that the next person on the electoral list would be appointed automatically.  I should like <Col N="1590" /> to see that sort of system apply &mdash; where there is election on to a statutory body &mdash; that the next person on the electoral list below those who had been elected to the board or body would automatically replace anybody who left the board rather than have a Minister appoint somebody himself, somebody who might not have stood for election originally.  I am not saying that the present Minister would do so but, in the future, a Minister could appoint somebody who would not even be remotely connected with or have much interest in the category about which we are speaking.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to investigate that point in order to ascertain if something could be done to ensure that any replacement would be effected by way of somebody who had stood for election, somebody for whom the nurses themselves had voted, somebody just below those who had been elected to the board initially.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I might reiterate what Deputy O'Hanlon has said.  I can think of one example in our health board where one of the elected members of the profession took up an appointment elsewhere and he was replaced by the Minister.  In relation to the provisions of this Bill it is very important that the person who fills the position comes from the area from which that position was vacated, in other words, from one of the three sections laid down here.  Let the Minister renominate somebody, but in relation to the other section &mdash; whether one goes along with what Deputy O'Hanlon has said, taking the next name on the list &mdash; I do not know how that can be done.  However it is vital that any replacement be elected by one's peers.  That was the situation that obtained in the first place and the one we must ensure continues, that rather than the Minister or anybody else filling such vacancy, the nurses themselves would decide who will replace such person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall carefully consider the points raised by Deputies O'Hanlon and Ormonde on Report Stage.  As Deputy O'Hanlon has pointed out, it has been the general practice in <Col N="1591" /> the case of health board vacancies.  In the case of a recent vacancy in the North Eastern Health Board area, in exercise of the powers given the Minister under the Act, I selected the next person, with the next highest number of votes to fill that vacancy although, strictly speaking, there is no statutory obligation on one to do so.  I have followed that practice in relation to a number of vacancies and, by and large, it works well.  There is a difficulty in following that practice, that is that over a period of five years of a term of office a nurse may move from one category to another even though she may have been elected to an original category.  Therefore, there is particular need to draft rather carefully.  This issue will arise again under the Second Schedule of the Bill.  Indeed, Deputy Mac Giolla has an amendment down in that regard, in relation to the filling of casual vacancies.  I am not yet in a position to be entirely specific about who precisely can vote for whom, for the simple reason that there is need to examine this section, to investigate the existing rules, the quite elaborate rules of An Bord Altranais. The guidelines have already been laid down quite clearly in the existing rules.  I shall bear in mind the points raised by Deputy O'Hanlon and others as soon as we reach Report Stage.  That is as much as I am in a position to clarify at present.</P>
      <P>Section 11 is quite clear in its intent, in providing for the first election to appoint the 17 members to represent the profession. For the first election I appoint the returning officer.  For subsequent elections the board appoint their returning officer.  That is the position regarding section 11 (1) and (2).</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 10, subsection (1), line 23, after &ldquo;meeting&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, which shall <Col N="1592" /> be held not more than six months after the passing of this Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 12 (1) states that:</P>
    <P>The first meeting of the Board shall be held on a day to be appointed by the Minister and the Minister shall notify the members of the Board of the time and place of such meeting.</P>
    <P>My amendment would add the proviso that that meeting should take place not more than six months after the passage of this Bill.  The reason for that is that this Bill can pass both Houses of the Oireachtas and then no action need be taken for some time.  It is left entirely to the Minister as to when action might be taken.  It could be a year, two, three or even five years.  I believe it would be in the interests of the nurses generally, and indeed of the general public, that when this Bill passes both Houses its provisions come into effect as soon as possible thereafter. Because there must be elections to the board by the nurses I know it is not practicable to have the first meeting of the board held within weeks of its passage. For that reason I have inserted a period of six months in my amendment which I beleive to be a reasonable time within which to hold elections, giving the Minister time to organise the elections and hold the first meeting of the board.</P>

In other words, it would be a pity not to immediately harness the good will which will accrue out of its passage and the work that will have been put into it on all sides.

There are a lot of things to be attended to, a lot of organisation of elections etc.  Therefore I would feel that 30 days is pushing things somewhat.  At the same time, as Deputy O'Rourke has said, I would not advocate that it be put on the long finger, and six months would appear to be reasonable in this respect.</P>

      <P>I accept fully the general intent of Deputy O'Hanlon's amendment but I am rather reluctant to insert a given period in the provisions within which the board must hold its first meeting. Equally, when I met the Irish Nurses Organisation they were anxious that there should be a 30-day period allowed. At a meeting with them on 3 September 1984 I assured them that I would mention for the record here, on Committee Stage, that I would ensure that the first meeting of the board would be held as soon as possible after the appointments had been made.  For example, one of the difficulties about a 30-day period &mdash; if the elections finished in the month of say, June or the middle of July, it might not be possible for some of the Organisations, such as the medical organisations with whom I have to consult, to meet until the month of September.  We would have to await their nominees to the board.  To stipulate a period of 30 days would be too little while, at the same time, six months after the passage of this Bill would be too much.  I intend to move immediately after its signature by the President.  I would dearly wish to see a new Bord Altranais established and functioning, and I can assure Deputies there will be no delay whatsoever.  Basically this relates to the election of the board.  I do not think it will take six months to complete the necessary formalities.  It may take perhaps a month or two but, to write it in and then not to adhere to that time limit, would mean that one could find oneself in the real difficulty of not having received all the nominations with a month <Col N="1594" /> having passed, when legally one would have to hold a new election.</P>

I am not expecting the Minister to admit that. The first meeting of the board should be held on a day to be appointed by the Minister.  A Minister could for one reason or another put off appointing a board for a year or even two years.  If we pass this legislation the decision as to whether the board will ever meet will rest with the Minister.  There should be some minimum time such as the amendment proposes within which the Minister must call a meeting of the board.  Perhaps the Minister could suggest a period of three months or six months.  He must be tied down to calling a meeting of the board because under the section a meeting might never be called.</P>

      <P>Subsection (1) provides that the board shall appoint such committees as they see fit to assist in carrying out their functions.  Subsection (2) obliges the board to set up a fitness to practise committee.  This is the only one which will be statutory.  The rest may be statutory if the board see fit to give that amount of power.  Subsection (3) enables the appointment of non-members of the board to committees other than the fitness to practise committee. The present board provides in its rules for the appointment of person other than members of the committees.  Subsections (4), (5), (6) and (7) are self-explanatory.</P>

      <P>The section proposes to set up sub-committees, some members of which will not be members of the board.  This is at variance with the Medical Practitioners Act where all the sub-committees are made up of members of the Council.  Could the Minister explain why people who will not be members of the board will be members of the sub-committees?

      <P>This is the point I made when the Minister told us that certain sections were included in this Bill because they were also in other Acts.  This is something we should get away from.  This is the third time in six or seven years that we are legislating for professional bodies but a lot of the Bill is a copy of provisions in previous legislation.  We have an opportunity now to update sections and subsections contained in previous legislation and produce a Bill that represents 1984 thinking on the subject.  I do not think any Member will agree with that subsection, that the president or vice-president of the board should be excluded by statute from being chairman of the sub-committee.  I am not referring to this legislation only but to any legislation.</P>

      <P>In page 11, subsection (1), line 15 after &ldquo;by order,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;after consultation with the Board,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an important section because it gives the Minister power to disband a board if the members refuse to perform any function assigned to them under the Act.  While I accept the need for such a section I am concerned when it is taken in conjunction with sections such as section 54 which gives the Minister the right to assign new functions which may not have been debated by the House.  The Minister by regulation will be in a position to assign new functions to the board. I am concerned about section 52 which deals with ethical conduct.  In the context of the two sections mentioned we must give serious consideration to section 15.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1600" /> I see the need for such a provision because if a nursing board went completely away from what was laid down by statute the Minister, or somebody else, would have to have the authority to disband the board.  My amendment provides for consultation with the board before a Minister takes any such action.  I want to ensure that the Minister does not take any such action without consulting the board and discussing with the members whatever misdemeanour they may have been guilty of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to the Deputy that the Minister's power under this subsection is deliberately discretionary.  The subsection, as drafted, leaves the way clear for consultation to take place.  It goes without saying that if the board refuse, fail or neglect to perform any function assigned to them under the Act any Minister for Health before making an order would consult with the board to find out if there was any valid reason for their action.  I submit, therefore, that the amendment the Deputy has proposed is unnecessary.</P>

      <P>The Minister made an interesting statement.  He said that where the board fail or neglect to perform functions the Minister would consult with the board to consider if there was a valid reason for their failure to perform a certain duty or function, but who decides a &ldquo;valid reason&rdquo;?  I am interested in those words.  We have an example in my constituency where a number of the members of a semi-State body were fired for precisely that reason.  They thought they had a very serious valid reason for not performing a particular duty, but the Minister disagreed, although the board agreed with the members, and the members were fired.  I would be concerned that where all the board members felt there was a valid reason for not performing a particular duty, or neglecting to perform it but the Minister thought there was valid reason, that the Minister's view would prevail.</P>

The Minister of State accepted that a reasonable Minister would consult with the board, but we are legislating for decades ahead when a Minister might not be reasonable.  In this case I can see no reason why this amendment cannot be accepted.  It merely asks that the Minister consult with the board before removing members from office and that he would not take a high-handed approach and remove the members from office without consultation.

      <P>In page 11, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following subsections:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) The Minister may amend or revoke an order made under this section, including this subsection.</P>
      <P>(5) Every order under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made, and, if a resolution annulling the order is passed by either House of the Oireachtas within the next twenty-one days on which that House has sat after the order is laid before it, the order shall be annulled accordingly and in case of an order made under subsection (2) of this section the members of the Board who had been removed from office by virtue of the order shall be restored to office but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done by any person or persons appointed to discharge all or any of the functions of the Board under and by virtue of the order.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister is given two permissive powers under this section, first, the power to direct the board to carry out their functions and second, the power to remove the board from office.  The exercise of either of these powers could have significant effects for the profession as a whole.  It is therefore considered desirable to provide for the amendment or revocation by the Minister of an order under this section and for the Houses of the Oireachtas to be given an opportunity to annual such an order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>While obviously this is an improvement on the original Bill, <Col N="1604" /> nevertheless I do not understand why the Minister introduced two subsections which would oblige him to lay the regulations before the Houses of the Oireachtas and, if the Houses of the Oireachtas so desired over 21 days to revoke the regulations, they would have to make a decision on that.  Earlier today we discussed section 9 under which the Minister, when making regulations, can change the composition of the board.  He makes it mandatory on the Houses of the Oireachtas to debate those regulations.  They must come before the Houses and the Houses must approve the regulations.  I do not understand why in a section of such fundamental importance as section 15 a similar subsection is not brought in instead of the subsections which says that the regulations should merely be laid before the Houses and if someone is quick enough to spot them they can be raised here.  It is not mandatory for the House to debate this but it is mandatory on the House to debate a change in the composition of the board.</P>
      <P>This section is of more fundamental importance than section 9 because here we are giving the Minister power to remove from office every member of the board, those elected by their peers and those appointed by the Minister.  Now a very vague watered down subsection is being introduced and Members will have to be very alert to see the regulations when they are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  They would probably be placed in the Library, but we might not be notified.</P>
      <P>If we introduce a subsection to ensure that we do justice to the board and that we will not have a Minister removing the board from office without just cause, I ask the Minister to introduce a subsection similar to section 9(4) which would make it mandatory on the Houses of Oireachtas to debate these regulations and to pass a resolution approving them before a board is removed from office.</P>

      <P>I am talking about this order particularly because section 15 is of fundamental importance.  Here we have a board, the majority of whom will be elected by their peers and 12 appointed by the Minister, and we are now giving the Minister power to remove them from office if they are guilty of a misdemeanour. To date, we have not succeeded in having the Minister even consult with them.  Hopefully on Report Stage that will be changed.  I am asking that it be mandatory that the Minister come into this House with the regulations and have them approved by the Houses.</P>
      <P>In the history of the State it is very seldom that a Minister used that power. Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn referred to the board of Údarás and I remember once the boards of RTE and Dublin Corporation were removed by the Minister. They are the only three cases which spring to mind.  This power is used very rarely.  For that reason, if there was a debate on the matter it would not take up much time in the House.  Section 15 is of such fundamental importance that we should include a subsection which would make it mandatory on the Houses of the Oireachtas to approve regulations laid down by the Minister.</P>

I am not blaming him for that but this amendment is fundamentally important.  In the cases of the RTE Authority and the Údarás Authority mentioned by Deputy O'Hanlon, the people removed by the Minister were those who were appointed by a Minister to the board.  However, this is a completely different matter.  These people are elected by their own profession and they are now going to be removed from office by a Minister.  If the elected members on the nursing board feel they have a valid reason for neglecting to perform a particular duty and if the Minister thinks they do not have a valid reason they will be removed from office without reference to this House.  We should not have a repeat of Committee Stage on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I am glad to see that the board, not the Minister, will appoint the chief executive officer as it appears throughout the Bill that the Minister is assuming an inordinate amount of power. I see also that his terms, conditions and the duties he performs are with the consent of the Minister.  While I do not want to fall into the trap which the Minister and the Minister of State fell into this morning of saying that certain provisions were in previous legislation and, therefore, would be included in this Bill, I should like to draw attention to the fact that the Registrar of the Medical Council is appointed by the Medical Council and there is nothing about the consent of the Minister.  This is something that runs throughout the Nurses Bill and to which we objected on Second Stage.  We do not understand why it is necessary to have the consent of the Minister in the appointment of the chief executive officer.  I have every confidence in the Nursing Board to do that job.  Subsection 4 says that the Minister may, whenever and so often as he thinks fit, declare that any power conferred on the board by this section shall be exercisable only with the consent of the Minister and whenever any such declaration is in force, the said power may be exercisable only with such consent. That gives an inordinate amount of power to the Minister and I should like the Minister of State to explain the thinking behind that subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection 3 says that there shall be paid by the board to its chief executive officer out of funds at its disposal such <Col N="1608" /> remuneration and allowances as the board, with the consent of the Minister, from time to time determines.  The nurses will be funding the board and will be fully responsible for all funds.  I do not understand why it is necessary to get the consent of the Minister when they are funding the board.  Perhaps the Minister of State could deal with those points.</P>

      <P>The Minister misunderstood me.  I welcome the fact that the CEO is appointed by the board instead of by the Minister.  However, I would welcome any subsection which is specifically designed to make this better legislation. I am concerned at the number of times we have been told today that the reason for the subsection is that it is standard procedure in legislation.  We are legislating for the nursing profession to regulate their own members.  Why is it inserted in subsection (1) that the Minister must give his consent to the conditions of service for the chief executive officer when this does not appear in previous legislation dealing with similar bodies.? It appears here because, throughout the Bill, the Minister is taking more and more powers to himself which do not appear in previous legislation.  That is why I asked why it appeared in this section as there is no reference to it in Bills of a similar nature.</P>
      <P>I also ask why it is necessary to have the consent of the Minister for payment of the remuneration of the chief executive officer because, as proposed in the Bill, the board will be funded exclusively from the nursing profession.  The State will not be obliged in law to make any financial allocation to the board.  We will deal with that on section 25 because that section states that board will be funded by the nursing profession.  I wish the Minister to explain exactly what subsection (4) means.  It appears to me it is giving an inordinate amount of power to the Minister.  How will he use his power under that subsection?</P>

      <P>The pay of chief executive officers is not determined by the Minister but is governed by the public pay agreements.  We have nothing to do with it.  In the normal course it might be expected that the giving of such consent would be a formality.  However, in a situation where, for example, the board might have cause to dispense with the services of the CEO or otherwise radically adjust his conditions or functions, the consent clause would operate both as a saver for the board and/or as a protection of the interests of the chief executive officer.</P>

      <P>There shall be paid by the Board to its Chief Executive Officer out of funds at its disposal such remuneration and allowances as the board, with the consent of the Minister, from time to time determines.</P>
      <P>Surely that gives the Minister all the power to decide how much the CEO will get?  The board can decide on any figure they like but if they do not get the consent of the Minister the CEO will not receive that amount.  I should like to know from the Minister of State how he can interpret that subsection to show that the Minister has no say in the amount the CEO will receive.</P>

Will the Minister of State not accept that this board is different from the boards of semi-State bodies?  This board is funded by the profession itself.  The funds will not come from the Exchequer as they do in the case of many of the semi-State bodies.  Will the Minister of State not accept that in this case the consent of the Minister should not be required with regard to the salary of the chief executive officer?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is well established that public pay policies are controlled by the Government.  There will be a substantial amount of funds in this new board and somebody must have responsibility in this matter.  If the Minister did not have some responsibility here, I am sure the Deputy would be the first to criticise if the board did not operate in the way one would expect from the point of view of finances.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State suggested we would be very concerned if the funds were spent in a way that might not be professionally correct. The nursing profession have given tremendous service to the community for many years.  They have a very worthwhile code of ethics and code of practice that may not be appreciated by the other side of the House but that is appreciated over here and I am sure that Minister State also appreciates it.  I have made the point that this board is different from the other boards of semi-State bodies in that they are funded directly from the Exchequer.  This board will be funded directly by the profession and I think the salary of the chief executive officer should be decided by the board.  Perhaps the Minister of State might be able to <Col N="1612" /> give the House an example of a similar situation where funding for a board comes directly from the profession concerned and not from the Exchequer and where the consent of the Minister is required with regard to payment of the salary of the CEO.</P>

      <P>I cannot give the Deputy a direct example and I do not see any reason for doing so.  The point I have made is that the buck must stop somewhere and in this case it stops on the desk of the Minister for Health.  As I said, the level of fees being charged to fund this new board are quite substantial.</P>

Pay across the board has to be held at a certain level.  There is no point in my saying to the Deputies opposite that this board, apart from any other board, should be allowed to pay anything they like to their chief executive officer. It is only reasonable to expect that the Minister would have some input in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to a previous question from the Deputy on 8 June 1983, I am not satisfied that a sufficient case has been made for the appointment of a separate Minister of the Government for the food industry.</P>
      <P>Responsible Ministers are giving particular attention to the development of the industry at the present time as the recent White Paper on Industrial Policy and the national plan, <i>Building on Reality</i> makes clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A co-ordinating group, consisting of the Ministers of State at the Departments of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, and Foreign Affairs (Chairman) was established earlier this year, the terms of reference of which include, <i>inter alia</i>, the examination and the co-ordination of the <Col N="1614" /> roles of the Departments and State agencies involved with the food industry, and consideration of the question of joint &ldquo;marketing&rdquo; of the services of the respective Departments and agencies to the primary producers or processors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach satisfied, in view of what he has said on the progress in the development of our greatest natural resource, that the proper added value is being made to our agricultural industry?  Is he aware of the calls in recent weeks and over the past six months, when I put down a previous question on this subject, of most important agencies, such as the Confederation of Irish Industry, the IAOS and almost all the major bodies involved in agriculture and in food processing, for a proper, coordinated apporach which would take place only with the appointment of a Minister specifically responsible for the co-ordination and development of the food processing industry?  Is there any reaction at all to the calls of those agencies to him and to his Government to take immediate and urgent action on the existing crisis in the whole food industry?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the co-ordination and the efforts of our food processing industry in the marketing area and with the failure over the last 30 to 35 years to face up to the issues involved and the accumulation of reports on shelves with no action being taken on them.  I agree with the Deputy that there is a serious problem here, which is precisely why I have established the co-ordinating group with a view to examining what might best be done to resolve this problem.  I am not satisfied that one solves these problems by simplistic answers, by appointing a Minister for this or the other.  The problem is a much more fundamental one and must be tackled at a more fundamental level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely there is nothing fundamental about a co-ordinating group?  Would the Taoiseach accept the proliferation of agencies &mdash; and I am aware of at least 12 involved in this whole <Col N="1615" /> area of food processing, food promotion and so on &mdash; and at least four Ministers, with several Ministers of State also trying to have a bite of the cake?  This whole proliferation of agencies and Ministers is causing the development of the food industry to fall between all stools.  In the two years that the Taoiseach has been in Government, he and his Government have failed to take any positive action whatsoever.  As a result, food imports are increasing at an alarming rate and our exports are failing to make any impact, particularly on European markets.  Is the Taoiseach further concerned with the total disintegration of a food industry which is happening all around him?  The liquidation of clover Meats this week is just one other example.  Is the Taoiseach prepared to sit there and tell this House that he is able to do nothing further than appoint a further co-ordinating group to talk away this problem?  I must say that I am totally disappointed with the Taoiseach's response to this vital matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, Deputy.  I recognise, as I have said, that the proliferation of agencies does raise questions which need to be examined and that the actions of preceding Governments in accumulating these agencies in this way need a through examination.  The co-ordinating group are there not simply to co-ordinate existing agencies but, as I said to the Deputy, part of their terms of reference is to consider the question of joint marketing of the services of the respective Departments and agencies to the primary producers and processors, services which at present are &ldquo;marketed&rdquo; jointly and do involve the proliferation of effort.  The Deputy is right in identifying the problem but it is about time that something was done about it and we are tackling it, which previous Governments have failed to do.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach not accept from me that the decision I took in the short time that I was Minister for Industry and Energy to hand over, on a pilot basis, the development of our food industry in the mid-west to an agency which was fully established, very active <Col N="1618" /> and very effective &mdash; in other words, the SFADCo operation &mdash; was an effective step to do something about it?  His Government threw that aside and went along with another task force of Ministers. That is the reality.  I wrote that in the decisions of the Department of Industry and Energy, if the Minister wants to examine the record.</P>

Considering that three or four multiples, mostly foreign based, control up to 80 per cent of the food trade in the city and 50 per cent nationally, does he agree that we are virtually totally dependent for half the food consumed in the country on foreign sources?

This is a major target of Government policy: to create conditions in which unnecessary imports can be substituted by domestic production.  The Deputy was right to identify that.

The Minister for Foreign Affairs showed absolute contempt for them when they visited here seven months ago.  Does the Taoiseach agree, having agreed that the embargo resulted from that event, it had a major effect on our trading prospects for the future and were it not for the recent visit by Deputy Haughey and the subsequent lifting of the trade embargo the damage which Deputy Barry and the Government did to the trade would have continued?

      <P>The negotiations between the Community and the applicant countries in the fisheries sector are only now reaching their final decisive phase.  Given this situation and pending the outcome of the negotiations it is not possible to make an assessment of the practical implications of enlargement on the Irish fishing industry. My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, has already assured the House of the Government's commitment tot the forceful presentation of the particular requirements of the Irish fishing industry in the ongoing negotiations.  I would like to repeat that commitment now to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware of widespread fear and anxiety throughout the Irish fishing industry about the way negotiations are progressing and because of the threat and serious implications for the development of the industry in the future.  Can the Minister give any indication this afternoon as to the Government's negotiating position and how he proposes to build protection for the Irish fishing industry into any agreement? With the threat of Spanish and Portuguese accession to the EC, how can he see any prospects whatever for the development of the fishing industry?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply, we are now reaching the final decisive phase. As the Deputy knows, only yesterday arrangements were made to proceed along the lines laid down by the summit in relation to the Community negotiations. The Deputy as a former Minister must know that it would be inappropriate and very foolish of me to give details publicly of the negotiating stance of our Minister or his colleagues in the Community at this time because very serious matters are to be negotiated yet.  I accept that concern is being expressed and I have expressed the same concern in relation to the effects of the Spanish accession in particular on the fisheries sector.  All I can say is that I am sure the Deputy will understand that the publicising of a negotiating stance at this stage would be both foolish and inappropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister clarify for us what the Irish Government's position is after yesterday's summit?  Do we take it that the decision reached at the summit is our first opening position in these negotiations?  Can we expect that as the negotiations progress there will be a further weakening even in the very weak demand made at the summit?  As the negotiations progress a further weakening of that position is likely with a more serious threat developing for the Irish fishing industry.  The Minister will be aware that the Spanish Government rejected totally yesterday's summit proposal. They said that they need a shorter transition period.  They have said already that they need further access into the Irish stocks on the west coast.  The negotiations which will proceed from here on the position which we have adopted, which is weak enough in itself, will be weakened further with the serious threat of a substantial Spanish involvement in the Irish coastal areas in the coming years and even in the transition period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>All this did not start yesterday.  The declaration by the Community was made to Portugal in May 1984 and to Spain on 28 May and the proposals contained in that declaration were <Col N="1626" /> rejected by Spain.  In the meantime negotiations have taken place along even tougher lines with the applicant countries, Spain and Portugal.  While at this stage Portugal is causing us no problem, Spain is the problem area, and all I can say is that the stance adopted now will probably change again through further negotiations which must take place.</P>
      <P>This matter has been going on for the past seven years and we are now reaching the final phase.  The negotiators and both the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is at present President of the Council, and the Minister of State, who is heading our delegation there, are well informed and well aware of the concern expressed and the serious consequences that might ensue if the right approach is not adopted. They are making every effort to ensure that that concern will be taken on board and that the interests of the Irish fishing industry will be preserved in any final agreement reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give an assurance that the structures which exist already within the Community, the measures which have been adopted with regard to licences and what we call the box to curtail the activities of Spanish fishermen, will not be dismantled with the accession of Spain?  I ask him to accept that any questions which we ask here are not in an attempt to destroy his negotiating capacity but merely to strengthen his resolve and his hand in dealing with what is regarded by fishemen as the biggest threat to their future livelihood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the sentiments expressed by Deputy Power in relation to not damaging our negotiating position. However, anything I say in relation to assurances given here is adopting a stance and giving away something, which ought not be done at this point.  Let me say, however, in relation to the Common Fisheries Policy that that was agreed in January 1983 and that policy provides for certain measures.  The up-to-date position is that in any negotiations that have taken place the Community negotiators <Col N="1627" /> have insisted that the provisions of the CFP are held intact.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Irish fisherman is very much afraid of the invasion of the Spanish fleet? Further, is he aware that the Irish fisherman believes that there is a complete sell out by the Irish Government on his own industry?  The fishermen believe that they will be sold out in order to gain concessions in other directions.  I am sure that the Minister agrees with that.  Can he guarantee here today that he will safeguard the livelihood of the Irish fishermen, and will he tell us of his input into the talks and what his bottom line is in relation to Spanish fishing?</P>

      <P>The mention of them here by Deputy Byrne gives currency and credence to that kind of terminology, which I do not accept.  How many times must I say that it is in the Deputy's interest as well as mine, and <i>vice versa</i>, to ensure that we safeguard the interests of our industry within the framework of the CFP to which we have been party and, let me say, to which my predecessor, the Deputy's colleague Deputy Daly, contributed in his time as Minister as did his predecessors?  In that framework we are operating.  Let us be clear in our minds as to what we are talking about.  A decision was taken to proceed with negotiations on enlargement.  Once we went down that road the only people who could stop that would be the applicant countries themselves by way of their non-acceptance of the terms being put to them.  Up to now negotiations have continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to certain responsibilities and obligations there are rights in respect of accession and membership and these <Col N="1628" /> must be catered for in the event of accession by the applicant countries.  Having said that, we are now in a position to take the precautions necessary to ensure the preservation of our interests.  That is what our negotiators are doing.  I am not involved directly.  I am in the second row, so to speak.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that our fishing industry is a vital national industry.  It is as vital to us as wine is to parts of Germany, France and Italy.  In these circumstances would the Minister not agree that, to say the least, our Government have been ineffective in not making the negotiations on fishing as vital a component of the enlargement agreement generally as the French, the Italians and the Germans particularly have succeeded in doing in respect of their interests?  Would the Minister not agree that under our presidency the only issue that seems to have been unblocked is the issue of the wine lake and not of our fisheries protection?</P>

      <P>Are the Government considering the imposition of some kind of ban on the expansion of the Spanish fishing fleet for a period of only ten years? Are the Government favouring the ten year proposal or are they taking the stance that we would encourage them to take, that would be to bar the Spanish fishing fleet from operating in those areas to which they do not have established rights?</P>

      <P>As I have said, the enlargement question is one that is causing <Col N="1630" /> us concern.  As Minister for Fisheries I would much prefer that this matter had never arisen but the fact is that negotiations on the question of enlargement have been proceeding.  However, the problem is that the negotiations on fisheries are now really beginning.  I appeal to Deputies not to continue asking me questions to which they know I cannot give replies without doing damage to ourselves and to the Irish fishing industry.</P>

      <P>If the Minister has not done so already, will he agree to meet with the various fishing interests, the IFO, the IFPO and so on, in order to brief them on the latest position and, more importantly, to advise them of the effects which enlargement of the Community could have?  Even if the Minister has met these associations recently I am sure they would be very anxious to meet him once more.  Does the Minister accept that while the accession of Spain may mean the opening up of markets for this country generally it would be of no advantage in terms of selling fish products to Spain since the white fish on which our industry depends largely, that is, mackerel, herring and salmon, is not sold into Spain as finished products?  The Minister said a few moments ago that he would prefer that this problem had never arisen. It is important that he clarify that remark. I interpret it to mean that he would have preferred if the question of enlargement had not arisen.  Does he mean that this question is causing problems for the industry?  Will the Government use their <Col N="1631" /> powers of veto in relation to enlargement if accession of the applicant countries will result in disastrous effects for our fishing industry?</P>

I have met the IFO twice recently and the last word I had with them was that if they wished to meet me again my door would be open to them and that I would update them on what was happening.  At 3.30 today I am meeting the processors and I intend to discuss with them the question of enlargement and also a variety of other problems. Last night in Brussels I met the general secretary of the IFO and I had a long discussion with him on yesterday's meeting.</P>

That is the kind of impression that is gaining credence but there is no basis for it.  I refute it entirely.  The second question concerned an expression I used and which I stand over.  I began that statement with the words &ldquo;as Minister for Fisheries&rdquo;.  Let us not blind ourselves to the fact that enlargement and full membership carries with it certain rights for the new members, rights which we as members must take on board.  That is the whole reason for the concern being expressed.  It is the whole reason for the negotiations that have been in progress for the last seven years.  We are talking about very complicated issues and the existing members are trying to ensure that their interests are preserved in the enlarged situation.  That is what we are trying to achieve.  The third question from the Deputy concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to markets in <Col N="1632" /> Spain, at the moment the species mentioned by the Deputy are not marketable in Spain.  In Spain there is a total consumption in the region of 1¼ million tonnes of fish.  They supply 1 million tonnes, so there is a net import into Spain of ¼ million tonnes of varied species of fish.  We could avail of that market.  That depends on what happens at the end of the negotiations, the demolition of trade barriers and so on, when it will be easier for us to get access into the Spanish market for species of fish for which we have had a fishing tradition.  The market is there and it is up to us to avail of it.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the widespread disquiet at the appointment of a liquidator to this boatyard?  Is the Minister concerned that the present Government seem to have a penchant for converting boatyards into graveyards? Will the Minister ask BIM to draw up a comprehensive scheme to secure the jobs of the people in this industry which is 100 years old?  Will the Minister do everything in his power to secure those jobs?</P>

      <P>That company is in the hands of the liquidator at the moment and that creates problems for me.  However, boat-building yards have never been a matter for the Minister for Fisheries. These are run by the private sector and the only involvement of the Minister for Fisheries with the boat-building industry is that he provides the finance in the form of grants and loans to BIM, who in turn provide them to applicants for the provision of boats.  Such grants and loans are not given for the building of boats.  They are given to individuals for the purchase of boats from boatyards where orders have been placed.  I am at a distance from the actual boat-building industry so while I would like to see a healthy boat-building industry here, I am afraid that individual companies are the responsibility of their boards of management.  In this case the directors of the company sought a liquidator. The High Court granted their request and a liquidator was appointed.</P>

      <P>As Minister for Fisheries is the Minister responsible for the overall policy and direction of An Bord Iascaigh <Col N="1637" /> Mhara?  Would he agree that, in a number of cases in the past couple of years, BIM have spent considerable amounts of the taxpayers' money on office accommodation and various other schemes?  Would the Minister agree that he has the responsibility for providing taxpayers' money to BIM and that some semi-State bodies are quick enough to come to the Minister seeking funds when they are in trouble?  Would the Minister not agree also that he has a responsibility to the taxpayer to ensure that such bodies spend their money in a prudent manner? Would the Minister ensure that the jobs at the Baltimore Boatyard are protected? Would the Minister request BIM to introduce a comprehensive scheme to recover the boatyard and secure its jobs?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry the reason a Galway-based trawler was not hired by his Department to facilitate the taking of a herring survey off the Galway coast recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The survey referred to is part of a series of scientific investigations of herring stocks off the west and northwest coasts.  Tenders for boat hire in connection therewith were received from six trawler owners of whom four were based in County Galway.  The successful tender which was submitted by a skipper from another county was considered the most suitable not only from the point of view of price but also having regard to such relevant factors as the size and horsepower of the vessel, its suitability, efficiency and experience for the survey work in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>When surveys of this kind are being undertaken in the future, would the Minister invite tenders from the trawler owners in the area where such survey is to be carried out?  I am sure the Minister will agree that it is galling for fishermen in Galway to see fishing trawlers coming in from other areas to carry out surveys in their traditional, local fishing grounds, and it has caused quite an amount of resentment among them.  Would the Minister state if the invitation to tender was open to all trawler owners around the country?  Furthermore, will he state what were the tenders submitted to his Department and what was the difference between the best tender from a Galway trawler owner and whatever trawler owner was actually granted the contract?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1640" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would accept the Deputy's view in relation to the galling experience of skippers if that were a fact but I think he is under some misapprehension because the survey area goes far beyond the boundaries of the Galway coast.  It takes in from the Shannon Estuary to Greencastle, the whole of the north west area, which covers the Clare coast, Galway coast, Mayo, Sligo and Donegal, so the area is fairly broad.</P>
      <P>In relation to the factors to be considered in the acceptance of a tender, for example, they include living accommodation on board, the size of boat, that is that it is sufficiently big for the job, the existence of a shelter deck on board, the calibre and capability of personnel on board, including the skipper.  All of these matters are taken into consideration.  The successful skipper in this case was engaged because it was felt he met the requirements I have broadly outlined and the factors necessary for the carrying out of the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that none of the four County Galway trawler owners who submitted tenders complied with any of the criteria the Minister has set out?  Is the Minister saying that the successful tender was the cheapest?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the kernel of the whole matter.  Is the Minister aware of the anger felt by Galway fishermen at the decision taken by his Department in this matter in that they feel that, in these surveys, they are being continually overlooked, that there is no occasion when the Galway trawlers are utilised for this work?  If there is some work of that nature to be done in the future, in an area in <Col N="1641" /> which the Galway trawlers traditionally fish &mdash; that would be from the Shannon Estuary up to the Mayo coast &mdash; would the Minister agree that it should be Galway trawlers that are used?  If the tender awarded was not awarded to the person who submitted the cheapest tender why then did the Minister and the Department decide not to award it to the cheapest?  Can he justify that decision to the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I can, on the basis of the factors I have just mentioned.  In fact the tender accepted was in relation to a larger boat with facilities which were felt to be necessary by the people dealing with this tender.  The Minister did not deal with the tender; I can assure the Deputy of that.  All of these requirements and factors &mdash; size of boat, shelter on deck and so on &mdash; were taken into consideration in recommending the appointment of the person who was appointed.  By the way experience enters in also, because I understand that the successful applicant had previously done this work satisfactorily on behalf of the Department.  That does not imply that in future other people who have not done such work will be excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The opinion is abroad in Galway that one must be a pal of Joey Murrin to get any of these survey tenders accepted.  Is it not time that the Minister took some action to dispel the notion in the fishermen's minds that there is political work going on in the allocation of these tenders especially when we hear now that the person whose tender was accepted on this occasion had not submitted the cheapest and most advantageous one from the point of view of the Department?</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister about subsection (4).  He has given an explanation in regard to subsection (3) on a number of occasions.  Subsection (4) is very important and we should have some idea of what the Minister intends. Subsection (4) states:</P>
      <P>The Minister may, whenever and so often as he thinks fit, declare that any power conferred on the Board by this section shall be exercisable only with the consent of the Minister and whenever any such declaration is in force, the said power may be exercisable only with such consent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may, whenever and so often as he thinks fit, declare that any power conferred on the Council by this section shall be exercisable only with <Col N="1668" /> the consent of the Minister and whenever any such declaration is in force, the said power may be exercisable only with such consent.</P>

      <P>After this morning's debate I thought we would get away from saying that because a provision appeared in previous legislation it was therefore all right.  We are trying to bring in a Nurses Bill that will do justice to the general public and the nurses and will be a credit to the legislators.  I have read the Medical Practitioners Bill and I appreciate that it contains that subsection. I have stated a number of times that there is an inordinate amount of ministerial control throughout the Bill which does not appear in the Medical Practitioners Act.  If the Minister of State looks at section 16 (1) of that Act he will see that the Medical Council have the power to appoint a registrar and do not need the consent of the Minister.  Under section 16 of this Bill the Nursing Board must have the consent of the Minister. That is an example of a change from the time when the leader of our party was Minister.  I understand that the Minister's name appears 46 times in this Bill with special powers for himself.  There is nothing like that in the Medical Practitioners Act.  I am asking what the subsection means in terms of ministerial power.</P>

    <P>Effectively, this appears to indicate that the Minister has total control over the personnel the board appoint.  That is extraordinary for a board that will not be funded by the Exchequer but by nurses. The nurses will elect 17 members to the board, a majority, and the Minister will appoint a further 12 members.  The 29 members of the board will be subject to the control of the Minister as to the people they employ and the conditions of service for employees.  I do not understand the need for that subsection.  We have spent a long time debating the composition of the board and, hopefully, as a result when the Bill is passed we will have good legislation but if we do not have confidence in the board to do their job effectively we should not be debating this legislation.  In view of the fact that the board will not be funded by the Exchequer it should be given the authority to employ people and lay down their conditions of service as they see fit.</P>

      <P>I have re-examined the contents of the section, particularly subsections (4) and (5).  I sought to provide in the section a clear distinction between the overall administrative personnel function of the board and the purely executive function of the chief executive officer in the manner of recruiting staff and determining their terms, conditions and duties.  To this end I am following a <Col N="1670" /> precedent set by the Health Act, 1970, which contains similar provisions in relation to functions of health boards' chief executive officers.  Further I am seeking to tie up all loose ends.  I may be duplicating the provisions for ministerial powers in subsections (4) and (5) and it is proposed to delete subsection (5).</P>

      <P>The amendments were intended to meet the needs to protect the employment of an officer or servant of the board who is nominated as a candidate for election to Seanad Éireann as opposed to a Taoiseach's nominee.  The amendment sought to provide that such a person would not be seconded from employment with the board until he is actually elected and then only from the date of his election.  Senators have often pointed out the anomaly that a person can be nominated for election to the Seanad without his prior consent and cannot then withdraw his candidacy.  I understand <Col N="1672" /> that the Minister for the Environment is examining this matter with a view to making the necessary amendments to the Seanad electoral legislation.  Clearly a global amendment to Seanad electoral legislation would be a more efficient means of achieving this protection of employment of staff of statutory bodies.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 14, line 8, to delete &ldquo;giving&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;re-issuing&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment refers specifically to the giving of a certificate.  The question is to whom will these certificates of registration be given because I understand that a person will first apply to the registrar to have his or her name placed on the register and will be obliged to pay a fee.  Presumably, the cost of an annual, two or three year certificate will be included in the cost.  Therefore, I cannot understand why there is a subsection to provide for a fee for the giving of a certificate of registration.  In other words, they will be charged twice, when they apply to have their name placed on the register and when they pay the annual retention fee. I would have thought that a receipt would <Col N="1680" /> be in the nature of a medical certificate similar to other bodies but, according to this, the board may charge them for giving a certificate.  I want the word &ldquo;giving&rdquo; taken out because if somebody loses their certificate and applies to have it reissued, it is reasonable to expect them to pay a small fee for that service because there would be a certain amount of work involved but I cannot see why there would be a charge for giving a certificate of registration to a person who has already paid a fee when applying to have their name placed or retained on the register.  Under no circumstances would a certificate of registration be given to anybody other than the nurse whose name would be going on the register, so there is no question of giving a certificate to a third party.  Obviously a certificate of registration will only go to the nurse whose name is on the register.  That is why I put down this amendment and perhaps the Minister has some explanation as to why it is worded in this way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to make a point later on but it arises now because Deputy O'Hanlon has mentioned the question of what he calls an annual retention process of the names of nurses on the register.  Is it intended that the register should be updated annually?  There is general agreement in the nursing profession, so far as the advice I have from it goes, that there should be a live register and that there should not be people on it who are no longer bona fide practising the profession.  The question of whether the retention of people on the register should be determined annually does not seem to arise on this section.  The section does not say at what intervals the register is to be updated.  The advice I have been given from the nursing profession is that, while there is agreement with the principle of keeping the register a live register, perhaps one year is too short an interval at which to update it.  This is because nurses, particularly in the early years of their service, are often out of the country for periods longer than a year.  Depending on where they were situated that would not altogether exclude their applying <Col N="1681" /> even from a foreign address for retention of their registration but it might impede it if they were in a distant part of the world.  I should like the Minister to indicate the attitude of the Department with regard to this.  The matter arises here only because Deputy O'Hanlon seems to take it for granted that the register should be updated annually&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I hope the Minister will take into consideration the views of all the people who have made representations that there should not be a registration fee every year. There are no such fees in many other areas in the public service.  It should be a once-off payment.  The updating of the register of all the nurses should not have to take place each year.  There should be only the addition of the new members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment of Deputy O'Hanlon: It appears to us that nurses in addition to paying a registration fee will be subject also to a certification fee.  When a student pays a fee for the leaving certificate examination he or she gets the certificate without any further payment.  The point put forward by Deputy O'Hanlon is quite clear.  He wished to find out if in addition to payment of the registration fee a nurse will also have to pay a certification fee.  If that is the case we will be opposing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to clarify one aspect that is likely to be misinterpreted. I refer to paragraphs (a) and (d) of subsection 25.  The board is empowered to charge fees for registration of the person on the register and the giving to <Col N="1682" /> the person of a certificate of registration and this is a matter for the board.  For registration of a newly qualified nurse there is only one fee which is £40 at present.  This covers the nurse's registration and the supplying of a certificate of registration.  This is how the present board work and there is no reason why there should be any change under the new board.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's amendment, I must assume he envisages a double fee, a fee for actual registration and a fee for the supply of a certificate. If I may speculate about the Deputy's wishes, I do not think he is in favour of having two fees paid by a newly qualified nurse.  He wishes to ensure that the fee in respect of paragraph (d) shall apply only to the re-issuing of a certificate. However, I must point out that the certificate of registration at paragraph (d) covers not only the re-issuing of an original certificate but also a certificate for a second or subsequent division of the register.  As the Deputy is aware, a nurse who is registered in one division of the register may, through further study, acquire further qualifications that may be registered.  I cannot accept this amendment which does not provide for the full implications of the section as drafted.</P>
      <P>In relation to the point made by Deputy Kelly regarding the updating of the register on an annual basis, there is no guarantee but in all probability it will be updated on an annual basis.  However, it is a matter for the board.  The receipt of payment will act as proof of registration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State be willing to suggest to the new board that if they opt for an annual updating of the register they will make some special provision to facilitate nurses who are abroad, perhaps in some place that is difficult of access, so that a nurse who may have difficulties regarding communications will not find herself deregistered without her knowledge?  I will not press the Minister to give details of what solution he might find but I think the matter should be brought to the attention of the board.  I hope the Department will take <Col N="1683" /> on board what I am saying which I think is the view of the nursing profession in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to the Minister's reply.  He agrees entirely with us that a newly qualified nurse should not have to pay a second fee for certification or the retention of a nurse on the register.  My concern is that there is nothing in this section that makes clear what the Minister has just said to us that a nurse will not have to pay a fee for a certificate having already paid for registration or for retention on the register.  I am sure if the Minister were in charge of the board he would ensure this would not happen, but it will be the board who will decide on the fees and the persons who will be obliged to pay.  I ask the Minister to look at the section.  Perhaps if he were to insert a provision regarding the registration of a person in the register and the giving of a registration certificate that would suffice to ensure that the giving of a certificate was included in the two paragraphs.  In this way a newly qualified nurse who applied to have her name on the register would not have to pay another fee for a certificate.  I am not so sure that it would be justifiable to charge a fee for a certificate on some sub-group of nurses.  It is possible in those circumstances that a sub-register might be set up with a charge for placing names on that register.</P>

      <P>I am not so sure that nurses will not end up paying two or three different fees.  With regard to Deputy Kelly's point concerning the updating of the register every year, I am not sure of the Minister's intention in that regard. Does he intend to have an annual retention fee?  If that is the case we will be opposed to it.  I will give a small example of how costs can spiral out of all proportion. When I qualified in medicine I paid a subscription of £15 but last month I wrote a cheque for £324.  That is an indication of how costs can spiral.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>We all agree that there is necessity for a register which it is hoped will be effective in getting employment for nurses.  If it is a register which is kept up to date there will be no need to find out who on the register is available for work.  How often one would have to update it and pay a registration fee plays a part here.  This raises certain problems, particularly to do with the careers of women.  It is hoped that there would be a 50-50 registration of male and female nurses in the future who would be sharing responsibility in their homes and that there would not be the same demands on women as there are now.</P>
      <P>I take the example of a qualified nurse who for reasons of child rearing and domestic responsibilities might wish to remain on the register but might not be able to continue to pay a high annual or regular fee.  Could that type of circumstance be taken into consideration by the Minister and perhaps a nominal or sliding or holding fee obtain?  The fee might fit the circumstances of a woman taking five or ten years off nursing and then wishing to return and not lose her place on the register. I hope in the future that we would be talking as seriously about male nurses and their domestic responsibilities and their taking time off also.  However, at the moment the female nurses are my first consideration.</P>
      <P>For information, regarding certification, in the case of a nurse on the register getting extra qualifications is it only in those cases where that extra qualification or expertise is granted and the nurse wishes that information be registered that the extra fee takes place?  Economically, it might then make sense.</P>

Amendment No. 2 is not acceptable, for the fairly obvious reason that an interpretation of it would be that if the board decided to increase the registration fee in any year they would be obliged, it seems to me, mandatorily to increase the registration fee by an amount equivalent to the increase in nurses' salaries for that year.  I know that that is not the intention, but that is one reading or interpretation of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express basic concern about the effect of this section. It introduces a State control with regard to the right of people to work.  For the first time people who are privately employed in the area of health care would be obliged to pay a fee for the right or privilege to take up work or to continue to work.  It would be a fee dictated by the Minister of the day &mdash; by the board initially but, as we know from other sections, if the board do not satisfy the requirements of the Minister, the Minister may intervene.  Indeed, in any matter in this Bill the Minister has the last say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Allowing for the fact that there is possibly a benevolent attitude prevailing on the part of the current Minister, and indeed the current Opposition if they were in power, the reality is that we are entrusting to a Government, in effect, the right of disbarring people from work. That is something we should not rush into very easily.  I am not convinced that there should be a need at all for an on-going fee.  I understand that on a cost-effective <Col N="1686" /> basis arguably there may be need for the cost of the board to be recouped, the cost of initial registration.  Of course, if the State managed their affairs effectively that cost would be very little.  What it boils down to, I assume, is the issuing of some type of form, its completion and return to the board and an assessment of that form by some competent representative of the board to make sure that it is in order and its being incorporated into a ledger or whatever.</P>
    <P>In fact, the section and amendment 15 are about something which goes far beyond that.  They talk about re-issuing it.  Is there a need to pay a fee to have a name of a person retained on a register? What is the cost associated with that?  I accept that some official has to open the book once a year to find out if the name is there and so on, but the onus should be on the State before they introduce what is potentially a very serious managerial control to prove that it is necessary. The effect of it would be that thousands of people at present working in the nursing profession will now for the first time ever pay to have access to that right to work.  It is no less than that that we are talking about.</P>
    <P>It is all very fine to say that it is a matter of tidying up the books and keeping things in order, but interpreted in a malign or vindictive way &mdash; and it is quite possible that that could happen in the order of things &mdash; then a woman who might have very strong personal views as to how things should be run in a hospital might find herself discouraged in a variety of ways from practising her profession.  I could also see a woman not being able to afford a fee and I wonder what the attitude of the board would be then.  I should like to think that they would take a sympathetic attitude.  It would be very sad if there were even one case where a nurse could not afford the fee of the day.  It sounds like a small amount now, but the section clearly allows the fee to rise and the amendment to which we will be coming later on would also facilitate a regular increase.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the need for this registration process.  It essentially means <Col N="1687" /> that nurses would have to register annually and pay for the right to work and, if they do not, they simply will not be able to work.  That is very serious.  I accept that I did not have the benefit of hearing the Minister's comments on this earlier on and perhaps he may have answered some of these queries.  However, I do not know why we should have to go that far.</P>
    <P>The controls essential in an area like this should be the minimal necessary to do whatever the objective of this Bill is, which I presume is to bring improved standards of excellence, if that be possible, and standards of order into this area.  It should not go beyond that and this Bill goes far beyond that.  Grave difficulties could be caused to persons who are practising nursing to a very high standard of excellence right now, who would be suddenly encumbered by a whole barrage of regulations and controls, particularly payment of a fee on an annual basis &mdash; an unspecified fee to work.  I want to put that on the record.  I am deeply unhappy about that basic innovation. Would the Minister be good enough to comment on the necessity for payment of a fee at all, particularly for retaining a name on a register and the issuing of a licence?</P>

      <P>When we consider that we are talking about a 29-member board made up of people working in the profession naturally they will take all these points into consideration.  We are setting up a system whereby the profession will be allowed to operate the board subject to certain controls by the Minister.  It is up to them to operate it in whatever way they see fit but if they do not operate it as the Minister thinks it should be operated he will be able to step in and say something about it from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The registration fee will include the issue of a certificate.  It is a matter for the <Col N="1688" /> board to decide if they want to charge a retention fee or an annual fee for registration. I am sure that in doing so they will take into consideration people who are unemployed.  If there is a charge for registration it helps to ensure that there is a correct register.  If there was no charge it is possible that after the initial registration the register could go out of date.  Someone mentioned the cost of registering an extra qualification.  They asked if it was in addition to the registration fee.  The practice has been that there is an additional registration fee for an additional qualification.  We are setting up the board and it is up to the profession to run the board as they see fit.</P>

      <P>I come back to amendment No. 15.  I do not want to become involved in the debate on the section generally.  My concern is that a person who has already paid a fee to register on the nurses register and have their name retained on it should not be obliged to pay another fee for a certificate.  I want to ensure that if a person pays for registration or retention on the register they will not have to pay another fee for a certificate. The certificate should be part of the original fee.  I should like to see that written into the section.  There are eight subsections already and it should be possible to insert that into one of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment on the re-issuing of a certificate to any person under (d) would fit the bill.  I understand what the Minister said that the board might set up sub-registers and that they might give a certificate if a person was a member of, for example, a midwife sub-register.  I would be totally opposed to charging someone who had already paid their annual retention fee another fee for a certificate if they registered for a particular group: for example, if a midwife registered on a midwife sub-register or a psychiatric nurse registered on a psychiatric sub-register. Not alone would they have to pay a retention fee but we are now being told they will have to pay another fee to have their name placed on a sub-register. No matter whether it is a main register or a sub-register, the one registration fee <Col N="1689" /> should cover certification.  The only charge for giving a person a certificate would be in the case of re-issuing a certificate to someone who lost it and wanted a second one.  Otherwise it should be included as part of the registration fee.</P>

      <P>I take the point made by the Minister of State that fees will be determined by the board.  As of now the majority of this profession are women and traditionally women have a more broken career than men.  Would it be possible for us, before the Bill goes through the House, to have written in as part of the section the fact that the board would take that into consideration and also take into consideration nurses who leave the profession for domestic or other reasons and who may wish to remain on the register?  Perhaps they might have a sliding fee or nominal fee which would enable them to remain on the register.</P>

      <P>Therefore the words &ldquo;the giving to any person&rdquo; must be interpreted as being the issuing of the certificate. Presumably that is what the Minister is <Col N="1691" /> trying to achieve.  If that is the case, the word &ldquo;giving&rdquo; is too loose.  Under this section as proposed the amendment obviously is trying to ensure that the person who is paying the registration fee is not asked two months later for a fee for the giving of the certificate.  It is simply a question of what I might call English usage, unless the intention is to charge two fees.  I do not think that is so, unless I am misinterpretating what Deputy O'Hanlon is saying.  The wording should be considered again, otherwise, depending upon what the board and the Minister would say, it can be argued that the person would pay a fee on registration and then pay a fee three months later when the certificate was being issued.  I presume that is not the intention of the Bill.</P>

The only one I would like to add is that which Deputy O'Hanlon made initially and which we are forgetting about at this stage.  I presume it is not the intention in paragraph (d) &mdash;&ldquo;the giving to any person&rdquo;&mdash; that I could go and get a certificate of registration for you as a nurse.

It is another form of taxation added to the excessive taxation imposed on every member of the community, particularly nurses who pay all the levies, PRSI and PAYE, and who as a group are also paying into their union fund.  This is another form of taxation which the Minister is bringing about through this Bill.  I support our spokesperson in opposing this type of imposition.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister missed the first part of the debate, but there is nothing sinister in the proposal in the amendment.  It is merely to ensure that the board will not have a whole range of fees for any nurse who registers for either annual retention or for the first time, that there will be one comprehensive fee which will include the giving of a certificate.  If there is a sub-register for the various specialities within nursing, that will be included in the one fee and the nurse will not pay her annual retention fee or her fee to register and then find that she will have to pay another fee for the issue of a certificate later.  Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn made the point, and I agree, that a certificate can be issued only <Col N="1693" /> to the person whose name is placed in the register.  It cannot be issued to a third party.  That is not clear from paragraph (d).  Naturally, a certificate can be given only to the person whose name is in the register; therefore that person would have to pay the fee.  I am suggesting in the amendment that for the re-issuing of a certificate it would be in order for the board to charge a small fee.  If somebody receives a certificate, loses it and wants another, then I would deem it appropriate that that person pays a small fee.</P>

      <P>I have the floor but we must appreciate that the floor belongs in many respects to the board.  In the legislation we are trying to devolve responsibility as broadly as possible on An Bord Altranais and to determine charges from time to time.  Deputies come into the House and demand virtually that two-thirds of the representation of the board should be for the nursing profession and they are absolutely preoccupied with the role of the nurses on the board.  This enabling provision is to enable self-regulation by the profession, by nurses, for themselves in terms of running their own board.  The admittedly comprehensive series of measures was drawn up to ensure that An Bord Altranais would not be inhibited in any way, by virtue of their own internal decisions, in deciding how they should raise revenue and charge members of the profession for the work they perform on behalf of the profession, and in not being a grant-aided body dependent solely on their day to day income from this measure and from whatever other assets they may have.  I was extremely anxious not to spancel the board in any way in that regard.  I tell Deputy O'Hanlon that I am <Col N="1694" /> easy about the question of giving or re-issuing. My initial reaction in not favouring the amendment was largely that I wanted to tease out the arguments here as to why it should be within another framework.  I will look at that between now and Report Stage, and also at the point made appropriately enough by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn.  There is a difficulty.  If we are to put every contingency into this Bill in relation to the activities of An Bord Altranais we would finish up with a Bill of a couple of hundred sections.  It can do no more than lay down the general principles.</P>
      <P>I find it repugnant to accept Deputy Leyden's arguments that this is another form of taxation on nurses.  It is not.  If you want An Bord Altranais to discharge the professional functions they should discharge, and in the future will discharge as far as I am concerned, then they must have cash resources.  They must be able to employ staff.  They must be able to employ a comprehensive professional staff and, above all else, they must have a live register.  I speak as a member of a trade union and of some professional bodies.  As a member of, for example, The Institute of Industrial Engineers I pay an annual fee to my institute for keeping myself on a live register in order to perform whatever I might perform if I am kicked out of this House&mdash;and that would be a difficult performance.</P>

I would not wish to hold up the Bill but we are anxious to ensure that nurses will not be confronted with the payment of two or three fees for various essential services either at the time of their first registration or subsequently in respect of retention on the register.

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 14, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Any fee which may be charged by the Board pursuant to paragraph (b) shall increase by a percentage of not more than the percentage increase in nurses' salaries during the preceding year.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>None of us is anxious that a fee be imposed on any person in respect of enabling him to work, especially on persons who may have registered some years ago and who were of the opinion that that was the last time they would be asked to pay a fee for registration.  However, if the fee is to be introduced there must be some control in regard to its being increased, whether the increases occur annually, at three-year intervals or at five-year intervals. The amendment would have the effect of keeping some control on the level of the increase in the fee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In respect of the medical profession the fee was introduced in 1981 at £15. Now it is £38.  That was a very rapid escalation.  We would not wish that sort of development to follow in the case of nurses.  The amendment would go a long way to assuaging the fears of nurses that if even a modest retention fee is accepted, it may escalate in the second year to <Col N="1696" /> perhaps 10, 20 or 100 per cent greater. We should introduce some system whereby the level of increase would be controlled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Acceptance of the amendment is the least we could expect of the Minister in this matter.  Those nurses who are already registered have been of the opinion that they were registered for life.  The Minister reminds us that we are not talking of life membership of the GAA.  Up to now nurses registered on the completion of their training and no further fee was involved in that respect. Therefore, it is understandable that they are perturbed that in this Bill the Minister is providing that they must register each year.  The Minister has expressed the hope that the provision would not be regarded as a tax-gathering device but that is how it is being regarded by a considerable number of the nurses concerned. They would like to know what advantages will accrue to them on foot of this annual registration fee.  When a nurse completes her training she is deemed to be qualified and that remains the position regardless of whether she pays a fee.  If this Bill goes through in its present form many nurses will regard the fee as something they must pay in order to be permitted to work.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the register but I do not know what value the register is so far as individual nurses are concerned. It is useful to the Department and perhaps because of that they might consider paying for its compilation.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise also a couple of practical points.  What is to be the position of those nurses who are working on a temporary basis and in some cases, for only a couple of weeks in the year?  Also, a very considerable number of qualified nurses are unemployed.  Are all of these to pay the full registration fee?  In many cases the nurses concerned would be on the lowest point of the scale.  In these circumstances I have considerable reservations about the imposition of a fee.  At the very least, the Minister should accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I, too, support the amendment.  We should not leave the question of the fee open-ended because to do so would result in the fee increasing by leaps and bounds each year.  Deputy Faulkner raised the valid point about the large numbers of nurses who are out of work and also those who work on a temporary basis, perhaps only for a month each year.  It would be very unfair to nurses in that situation if they were expected to pay a fee that increases annually.</P>

Already the doctors are complaining about the escalation in their fees in that regard.  We do not hear of large numbers of doctors being unemployed but there are 2,000 nurses unemployed.  In those circumstances nurses should be given some measure of assurance that the fee will not escalate to such an extent that they would be precluded from participating. I support the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Few would quibble with the spirit of what the amendment seeks to achieve but there are practical problems. First, the purpose of the fee clearly is to offset the cost of the administration of the register.  It is regrettable but inevitable that there has to be any charge but the fee will not relate automatically to increases in nurses' salaries throughout the year.  Over a ten-year period there could be either an inadequate or an excessive increase in registration fees.  It may not be the right approach to put down a guideline for the Nursing Board.  There is no point in having a dog and barking yourself.  If the board is to have any function it would have to be responsive to the Minister particularly when the Minister may overrule the board in many respects to take cognisance of real income increases in the nursing profession.  I agree with Members who have expressed disquiet about the analogies in other professional areas where the inevitable growth of empires which occurs on these <Col N="1698" /> boards means that the costs increase proportionately at a greater rate than one might reasonably expect.  I am also concerned that the amendment as proposed might put an automatic obligation on the board to increase the registration fee.  A court might interpret that section which says:</P>
      <P>Any fee which may be charged by the Board pursuant to paragraph (b) shall increase by a percentage of not more than the percentage increase</P>
      <P>as being an implicit order to increase the fees in line with inflation and I have no doubt that that is not what is intended here.  Most of us would like any increases being pegged in some realistic ratio to the increase in the salaries of nurses.  I am not convinced that this formula is the proper one.  Also, there would not be automatic agreement about the percentage increases in nurses' salaries during the preceding year.  There are many categories of nurses and many categories of increases.</P>
      <P>I recall Members on the other side of the House arguing vehemently for index linking of fines in the criminal justice area and that sort of reply was advanced, that there are always conflicts about the economic indicators.  If a general directive is given to the board which takes into account the perceived percentage increase in nurses' salaries and if the Minister watches that carefully and takes action when appropriate that might meet the need rather than the insertion of an amendment which might not meet what it is designed to do and which might be interpreted in a malevolent way to do something else.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Keating. I would be worried in case the insertion of this amendment would hint to the board that they should increase the fees annually.  We cannot dictate to the board but we should try to get across to them that they should find a way to register nurses who wish to work and find a way of ensuring that people who are not working <Col N="1699" /> when they register but wish to keep themselves available for work do not have to keep paying for registration.  This amendment if put in would encourage the board to increase the fees annually.  Deputy O'Hanlon may be able to get rid of my fears about this but what he should say to the board is that they should find a way to have a register with a sliding scale for people who are not actually working but who wish to retain their names on the register.  I can see great justification in the complaints of nurses that people who are not working will have to continue to pay the registration fee each year.  I cannot suggest a way to ensure that the board do not keep increasing the fees but this amendment will not do what Deputy O'Hanlon would like it to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like many speakers am apprehensive about the open-ended situation of a retention fee.  Nobody would deny that there should be a retention fee.  If we want to make the board masters of their own destiny we must put them in a situation to finance themselves. What I am afraid of and what most speakers are afraid of is that this thing will take off.  Deputy Alice Glenn made a reference earlier to the Medical Council, about which I know something as I have to pay the fee.  In 1981 the retention fee on the Medical Council was £15 and in 1984 it is £38.  If there is not some control on the annual retention fee it can shoot up out of all proportion.  When I qualified, I paid a fee of £15 per year and I wrote a cheque for £342 last month in relation to that fee.</P>
      <P>I would urge the Minister to take our views into consideration and to consider Deputy O'Hanlon's amendment or some recommendation to hold the fees at a reasonable level.  Perhaps the fee should apply for the duration of the board to be increased by a percentage thereafter in relation to the percentage increase of nurses' salaries.  There should be some provision to prevent the spiralling that will otherwise take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to what Deputy Faulkner said about those in temporary and part time employment, we must make some provision for them and for the people who are unemployed.  Unfortunately due to the lack of funding from the Department of Health to the various hospitals and the major shortfalls we will see in 1985, there will be major cutbacks in employment.  We must take the unemployed nurses into account.  They should not be expected to pay a retention fee similar to that paid by working nurses. Might I make one last plea to the Minister as somebody who suffered in relation to the retention fee to be paid to the Medical Council.  I would urge that plenty of notice be given to those on the register. As in the case of the Medical Council, non-payment of the registration fee to An Bord Altranais means that one will find oneself omitted from the register. Unfortunately I discovered that the hard <Col N="1701" /> way last year when I omitted to pay my fee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to describe the kinds of expectations we have of An Bord Altranais.  In some respects we, the legislators, suffer from a kind of Walter Mitty or perhaps a split personality complex when it comes to expectations of the board.  On the one hand we want to have a board performing the job we all want to see undertaken&mdash; and we all have a very good idea of what we want them to do &mdash; while, on the other hand, we are not going to trust them to do the job.  In terms of the retention fee, what it boils down to is: do we trust An Bord Altranais to establish reasonable fees for the variety of purposes for which they determine professional standards?  Do we or do we not? We have got to make up our minds.  That is the basic issue.  I shall have every confidence in An Bord Altranais, in their composition, to act in a reasonable manner.  We have taken legislative powers to so ensure.  In respect of the initial fee, as is stated here, the consent of the Minister for Health of the day is required.</P>

      <P>It is a basic safeguard which is there and which I am sure Deputies would not want to hand over; in other words, for the initial registration fee the consent of the Minister will be required. Bearing in mind the exotic sensitivities of people about paying money in this country for professional purposes, I am sure the Minister for Health of the day will act with great sensitivity and compassion in that regard in terms of whatever proposals are put before him, even in respect of Medical Council fees of £320 per annum.  For God's sake, a good radiologist would earn that amount for one hour's work.</P>

      <P>Let us be quite clear about it.  When it comes to the nursing profession, needless to remark they are paid as much as radiologists.  At present, for example, they must pay £45 in order to take the preliminary State examination, £55 for the final State examination; the registration fee, following their final examination, including their certificate amounts to £40; registration in second and subsequent divisions of the register costs £40. Registration for persons from outside Ireland is £45.  The fee to sit for post-graduate examinations, for example midwifery or second registration for dual qualified nurses, is £55.  Registration in the student index is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>They are the current scale of fees of An Bord Altranais.  As I was saying, registration in the student index is £10 which would not break any farmer's daughter.  The registration fee of verification for Irish nurses going abroad amounts to £30.  It should be remembered that one must pay £5 to leave Ireland at Dublin Airport.  Registration following removal from the register has not arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might also point out here that when An Bord Altranais submits applications for increases in their fees to the Minister for Health of the day; the Minister, in accordance with the prices legislation, must go to the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and to the National Prices Commission seeking their approval for such increase.  This country being the incestuous administrative bureaucracy it is, nobody does anything without half a dozen other people formally agreeing to it.  Therefore, I will have to go to my colleague, the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and to the National Prices Commission to seek approval for any such increase in fee by An Bord Altranais, by which time An Bord Altranais have gone bankrupt because it will take about three months to effect all of that.  It is necessary. That is the procedure.  There is nothing particularly obsessional about it. <Col N="1703" /> When it comes to An Bord Altranais, of course, they will have to take cognisance of the fact that a nurse may be unemployed and, as an unemployed nurse &mdash; and there are not 2,000 of them around because, if one puts an advertisement in the newspapers, one finds to the contrary. I was talking to the matron of a Dublin hospital the other day who had a vacancy for a theatre sister.  She had 100 applicants, 94 of whom were working in other hospitals.  This hysteria about 2,500 nurses being unemployed and so on is totally exaggerated.  Incidentally not a shred of a nurse has lost a job since I assumed office in the past two years.  I should like the Deputy opposite, the Southern Health Board and everybody else, to give me the names of the first ten nurses who lost their jobs in Ireland when, frankly &mdash; although within the privilege of this House &mdash; I would be tempted to pay them £10&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is the Minister honestly suggesting that there are no unemployed nurses at present?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will revert to the issue.  We should stop nurse shroud waving.  Certainly I would hope there would be a differentiation in fee payment for unemployed nurses as there should be for part-time nurses, nurses abroad and those who have retired who want to retain their status.  I would even encourage such differentiation to be operative in the case of nurses on a career break and I know of nurses at present on a career break.  I would contend that they should pay a lesser fee and that could be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, it is not a question of empire building in An Bord Altranais. At present An Bord Altranais is in a situation of being an emperor without financial clothes, collecting these fairly modest fees.  It should be remembered that there are young nurses who would go on a Continental holiday, spending £300, at the end of a year's work and it would not cost them an awful lot of thought.  Yet there are people screaming <Col N="1704" /> at me because they are asked to pay £20 to become a registered, professional nurse.  It is a load of special pleading.  I shall be keeping a very close watch, on behalf of the profession and of the Department, on An Bord Altranais who will look for the money.  If they want to put up exorbitant propositions to the Department they will have to justify them line by line.</P>
    <P>I might even contend that I could not accept at all the suggestion made by Deputy O'Hanlon that the fees should be related to the nurses' salaries.  Why nurses salaries?  Why not the consumer price index?  Why not something else? The reason for any prospective increase in fees is that the board will need the money, justifying to themselves the need for such money.  It should be remembered also that there will be on that board 90 nurses from all over the country, all fairly tough individuals in their own right.  To get elected to An Bord Altranais one needs to be tough and remain tough to convince sufficient people to vote for one. One would need to be a fairly articulate, competent person to get elected in the first place; I have no doubt about that. Such members will not willingly face reelection five years later, having crucified the profession by massive increases in fees over the years, and have themselves put before the annual conference of the Irish Nurses Organisation.  I have come before the Irish Nurses Conference, admittedly on a social occasion, and it is a fearful experience.  But to be a delegate attending that conference endeavouring to justify massive increases in fees to one's peers would mean that one would get fairly short shrift.  Therefore, An Bord Altranais must approach us, producing their financial projections for two to three years ahead.  They have an excellent chief executive officer at present.  He is not likely to go around stealing cheque books belonging to nurses or endeavouring to put student nurses into personal impoverishment, facing their mothers and fathers, while they endeavour to scrounge together enough money to pay their fees.  That is not the intention.  We should calm down and appreciate that we <Col N="1705" /> should not relate fees to nurses' salaries. I would be very much opposed to that proposition because, in any one year, they might not want to increase the fee at all; in fact they might even reduce the fee.  It is not unknown for fees to be reduced in some instances, and increased in others.</P>

      <P>Therefore I am glad Deputy O'Hanlon tabled his amendment but there is no great need for it.  Its outstanding merit is that it has given us an opportunity of discussing the question of fees here.  The subject has become quite a vexed one.  The special pleading which has gone on on this issue is no more special than that which took place in relation to the fees of the Medical Council and other professional bodies.  I can assure Deputy O'Hanlon that I do not think we shall ever reach the stage of sanctioning fees of, say, £320 per annum. That is not the intention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Our concern is that nurses will not find themselves in a situation where their retention fee will go up by perhaps 100 per cent.  It is important that we as legislators should try to ensure some control on the fees.  The Minister said he would have to give his consent to any increase in fees, following approval by the National Prices Commission and the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  It is specified in section 24 that the Minister shall pay out funds with the approval of the Minister for Finance.  There is no such provision in section 25.  If the Minister were to write into the Bill what he has just told us it would go a long way towards alleviating the fears of the nurses and of this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the board decided they would not increase the fee there is nothing in the amendment that would oblige them to increase it.  It merely provides that the fee should not be increased by more than the percentage increase in the salaries of nurses in the previous year.  It would seem appropriate if there were to be an <Col N="1706" /> increase in fee that it should be an increase they could tolerate in keeping with the percentage increase they received in the previous year.  I take Deputy Keating's point that different grades of nurses might receive different percentage increases but that is unlikely since most increases are negotiated nationally and most nurses are employed in the public service.  There has been a tendency for similar percentage increases for nurses.  It would be reasonable to take the average percentage increase.  It is important to lay down some structure whereby nurses would not find themselves having to pay an increase of 50 per cent or 100 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>In the final analysis the imposition of fees must have the consent of the Minister.  He mentioned a number of categories such as part time workers, people taking career breaks and retired nurses and he agreed that there should be some kind of sliding scale.  Can he give an assurance that if some kind of sliding scale is not included in any proposal which comes before him he will take into consideration the sentiments of this House and ask for that kind of scale to be brought in?</P>
      <P>My fear would be that in the setting up of the board the initial thrust would be to get in as much money as possible so that the board could get off to a good start with adequate funding behind them. I do not think that is a good enough reason to start off on a wrong footing. I hope the Minister will not approve a scheme of fees which does not have special provision for people who are not working full time.  My concern would be about women working in the home who might want to stay on the register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the consent of the Minister was required. I know what he had in mind.  He would have the responsibility for controlling any increase in the fee suggested by the board.  What would the situation be if An Bord Altranais decided to charge an initial fee which the Minister did not consider to be high enough?  Would he refuse <Col N="1707" /> to give his consent unless they charged more?</P>
      <P>In relation to the point I raised about unemployed nurses or nurses who have only short periods of work, the Minister said that this would be taken into consideration in respect of the fee charged. The section states that the board may charge such fees as may, from time to time, be determined by the board, with the consent of the Minister, for the registration of a person in the register.  If a fee is fixed for the registration of a nurse, how does the Minister suggest that the board will be entitled to charge a lesser fee to somebody who is in part time employment?  It is not his interpretation or what he might desire that will come from this legislation, but rather the manner in which it will be interpreted by the courts if that is felt necessary.  There is no suggestion anywhere in section 25 that a lesser fee can be charged to nurses on temporary duty.</P>
      <P>It appears that the House is generally favourable to the spirit of Deputy O'Hanlon's amendment.  Deputy Owen and Deputy Keating said they were perturbed about the wording.  None of us is an expert parliamentary draftsman and if it was found that the drafting of the amendment was not perfect I am sure Deputy O'Hanlon would be satisfied with a guarantee from the Minister that the spirit of the amendment would be accepted and that he would come forward with a properly drafted amendment to the same effect as Deputy O'Hanlon's amendment.</P>

      <P>The House will be aware that the four associated banks announced increases in their lending and deposit rates with effect from close of business on Monday, 3 December 1984.  On the deposits side the increases were one percentage point for amounts under £25,000, 2½ percentage points for amounts from £25,000 and under £100,000 and 2½ percentage points for amounts of £100,000 and over.  Lending rates went up by 1 to 2 percentage points, depending on the category of borrower and the term of the loan.</P>
      <P>The effect of these changes is that the lending rates now being charged by the associated banks range from 14¾ per cent to 19¼ per cent.</P>

      <P>It is on the way and should be here instantly.  Since these increases in rates affect the majority of borrowers in all walks of life they have given rise inevitably to a good deal of comment. The Government, therefore, have decided it would be proper to afford the House the opportunity to consider these events.  I hope Deputies will use the occasion to discuss the matter with a due appreciation of its importance and, I emphasise as regards some aspects, its sensitivity.</P>
      <P>We have just come to the end of a long period of interest rate stability.  Associated banks interest rates were unchanged between September 1983 and this month. Some commentators have referred to the fact that Irish rates are going up when the international trend of interest rate is downwards.  What they have failed to point out however is the very significant fact that associated bank interest rates did not increase earlier this year in line with key international interest rates. Recent reductions in key foreign interest rates have left them significantly above their level during the first quarter of this year.</P>
      <P>The projections which underpin <i>Building on Reality</i> are based on the assumption that foreign interest rates, particularly US dollar rates, while remaining high in the immediate future, will fall significantly over the period to 1987.  A corresponding reduction in domestic interest rates is also assumed.  With regard to Exchequer cost, changes in key foreign interest rates have about one and three-quarter times the impact on the 1985 interest bill as a corresponding change in domestic interest rates.  Unlike foreign interest rate increases Exchequer payments to residents resulting from increases in domestic interest rates will generate an increase in tax revenue and so reduce the net cost to the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to make it clear that the Government do not approve increases in bank interest rates.  The normal protocol in these matters has been and still is that the Minister for Finance is informed of the proposed changes shortly before they are announced and of the reasons for these changes.  Therefore, there is no question of Government approval being either sought or given.  The Government do not interfere with the day to day administration of the Central Bank which is independent in the carrying out of its functions.  This independence is possessed by almost every Central Bank throughout the world and it is very desirable that this should be the case.  It is in line with this principle that the level of interest rates is a matter primarily for the Central Bank.  Section 6 of the Central Bank Act, 1942, sets out the bank's general function to safeguard the integrity of the currency and to ensure that:</P>
      <P>...in what pertains to the control of credit, the constant and predominant aim shall be the welfare of the people as a whole...</P>
      <P>From this general mandate derives the Central Bank's responsibility for the operation of monetary policy including the regulation of credit and interest rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1712" /> The increase in Dublin interbank interest rates over the last months is the immediate cause of the increase in associated bank interest rates which has just been agreed.  The Dublin interbank market is a free market and as a result interest rates move up and down in response to changes in the supply of and demand for funds.</P>
    <P>Given that we have a free interbank market it is not possible to control the interest rate structure of other financial institutions which are directly affected by developments in that market.  For example, the key one and three month inter-bank rates were in excess of 15 per cent last Thursday and therefore customers of the associated banks, who have themselves to deal in the interbank market, could in some cases borrow money for 12¾ per cent and deposit it in the interbank market at over 15 per cent.  In many cases non-associated bank customers, who account for about 45 per cent of non-Government borrowing, were already subject to the higher rates because the interest rates of the non-associated banks respond automatically to changes in interbank interest rates.  Obviously, this situation could not be allowed to continue any longer.</P>
    <P>The Government have been relatively successful in tackling the enormous balance of payments problem which faced it.  The projection for the 1984 balance of payments deficit is of the order of £700 million or just about half the 1982 figure of £1.316 billion.  Despite this relative success the fact remains that in 1984 we will spend about £700 million more abroad than we will earn.  This foreign deficit can be traced directly to a level of Government spending which is far greater than can be financed from tax revenue.  The balance has of course to be borrowed.</P>
    <P>The main influences on Irish interest rates are the trend of international interest rates and the domestic demand for credit.  Therefore, the outlook for Irish interest rates in the immediate future will depend to a considerable extent on international interest rate developments. While international interest rates have fallen somewhat recently they have <Col N="1713" /> mostly been reversing increases which took effect earlier this year and which did not occur here in Ireland.  If the international trend of interest rates continues downwards it will help create a favourable environment for domestic interest rates in the coming year.</P>
    <P>The root cause of the most recent increase in domestic interest rates is the size of the Exchequer borrowing requirement. Despite the relatively slack demand for credit from the private sector in recent years the size of the Exchequer borrowing requirement has produced a total credit demand well in excess of what could be financed from domestic resources without an increase in interest rates. The gap between available domestic resources and the demand for credit has been bridged by net official foreign borrowing, including foreign borrowing by State bodies and agencies, of over £1.5 billion in 1982, just over a billion in 1983 and, despite the efforts made by this Government to reduce reliance on foreign funds, the 1984 figure will be about £900 million.  As well as financing the Exchequer borrowing requirement these foreign funds provided the external reserves necessary to cover the large balance of payments deficits which are also directly related to the size of the Exchequer borrowing requirement.</P>
    <P>Therefore to say, as some commentators have, that the Government by increasing their borrowing on domestic markets pushed up the level of interest rates totally misrepresents the situation. The point is that the Government when they assumed office two years ago found themselves faced with a situation where the level of foreign borrowing itself was threatening to become a major problem. This situation could not be allowed to develop and so the Government have ensured that their foreign borrowing each year is limited to the amount which is prudent and manageable and which can be used for productive purposes.  The Government are in no doubt that it is not possible to eliminate our dependence on foreign borrowing and reduce our exposure to exchange rate loss overnight.  This is a medium term objective, but the <Col N="1714" /> amount of foreign borrowing in any one year must be kept at a manageable level. It is in many ways extraordinary that the Government are being urged to borrow more abroad when the Exchequer's foreign debt is in the region of £8 billion.</P>
    <P>Despite the efforts we have made to restore order to the public finances the demand for credit by the Exchequer together with the credit demands of the rest of the economy are substantially in excess of what could be financed at the interest rate levels which prevailed up to end-October last.  The exchange rate risk associated with foreign borrowing makes it vital that our reliance on that source of funds should be carefully weighed.  In fact, the progress we have been able to make so far in reducing our reliance on foreign funds has helped us to secure improved terms on our new foreign debt.</P>
    <P>A significant increase in official foreign borrowing would have been required this year if the liquidity needs of the domestic banking system were to be met without borrowing from the Central Bank or increasing interest rates over the levels which prevailed at end-October last.  Our efforts to finance the Exchequer borrowing requirement without damaging Ireland's excellent credit rating and without incurring unnecessary exchange rate risks put pressure on bank liquidity at the interest rates which prevailed up to end-October last.  However, when it comes to a choice between the level of domestic interest rates and damaging Ireland's credit rating, I would expect that most Irish people would opt for an increase in interest rates.  Damaging our credit standing abroad to secure a short-term gain could lead to even higher interest rates in the medium term and therefore prove to be a very costly error.  That would be a continuation of the kind of spendthrift policies in the years 1977 to 1981 that got us into the difficulties in which we find ourselves today.</P>

      <P>I must re-emphasise therefore that the root cause of the pressure on domestic interest rates since end-October last is the size of the Exchequer borrowing requirement and the need to minimise the risks associated with foreign borrowing. There is no question of a decision to <Col N="1716" /> have a higher level of interest rates; rather the higher interest rates are a product of very high levels of public expenditure and borrowing over a number of years and the effects these have had on the size of the Exchequer foreign debt. Despite our best efforts to balance our portfolio of foreign debt the addition to the national debt arising from exchange rate changes in 1983 was £858 million. This was equivalent to 52 per cent of total income tax receipts in 1983.  It is very clear from those figures alone that we must try to minimise the risk of further losses of this magnitude wherever we can.</P>
      <P>The Government readily appreciate that interest rate increases are unwelcome. They are well aware that increases in interest rates will add to the problems facing many firms and farmers and are also aware that house purchasers are concerned about their position.  It is also a fact however, as I stated earlier, that many borrowers whose loans are directly related to interbank interest rates were already paying the higher rates well before the associated banks increased their interest rates.  This means that the additional cost to the economy of the associated bank increases is generally less than many commentators have alleged.</P>
      <P>The Government are also aware of the extra costs which will fall on the Exchequer itself because of the impact higher interest rates have on the cost of servicing the national debt.  However much we appreciate the problems, we feel that it is necessary to face the realities of Ireland's capacity to borrow abroad and the effect of this on the market for funds in Ireland. This reality accurately mirrors the problems which flow from a high Exchequer borrowing requirement coupled with a need to preserve Ireland's excellent credit standing abroad and to minimise the risk of exchange rate loss by keeping Exchequer foreign borrowing to a prudent level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Movements in interbank interest rates, particularly since end-October last, justified the increase of between one and two percentage points in associated bank lending rates announced with effect from the close of business last Monday, 3 <Col N="1717" /> December 1984.  The shortage of bank liquidity which developed in the period up to end-October is reflected in the Central Bank's statistical bulletin of 7 November 1984.  This shows that borrowing by licensed banks from the Central Bank at 17 October last stood at £348 million, £278 million up on the corresponding end-1983 figure of £70 million.  I understand that the Central Bank were called upon to supply significantly more funds to the licensed banks before this borrowing peaked early in November.</P>
    <P>Domestic bank interest rates charged to borrowers, while high in nominal terms, are not high when the level of domestic inflation is taken into account. Before the recent increase in associated bank interest rates the prime lending rate of the associated banks after taking account of inflation was the third lowest in the EC and well below the corresponding US rate.  The most recent increases have brought our prime rate into line with rates in other EC countries.  Many of these countries, however, are much better positioned than we are, particularly in that their Exchequer borrowing requirement and balance of payments deficits are, in relative terms, only a small fraction of ours.</P>
    <P>The associated bank interest rate increases which have been agreed between the Central Bank and representatives of the Irish Banks Standing Committee are as low as it was possible to make them in the circumstances.  The overdraft rates had to be increased by two percentage points but the interest rate increase for other maturities were kept to between one and one and a half percentage points.  The increases in associated bank deposit rates for deposits of up to £25,000 were kept to one percentage point in order to minimise the impact of these increases on building society mortgage rates.</P>
    <P>The existence of a competitive market for funds ensures that the interest rates offered and charged by all financial institutions, including building societies, are related.  Building societies fulfil key social and economic functions by providing the <Col N="1718" /> funds for house purchase and it is important that they should maintain their ability to service the demand from prospective house purchasers.</P>
    <P>The other side of the coin, as it were, is the impact an increase in mortgage rates could have on hard-pressed home owners and on the building industry.  The Minister for the Environment, is very conscious of these effects and he has already expressed his deep concern to the major building societies.  They will be taking the Minister's points into consideration and I am sure that, in the interests of the community and in their own interest, they will keep any adjustment in rates that may be found necessary, as low as possible.</P>
    <P>While our exchange controls have enlarged somewhat our scope for discretionary action in regard to interest rates, they cannot confer anything approaching full freedom of action on us.  No country, no matter how big, can insulate itself fully from external influences.  Our exchange controls do not apply to funds held here by non-residents and in operating them we must also respect certain EC and international obligations.  The timing of trade payments and receipts, while monitored by our controls, can also be influenced by interest rate differentials. Attempts, therefore, however well-motivated, to hold Irish interest rates artificially low can lead to capital outflows and losses of external reserves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Even before these interest rates increases were announced, it was already quite clear that one of the most depressing factors in the Irish economy was the high level of interest rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 28 November, when there was speculation about this matter, an eminent international economist, the chief economic adviser to the National Westminster Bank, announced in Dublin that the current level &mdash; before the 2 per cent increase &mdash; of high interest rates could not be maintained for many months without having a severe recessionary effect on the economy.  He went on to argue that a reduction of 2 per cent in the <Col N="1719" /> interest rates would be appropriate for this country.  Instead of a reduction we are now faced with a 2 per cent increase.</P>
    <P>The associated banks, to which the Minister referred, have clearly been very reluctant to propose these increases because they know that the private sector is already so depressed, as is evident from the objective comment of an international economic adviser, that this latest increase will depress the economy into a disastrous state and will have a major effect on the banking sector.</P>
    <P>In contrast with previous occasions when interest rates were raised by international trends, at present the trend is consistently downward internationally and we, as a consequence of direct Government policies which is implicit in what the Minister said, are creating conditions here which will mean that the whole basis of the plan to have stable interest rates internationally and, as the Minister has acknowledged, domestically, is being undermined as a consequence of the Government's action.</P>
    <P>On 28 November the rates in Chase Manhattan, France and Italy were all down 0.5 per cent and the trend has been continuously downward.  Here, contrary to international trend, the rate has been pushed up.  The reason for this is the rigid approach which the Government and particularly the Minister have adopted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister acknowledges in his statement that the root cause of the most recent increase in the domestic interest rates is the size of the Exchequer borrowing requirement despite the relatively slack demand for credit from the private sector in recent years.  That underlines the fact that the <Col N="1720" /> rigid approach of the Government to borrowing targets has put the Minister into a straitjacket and has done the same for the economy.  When we refer to the trends over 1983 to which the Minister has referred as being evidence of the growth of the servicing of the foreign debt, it must be said that the policies of the Government in determining the range of foreign borrowing, particularly in borrowing to the extent to which they did against the advice of the Opposition and many others in the dollar market by contrast with other markets, have increased the cost of servicing that debt and have also, because of the exchange rates <i>vis-à-vis</i> the dollar, added very considerably to our total foreign debt.  It is not surprising, because of that mistaken strategy on the part of the Government where even our foreign borrowing was concentrated unduly as distinct from the mix which every previous Minister has engaged in, particularly in European currencies, that we now have a Government in a straitjacket as a consequence of which they have to soak up the credit available on the domestic market.  They are the sole cause of this huge rise in interest rates which is contrary to international trends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because the Government have had to soak up more for their borrowing programme from the domestic banks, a very major issue has now arisen for the banking and private sectors.  Already this year &mdash; and the Minister knows this &mdash; the Government have soaked up more from the Central Bank and the domestic banking sector than the private sector <i>in toto</i> already this year, although we all recognise that one of the major problems of the economy at present is the lack of investment and the disincentives with regard to investment in the private sector.  Surely the Minister must recognise that this extra increase which has been forced upon the associated banks and has obviously been sanctioned by the Central Bank is a direct consequence of his own actions?  We must also recognise that the private sector which was already depressed to the extent that they were borrowing much less than he was from <Col N="1721" /> the domestic banking sector, will be depressed even further to a disastrous extent.  We can see the evidence all around us.</P>
    <P>Looking at the effect this is having on the private sector and on the economy generally, we also have the highest tax rates in Europe taking direct and indirect taxes into account.  If we are even to begin to look reality in the face &mdash; from a Government who claims to build on reality &mdash; we must see that a combination of these penally high tax rates, plus these new rates of interest which are operated to the banks, will mean that the economy is going to go further into depression.  We will have little left but rubble and before we start to build for a renewal of the economy we will have to clear that rubble.  We already had the lowest rate of investment before interest rates rose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the lowest level of investment as a percentage of our GNP for over 15 years.  Any Deputy can tell the Minister from his own experience that investment is very low and the Minister is ensuring that it will be even lower. This further 2 per cent increase is going to have a disastrous effect on the economy. Contrast it with, for instance, the rates in Britain.  The preferred rates for the semi-State bodies and the biggest companies will be 14¾ per cent on overdrafts and the AA rate for businesses other than semi-State bodies and the very large companies will be 15¾ per cent.  Let us compare that with the average rate in the United Kingdom of about a 10 per cent base rate plus one or two percentage points depending on the preferred position of the borrower.  That is the kind of comparison that must be made to see what climate for investment there is here in comparison with competitor countries. We have to add to that the penal tax rate here where a person pays at the rate of 65 per cent when his income is in excess of £12,500 while his counterpart in Britain will not pay at the rate of 60 per cent until his income is £40,000 per annum. After making these comparisons one can <Col N="1722" /> begin to see why this economy is in such a depressed state.  On the Order of Business practically every day, in our newspapers and on every news bulletin there is mention of closures, liquidations and redundancies.  What has happened now will, unfortunately, add to that dreary chain of disasters.</P>
      <P>Why did the ACC have to put pressure on Clover Meats?  They did so because of pressure on themselves in having to face the interest rates.  There are many fishermen whose boats are being repossessed and in the business sector companies are going into liquidation.  The building industry is suffering closures every day and is in a state of collapse.  It is quite clear that the basic economic structure of the country is falling apart. We have not the capacity left to build up the productive sector of the economy.  At the beginning of this year the Government announced they would borrow from abroad a sum of £640 million and £1,000 million on the domestic front irrespective of the consequences to the economy. They have not even the judgement, much less the wit or the sense of direction, to ensure that the consequences of their rigid actions will not bring further disaster on the economy.</P>
      <P>Wherever we turn we see the effect of the Government's actions.  With the collapse of each firm go other firms also. We know in our towns and cities that when one undertaking goes it does not fall on its own but brings others with it. The Minister must be completely deaf as to what is happening in the business sector.  I do not know if he has been sheltered by the civil servants but as Opposition spokesman on Finance I have never had such a range of business, financial and commercial community trooping into my office.  Apparently they have done this because they have no access to the Minister because he is being protected behind civil servants&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We know that unemployment is the major crisis but we cannot begin to tackle it until we create a climate for investment and activity.  This decision which the banks regret is a direct consequence of a rigid Government adherence to fixed targets irrespective of the consequences.  With regard to the building societies and the effect on borrowers, it is clear that because of our tax climate people are not prepared to invest. As a consequence of that people have been putting their money into safe havens and even if the building societies benefit let that be.  However, people are not drawing on the building societies to the <Col N="1724" /> same extent and the building industry is depressed.  The net inflow into the building societies in October amounted to £19.97 million which is an increase of 43.3 per cent on October last year and an increase of almost 2 per cent on September. It is obvious that when people do not invest in the productive sector or in their own businesses they will put it somewhere away from the claws of this Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should draw the rest of that conclusion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleagues will develop this point further.  In view of this trend in the building societies I hope they will not find it necessary to increase their mortgage interest rates because they are in an unusually buoyant position.  People are putting their money into the societies to get away from the Minister, and few people are drawing on the funds of the societies.</P>
      <P>In the final analysis the real issue is the role of Government.  It is no more and no less than to create a climate in which the doers will do and the goers will go and where all together will lift the economy. However, this Government believe that their role is to control and regulate tax revenue, to adhere to rigid targets, to treat every person as if he or she were a robot who will react as the Minister thinks they should.  Because of that attitude there will be further depression and there will not be a renewal of activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This latest increase has, quite frankly, been forced on the banks and as a consequence of this action we will have an even more depressed economy.  There must be some light at the end of the tunnel and some hope must be given to people.  If the Minister cannot do a U-turn in respect of all the rigid targets he has set &mdash; I plead with him to do so &mdash; then perhaps the best turn he could take is a turn out and let the people make their choice.  I have not spoken like this before in the House but I am conscious of the mood throughout the country.  It is time all of us took note of the fact that we are sitting on a time bomb and we cannot allow it to <Col N="1725" /> explode in our faces.  If the Government are not capable of changing even at this late stage it is time they allowed somebody else to make the changes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given us an excellent lecture on banking, inter-bank rates, interest rates and so on and I am sure it will be of great academic interest to many people.  However, we were listening to the Minister for Finance, the man who is supposed to control the economy and the financial operations of this State.  In essence he was telling us that he has no control over the situation. It will be very depressing for the people to hear the Minister for Finance tell this House how the system works but who then states that unfortunately he has no control over it.</P>
      <P>The most significant part of the Minister's speech was his quotation from section 6 of the Central Bank Act of 1942, which I repeat:</P>
      <P>...and ensuring that, in what pertains to the control of credit, the constant and predominant aim shall be the welfare of the people as a whole.</P>
      <P>The predominant aim of the Central Bank is not what the Minister was talking about &mdash; inter-bank rates, banking loans, Government spending, Government lending, foreign loans, domestic borrowing and so forth.  Their interest is the welfare of the people as a whole.  The banks have been allowed to get away with these increased in interest rates, although the Government did not want them and Deputy O'Kennedy says that the banks did not want them, that they regret them very much.  It is amazing, everybody regrets but everybody has to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of these increases in interest rates we shall see now many more firms going to the wall &mdash; many more Clover Meats.  We are also going to see a substantial number of people out of work. In particular, there are the effects of this increase on the building industry.  None of these things can be seen as being in the interests of the people as a whole. Already, investment in the building industry and its output have decreased <Col N="1726" /> and are forecast to fall by 4 per cent this year, even before this increase.  Now the position will be even worse in an industry which is, after agriculture, the second biggest industry in a State where one in every four of the male unemployed is a building worker.  The increase in interest rates is a further sanction by bankers against this industry which has almost half its workforce out of work.  How can this be said by the Central Bank or the Minister to be for the welfare of the people as a whole?</P>
    <P>The increase will significantly add to the problems of our semi-State companies, many of whom are trading quite profitably, but due to the huge amounts they have to pay out in interest charges, find themselves operating at a net loss.</P>
    <P>The Bord na Móna report issued last week showed that they have to pay £9 million in interest charges to the banks. In spite of this they made a profit of about £12 million, I think.  Following these increases in interest charges, will they make a profit next year?  Also will those semi-State companies which are operating at a loss &mdash; some at a considerable loss &mdash; now show a further loss this year as a result of these increases?  Will the Government proceed to do what they did to Irish Shipping?  If there are other State companies showing very substantial losses as a result of the increase in the bank interest rates, will the Minister for Finance put in a liquidator as he did in Irish Shipping?  That seems to me the headline for major loss-making semi-State companies.  The banks will force them into loss, which is happening and will happen as a result of these interest charges.  Will the Minister then, instead of acting against the banks, act against the companies which made the loss?</P>
    <P>The other area where the welfare of the people is certainly not considered is the huge burden of interest charges on repayments of mortgage rates for many householders.  Most of these have already seen a substantial drop in income, either through unemployment or other causes. Although we do not yet know by how much the building societies will increase their interest rates, it is quite possible <Col N="1727" /> that mortgage rates could increase by £30 to £40 a month as a result.  That certainly cannot be seen to be for the welfare of the people as a whole.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that at a time when interest charges are coming down in other countries, as other speakers have said, the Irish banks should be seeking substantial increases.  It is no answer to say that when interest rates were going up earlier in the year the banks here did not increase their charges.  They did not have to increase them.  But why, now that the interest rates have gone down, do they suddenly increase their interest charges? The banks on existing interest rates have reached around the £200 million profit margin in a year.  This increase in rates from, as the Minister said, 14¾ per cent to 19¼ per cent range, will further increase the profits of the banks.  The Minister never referred in any way to this effect of the increase in interest charges &mdash; the inordinate profits of the banks.  Has he any proposals in mind to take these profits from them?  They regret very much having to put up the charges, we are told.  They do not really want to make a profit.  It is just that they have to put up the charges.  Why not, then, take from them the profits that will accrue to them into the Exchequer and let the Minister use that sum to help those who are suffering as a result of these increased charges? There is no reference by the Minister as to what he is going to do in that regard.</P>
    <P>This increase also raises the question: to whom are the banks accountable?  It certainly appears that the Central Bank has neither the desire nor the ability to keep them in check.  This has already been instanced by a number of decisions in the past few months by the associated banks which were meekly sanctioned by the Central Bank.  They were relatively small matters, like in August the Central Bank approving the decision of a commercial bank to introduce a charge of 50p for cashing cheques for non-customers. Last year they gave the go-ahead to banks to stop sending back cancelled cheques. What is happening is that, as the profits of the banks are increasing at a rapid <Col N="1728" /> rate, the service that they are giving to their customers is becoming less and less. They are cutting back on it.  In other words, the Central Bank is failing in its responsibility to act as a watchdog for the public.  Of course, this is not surprising considering that 50 per cent of the board of the Central Bank is made up, I think, of representatives of private banking interests.</P>
    <P>One step that the Minister could and should immediately take is to ensure that the Central Bank is revamped and a board appointed which is made up of members who will protect the interests of the public &mdash; in other words, under section 6 of the Bank Act have directors whose predominant aim would be the welfare of the people as a whole and not as at the moment the welfare of the commercial bank directors and their shareholders.  In the light of the policies pursued by the banks in recent years and in view of this further usury against the public interests, the public would be well justified, following on the Minister's speech, in asking who is running the country.  Is it the banks or is it the Government?  It certainly looks, following the Minister's speech, as if it is &ldquo;Bank rule OK&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The increase will be seen now as further evidence that a small group of wealthy individuals wield great power in this State and that there is no Government that have the guts to tackle them. The present Coalition Government have shown a particular lack of backbone in dealing with financial institutions, as we discovered earlier this year in the backdown in the period between the budget and the Finance Bill on measures to deal with section 84 &mdash; loans and bond washing. This was presumably as a result of pressure from a handful of stockbrokers or financiers.</P>
    <P>In May, the Tánaiste, in a fairly widely reported speech made in Cork, criticised the banks for, as he said, failing in their social responsibility to society.  He further said in that speech:</P>
    <P>In the Labour Party we have always had a view about the contribution we <Col N="1729" /> require from profit.  It is approaching time that we make it clear to everyone that we mean what we say.</P>
    <P>It was approaching time in May and there is a time here now for him to do it. This is an opportunity for the Tánaiste and his colleagues to confront the banks and compel them to live up to their social responsibilities and adhere to section 6 of the Central Bank Act in protecting the welfare of the people as a whole.  If the Labour Party are prepared to initiate legislation to compel the banks to act in the public interest, as they are supposed to do, it will have the full support of The Workers' Party.  We believe that the banks have such an inordinate influence on the economy and on developments that it is in the best interests of the people that they be taken into public ownership.</P>

      <P>It happens for reasons which I will explain if the Deputy lets me.  The banks will place their bad debts position in jeopardy.  Businesses which are on the edge will go to the wall.  It is irresponsible to suggest that the banks want that or that it is good for them. One of the easiest things to do in politics today, when no one has any idea of what else to do, is to attack the banks.  Bank profits are very easy to attack.  They look very large.  Are they really large in relation to the amount of money that goes through a bank?  What would be the position if there was a run on the banks because people had a doubt about their viability?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Central Bank, contrary to Deputy-Mac Giolla's view, has always acted in the interests of the people and has said over and over again that bank profits are <Col N="1730" /> barely adequate.  It is popular to attack them but we must look at the other side of the coin.  We saw an example of the bank system last week when there was a run on the savings bank on the basis of an unfounded rumour.  I could think of nothing worse than to have a serious problem with one of the major banks. That more than any other feature would destabilise our economy.</P>

      <P>The stability of interest rates in Ireland has been quite remarkable over the last 15 months.  There is no question but that this is a setback. However, it must be viewed in the context of unusually satisfactory interest stability particularly when compared to the previous four years.  The level of real interest rates, that is the level of interest rates relative to inflation, compares favourably with other countries and very favourably with the US where interest rates are very high relative to low rates of inflation.</P>

    <P>While it is understandable that people will be critical and upset about all this we need to look at it in perspective to see why it is happening, what can be done, how long it is likely to last and whether the overall trend in the economy is absolutely sound, which I believe it is.  The Central Bank, in its negotiations about this matter, has dealt with the increases in as sensitive a way as it could in relation to the fact that great emphasis has been placed on minimising increases on mortgages. In the case of the building societies there is a possibility that by 1 February, which is the date by which they will be in a position to put up their rates, it might <Col N="1731" /> not be necessary to do so.  However, that is speculative.</P>

      <P>No one is in a position to guarantee that but there is a reasonable prospect of it for reasons I will try to explain.  The position about this interest rate increase is that it relates directly to the necessity to borrow large sums of money on the domestic market.  It would be well to look for a moment at the merits or otherwise of that policy.  I submit that, by and large, it is better to borrow a higher proportion of one's total borrowings on the domestic market rather than on the international market.  If one borrows domestically the question of currency risk is eliminated.  Deputy O'Kennedy, with good reason, has been very critical in recent months about borrowing in dollars.  The currency risks in borrowing in strong currencies like that has cost the country dearly.  It was a sensible, realistic and commendable decision to look to the domestic market for a larger share of our borrowing to reduce the risk inherent in borrowing in a strong currency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Government borrow at home and pay out interest they take back a certain amount of it in tax.  At the end of the day there is still some residual spending within the economy.  All that is gone if we borrow abroad.  We pay interest, take the currency risk and get nothing back in taxation or spending.  The policy is fundamentally sound but there is another side to it.  There is the question of balancing and against the pressure it puts on the bank system and which it inevitably puts on rates.  What happened was that in the latter half of this year when our international borrowing had been taken up to the limit set by the Minister that pressure was put on.  As I understand it, next year we will commence our borrowing requirement afresh on the international market and that will begin quickly enough in the early months of 1985 to take the pressure off the domestic market.  That in turn should, in the <Col N="1732" /> normal course of things, lead to a reduction of pressure on interest rates. Whether that will happen in time to put off the mortgage interest rate increase altogether is a matter of conjecture but the trend is in the right direction.  It is a reasonable conjecture to suggest that this will be the likely outcome.</P>
    <P>As regards the national plan, <i>Building on Reality</i>, there are references in that to interest rates.  I refute the notion that because there has been a temporary increase in rates domestically the plan has been somehow invalidated.  There are two kinds of rates of interest, the international rate and the domestic rate.  A 1 per cent drop in international rates is worth approximately £35 million to us in terms of our foreign borrowings reduction and savings and a similar 1 per cent drop in domestic rates would be about half that, so that international rates are more important by 2:1, a factor of two, than domestic rates.  The dollar rate has dropped 2 per cent in two months and that is away ahead of anything that had been planned or anticipated in the national plan.  It is much too soon for me or for the Minister to guarantee what will happen to interest rates internationally and locally over the next couple of years, but it would be erroneous to suggest that because we have had a temporary setback here in interest rates for three or four months the whole strategy of the plan in relation to interest rates has been invalidated. That is not the case.  The reverse is the case because of the steep reduction in the dollar rate.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day I want to come back to the eternal triangle, which is the balance between Government expenditure, taxation and borrowing.  If I have been critical of anything in the national plan it is that we have not gone far enough, that despite the fact that this Minister and this Government have been referred to as Thatcherite, monetarist and all the other &ldquo;ists&rdquo; and &ldquo;isms&rdquo;, this is a high borrowing, high public expenditure, high taxation Government, and those pressures lead primarily to an increase in interest rates.  We must understand that the people cannot pay any <Col N="1733" /> more taxation.  We cannot borrow much more because we cannot pay for it, and the only part of that triangle that we can do anything about is the question of public expenditure.  Unless and until we face up to the reality that we are still with all the alleged cut backs &mdash; many of them true &mdash; spending more than we can afford by a long shot, we will continue to delay our recovery.</P>
    <P>Because taxation levels are so crippling business cannot and will not have the incentive to invest.  Therefore we cannot make up the difference in borrowing.  We see what is happening this week.  We are over-borrowed, therefore we must tackle public expenditure and we must be honest and courageous in that.  For instance, the Southern Health Board in Cork are screaming that they will have to decimate the services there when they have failed patently to deal with the budgetary situation in 1984 and are now being forced to carry that into 1985.  That is an example of what no Government in the present climate can accept.  When we all cry for expenditure for one thing or another we must be prepared to set it off against something else.  With regard to the great catch-cry from the south-west for the past month about money for a ferry, some of us at least faced up to the fact that we could not have that except at the expense of something else.  That is the way it must be, otherwise we would be back here again and again with one Government or another crying about the kind of development which happened this week.  It is all related to the fact that we are spending too much, that we are taking too much in tax, therefore we are borrowing too much and we have not faced up sufficiently to that.  This Government are trying to face up to it and in the long term they will get the support of the people. We need a more competitive, lower inflation economy and if we can get that and get our Government expenditure down within acceptable limits we will not have problems with interest rates.</P>

      <P>I will do as much as I can in the time available.  There is no doubt that the increase in interest rates from the close of business on Monday night will have a very serious impact on industry.  One could say that the detrimental effect it will have on manufacturing and other industry is unquestionably very serious.  The increase will bear particularly heavily on firms supplying the home market.  Do the Minister, the Government, the Central Bank or whoever &mdash; I notice a great deal of shifting of responsibility here this evening&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no shifting at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>They must realise that the survival of industry at this time is very much dependent on borrowing.  The NESC report published recently indicates that borrowing in 1982 accounted for 59 per cent of the network of indigenous manufacturing companies compared with 52 per cent in 1978.  Furthermore, interest payments accounted for almost 60 per cent of profits before interest on tax compared with less than a quarter in 1978. These figures indicate clearly that Irish manufacturing has become very much more vulnerable to any hike in interest rates.  Industrial borrowing is divided evenly between overdrafts and term loans.  Therefore, the typical company as a result of this increase will bear an average increase of 1.75 per cent. taking into account the different rates and the years applicable to the term loans.  I think I am being generous in dropping it down from 2 per cent to an average 1.75 per cent.</P>
      <P>We have all expressed the opinion that competitiveness with our trading partners is vital in Irish industry.  I wonder how much notice the Government have taken of that competitiveness.  A document we have heard a great deal about has been referred to here again this evening. I quote from <i>Building on Reality:</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1735" /> 1.18 The Government have set their objective of improving the overall competitiveness of the economy in the manner outlined in this Plan...</P>
    <P>1.19 The fall in employment in manufacturing industry that has occurred over the past four years has been due principally to two factors: the depth of the international recession and excessive increases in costs, particularly labour costs, relative to our main trading partners.....  The excessive increases in Irish wage rates over the past few years have led to a considerable shake-out in labour as industrialists tried to maintain their competitive position.</P>
    <P>Here the Government, in their document <i>Building on Reality</i>, attack workers for lack of competitiveness in industry and in the market place.  That is a terrible slight on the work force.  I wonder how the Labour Deputies, allegedly representing the workers, marched as they did not here when we were condemning and voting on this famous document, I do not agree with the Government's assessment as a reason for our lack of competiveness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Deputy ever read <i>The Way Forward</i>?  Let him have a look at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>These factors within the control of the Government have added immeasurably to the uncompetitive situation in which we find ourselves now. Recently we discussed the damaging effect that the electricity crisis would have on competitiveness, still the Government blame the workers.  This further increase of interest rates will be a very damaging blow to that effectiveness we are all talking about.</P>
      <P>Consider the Government's document when it states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>1.7 When account is taken of the moderation in inflation that has taken place, interest rates worldwide are now at exceptionally high levels.  This has <Col N="1736" /> been a major factor in inhibiting investment both in Ireland and abroad...</P>
    <P>We read in paragraph 1.8 that:</P>
    <P>While it is generally agreed that real interest rates cannot remain at their present levels over the medium-term, there is no consensus as to when they will start to come down or as to the extent of their decline.</P>
    <P>So much for the honesty, the reliability and the reality of the Government plan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The rates came down sooner than we expected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Within a matter of weeks of the publication of that document there is this unacceptable increase in interest rates at home.  Is it not true that our interest rates are much higher than those of our competitors?  I am outlining the effect that this increase will have on all aspects of our struggling industry.  The three month inter-bank rate is now more than 5 percentage points higher than is the rate in Britain or the US and it is 9 percentage points higher than the German rate.  Consequently, Irish firms are at a major disadvantage in competitive terms.  A typical Irish firm have borrowings of about £7,000 per person employed.  That means an annual interest charge of about £1,000 per person employed.  This week's increase will push that interest charge up to £1,100.  If the same funds were being borrowed on the inter-bank market in Germany the interest rate charge would be only £500 while in Britain or the US it would be less than £800.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main reasons for the increase in Irish interest rates at a time when international interest rates are decreasing is the extent of public sector borrowing.  That has been established here this evening.  The Government and their agencies have borrowed £10,000 million abroad.  This has been increased by £650 million this year and it has happened despite the Government having made an absolute commitment to the electorate not only to reduce but to wipe <Col N="1737" /> out total foreign borrowing and to eliminate budget deficits.  But we are all aware that these two commitments have long been abandoned and we find that Ireland has the highest level of Government spending and borrowing in the EC.  What is worse, the Government are borrowing now on the home market.  This increases the demand for the limited supply of money available and thereby increases interest rates.</P>
    <P>So far this year the Government have absorbed half of the increase in domestically-financed credit and they are now trying to increase this share.  Public sector borrowing is crowding out the private sector, whether corporate or individual, and in the process is forcing the contraction, and in many cases the closure, of manufacturing firms.  The total cost to the manufacturing sector of the recently increased interest rates will be about £20 million in a full year.  This is equivalent to the working capital required to maintain about 2,000 people in manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to clarify a doubtful aspect of the increase in interest rates.  According to the managing director of one of the five big banks, the increase will not be short term but the Minister and other commentators, including Deputy Coveney, have indicated that there will be a change by February 1985.  This is another of the uncertainties that surrounds the activities of this Government.  I call on them, even at this stage, to provide the necessary action to promote enterprise, to promote innovation, dynamism, confidence, risk taking and hard work.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of manufacturing industry relates to their problems in respect of securing insurance.</P>

      <P>I will not use those five minutes so that I may give way to my colleague.  I will conclude by asking what the Minister means when he refers to a prudent level of foreign borrowing.  I should like to think that, as Deputy <Col N="1738" /> Coveney indicated, we are talking about a temporary setback.  Regarding the Minister's reference to our credibility abroad, it must be well established now that our international credit rating has been shipwrecked by the Government.</P>

      <P>The reason we are here debating this matter this evening is the abysmal failure of the Government's economic policies in the two years in which they have been in office.  The stability and growth which they led the people to believe would result from their policies have not materialised and instead of a growing and buoyant economy we have a deflated economy in which there is rampant unemployment and general despair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government came into office saying that there was too much foreign borrowing and promising that it would be eliminated.  They promised also to reduce current budget deficiting.  Not only have they failed to achieve the targets they set themselves but they exceeded those targets to a large extent.  They have reduced us to a situation in which there is now a mopping up of the liquidity in the domestic money market.  This puts pressures on that market which result in these unwanted increases in interest rates, increases that will have a savage effect on the economy and a very sad effect on a section of the community on behalf of whom I should like to appeal to the Minister.  I am asking him to take some measures to ease the burden of those who must meet big repayments in respect of mortgages on their homes and who are already finding it very difficult to continue to provide for their families in a situation where there are to be no wage or salary increases in the public service and where wage increases in the private sector are being kept to a minimum. Despite these conditions inflation is rampant and the standard of living of everyone in the community is decreasing rapidly.  The ability of mortgage holders <Col N="1739" /> to continue to meet their financial commitments is becoming more doubtful daily.  In many cases people have had to surrender their homes and to fall back on local authorities to provide housing for them.  This is at a time when the Government are not making any provision for extra local authority houses.  The estimates indicate that provision of these houses is to continue at the rate of 6,000 per year.</P>
    <P>Obviously the Government housing policy is dependent on the level of buoyancy in the private sector but the kinds of pressures that are brought about by Government action by way of excessive borrowing on the home market will create major problems for householders who have had to borrow to provide homes for themselves.  The Building Societies' Association are meeting on Monday next.  The Minister should indicate to the House whether the increases in interest rates are temporary or whether they are to last for some time.  If their borrowing policy for next year involves taking £1.2 billion out of the domestic liquidity market, the pressures will remain, the interest rates will remain high and the building societies will be forced to increase their rates also.  I hope that the Government will provide some subsidy to the borrowing members of the building societies to ease the burden.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy concentrated a lot of his remarks on the suggestion that the trend of international interest rates is consistently downwards and Deputies on the opposite side of the House have been speaking as if interest rates have never been as high as they are at the moment.  I would remind the Deputies of a few historical facts which they might like to get under their belts, and reflect on what they were saying and doing when those things were happening. On 16 May 1978 treble A overdraft rate increased to 9½ per cent; a little over a month later it went to 10½per cent, in November 1978 to 13 per cent, in June 1979 it went to 15½ per cent and in April of 1980 it went to 18 per cent.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy claims that the international trend in interest rates is consistently down.  That is not the case.  We have had stability in our interest rates since September 1983 which we maintained in spite of the fact that at the end of June this year international interest rates generally increased by a substantial margin and have only recently started to come down from that level.  In spite of that, given our management and the situation here, we maintained our interest rates at that level and it is only now that these international factors plus the domestic factors to which I have referred have fed into our interest rates. We have done extremely well in the interest rate front given what was happening on those international markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will diverge from the interest rate topic and talk about some of the other points raised by the Opposition.  The Opposition speak as if there was an inexhaustible supply of money available from foreign lenders at lower rates than we have at the moment.  This is the most absurd of expectations.  We have an extremely good credit rating on international markets.

They are wrong.  Deputy O'Kennedy has come back again this evening with that old chestnut of his about dollar borrowing. <Col N="1742" /> When I heard that, I wrote down a reference to dollar borrowing and I wondered if the Deputy was suggesting that we should go out and borrow in coral beads or something like that.  The Deputy knows perfectly well that there is no way in which one can run a substantial foreign borrowing programme without having a large element of dollars in it.  As I explained to the Deputy before, the dollar market is now the largest source of funds.  Funds from other parts of the world that would otherwise be going into other markets are now going into the dollar market because the interest rates on the dollar market have been so high that it has been the best place in which to put money.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Northern Ireland Supergrass Trials: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy O'Hanlon on Tuesday, 4 December 1984:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann condemns the system of Supergrass trials in the North of Ireland whereby persons are convicted of serious crimes, mainly on the uncorroborated evidence of informers as being totally alien to both Irish and British Court practice and contrary to the principles in accordance with which justice is administered throughout the democratic world, and calls on the British Government to terminate these trials and to institute an independent review of all such cases which have resulted in convictions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;notes the damage which is being done to the legal and judicial system in Northern Ireland in the eyes of many in both sections of the community there by the regular reliance on uncorroborated accomplice evidence as a major feature of the prosecution system.&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The practice of using the uncorroborated evidence of accomplices in a systematic manner started in November 1981 when the informer, Christopher Black, was arrested and agreed to testify for the prosecution in the Six Counties. By March 1984 a total of 477 people had been charged for serious offences on the evidence of 26 police informers.  In January 1984 there were over 200 persons in custody awaiting 13 trials in scheduled cases in which it was intended to hear accomplice evidence.</P>
      <P>The system of supergrass trials is unique.  It allows uncorroborated evidence to be used involving no jury, and one judge only. Previous speakers outlined details of specific cases.  This system means that the courts in Northern Ireland are being used as a political weapon where inducements and payments are being made to informers who, more often than not, are dangerous criminals themselves and whose evidence has been contradicted many times over but is still accepted by the one judge involved.  We would all agree that it is a very doubtful system of justice, to say the least.  It is undermining the credibility of the whole judicial system.  The operation of the supergrass trial system has been condemned by almost everybody in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The SDLP passed a motion in January 1984 condemning the use of supergrasses at their Annual Delegate Conference. The DUP are also firmly opposed to supergrass trials.  Various other groups have expressed concern, including the British Liberal Party and the British Labour Party.  The Church of Ireland and the Catholic Bishops of Derry, in a joint statement, expressed concern at the effect of the supergrass phenomenon on respect for the legal system in the North. The Association Against Legal Injustice stated that the Secretary of State was presiding over the destruction of legal justice in the North of Ireland.  I must reecho that sentiment here this evening. <Col N="1747" /> The supergrass system is causing the destruction and elimination of respect for the legal system in the North.  That has come on the heels of the total destruction of respect for the security forces and for the forces of law and order there.  In fact there is so much animosity even on the Unionist side on the operation of the supergrass trials that riots that occurred this summer in Belfast came about because of the Budgey Allen trials.</P>
    <P>The British view is that the use of supergrasses has lead to the successful conviction of known subversives.  Having spoken to a large number concerned with this matter, my view is that a lot of innocent people have also been convicted. This to most Members of this House is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The practice of holding persons on remand for long periods of up to three years gives substance to the charges from Nationalists that supergrass trials are internment under another name.  The Presbyterian Church has expressed concern at the length of time accused persons are spending in custody.  Classical examples are the cases of two Belfast men, Thomas Power and Gerard Steenson, who served 33 months in Crumlin Road Jail on the basis of allegations made by five successive supergrasses &mdash; allegations that were either subsequently withdrawn or were dismissed as unreliable by a judge.</P>
    <P>The injustice of the supergrass trials has been well documented.  At this stage we should concern ourself with what can be done to eliminate this reprehensible practice in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>A group from the Concerned Community Organisations in Belfast, called the Delegation Against Legal Injustice, came to Dublin recently to meet TDs. and Senators from all parties.  Last night Deputy Liam Fitzgerald expressed regret in this House, that the Dáil could not have a united voice in dealing with this motion.  Unfortunately, I must say that the division of opinion came about at a much earlier date.  When the Delegation Against Legal Injustice came to Dublin for an all-party meeting it was the Fianna <Col N="1748" /> Fáil party who split from the group and changed the arrangements that had been made so that as a result an all-party meeting could not take place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>For the record, there was no arrangement made.  We were told.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>When we met the delegation from Belfast we expressed regret that we were not in a position to meet them as an all-party group.  We expressed the hope that the matter would not become a vehicle for political advantage in the Dáil.  I am not suggesting that it has.  But what I am saying is that far more effective action could have been taken on this issue by a united all-party approach. Since that meeting our colleagues on the other side of the House chose to table a motion here.  As a result of our meeting with the delegation that evening some of us met the Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs requesting that this very serious practice be taken up with the British Prime Minister at the earliest possible opportunity.  I have no reason to think that this has not happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated earlier, the principle of being innocent until proven guilty has been abandoned in the North.  The detention period leading up to supergrass trials is a substitute for internment.  People have had their lives ruined even though they have never been convicted because of this abominable system operating in Northern Ireland.  We all saw examples and met people who suffered because of the system when we met that delegation from the North recently.  Unfortunately some people find, having been unjustly detained, that they lose their jobs and then have no recourse to compensation. The victims of this supergrass system must be listened to.  Something must be done on their behalf at some international forum.  I would ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs, through his representatives here this evening, to investigate the cases of people who have been the victims of this terrible system, who have been found to be innocent but, because of the length of time they were detained, <Col N="1749" /> suffered materially and in their private family lives.  This is totally unjust and the matter must be investigated further.  Such victims must be compensated in some way for the travesty of justice that is taking place.</P>
    <P>Alienation of the minority community still exists in the Six Counties irrespective of any pious comments made on the part of British politicians and some Northern politicians.  The discrimination against the minority continues in the area of jobs, as is evidenced even today in Queen's University, Belfast, where only a tiny percentage of the administrative staff are from the Catholic side.  It is a bad sign if it is happening in a place like Queen's University, Belfast, which is supposed to be a seat of learning and knowledge.</P>
    <P>I regret that the former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. James Prior, supported a policy of discrimination. Evidence of this is the treatment handed out to three young people from the Six Counties who applied for jobs with the Northern Ireland Electricity Supply Board and were discriminated against in an obvious way.  When pinned down on the issue Mr. Prior got them out of a difficult situation by classifying the young lads as security risks.  That type of treatment must not be tolerated and must be taken up at senior level by our Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs must be very firm with the British and must insist that the system of supergrass trials in Northern Ireland be reappraised and that the normal standards of justice apply equally to Northern Ireland as to Britain. It is no wonder that the campaign of the Provisional IRA can be so successful when supergrass trials are allowed to continue and there is still discrimination in relation to jobs.  A typical example of the way the Nationalist community are treated is to be found in an area of west Belfast where a street with 33 houses has only one house remaining where there has been no arrest to date of an adult male.  The people we term as moderate are being isolated and driven into extreme situations because of the continuing travesty of justice.  Therefore we <Col N="1750" /> must ensure that the supergrass system is immediately reappraised, and the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs must be very firm with Britain in this matter in coming weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The last words of Deputy Allen about being firm with Britain are obviously true and the only way to be firm with Britain in a matter of this kind, which is of concern to Britain and all parts of Ireland, is to pass a motion in the terms which we have put down.  This motion was deliberately framed on the basis that it would command all party support in this House because the logic of what Deputy Allen has just said and of what the Minister for Foreign Affairs said last night leads one to the direct conclusion that the terms of our motion are the correct terms.  The motion states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann condemns the system of Supergrass trials in the North of Ireland whereby persons are convicted of serious crimes, mainly on the uncorroborated evidence of informers as being totally alien to both Irish and British Court practice and contrary to the principles in accordance with which justice is administered throughout the democratic world, and calls on the British Government to terminate these trials and to institute an independent review of all such cases which have resulted in convictions.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the logic directly flowing from what Deputy Allen has just said and from what the Minister for Foreign Affairs said last night, which is totally at variance with the terms of the Government amendment which merely &ldquo;notes the damage which is being done to the legal and judicial system in Northern Ireland...&rdquo; and also refers to &ldquo;regular reliance on uncorroborated accomplice evidence ...&rdquo;.  I was glad to hear Deputy Allen use the phrase &ldquo;supergrass&rdquo; regularly during his contribution, as I was also glad to hear the Minister use language which should have led both of them and the whole Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and The Workers' Party to support our motion, which expresses in essence the spirit of <Col N="1751" /> the views put forward in the House by members of other parties.  We cannot understand in the national sense the logic of putting down an amendment diminishing our motion, which epitomises the views put forward by everybody who has spoken.  That is why we are not accepting this amendment and will be voting for our original motion which condemns the use of the supergrass system and calls for its termination by the British Government.</P>
    <P>The views put forward by the Minister for Foreign Affairs last night sustain fully the terms of our motion.  He spoke about the outrageous procedure whereby the number of persons in one trial exceeds 30.  There are three specific cases where this is so and in respect of which one informer is wheeled in to deal with these people.  That deserves condemnation, not just &ldquo;taking note of&rdquo;.  There must be immediate termination of this legal practice. These three cases involving 30 persons in each one are all resting on the evidence of one informer in each case. Then we have the proposed amendment which would merely take note of that procedure.</P>
    <P>There is no point in hiding behind the legalistic argument that accomplice evidence is admissible in courts here and in Britain.  Such evidence is admissible only under very strict checks, balances and controls and the judge must give a warning to the jury.  In the case of our courts where we have three judges dealing with cases under the Offences Against the State Act each judge acts as a check on the others.  We have never descended to the degeneration, corruption and perversion of the courts as a systematic policy in the manner which is being adopted in Northern Ireland.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke about this aspect and said that the most serious feature is that these courts are being systematically organised, controlled, corrupted and perverted in respect of the police and the whole system of arrest, and in respect of detention and of the ultimate judicial <Col N="1752" /> hearing and sentencing.  This degeneration deserves from this sovereign Parliament condemnation and a call for immediate termination.  It does not justify a mealy-mouthed approach that merely takes note of the matter without making any recommendation.  That is why the Government's amendment is totally unacceptable to us.  In all honesty, it should be totally unacceptable to the other parties in the House whose Members in contributions have made the same points I have made.  I have listened to Deputy Allen making them and, having read the speech of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I am aware that he made them.  Those Deputies are not following up the logic of the points of view they appear to have adopted and expressed here.</P>
    <P>One cannot have it both ways.  There is no point in being ambivalent in this approach.  I should like to give some advice to the Government.  If there is one thing the British appreciate it is straight talking.  The only way to deal with people like the British Prime Minister is to make it plain to her, to the British Government and British public opinion, precisely where we stand so that they are not under any illusion or misconception as to the Irish attitude and approach to this matter.  The amendment proposed by the Government is unacceptable because it does not condemn the system or call for its termination.  Instead it uses the ambivalent neutral parliamentary phrase, taking note of the matter.  That is not good enough in this Parliament or when dealing with the British Prime Minister or the British Government.  They understand and appreciate when we talk business and spell out our position.  We got into enough trouble in recent weeks over ambivalence in the presentation of our position.</P>

The amendment is a further example of that sort of thinking.</P>

      <P>As the Minister for Foreign Affairs said last night there has been a systematic corruption of the legal and judicial systems.  There have been numerous cases in recent years and more than 30 people were arraigned at one time on the basis of a bought informer's evidence.  About 20 such informers have been involved in this process to date.  On a more serious note this system leads to a corruption of democracy, something we are all anxious to see established on the island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The elected parliament is an important aspect of democracy but an equally important element in democracy is the existence of free independent courts where the rule of law is respected by all the people in society.  People of all persuasions, classes and categories should be able to go about their daily lives secure in the knowledge that they will be treated fairly within the law.  That <Col N="1755" /> rule of law is basic to every democracy throughout the world.  The perversion and corruption of the rule of law as exists in the supergrass system in the six north eastern counties, as we should now get down to describing them, the organised systematic arraigning of people and their conviction, is worse than anything that exists under the Soviet system or any right or left wing dictatorship.</P>
    <P>At least in a dictatorship there is a certain honesty because everybody is aware of the system.  However, we are referring to a system that purports to be democratic but is being deliberately corrupted, perverted and twisted round for the purpose of putting people, innocent or guilty, into jail.  That is being done for the purpose of a hegemony, to continue depriving the people of this island of their overall political right to nationhood and ensuring that power and superiority is maintained in the six counties in the north-eastern part of Ireland. There is nothing worse than that.  That is corruption upon corruption.  The people there have no respect for the police, security forces or the courts.  If one continues along that road one reaches a position where a whole area of the country will be corrupt by a drastic reduction in regard for the law, fair play and independent courts, which are essential for the continuation of civilised democratic existence in any society.</P>

      <P>That is agreed.  I am glad to agree to that arrangement because it is time certain people who speak for Ireland were heard in the House.  Fine Gael and Labour have disgraced themselves by recent actions and, in particular, by their unwillingness to adopt our motion which seeks to condemn and terminate a system <Col N="1756" /> we all disagree with.  If we embark on any diminution we are once again getting into an ambivalent position which the Taoiseach, unfortunately, got himself into to his own humiliation &mdash; I do not mind that &mdash; and the country's humiliation some ten days ago.  We cannot afford that.  If we are to present the Irish national case it is contained to the fullest extent in the Forum document.  That document tells the British Government, the British Ambassador or anybody who wishes to speak on behalf of Britain precisely what the Irish case is.  That is all that has to be done, and no more than that.  That is all that was done by successive Irish leaders of all parties, and I include some Coalition leaders of the past who were as good in some ways as some of our leaders in this respect.  But this Government have foundered badly in this area.  This has led to a diminution in the standards of Irish national leadership which will never be forgotten.</P>
      <P>As the main Opposition party, putting down this motion was our way of trying to secure a unity of national purpose among all people in the House but the Government's amendment represents a diminution of that purpose and the type of ambivalence which can lead us more and more into the kind of trouble the Taoiseach landed the country in in recent days.</P>

      <P>In supporting the case made by our Deputy Leader, I must say that the supergrass system is an abomination of anything known in the judicial legal system throughout the world.  To say anything less of it would be to understate the case.  Any lawyer in any jurisdiction will recognise that a system which promotes and encourages informers to come forward on the basis of either indemnity or financial reward for themselves is nothing more than an abomination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not just asking this House for a condemnation or a termination of that system, we are asking the House to <Col N="1757" /> associate itself with others in the British parliament who have already taken that position.  I want to mention in particular the British Liberal Party who condemned this system out of hand as being contrary to any of the principles of jurisprudence or the law.  It is of vital importance that these facts be acknowledged here before we water down what is a motion to condemn and terminate a system which is an abomination.</P>
    <P>Any Government who would tolerate within their jurisdiction a supergrass system as a characteristic of their main attack on any element of society in terms of prosecutions, show a contempt for each and every element in that society. Could we imagine for a moment that the British Government within that part of their jurisdiction from Lands End to John o'Groats would allow a system of this kind to operate, would allow the judicial function to be undermined and would create distrust between the Judiciary and the citizens?  The Judiciary's main authority to penalise or to impose sanction in any country, whether it be in respect of normal criminal offences or any other procedures, derives from the fact that it also acts as a protection for the citizen against the establishment.  But a Government which not only allows but encourages an abomination of this kind shows contempt for each and every person subjected to this awful system and those within that jurisdiction who can be affected by it.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister for Foreign Affairs in what can only be regarded as a very ambiguous approach to this question expressed concern &mdash; of course he did &mdash; and indicated the number of times he had expressed that concern to the British Government.  He then went on to say that he wanted to promote solidarity among the nationalist community of this island, and suggested that we should not rock the boat.  The only implication one can get from that was that the nationalist community, presumably including the SDLP, did not want to rock the boat.  If the Minister is not aware of the fact that the SDLP totally and utterly condemn and repudiate and without any ambiguity <Col N="1758" /> called for the termination of this system, then he is not doing justice to the SDLP. Extracts from his statement suggest that this side of the House, in putting down this motion which is clear and unambiguous, was rocking the solidarity of the nationalist community of this island.  This is an affront to the SDLP who made it very clear that they condemn, reject, repudiate and want to see this awful system terminated.</P>
    <P>I have said the system is an abomination, but there is a risk that we can be tainted by association with this abomination. That is a worry even in terms of our own selfish interests in the Twenty-Six Counties because we have on occasions recently in particular extradited to that jurisdiction people who as yet &mdash; the McGlinchey case in particular &mdash; have not been tried although those found in the commission of the same offence in this jurisdiction engaging in firearms with the Garda, have been tried in our courts. By sending one gentleman to a jurisdiction where this kind of legal abomination not only exists but is acceptable to the British authorities, we have repudiated our fundamental obligations to our citizens, not just to the man on the charge. Our first obligation was to try him for a serious offence committed here.  We are still waiting for evidence to be produced in the Northern court in respect of this case.</P>
    <P>Are the Government not conscious of the fact that by playing footsie with the jurisdiction which tolerates such a legal abomination we run the risk of being tainted by association.  By having midnight hearings of the Supreme Court where the Director of Public Prosecutions was not allowed to bring a prosecution here, we are treading a minefield even in our own jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The implications of this can be far-reaching for all.  There is no case for any kind of noting the damage which is being done to the legal and judicial system in Northern Ireland.  Are we not aware that for so long the legal and judicial system in Northern Ireland has not operated as a normal system for the protection of the citizen?  Yet we are &ldquo;noting the damage.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1759" /> We are talking about fundamental principles.  This is an abomination of any judicial or legal process and if we are not prepared to reject, condemn and call for its termination, we will damage our legal and judicial system which in recent times was prepared to transfer people to that jurisdiction rather than try them in our own jurisdiction where, up to now, we have some degree of respect for the judicial process and what it represents to our citizens.</P>

      <P>It is refreshing to hear in this House from either side, reference to the trauma and the calamity that is happening in part of our country.  I must congratulate the Deputy Leader of Fianna Fáil for saying even at this belated stage that it is time we began talking about the six north-eastern counties rather than Northern Ireland, Ulster or such appendage as we have been hearing in our discussions, debates and Government documents.  We will recall that the phrase &ldquo;Six Counties&rdquo; has been allowed to creep in in the last ten years.  I remember when in Government that if such a phrase were used, it was rejected and corrected.  We are making progress even if we had to go backwards to do so.</P>
      <P>That there should be any need in this or any other democratically elected assembly for debate or disagreement on the condemnation of the supergrass system operated as it is in a corrupt regime in all its aspects &mdash; police, defence forces, courts, the Judiciary and so on.  It is amazing to the outside world.  To us it is just more of the Irishism that emerges in so far as our ambivalent dealings are concerned.  These ambivalent dealings seem to change across the the House as the various parties change Government places.  I say this very deliberately because we have egg on our faces.  We are collaborating, not co-operating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe in the fullest co-operation across the Border while we have it but I totally and utterly condemn, as I have <Col N="1760" /> always done, the kind of collaboration which we have been having for years. When we talk about the supergrass system, Diplock courts and non-jury trials one would think that we were innocent in this respect and that by implication or association we might be contaminated.  We are long since contaminated. What about our Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act which the present Opposition fought tooth and nail when it was brought in by a previous Government? Then when they got into power they were the only party who used it, in the case of Gerry Tuite.  Why was that Act not repealed when they had the opportunity to do so?</P>
    <P>Why are they silent on the Criminal Justice Bill which they have been opposing? I asked if and when &mdash; and it looks as if it is not even if &mdash; they come into Government again are they prepared to repeal that to which they object today? If the answer is yes they would have some credibility and they would put some belief into our people whose whole outlook has been so bedevilled by the contradictions of various political spokesmen, particularly our leadership over the years, that they do not know whether they are coming or going.  The result on polling day is apathy and the apolitical outlook of our younger generation is that the parties are all the same and they are not even coming out to vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed regarding the abomination described by Deputy O'Kennedy but has he forgotten that we have a special court where the opinion of a Garda officer is sufficient to convict without a jury or trial in the real sense of the word? That is why I am saying we are not seen to be honest in our approach and our condemnation by the outside world and particularly by the people in the six north-eastern counties.</P>
      <P>I do not think anybody can refute the reasons for condemning the system which operates in the North.  However, when we play footsie with it we naturally are collaborating and giving it recognition.</P>
      <P>Extradition was mentioned.  There should be no extradition to that corrupt regime because in doing so we are the laughing stock of the world.  We are an inconsistent people who condemn the Border and spend money we have not got in maintaining it for Mrs. Thatcher.  If we changed team captains we could win the match even when it had been lost in London.</P>
      <P>I support the motion merely because it is stronger than the somewhat watered down amendment of the Government.  I can understand why they watered it down.  Usually when the Opposition puts down a popular motion, instead of carrying the original motion the Government wish to carry their version of it and therefore the wording is somewhat different. I will be voting for the motion, although not happily because we are practising what we condemn up there and by our association with it we are recognising the corrupt regime which we are condemning. That is an inconsistency which is destroying the convictions of our friends outside this country who could be helpful in their influence to try to bring this regime to a end.  They look at us and say: &ldquo;In the name of God, what are they talking about since they do something similar themselves they associate with these people and their system and then they expect us to listen to their condemnations of it in the European forum or further afield&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is good to see this House taking note <Col N="1762" /> of these things but let us consider cleaning up our own house and then we can with every justification not only point the finger north-eastwards but also elaborate on it elsewhere and gather the support which is there to condemn this lack of justice, proper courts and proper evidence being adduced.  When we have cleaned up our own house we will be much more effective than we are at present.</P>

      <P>I should like to share my time with Deputy Skelly.  Last night the Minister for Foreign Affairs said that we are not playing an ideological game with the lives and happiness of people.  I hope that this debate will not play ideological games either.  I am weary of banners, flag waving the greener than greens and people claiming to have a greater interest in or commitment to politics for party political purposes.  Lives are savaged, killings go on, civil liberties are eroded, the ordinary courts of justice are removed because of the bitter sectarianism and killing which has gone on.  Yet people feel they can walk around winding banners around themselves and claiming that they are greener than green as if that was the answer to the problem.  I deplore the fact that people's civil liberties have been eroded which has led to both sides of the community, particularly the Nationalist people, who for a long time, perhaps never, had not any real trust or confidence in the police force in Northern Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Nationalist community had no trust or confidence in the army and the security forces.  Then the last bastion &mdash; that people should have a right to redress &mdash; was taken from them. We now see a people who have no structures to support them.  They cannot look to any institutions within their own state. We see the human suffering and the stress that has been caused.  The criminal justice system as it has operated through the supergrass system cannot be relied on and cannot give confidence to the people <Col N="1763" /> there.  It is a travesty of justice and it certainly cannot resolve the conflict which requires a political solution. Rather, it can lead dangerously to a further alienation of an already alienated community.  It has added to the bitterness and to the discrimination that have built up during the years and it will take generations to remove.</P>
      <P>It has led to men being imprisoned on the word of informers, people of very dubious nature.  It has led to the point where 35 or 40 men can be lined up, where the person accusing them does not even have to face them, where they have no redress and very little appeal.  The very element of justice is removed by the sheer numbers.  What does this do to the outside community?  It has left families bitter, bereft and betrayed.  The younger generation are totally disillusioned and they have an absolute rejection of what should be their source of strength and protection within the community.</P>
      <P>The long term consequences cannot be overemphasised.  I appeal to all sides of the House tonight: for God's sake and for the sake of all of Ireland, let us work together in a totally supportive way to bring about enough pressure to remove the supergrass system.  It has left the Nationalist community isolated, alienated and bitter and it has also affected many members of the other community. Above all, let us realise that screaming at one another here does not resolve the problem.  Let all of us use this debate as constructively and positively as possible to bring this matter to the attention of those who govern Northern Ireland, the Six Counties, or whatever term one wishes to use.  Above all, let us not forget the dehumanising process that is taking place while we who are safely in this House have an academic debate about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In his speech the Minister made the following comment:</P>
      <P>The absence of a jury, however, raises particular difficulties, especially when only one judge hears a trial, a jury being the most desirable safeguard when uncorroborated accomplice evidence is presented.</P>
      <P>I do not excuse the supergrass trials.  I do not believe it is just the thin end of the wedge: I think it is the last straw.  I condemn strongly the use of the supergrass trials.  Many sources have been referred to in the past two nights and many examples have been given.  In his speech last night the Minister asked for a measured and responsible view from this House when considering this matter.  I think that has been given by Lord Gifford in his report on supergrasses.  In the chapter entitled &ldquo;conclusions&rdquo;, Lord Gifford stated that the use of supergrass evidence can lead and has led to the telling of lies and to the conviction of the innocent. He said there was a further social harm, namely, the discrediting of the judicial institutions in the eyes of the community. He made the following comment:</P>
      <P>One does not combat terrorism effectively by twisting the course of justice.  I believe that the supergrass trials have already caused a dangerous anger and alienation among a broad section of both Protestant and Catholic populations.</P>
      <P>Lord Gifford also recommended the reestablishment of trial by jury for all indictable offences in Northern Ireland.  He said trial by jury should be restored, possibly with some arrangements to ensure the security and anonymity of jury members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lord Gifford also stated that the conviction of defendants by single judges is not an acceptable means of doing justice and that there should be no further granting of immunity from prosecution to those who have been repeatedly involved in serious terrorist crimes.  He said that the uncorroborated evidence of a supergrass should not be accepted as a valid basis for convicting a defendant in a <Col N="1765" /> non-jury court and that even if there was some such evidence that was worthy of belief he said it is not right that a single fallible judge should be left to determine what it is.  Lord Gifford recommended that prosecutions should not be authorised by the DPP where the only evidence to implicate the accused is that of a supergrass and, if necessary, the Attorney General should intervene to prevent prosecutions based on uncorroborated supergrass evidence.</P>
    <P>As with Mr. Justice Murray in the McCormick case, Lord Gifford stated that when the evidence of a supergrass is uncorroborated they should hold that it is highly dangerous and wrong to convict. He said that in a Diplock court there must, as a matter of law, be corroboration of the evidence of an accomplice.</P>
    <P>I think that is the reasoned response the Minister asked for in this debate.  The question must be asked, once the erosion of civil liberities begins where will it end? I am an unapologetic opponent of sections of the Criminal Justice Bill that recently was passed by this House.  There were questions with regard to removing the right to silence and inferences from remaining silent without the proper checks and balances.  I admit that this form of trial is equivalent to internment without trial but this motion in the name of Fianna Fáil rings hollow when this conservative House was prepared to tolerate recently in the other Bill detention and removal of the right to silence and to place blind trust in police interrogation. How much credence can the people of Northern Ireland place in the concern of this House when little concern was shown for the innocent victims of the new powers in criminal justice legislation?</P>

How could I ignore the frustration of decent people, the anger of innocent people and the justifiable rage of law-abiding citizens?  During our recent debates on the criminal justice legislation the hit and miss system in our District Courts was accepted, where many defendants come along, one after the other&mdash;&mdash;</P>

How can one man dispense justice fairly in such cases?  The difference between our District Court and those cases is that life sentences are involved in the latter.</P>
      <P>The suspension of democracy cannot be tolerated in any form, even if it only for a weekend during the visit of a person from abroad.  The Minister called for the understanding of the Dáil but that was not meant as a defence of the system.  I am sorry to see Fianna Fáil banging the drum and refusing to make it an all-party issue as they were invited to do.

      <P>The fact of the matter is that a reading of this debate shows no disagreement really between the various contributions made by Deputies, irrespective of party, on this matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs was wise in his admonition that the debate should not lend support to the notion that the Northern Ireland legal system would be otherwise worthy of our approval if there were reform of the supergrass system.  As he very wisely said, there is more wrong with the system than simply the supergrass element.  That is only part of the disease, one defect in the system. The legal framework of the emergency criminal process is contained largely in the Northern Ireland Emergency Provisions Act of 1978 and the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act of 1976.  Their operation has been analysed by independent observers, Hillery and Boyd.  In that analysis we can see part of the difficulty of alienation within Northern Ireland felt by so many.  That analysis reveals a series of abuses in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland of which the supergrass system is only one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The central error to which the abuses in the legal system of Northern Ireland owe their origin consists briefly in reliance by the authorities on the criminal process alone, backed by army and police to deal with violence which is essentially <Col N="1768" /> political in nature.  The same abuses chronicled in the seventies by these observers I have mentioned, abuses in interrogation methods and in the courts, continue into the eighties.  The authorities in Northern Ireland rely almost exclusively on the ordinary criminal process, as amended by emergency legislation, to deal with their problems of violence. They ignore essentially the political nature of their problems.</P>
    <P>The use of the emergency arrest procedures means that an individual is dragged into the criminal process without his even knowing what offence he is supposed to have committed.  Considerable pressure can be brought to bear on him to make a confession, not only by virtue of the length of periods for which he can be held.  There is the oppressive interrogation itself and there are the practices permitted by these actual processes of the emergency legislation.  The overall effect is to bring the whole criminal process into disrepute, not least among those sections of the population most affected.</P>
    <P>In isolating this aspect of the abuses of legal process in Northern Ireland we should not overlook the fact that the paramilitaries wage a dirty war in Northern Ireland in which civilians are the victims and the only legacy of that dirty war of the paramilitaries will be a second partition &mdash; is, in fact, a second partition erected between Nationalists and Unionists within Northern Ireland.  Emergency powers backed up by the army and police will not ameliorate the sickness in that society, nor can the courts on their own solve the fundamental alienation which divides that society.  Nonetheless, the authorities continue to place their trust in security, and the courts and the legal process are depended upon to deal with the problems thrown up by the political divisions within Northern Ireland, the essential alientation that tears that community apart.  Instead, amelioration of the Northern Ireland problem requires decisive intervention of the power claiming to exercise sovereignty within Northern Ireland, that is the United Kingdom under present circumstances.</P>
    <P>Now, the use of supergrass evidence <Col N="1769" /> has meant in many cases that, despite the absence of corroboration, conviction has followed on the evidence of a person who in many instances is a convicted felon. Yet the courts in their findings have often given such witnesses the status of witnesses of credit, notwithstanding the warning that must always accompany the reception of evidence of such character. In fact, the courts appear to repose trust in the evidence of those with truly dreadful criminal records.  Greater trust appears to be reposed in such witnesses than in the accused person against whom, in the normal rule, there must be a presumption of innocence that should apply until conviction.  Greater trust appears to be reposed in people already convicted of the most heinous of offences.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out by those who examined it that such witnesses coming from the supergrass accomplice system have every incentive to co-operate with the prosecuting authorities.  It may be and have been said that they have been given no money, although doubts remain in relation to that.  Their early release prospects, their parole conditions must conduce them to co-operate with the prosecuting authorities.  There is every incentive to co-operate, even at the expense of truth.</P>
    <P>Although it may be denied there is more than a suspicion that payment of money and deals have been made.  In regard to any conviction secured by such means and from such sources, suspicions must remain.  After all, it has been a feature of the system that lifelong settlement arrangements, identity changes, resettlement of entire families have been arranged.  The result has been that the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom might not believe in the existence of alienation within Northern Ireland but it is a matter of strict experience that the results have been, that such abuses as we are discussing tonight, undermine that confidence in the administration of justice within Northern Ireland if any such confidence remains.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the use of the supergrass system is justified in that it is an effective way of putting terrorists <Col N="1770" /> behind bars and of providing information for the security forces.  In my view that is a shortsighted view of the matter and gives a very temporary advantage indeed to the authorities became these security priorities militate against the wider political imperative of ending the alienation that afflicts Northern Ireland in so far, at any rate as Nationalists are concerned, and from what one can gather it may be an affliction that the Loyalist population increasingly experience.</P>
    <P>The reliance on emergency measures by the security forces and on these methods means that while one may obtain information and military advantage in the short term it constantly militates against the search for the necessary political solution.  In any case, the evidence of alleged accomplice informers must be notoriously unreliable.  Having said all that one may say against it, a doubt remains: how may one expect truth from sources such as these?  Whatever the short term gain certainly these measures provide grounds for future violence &mdash; and what assistance they must give to paramilitaries of all kinds to be able to point to the courts participating in such practices.</P>
    <P>If the suspicion cannot be banished that the security authorities may use blackmail and every personal and domestic reason to gain the information, what respect can be had for convictions made in such circumstances?  It discredits further the entire system of justice among those affected.</P>
    <P>There is a big temptation at all times to look for the short term military security advantage at the expense of the necessary political search for a solution.  If it is our conclusion, as I believe it is, that the view of the Parliament is that the administration of justice within Northern Ireland does not enjoy the confidence of this House as to its impartiality it follows that the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act 1976, which permits the trying of offences committed outside our jurisdiction within our jurisdiction and permits evidence of such offences to be given, should be utilised here rather than to accede to extradition <Col N="1771" /> processes for offences committed within Northern Ireland.  That is the conclusion I come to based on the view of this Parliament of the state of justice within Northern Ireland, as reflected in this debate.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to our Special Criminal Court but the normal rules of evidence apply there.  We would be rash, in the course of the debate, to pretend that there have not been certain inroads on our freedoms as a result of activities of paramilitaries because they have occurred on this side of the Border even if their origins lie on the other side. Thankfully they are not substantive. There is no comparison between the Special Criminal Court system under which three judges operate with normal rules of evidence obtaining and in relation to the Diplock court system operating in Northern Ireland.  I recognise the difficulty of returning to the jury practice within so severely polarised a society as Northern Ireland but all this difficulty goes to prove our case that Northern Ireland is a maimed society and that the UK Government, which is outside the ambit of this debate, are pursuing the wrong course in depending solely on the Northern Ireland judicial system to cope with political problems.</P>
    <P>It is opportune that the House is speaking as with one voice on the main matter before us which is condemnation of the supergrass system in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>My colleague, Deputy Fitzgerald, has called my attention to a quotation from Pastor Niemoller of Germany who was jailed by the Nazis.  He said:</P>
      <P>They first came for the communists; I did not speak because I was not a communist.  Then they came for the Jews; I did not speak because I was not a Jew.  Then they came to fetch the workers, members of trade unions; I did not speak because I was not a trade unionist.  Afterwards, they came for the Catholics; I did not say anything because I was a Protestant.  Eventually they came for me, and there was no one left to speak ...</P>
      <P>In putting down this motion Fianna Fáil are providing an opportunity that we badly needed to speak on the problem in the Six Counties.  I agree with the approach that this should not be party political.  I must attack a central thesis in the speech of the Minister for Foreign Affairs but not on party political lines.  I agree with a good deal of what the Minister for Foreign Affairs said on this matter on numerous occasions, notably in a speech some time ago in Limerick and in another speech in Drogheda.  However, I cannot accept the thesis in his speech last night and from what Deputy O'Leary said he does not accept it either.  The Minister said that the considerations concerning the lives and safety of innocent people:</P>
      <P>are among the reasons why I cannot agree that the system can be condemned absolutely without qualification and why I am asking all sides to support our amendment rather than the original resolution.</P>
      <P>He went on to speak about witnesses being intimidated and being afraid to come forward because of the savageries inflicted, judges attacked and relations murdered.  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In such circumstances is it any <Col N="1773" /> wonder that resort is had to evidence of this nature?</P>
    <P>I call the attention of the House to the philosophy outlined there.  Deputy O'Leary has just condemned the approach that the end justifies the means. Dáil Éireann should indicate strongly by its vote that we do not believe that the end justifies the means.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>If the use of accomplice evidence serves to put these sectarian murderers behind bars and helps to allay the fears of the innocent, is there anyone in the Dáil who would object?</P>
    <P>We are objecting to the method of convicting people because we are not convinced that the people who are convicted are guilty and because they have been stripped of all the protection that the law has developed for such people over many generations.</P>
    <P>The Minister said innocent Protestant people were also being terrified, attacked and murdered.  He said:</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the Members of Dáil Éireann, for all our serious concern about supergrass trials, would oppose their use in bringing to justice the murderers of the innocent who died in the infamous slaughter which took place in Darkley...</P>
    <P>What the House is concerned with is that when persons are arraigned they should get a fair and just trial.  That is the substance of our motion before the House. It does not matter if paramilitaries act unjustly and murder people; their wrong does not make a wrong on the side of the administration in the Six Counties right and never will.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that if the murderers are brought to justice that justifies the method by which that is done.  I am calling on the House, appealing to the Government side, to the members of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties to see the basic philosophical problem and to reject the idea that if you have an end to achieve you can use any means irrespective&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have had in this House already &mdash; I am not going to go over it again &mdash; an outline of the no jury, one judge, Diplock courts.  At least here we have &mdash; not the most desirable system &mdash; three judges, and, as Deputy O'Leary said, the laws of evidence apply.  I do not know why there are a couple of judges in the Six Counties who have never been called upon to preside at those trials.  I do not know whether they would be able to put up enough judges, three to a court, to utilise in these cases.  That pool of judges, made up mainly of ex-Unionist MPs and Attorneys General, would be suspected of being polluted from the word go.  We know that torture was tried before the supergrass phase.  We know that this House and an Irish Government played a role in having that kind of torture and the activities of the UK Government condemned.  Speakers have referred to the erosion of what lawyers call the due process of law, and we know that suspects can be held for seven days. confessions made under threat have been admitted as evidence in the courts.  We <Col N="1775" /> know, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs referred to it last night, that bail is a thing of the past and that somebody who is merely a suspect may be five years in jail before he is brought to trial.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I do not think the word &ldquo;condemn&rdquo; is too strong to put before Dáil Éireann tonight in our motion before the House.  In the amendment in the name of the Minister the UK and British Government are not mentioned at all.  It is as well to sew into the record of this House that the UK Government have a responsibility, that the Attorney General is the man who consults with and directs the Director of Public Prosecutions in the North, that the Attorney General is appointed by the British Government, that he is a political appointee and that, consequently, the British Government cannot shy off from responsibility in this matter.  That is why the wording in our resolution is very important.  Anyone who likes can read it; I am not going to take up time, I am not going to be diverted to reading that resolution out now.  There is no mention of the British Government in the amendment. The responsibility is there and in the end the crunch question is, where does the responsibility lie?  I am putting it to this House that the responsibility lies with the British Government and that there is an obligation on this House to bring to their attention that they are responsible for the activities in their courts in the Six Counties.</P>
      <P>We know that these people are taken in.  I was on the telephone to Belfast this afternoon.  We know what is done with them.  Where does this Judas money come from?  Surely the British Government if they are providing that money for the supergrass witnesses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>We have complained that there is not preliminary inquiry, that bills of indictment are granted very easily. Are the political philosophers of whom Britain boasts going to be co-adjuced in these cases?  Are their philosophers, their jurists, their international jurists, or their religious leaders to be co-adjuced?  We know that the supergrass people with their wallets bursting with pieces of silver are now making a charade of British justice.  The motives of the supergrass people are supposed to be anxiety to get out of prison.  What about the silver that I have mentioned?  There is a strong belief now among the people on the scene in Belfast that an element of Palovian conditions is going on.  They are kept apart from their families.  They are asked not to make contact with any of their former friends.  Where they come into court they have their story so well rehearsed that they dot every i and cross every t, and this in itself is a subject of some suspicion. Gifford said in one of his Cogdon Trust lectures that it was quite evident that many of the supergrasses had their story very well rehearsed.  Cogdon is not a bad name to invoke in that context; when somebody of that stature says that we know damn well that the people have been conditioned.  How successfully they have been psychologically conditioned I do not know, but it is obvious to everybody that they have been conditioned.  Even when they are being brought into court, when Jack is in the box, he is not allowed to be seen by the prisoners.  He has not to face them or look at them, and, of course there is a huge battalion of policemen all around the court intimidating the witness who has already been conditioned, and intimidating the prisoners also &mdash; there is no change there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we bring to the attention of the British Government that they are shaming themselves in the eyes of the world.  We should encourage international jurists to come to the courts and see what is going on.  In fairness to the British Government, they have always been anxious to look well before the world, and if we find that a weakness in <Col N="1777" /> them then we should encourage international jurists from whatever country to come and watch what is going on, to see this travesty of justice for which they are responsible.  That is my main theme.</P>
    <P>One of the stupidities of the whole system is that, God save the mark, the judge has to warn himself.  The House will not believe this.  The judges are warning themselves that uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice is dangerous to convict on.  As solemn as owls they sit on the benches and warn themselves that this is a danger.  That will give an idea to the House of the degree of farce involved in these trials which take place in our country in the six north-eastern counties.</P>
    <P>I will make one more point before I sit down.  The judge is believing the supergrasses even though people like Desmond Boal are exposing them every day, but they are not believing solid witnesses, as many as 40, providing an alibi when a young man is accused of walking around south Tyrone with a landmine in his waistcost pocket sometime between 1 <Col N="1778" /> January in a given year and 31 December in the same year.  Legal people who are fed up with the whole business have pulled out of many of these cases.  They are in a dilemma.  Some who have pulled out have gone back in again, believing that they might be able to do more good by staying in.  They know the rules of the farce by now and they think that if they stay in they will be able either to benefit law and justice or benefit some of the defendants.</P>
    <P>I conclude by asking the House &mdash; I do not want to make a party political issue of this &mdash; and appealing to the Government, in order to be able to call on the British Government, to withdraw the amendment and agree our original motion before the House.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West)</i>: I move amendment No 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 20, after &ldquo;State&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or imported into the State&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The thinking behind our amendment is that potatoes imported into this State should be subjected to the same inspection, the same grading and packing regulations as will be introduced by the Minister under the provisions of this Bill for our own produce.  On a later section we shall be moving another amendment concerning the state of origin of such potatoes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>While I can <Col N="1785" /> see much merit in the Deputy's amendment it poses problems for us in that we could not provide that growers and packers in other countries would be registered. Therefore a problem arises there.</P>
      <P>In an effort to meet the Deputies point I should say that imported potatoes from whatever source or State must meet our grading standards.  Certainly they would have to comply with the same grading standards as Irish potatoes. Suppose such imported potatoes emanated from Holland or some other country, if such imported potatoes are put on offer here as imported potatoes then we can actually go after the supermarket or store where they are on offer.  I am sorry that we could not see our way to including this amendment.  My advice is that it cannot be included in the provisions.  In a subsequent amendment I may be able to meet the Deputy's point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Would the Minister consider even in cases of potatoes not subject to the regulations that such regulations would be applicable to the packers?  Surely the Minister could accept an amended portion of this amendment in so far as it refers to packers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, yes, that is part of the provisions of the Bill anyway.  If an Irish packer decides to pack imported potatoes and if, for instance, they are imported in bulk from the North of Ireland &mdash; I presume that is the sort of thing the Deputy has in mind &mdash; then the packer in question must be registered and the same packer could be taking potatoes from an Irish farm.  In that case it will be the packer who will be held responsible for the quality of the product.  That point is taken care of in the Bill.  Where imported potatoes are packed in Ireland it is the packer who is held responsible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may be under the impression that the amendment refers to potatoes coming on to the market here from Northern Ireland but potatoes are also coming in through our own ports from such places as Cyprus and we are not entirely satisfied that the Bill will cover that type of importation.  Can the Minister not agree to consider this amendment for a later stage?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to dwell on importations from Northern Ireland which are creating problems.  He tells us that this problem can be resolved because when the potatoes are being packed here there will be an obligation to register.  What happens when potatoes which have been packed outside the State arrive on supermarket shelves:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>These potatoes arrive through a limited number of ports.  We keep a close watch on the ports for many reasons.  When they arrive packed it is easy to monitor quality control.  Invariably they are in super quality.  This is a point we must accept.  We have very little to complain about.  For the sake of argument, if potatoes arrive in poor quality on a supermarket shelf then the owner of the supermarket will come under the terms of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that 60,000 tonnes of subsidised potatoes have been withdrawn from the Northern Ireland market, where a floor price is given?  I am led to believe that a considerable amount of those subsidised dyed potatoes are already finding their way into markets here.  Any price they obtain is a bonus because they have already received a subsidised price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy made that point yesterday.  If they are pulling the wool over the eyes of the Northern Ireland Ministry by covering the vehicle I find that strange, but if it is happening that is it.  The potatoes must be packed somewhere and if the packer does not come up to the mark he will be dealt with under the terms of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The potatoes are up to the mark but they have already been withdrawn from the Northern Ireland market.  They are dyed, regraded and then find their way here.  That is one of the reasons why we have asked the Minister to consider all imports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The person who handles the potatoes referred to by Deputy Gallagher would be easily identified because he would have dye on his hands. Potatoes imported supposedly for animal feed are later sold on the market here and are causing a serious problem.  There should be restrictions on imports just as our potatoes are subject to restrictions by our marketing board.  The country of origin will be on the potato bags.  We should impose restrictions as to quality and size on all imports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important amendment and I appeal to the Minister to give it due consideration.  If we are to subject producers and those involved in the sale of potatoes to strenuous rules and permit an anomaly in regard to imports there is little point in bringing the Bill before the House.  We must ensure that the same regulations apply to imports and home produced potatoes.</P>

      <P>The rules may govern imports and home produced potatoes but if they are not applied the home market <Col N="1788" /> may be undermined.  We must protect home producers.  We must ensure that the same rules apply across the board. Imported potatoes must be clearly identified. We must do all possible to preserve and improve the home market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the legislation is intended as a beginning to regularise the potato industry here.  Potato imports sold on the Irish market cannot be disregarded. Any legislation must take into consideration the fact that potatoes are being imported from Cyprus and other countries.  At certain times of the year those imports seriously distort the home market and that has shattered the confidence of producers.  Unless the legislation reflects a desire to bring regularity to the industry by dealing with imports it will be useless.</P>

Bearing in mind that the potatoes are foreign grown and packed on whom may we visit the penalties that are rightly in the legislation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">

      <P>Potatoes are imported through licensed merchants and in 95 per cent of cases they are packers.  In that event they are registered.  If they are not packers they will have to display their name on the sacks.  Potatoes sold through retail outlets, whether imported or native, will have to carry the name of the wholesaler.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not too sure that that is the case but my point is relevant on the section.  Are we to take it that the act of importing is tantamount to producing, that the registration regulations to be laid <Col N="1789" /> down will apply to importation as if they were leaving a home farm or packing station?  Does it follow that there is no way we can reach out and penalise foreign growers, put them out of business and stop them sending their produce here rather than saying that the importer must carry the baby?  What action will the Minister take if there is, as there has been for a long time, heavy imports from the Netherlands where farmers, growers and packers have been heavily supported by various grants and aids to preserve potatoes in an almost new state for between six and nine months before flooding our market at a time when our own produce are about to be made available?  In fact, those potatoes are truly being dumped, but to prove that is the problem.  Those people get grants for storage and refrigeration to keep potatoes in good condition so that when they are released in March they are in the same condition as they were the previous September.  The cost of energy used for this refrigeration for horticulture producers is charged at a lower rate than applies generally in the Netherlands.  It amounts to a subsidy and I should like to know if there is any way the Minister for Agriculture &mdash; I would rather it was he than any other Minister &mdash; can use the legislation before us to stop the import of potatoes from the Netherlands or any other country that tries the same game?  Those countries are subsidising their farmers in a round about way while our producers suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to third country imports, such as those from Cyprus, they are only allowed in under licence.  With regard to the Netherlands, the effort we are now making started precisely because of the point Deputy Blaney made.  In the winter of 1982-83 farmers in their anger dumped Dutch potatoes into the sea.  We endeavoured to put that situation right.  I do not have to tell the Deputy about the difficulties of being a member of the Community because he knows more about that than I do.  We are in the Common Market. The extraordinary thing about the Dutch potatoes was that they were not cheap, <Col N="1790" /> but they were so beautifully packed and presented that those of us who worked on this legislation felt that there was only one way to cope with the Dutch and that was to beat them at their own game and to present our potatoes in an identical manner, which we are now doing.  At present all our supermarkets in Dublin are presenting superb Irish potatoes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is unfortunate particularly if you come from my area because this market has been a scandal over the years.  Many people have been ruined and more people will be ruined this year and for as long as we are importing potatoes.  Four years ago an EC directive required potatoes to be graded but damn all was done about it.  The Dutch did something about it.  They have refrigerated stores where they keep their potatoes in very good condition and they are brought here to compete with our new crop.  I believe there should be a ban on imports at that time of the year because of the skulduggery that has been going on.</P>
      <P>I remember when we supplied the Dutch with seed potatoes but now they have beaten us at our game.  Our best customer for seed was the Netherlands. My county exported 40,000 tons at one time, but now we are lucky if we export 10,000 tons at a price even approaching what we got ten, 15 or 20 years ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two types of imported potatoes.  The first are the loose potatoes coming across the Border.  They are packaged here and that is covered by the regulations because the person packaging is registered and he will be responsible.  Secondly, there are the potatoes which are imported by well known merchants.  These potatoes are already packaged and will carry the merchant's name and address so that they can be traced and the merchants or the supermarkets can be penalised if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. Our growers have lost a lot of confidence <Col N="1792" /> in various Governments down the years because EC regulations were not enforced. Perhaps the Minister could tell us why these directives were not enforced. The conditions the producers were looking for over the years should have been implemented.  As Deputy Blaney said, I cannot understand why when the regulations were already there action was not taken to protect the small producers.  In my county the smaller farmers grow potatoes and medium size farmers grow potatoes to supplement their dairy and beef income.  Why are there not quality guidelines for imported potatoes?  As all speakers on this side of the House said, it is important that the same regulations apply to imported potatoes as apply to Irish potatoes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I see what Deputy Noonan and his colleagues are getting at but what they are saying is not logically possible.  The definition of potato in this legislation allows the Minister to exercise controls under section 2 and if they are not obeyed, somebody can be in breach of section 3.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Ultimately if they do not comply with that they can be liable to a criminal offence.

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The point the Minister is making is that the controls are exercised when potatoes are imported.  Are the Deputies suggesting that every potato grower in Europe should register with our Department of Agriculture in case they export potatoes to Ireland?  I do not see the logic of that nor can I see how that law is enforceable.  If they want to make this State the laughing stock of Europe, proceed with that type of proposal.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister has treated the Opposition Deputies very lightly.  The case being made is that we are trying to put controls on the Irish grower which will not apply to imported potato growers. There will be controls on the importation of potatoes, but how can the Opposition expect us to control potato growers in Holland or anywhere else in Europe or outside the EC?  I do not see the logic in this argument.  The Minister deserves the applause of this House for the control he is showing in dealing with this argument because there is no logic in the proposals being made by Deputies opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Applied as the Deputy said this would be ludicrous, but do not forget we have experience in the reverse direction because we have exported seed potatoes over the years, this year included.  Through seed exports over the years, including this year, representatives of the State to which they are being consigned visit our ports of export before the consignment leaves and they reject or accept them before they leave the port. There are regulations in force which we know a lot about because we are affected by them.  We can have potatoes inspected two or three times during their growing period.  We can also have them inspected in the stores of the farmers or merchants and, if they are given the OK, they go to the port where they are to be loaded and shipped.  There will be a representative inspector from the country to which they are being consigned who can reject the potatoes.  We could also do this and at least it would have a slowing down effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you produce a main crop of potatoes <Col N="1794" /> and allow them to grow to their full size, you will have a much bigger yield and the cost per tonne to the grower is very much less, if you are aided by the Government to preserve them in their newly dug state until the market begins to rise when our own potatoes are coming to an end.  If they compete with our own new potatoes, clearly the new potato crop has not got a hope because the other potatoes are more mature, more uniform in size than our own potatoes and have a better appearance. The housewife goes into the supermarket or greengrocer and, although the quality may not be what she is used to, it is better than the early ones.  The price does not matter at that stage.  We are doing nothing about this and perhaps the Minister could assure us that there will be assistance to our growers and packers to do the same as they are doing in other countries which is wrecking our markets with financial assistance from their Governments and subsidised energy to store their potatoes in a way that turns them out six months later the same as they went in.  If we had that system we could compete equally but at present there is not a hope of doing this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that Deputy Shatter has not an association with farming or potatoes.  We are asking for the same regulations for our ware potatoes which are being exported from Derry.  They have to be packed and assembled for size and there must be no mechanical damage.  There are very rigid regulations and potatoes are being exported year in year out.  Large potatoes such as King Edward, Arran Banners and the seed selected for the Canary Islands and Spain go to other countries also.  The bags must be branded with the country of origin, the grower's certified seed number and there is also a very rigid examination at the ports.  Inspectors from Israel come over to Derry every year. They empty the bags of potatoes, scrape the skins with a penknife to see if there is any sign of blight or other disease.  We want rigid control on imports also.</P>

I am anxious to know what the Minister of State is going to do about this.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects in section 1 which concern me.  I cannot see why in the context of package we have to define a package not merely as a bag, box, carton or container but as an envelope. Who in the Department of Agriculture envisages people sending potatoes in envelopes?  Is it suggested that An Post might have a new method of raising funds by posting potatoes around the country? I have done research on this aspect of the legislation and I will not detain the House too long.  I went through the Potato (Maximum Prices) Order, 1947, the Agricultural Produce Potatoes Act, 1931, and all the way back to the Potato Root Eel Worm Order, 1951.  Nobody in their wisdom defined the packaging of potatoes as including putting potatoes in envelopes and I do not know what encouraged the parliamentary draftsman to include this phraseology in this section. It is the type of thing that makes us look <Col N="1796" /> slightly ridiculous.  I defer to the Deputies opposite: maybe I am not as expert on potatoes as some of them but perhaps they can reveal the mysteries of the function of the envelope in the sale of potatoes. Perhaps the Minister can reveal the mysterious aspect of envelopes.  Is an envelope a euphemism for what you put potato crisps in?  I do not know but I do not see the logic in it.  I suggest in all seriousness that the concept of packaging potatoes in envelopes should be deleted from the Bill.  Is this a newfangled marketing concept to outsell the Dutch?  If so, I do not think it will take off.</P>
      <P>I want to make a point about the definition of potatoes which might sound funny but this legislation is a serious attempt to deal with the problem.  The definition of &ldquo;potato&rdquo; is central to the capacity of this legislation to operate properly and is central to the powers available to the Minister in the event of people not complying with the regulations.  The definition of a potato appears to be unique.  The potato crop is something that is close to the hearts of everyone in this country but it is peculiar that we are not able to define the potato in a way that would make sense to anyone outside this House.  A potato is said to mean a potato grown in the State, not intended for planting.  Is it the potato or the person holding the potato that has to have the intention?</P>

      <P>I will conclude in one <Col N="1797" /> minute.  Perhaps the Minister could tell me why we have not adopted the definitions contained in previous Acts and regulations to which I have referred?  All of these define potatoes as being either seed potatoes or potatoes that are not seed potatoes.  I make a prediction that if a prosecution is commenced on the basis of this legislation with potatoes defined as they are defined it will not succeed.  It may seem an odd point and it may be one the Deputies will laugh at in what they regard as a serious debate but I think we have got it wrong.  We are adopting a definition that will render this legislation extremely difficult to enforce if we try to enforce it.  I should like some clarification from the Minister.  I should have thought the Deputies opposite would have looked at earlier legislation and have suggested a different modification to the definition of potato rather than just dealing with the point they made regarding exports.  The point I have made is serious and is central to the operation of the Bill.</P>

There is plenty of justification for that on the basis that the bigger packers who buy from our small farmers, each of whom will have to pay the registration fee, will be substituting for imported potatoes grown by people in other States who have not paid any registration fee to anybody. An advantage is thereby given to the imported product.</P>

      <P>On section 2, I would ask the Minister to elaborate more on the fee of £15 and if he would confirm that this will be a once off fee and not a yearly one.  Secondly, what provision is there for the small farmer who does not actually sell his potatoes, but barters them because he would not have sufficient money to purchase provisions for his family?  Would the Minister consider him a grower and would he be selling potatoes?  I contend that that person should be omitted from that category in this Bill.  There are many such people in rural areas who barter their potatoes for other provisions from the small shopkeepers. Could the Minister make certain provisions for those people?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a feeling in the potato industry on this matter of the fee, that whether it is going to be annual or not is not very clearly spelt out in this Bill.  As I said on Second Stage debate last night, about 75 per cent of the producers here will grow under one acre per year.  Could I suggest that the Minister would consider the possibility of the fee being related to the acreage of potatoes grown rather than the fee being demanded for each producer?  The feeling is that the fees, of whatever amount might be collected, are intended by the Minister merely to cover the registration costs.  Will the fees provide financial help for the promotion and marketing so sorely needed for potato products? Would the Minister consider that possibility and in his response to the requests by Deputy Gallagher and myself, consider the possibility of relating the annual fee, if it is to be annual, to the area of potatoes grown by each producer in question?</P>

      <P>Much time was spent on <Col N="1804" /> this matter.  I must say I favoured that system originally, but we ended up with an across the board fee of £15.  It is not possible for me to say that it will be a once-off fee.  People will be registering all the time.  The only point that I am making is that the purpose of the money is to open the register and keep it.  It is a non-profit making operation.  It has been costed carefully.  Deputy Gallagher raised a difficult question and dealt with whether one could call giving a few bags of potatoes in return for groceries selling. I am prepared to look at that.</P>

      <P>There seems to be some difficulty about accepting this amendment.  We have already spoken about imported potatoes coming into the State.  Surely this is a simple amendment asking for clear identification of the country of origin to be put on each pack of potatoes offered for sale.  That should not have anything to do with the Food Standards Act, which has to do with hygiene and so on.  We cannot be subservient to the EC.  We must preserve our own <Col N="1808" /> identity.  We must ensure our products get fair and equal treatment.  If we can bring in an amendment which ensures that, there is no reason why it cannot be enshrined in legislation.  It is vital that the Minister accepts this to preserve people in business and to give a clear identify to the housewife or consumer in the market place <i>vis-à-vis</i> the product they are purchasing whether it is home or foreign produced.  Therefore we appeal to him to accept this amendment.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> In support of what Deputy Treacy has stated, surely we are identifying the produce of our own growers by way of number, and I ask the Minister to accept my other amendments regarding the name of the grower and producer.  Surely it is only fair that the country of origin of the imported potato should be identifiable on the bag to enable the consumer to make up his or her mind.</P>

If this breaks some EC rule, then the other people are breaking it, but I do not think they are.

      <P>At this late hour the Minister of State might accept both amendments.  He has not accepted any amendments from this side of the House yet.  All we are saying in these amendments is that in addition to the registration numbers of the grower and packer their names should be on the bag.</P>

      <P>We spent a long time on this one.  There was a request from the growers' representatives that we would not insist on the names being included in the information on the bags.  There are a number of reasons for this.  One big problem in that regard would be a number of people in the same locality bearing the same name.  We considered that the registration number would be sufficient.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The feedback I get from the growers in my area is different.  They consider that in order to bring some sense of regulation and sanity into the industry it would be necessary to include on the bag details of the name and address of the grower as well as the registration number.  Promotion of products in the names of growers will be an integral part of the promotion of potatoes if we are to have a grip on the area of import substitution that was identified by the Minister in his opening address.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I am asking the Minister to consider the amendment seriously.  I do not see any great difficulty about the practical operation of what is being sought.  In many ways this information would enhance the appearance of the bag, not to mention the convenience of being able to readily trace the origin of the potatoes.  The would establish in the consumer's mind a contact with the producer.</P>

      <P>A question that is most important in terms of trying to retrieve the loss we have suffered on the home market is whether such details as the variety, the size and the starch content of the potatoes are to be included on the pack.  Our loss on the home market has resulted from the deplorable condition in which potatoes have been packed and sold down through the years.  Are we now to have grading, for instance, grades one, two or three, noted on the pack?  We must have some such information so that the housewife will know what she is buying.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it possible to have quality control as well as variety control?  I ask the question because as we all know it is possible to find bad potatoes among those with one of the best names and good ones among those that have a bad name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition of &ldquo;variety&rdquo; in this context varies as between one country and another.  Strangely, potatoes which in the past might have been considered inferior by the housewife are now in demand.  A variety such as Pentland Del, for instance, would not have been considered some years ago as suitable for the table but they are now popular.  In other words, tastes are changing in that regard.  Whether for better or worse, what seems to count for quality now is what the housewife decides and she will be influenced by the appearance of the produce.  We must cater for that.</P>

      <P>I will be giving some of my time to Deputy McGahon and I believe the Minister will oblige by giving Deputy McGahon some of his time.  Due to the seriousness of the problems in Dundalk Deputy McGahon wishes to support me in urging the Minister to take urgently needed measures to come to terms with the problems.  It is with great sadness that I have put down this motion at this hour of the night but the seriousness of the problem is so great that I was forced to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dundalk as the largest provincial town in Ireland was a prosperous and bustling town.  Plentiful employment was available <Col N="1818" /> to the skilled workforce of Dundalk and its environs.  Dundalk as an industrial centre was the mecca for people from miles around seeking employment. Unfortunately employment opportunities have been drastically reduced.  Closures, redundancies and so on have become the order of the day.  At one time ECCO, the electronics firm, employed 1,800 people.  That figure has now been cut to 400.  The impact of the reduction is horrific.  A spectre of lifetime unemployment confronts many people who have lost their jobs.  Today there is a huge problem where people who had steady employment now find themselves unemployed and unable to meet mortgage commitments and so on.  The ECCO electronics firm gave great employment in the town and employed people from a great catchment area surrounding the town.  The shattering news that 260 employees would be let go between now and next March was a body blow to the industrial base of the town.</P>
    <P>In the past 15 months the two principal footwear manufacturers in the town have either closed or let many of their workforce go.  Because of the long tradition of footwear manufacture in the town the skills needed for the footwear industry are readily available to any industrialist who wishes to set up business in Dundalk. Because of the difficulties that exist at this time in many ways because of the approach of the Government to unemployment and to the maintenance of industrial bases in towns such as Dundalk which have been the backbone of our industrial set up here these industries are not getting the support necessary to see them through.  The skills that have developed over the years will be lost because people will have to move to other areas to find employment and might even have to emigrate.  It is criminal to allow those industries to fade out, so that the incentive for new manufacturers to set up in Dundalk will disappear.  There are other places like CRB where there has been a gradual reduction in the numbers employed.  That is the scenario that stares the town of Dundalk in the face.</P>
    <P>There has been a tremendous growth <Col N="1819" /> in the population of the town and in the catchment area.  We have been fortunate that the educational institutions and other facilities in Dundalk have attracted families to come to work and live there. They have become totally disillusioned. There is now the spectre of many well educated girls and boys in whose education there has been a huge investment by parents and the State and who cannot now find any employment outlets.  It paints a very bleak picture.  The commercial and trading activity of the area has declined very sharply in recent years.  It could be said that it is at present slumbering from the ether of the financial rectitude being pursued by the present Government.  Industrial development is at a standstill.  There is industrial stagnation. In the fine industrial estate at Coe's Road there are now many vacant premises which had been provided by the IDA and other agencies involved in industrial promotion, which buildings had been constructed for the forward planning programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I am calling on the Minister of State present to declare Dundalk a disadvantaged area for industrial promotion purposes.  The progressive decline in employment in the town inevitably imposes on the Minister responsibility to recognise the seriousness of the situation, taking the urgent measures necessary to get it back on to an even keel on the road to prosperity once more.</P>
      <P>It had been hoped that the natural gas pipeline would pass through Dundalk which, in its own way, would constitute an added dimension to the agencies involved in industrial promotion there.  Unfortunately, because of the breakdown of that agreement with regard to its extension to Belfast, the Government are reluctant to recognise the necessity for its extension even to Dundalk, thereby giving the IDA and other agencies an added dimension in attracting industries to the town.</P>
      <P>A programme of small industries for the town is of urgent necessity.  In the past we have been grateful to the larger manufacturers who have established themselves in the town and who absorbed the plentiful workforce on the ground. But, if we are to progress and restore stability to the town's industrial base, we shall have to think in terms of the establishment of small industries there.  There must be an outlet for service-type industries in places like Dundalk given the fact that there is sited there the regional college with its expertise percolating through the educational system.</P>
      <P>In response to what I have had to say this evening I hope the Minister will be able to tell us that he is prepared to make available higher percentage grants to attract industry to the town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a difficult situation obtaining in regard to the water supply to the town.  Indeed it has been contended that <Col N="1821" /> the IDA may even have had to turn away industries seeking large quantities of water, water-intensive industries, simply because an adequate supply was not available.  Present indications are that Dundalk Urban Council have reached an agreement over the crux that has obtained for so long with regard to the town's water supply.  It is a question of the Department of the Environment providing the necessary finance to finance or get a proper water scheme under way. In this connection I hope the Minister present will use his influence on his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, in order to get this matter moving.  The industrial promotion programme of the town has been affected through its water scarcity.</P>
    <P>The infrastructural development projects have passed their planning stage, having now reached the point of financing. I earnestly hope the Government will recognise that it is opportune and advantageous to provide such finance. Stage two of the inner relief road is ready to be initiated, with stages three or four in the pipeline.  I hope the Government will devote the necessary urgent attention to their implementation and financing.</P>
    <P>There is then the Customs complex to be built on the Border at Carrickarnon. If all of these types of capital projects were got under way they would provide much needed impetus to local industry.</P>
    <P>I could not allow this opportunity to pass without referring to the level of taxation and its general crippling effects. Many redundancies have been caused by the very high level of taxation and value added tax.  I hope the Minister for Finance, in his forthcoming budget, will implement the necessary steps to reduce those levels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank my colleague, Deputy Kirk, for having allowed me speak, demonstrating the measure of concern we feel for our native towns.  I concur in much of what he had to say.  I would describe Dundalk as a disaster area.  No other words could adequately describe the scene of deprivation and devastation that is the town of <Col N="1822" /> Dundalk, the largest town in Ireland of 27,000 inhabitants.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kirk suggested that this disaster was in some way the fault of the present Government.  I refute that allegation. I would suggest to Deputy Kirk that the present situation has been 15 years a-growing, that no other town in Ireland has suffered as grievously from the Northern troubles as has Dundalk, with no compensatory measures having been taken by any Government.  In the early seventies Fianna Fáil were represented there by three Deputies in the county who failed to recognise the problem developing which has now reached nightmare proportions for its business people. I find it difficult to confine my remarks to the footwear and electronics industries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Dundalk has suffered devastating blows in recent years in the employment sector, commencing in 1978 when McArdles closed with a loss of 380 jobs.  Since 31 October this year there have been 600 redundancies in the town, 200 in the American factory, the General Electric factory of ECCO.  In fairness those redundancies were as a result of technological changes effected within that industry which nobody could prevent and comprised the outcome of continuing negotiations between unions and management for several months previously. The products that EECO make continue to sell very well on world markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is even more cause for concern in the footwear industry, of which traditionally Dundalk has been its home both in boot and shoe wear.  In recent years there has been the closure of several footwear factories including, as Deputy Kirk said, the American factory of Weyenberg which at one time employed over 300 people and which closed down last year.  There is a definite threat to the very lifeblood, the continuation of the other factories in the area, chief among which are Clarks (Ireland) Limited.  If that were <Col N="1823" /> to happen Dundalk's industrial activity would literally come to a halt.</P>

      <P>P.J. Carroll, the showpiece of Dundalk industry, had 125 redundancies this year for the first time in their 150-year history.  That is the measure of the economic devastation in Dundalk.</P>
      <P>I suggest that Dundalk needs the same type of help that Cork has received. Unfortunately we have not the same lobby in this Chamber, but we are demanding the same attention.  I would ask the Minister to give some logical reason why Dundalk is not designated a disadvantaged area like every other Border town in the region.  I would ask him to create a taskforce for the northeast region and to up-grade Dundalk as a priority with the IDA.  Visiting industrialists are not brought to Dundalk.  If they are brought it is only as an afterthought, having already visited Galway, Cork, Waterford and Limerick.  He might consider the possibility of a Government subvention to substitute for rates for the shopkeepers of Dundalk since every second shop and public house there is for sale.</P>
      <P>Although it is too late to come into effect this year, I would ask the Minister to consider for next year a reduction or abolition of excise duties for the month of December to enable Dundalk business people, their families and employees, to survive.</P>

    <P>ECCO Limited in Dundalk was established in 1966 by General Electric to manufacture electronic components, principally for the US and European consumer <Col N="1824" /> electronic product market.  By 1974 employment had grown to 1,700 and by this stage the company assembled low current transistors, rectifiers and diodes. Further expansion followed involving additional products, but employment fell to 970 in 1975 and continued to decline to its present level of 715.  Regrettably the company were recently forced to announce a further reduction of employment in having to make redundant about 190 employees.</P>
    <P>Along with other companies in the industrialised world, ECCO have had to compete with increased competition from low cost Far East producers, over the past ten years in particular.  Several changes of product have been made by the company which, while not preventing decreases in employment, have at least enabled the company to maintain their manufacturing operation in Dundalk.  In addition to the switch to more viable products ECCO have been forced by the competitive nature of the electronic component business and particularly the low cost competition from the Far East to engage in increased automation of their manufacturing process.</P>
    <P>One must bear in mind the need for companies like ECCO to remain cost competitive, even though this may entail increased automation and concentration on a small number of key products and unfortunately may entail redundancies. In the last analysis companies must be free to carry on their business in the manner which they adjudge will best ensure a viable future.  To attempt to force or to encourage companies to do otherwise, even if one could, would be pointing things in a very dangerous direction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kirk gave the impression that the Government were closing down industries in Dundalk.  That is not so.  We are going through a difficult recession and it is primarily up to the management of companies to keep their undertakings viable.  Of course I am not happy with the prospect of the loss of 188 jobs in ECCO.  I understand that 100 redundancies will take place by the end of this year and that there will be a further 88 in the <Col N="1825" /> first few months of 1985.  These redundancies will be in the production and related areas, and as a result of these redundancies employment by ECCO in Dundalk will be reduced from its present level of 715 to 527.  Despite these redundancies, significant though they are to Dundalk, ECCO will remain a major employer in the area.</P>
    <P>I should add that the company have received substantial support from the IDA and a sum of £3 million had been paid by way of grants to the company up to 1983.  That shows the measure of the Government's commitment to the company. The IDA have always kept in touch with the company and have given their full co-operation.  Particularly since their difficulties in the mid-seventies the company have striven to engage in the manufacture of products which are the most viable in terms of the advantages and disadvantages of operating in Dundalk and have concentrated on the products which are most viable when measured against current market demand.</P>
    <P>As part of their current approach to company development, the IDA are at present assisting the company in drawing up a strategy which will enable ECCO to stabilise their Dundalk operations by concentrating on a number of high value added products.  This approach, it is hoped, will assist the company in avoiding the direct competition with low cost producers which has been the cause of some of their difficulties.  Production of a high value added product will entail concentrating on the attainment of the highest possible level of production efficiency.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day the future of ECCO in Dundalk will depend on the company's ability to demonstrate that they can and do produce a high value added product at a cost and a quality which will match the product of their competitors.  It is up to the company themselves to realise the need for competitiveness.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that the footwear industry has a long tradition in the Dundalk area and one of the household names <Col N="1826" /> in footwear &mdash; Clarks &mdash; has had a plant there for many years.</P>
    <P>The footwear industry in Ireland and in the EC has been experiencing difficulties in recent years.  Increased competition, changes in fashion and demand and pressure on consumers' disposable incomes have all had an impact on the footwear market.  This adverse impact has had consequences for employment in Dundalk.</P>
    <P>The effects on companies have varied depending on their individual circumstances. The type of market served and relative competitiveness of firms are important factors which must be clearly understood.</P>
    <P>In the Dundalk area one firm, Weyenbergs, closed late last year.  They employed in excess of 200.  Deputies will agree that there was an industrial relations problem in the plant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not for me to adjudicate on that.  In present economic circumstances it is vitally important that industrial relations be kept on a very sound basis in all industries.  I understand that the future of the Weyenberg company is still under review.  The Clarkes factory has recently announced redundancies. This means that by the end of the year employment will be less than 400.  These job losses are to be regretted, and I share the concern of Deputies at reductions in employment in traditional long-relied on areas of industry.  State agencies such as the IDA and CTT have provided assistance to firms in the footwear industry, including those in Dundalk.  This has helped in no small measure to enable some firms to survive. This assistance will be available in the future as it was in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must stress that it is for firms themselves to develop the plans and take the action necessary for survival.  State agencies <Col N="1827" /> can provide assistance in this regard but they are no substitute for planning and action by firms themselves.  I will take note of the points made by the Deputies <Col N="1828" /> and bring them to the attention of the IDA.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 6 December 1984.</P>

      <P>The sixth Conference of European Ministers responsible for local government was held in Rome from 6-8 November 1984.  Theme I of the conference was entitled &ldquo;Local self-government; adoption of a European charter for local self-government&rdquo;.  The technical report on Theme I requested the Ministers to examine the draft Charter and, for the guidance of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe:</P>
      <P>(a)  to indicate their approval (or otherwise) to the substance of the articles of the draft charter, and</P>
      <P>(b)  to recommend whether the instrument should be adopted in the form of a recommendation or a convention.</P>
      <P>There was unanimous agreement on the principles contained in the draft charter. However, agreement was not reached as regards the legal form which the draft charter should take.  A majority favoured a convention, while a significant number, including Ireland, favoured a recommendation.</P>
      <P>It is assumed that the &ldquo;draft resolution of the Council of Europe&rdquo; referred to by the Deputy, refers to the initial draft of the concluding resolution on Theme I, presented, for adoption by the conference, by the Minister of the Interior of Italy.  This initial draft, however, did not adequately reflect the conclusions of the conference and a number of alternative drafts were considered before agreement was reached on the wording of the resolution.</P>
      <P>It is now a matter for the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe to decide on the legal form which the charter should take.</P>

His means were assessed on the basis that he had a <Col N="1653" /> yearly income of £1,820 from self employment cutting timber, and that the yearly value of board and lodging on his brother's farm was £2,285.71. Accordingly the total amount of means assessed against him amounted to £4,105.70 per annum and exceeded the sum of £2,935.40 per annum which is the statutory limit appropriate to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Garda authorities have informed me that the statistical information sought in the question is not available in Garda headquarters and that, while records at local Garda stations throughout the country could be examined with a view to compiling the information, any such examination would take a disproportionate amount of time and resources.  Because of retirements, transfers, etc., it would not be feasible to compile the information on the basis of the recollection of members now in charge of particular areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if the information were available, I could not agree to give some of the details sought &mdash; in particular, information such as dates that would make individual cases readily identifiable.  A person who is prosecuted is subject to the hazards of contemporaneous publicity but it is a long established and in my view commendable convention that, except in very exceptional circumstances where a departure from practice can be called for in the public interest, Ministers for Justice do not provide material the publication of which effectively involves the raking over of old criminal cases.  In a <Col N="1664" /> matter of this kind, I believe that members of the Garda Síochána can reasonably expect to be accorded the same treatment as other citizens.</P>
    <P>I have very little doubt that in recent times there have been more prosecutions of members of the force for one reason or another than in earlier years &mdash; though it will be noted that prosecutions may come up for final adjudication by a court well after the events to which they relate, so that, unless allowance is made for that, a wrong impression may be taken.</P>
    <P>No doubt the increase in prosecutions reflects, in part, a dropping of standards on the part of some members of the force &mdash; corresponding, perhaps, to a dropping of standards in some other walks of life. So also does the fact that in a number of cases in recent times (though again, for the most part, in respect of incidents that occurred quite some time ago), damages have been awarded against members of the Garda Síochána in circumstances of a kind that brought no credit on them. These matters are a cause of regret and of concern.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, speaking not only for myself but also for the Commissioner, I can say that there is a firm determination to ensure that all steps necessary will in fact be taken.  On that point, it is clear that the prosecutions that have been taken show, very clearly, a determination on the part of all the relevant authorities, including of course the Commissioner, to see that, if and where the relevant evidence of criminal activity is available, there will be no hesitation in initiating the criminal process and that the fact that a person is a member of the Garda Síochána is no protection.  On that basis the evidence, far from suggesting that the matter warrants special Government or parliamentary examination, indicates very clearly that the authorities are fully committed to dealing with the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education the reason there has been a change in the school bus service from Poulmucka to Cahir in which a CIE bus has taken over school transport service in that area which was formerly operated by a mini-bus and as a result the pupils are now collected much earlier in the morning and returned much later in the evening; and if her Department will revert to the original arrangements which was much better.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of an increase in the number of eligible pupils offering for school transport, it was necessary to reorganise the services operating into the Cahir post-primary centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of this reorganisation of <Col N="1666" /> services, the pupils from the area in question have later pick-up times in the morning and later set-down times in the afternoon.  While they now have longer waiting times overall, the standard of service available to them is considered to be satisfactory in the context of the general operation of the post-primary school transport scheme.  Accordingly, it is not considered that any changes in the present arrangements would be warranted.</P>
