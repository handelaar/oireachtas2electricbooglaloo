      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will outline the reasons for his meeting with a group of US Senators in Dublin on the weekend of November 10-11; the capacity in which the group was visiting Ireland; the topics discussed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In line with the Government's policy of maintaining friendly relations and contacts with US legislators in the interests of promoting knowledge of Irish positions and of mutual understanding between our countries, I agreed to meet a group of US Senators who were passing through <Col N="2" /> Dublin en route to further engagements in Europe.  The discussions dealt with Northern Ireland, European Community and international affairs and the Irish economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Taoiseach if the question of Irish neutrality was dealt with during these discussions, in view of the fact that it has been reported that he received a briefing on this matter from US Embassy officials?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir.  The subject, like King Charles's head, was absent from this, as from many other occasions where he seems to think it should be raised.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I think it is quite in order to raise the question, as it would appear that the matter was discussed between the Taoiseach and officials of the US Embassy. Could the Taoiseach indicate whether the question of Nicaragua was discussed and whether he expressed the concern of the Irish Government in relation to pressure being placed on that country and interference with it?  That is of some relevance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid it would not be in order for the Deputy to go through a list &mdash; whether long or short &mdash; and query whether this, that or the other matter had been dealt with.  He is at liberty to ask the Taoiseach what was dealt with.  He cannot conduct a cross-examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is whether the pressure being exerted at present by the United States Government on Nicaragua was raised with this group and whether the Taoiseach expressed Government concern on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear to the Chair that the Deputy intends to go through a list of topics and ask was each of them dealt with.  The Chair thinks that would be an abuse of Question Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean that the Taoiseach is not going to be allowed to answer the question?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said to the Deputy, I have no objection to his asking the Taoiseach one question &mdash; what was dealt with.  I am not going to allow each topic to be taken up and dealt with individually.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of his reply, the Taoiseach indicated that international affairs were discussed.  I think it reasonable to ask, in view of the international situation and present US policy in relation to Nicaragua, if the Taoiseach expressed Government concern at US interference with Nicaraguan sovereignty.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In my personal discussions with the US Senators, I concentrated, in the brief time at my disposal, on issues related to Northern Ireland. Other issues were discussed while they were here, but I would not be in a position to go into the details about that in respect of other discussions at official level.  I had a very short time available to have a briefing session with the Senators and I concentrated on the question of Northern Ireland during my personal discussions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware that residents at a place (details supplied) in County Galway are unable to collect local contributions of £2,100 for repair of roads under the local improvement scheme rules laid down by his Department; and if he will alter the rules and revert to the situation where landowners whose land valuation was under £5 did not have to pay a local contribution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware that residents at Killeaney, Kilronan, Aran Islands, County Galway, are unable to collect local contribution of £2,500 for repairs of roads under the local improvement scheme rules laid down by his Department; and if he will alter the rules <Col N="5" /> and revert to the situation where landowners whose land valuation was under £5 did not have to pay a local contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>I am not so aware.  The administration of the local improvements scheme is carried out by county councils and the scheme is confined to farm road projects eligible for EC aid under the western package.  The relevant EC regulation stipulates that local landholders must contribute at least 10 per cent of the cost of eligible projects and this requirement is not negotiable at present.</P>
      <P>The manner of sharing the 10 per cent minimum contribution is a matter for determination by the landholders benefiting from each particular project.  All aspects of the EC western package fall to be reviewed next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the only way in which rural dwellers could have a local road repaired was under the local improvement scheme and that where their land valuations were under £5 they did not have to make any cash contribution towards the cost?  Now, since this EC contribution has been accepted and the 10 per cent minimum contribution requirement adhered to, this results, on numerous occasions, in local householders being unable to afford the local contribution.  Therefore, they are not able to benefit from the local improvement scheme.  Is the Minister aware of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have informed the Deputy, EC regulation 18/20/80 for the western package stipulates that there must be a 10 per cent minimum contribution in the case of eligible farm road projects. This is part of the regulations that were drawn up in the conditions governing the western package which was agreed in 1980-81 by Fianna Fáil when in Government. I cannot change it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that <Col N="6" /> the EC are to dictate to us as to what form of road improvement scheme we should operate?  Is the Minister aware, as he must be aware from my question, that several householders in western areas are unable to have repairs carried out to the roads leading to their houses because of this stipulation?  I have brought that matter to the notice of the Minister on a previous occasion.  His Minister of State said then that he was not aware of any such case.  I could fill the Order Paper with cases of this kind.  There are now two clear cases before the Minister.  The stipulation is presenting a major difficulty for rural dwellers.  I am asking the Minister who has responsibility in this area if he is prepared to change the regulations. To hell with the EC.  They do not live in the west of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy means to hell with the nine-tenths of the money that comes from the EC, that is fine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only £2 million involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's party when in Government negotiated this package.  It was part of the regulations that one-tenth of the money be provided by the land owners who would benefit from the road works.  These conditions will be looked at again next year and the Deputy can be assured that I will bear his point in mind at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware that this scheme was negotiated when Fianna Fáil were in office but the Minister may be assured that if we were back in office it would be renegotiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be renegotiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that on a previous occasion, the Minister for Labour who was then Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, gave me a similar assurance?  The late Deputy Coughlan and myself raised this matter here on numerous occasions more than two years ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Two years later no change has been made in the scheme.  What are these people expected to do?  Some of them cannot negotiate the roads to their houses and have had to leave their cars as far away as two or three miles from their homes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that the agreement is due to be renegotiated in the coming year and, as I have told him, the point he is making will be borne in mind at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that an imposition is being put on people who do not have roads leading to their houses in that they are being asked to contribute to the work involved, whereas in about 90 per cent of the country roads are provided free of charge? Is this not unfair and unconstitutional? Would the Minister try to impress on the EC that the necessary finances must be provided to ensure that the people concerned have proper road access to their houses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree that neither roads nor anything else are free of charge.  However, I accept the point he makes and when the renegotiation takes place that point will be brought forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that there is only £2 million provided in the Estimates for this scheme and that approximately £1 million of that is coming from the EC, would the Minister not provide a separate sum to cover those cases of people who are unable to benefit under the local <Col N="8" /> improvements scheme because of the 10 per cent contribution requirement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>

In these circumstances can the Minister give an assurance that the local people will not be disadvantaged for much longer?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that recent approaches from the land owners' solicitors have allowed the county council to re-open negotiations on the acquisition of the land by agreement.

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the action he proposes to take to counteract the extensive dereliction in the north inner city of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Action in this area is primarily a matter for the local authority concerned &mdash; in this case Dublin Corporation &mdash; on foot of the wide powers available to counteract dereliction and to secure the redevelopment of land.</P>
      <P>General powers to secure the development and renewal of those parts of an area which have become outmoded, derelict or obsolete are contained in the Planning Acts which enable the local authority to engage directly in urban renewal activity or to co-operate with private property owners or developers in this work.</P>
      <P>The Dublin City Development Plan, which was adopted in 1980, and is the policy statement of the corporation for the planning and development of their area, contains a specific objective to have as many as possible of the derelict sites which were identified in a major survey of the inner city area cleaned up and suitably developed.  It is the duty of the corporation to take such steps as may be necessary for securing that objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Derelict Sites Act, 1961 contains specific powers to enable local authorities to secure the clearance, improvement or acquisition of derelict sites which are in a condition injurious to health or amenities. Other powers to combat dereliction are contained in the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1964 which provides for clearance, acquisition or improvement of dangerous structures or <Col N="11" /> places; the Housing Act, 1966, which, <i>inter alia</i>, contains provisions in regard to unfit housing; and the Litter Act, 1982, which provides for the combating of litter and for dealing with abandoned cars.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Consideration of this group scheme has been prolonged by Roscommon County Council's proposal to increase the amount of the special contribution already approved in respect of the scheme.  The approved design is also being re-examined to ensure that it is compatible with firm proposals which recently emerged for other group schemes in the vicinity.</P>

In June, Roscommon County Council requested approval from the Department for a total of £74,000 which included an increase in the contribution of £22,000.  The increase is to take account of additional materials necessary for the scheme which, of course increased the cost of the original specification. I have arranged for a senior <Col N="12" /> Department inspector to examine the position with a view to improving the progress, which has been slow up to now.</P>

      <P>The last loan issue was met.  In October the agency succeeded in placing £30 million of 2 per cent index-linked HFA stock.  The proceeds of this issue, £25.3 million, were raised.  The Deputy is probably referring to the earlier issue in May last year which did not realise the amount required and certain short-term borrowing had to be taken up to make up for the shortfall.  A number of issues caused problems at the time but that is not the case at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that this index-linked form of raising finance is not attractive to financial institutions?  Does he accept that they are not interested in making finance available in this way and that the agency will continue to have serious difficulty in attracting funds?  The Minister should consider changing the system whereby finance is raised by the Housing Finance Agency. Does the Minister further accept that the system operating at present is very costly and is passed on to the borrower?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware that Donegal County Council are still using the poor law valuation in order to assess landholders' eligibility to qualify for a council loan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The PLV system continues to be used by local authorities in accordance with article 32 of the Housing Regulations, 1980 in determining the entitlement to housing loans of persons who derive their income solely or mainly from the pursuit of agriculture.  I am satisfied that it continues to provide a convenient and reasonable way of assessing eligibility for housing loans.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply by me to Question No. 371 of 7 March in which it was indicated that the Supreme Court did not find the valuation system itself unconstitutional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughConaghan" hpid="Mr. Conaghan Mr. Conaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Supreme Court gave a ruling that it was unconstitutional for the PLV system to be applied to rates, that the health boards do not use the PLV system in relation to assessing people for levies for health contributions and also in view of the fact that applicants are requested by local authorities to give an audited statement of their income for the previous year in relation to loan applications, does the Minister consider this is a fair system to use in respect of people applying for council loans?  Further, has he notified the local authorities in writing that the <Col N="25" /> PLV system still applies in respect of loans?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply, we consider it to be a reasonably fair system.  Obviously there are exceptional cases that may require individual attention by the local authorities but basically it is as fair a method as can be found.  Perhaps with the introduction of the new farm tax based on adjusted acres which has been used in the past by the Land Commission in the distribution of land the system could be looked at with a view to changing the method of assessing the income of farmers and perhaps could be substituted for the PLV system. The Deputy asked if I had instructed local authorities that this method should be used: my reply is that I have not instructed them that it should not be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughConaghan" hpid="Mr. Conaghan Mr. Conaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that in his reply he is indicating that the PLV system should not be used?  Does he not agree it should be abolished? Many landholders are finding it difficult to get loans because they exceed the valuation despite the fact that their income from land earnings would leave them eligible if they were on a par with other applicants?  These people have to submit audited accounts to the council.  Does the Minister not consider that the method used is unfair and should be abolished in view of the fact that the PLV system has been found unconstitutional?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The last remark of the Deputy is not correct.  The Supreme Court decision did not confirm the PLV system to be unconstitutional.  It set aside the declaration of the High Court that certain sections of the Valuation Acts were unconstitutional and substituted a declaration that section 11 of the Local Government Act, 1946, to the extent that it authorised the collection of the county rate on land independent of buildings was invalid having regard to the provisions of Article 40 of the Constitution.  The principal effect of the Supreme Court decision is that rates can no longer be <Col N="26" /> levied and that is the net effect of the decision.  In general, the use of the valuation system provides an equitable means from the farmers' point of view of assessing eligibility for loans and until a different system can be substituted I have made no provision to change the present system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughConaghan" hpid="Mr. Conaghan Mr. Conaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can instance many cases where the audited accounts would qualify people under the income limits but the PLV system excludes them.  Does the Minister not accept that PLV varies from townland to townland and from county to county and that in itself it was an unfair method of assessing valuation on property?  Will the Minister not accept that it should be abolished?  Is he telling the House in effect that he is going to remove it in view of the land tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said that in general it has proved to be an equitable system.  If the Deputy has specific instances where that has not been the case I would be prepared to look at them and if, when viewing those decisions I find his contention is correct, I would take steps to see what method could be introduced to have a more equitable system.  I have to repeat that the information and experience I have in this area is that the PLV system has been accepted in general by the farming community as equitable for this propose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughConaghan" hpid="Mr. Conaghan Mr. Conaghan">

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to my Department's circular N6/84 dated 14 February 1984 on housing needs, the information supplied by the Kildare local authorities shows that the total numbers of approved applicants on their waiting lists at 31 December 1983 were: Kildare County Council, 617; Athy UDC, 84; Naas UDC, 78.</P>
      <P>Progress reports supplied by the local authorities show that the numbers of houses under construction at end of September 1984 were: Kildare County Council, 214; Athy UDC, 27; Naas UDC, 5.</P>

When their wives and families turned up last Friday for their allotments they were told that there was no money and it was not known when there would be money. Therefore, the families cannot feel as confident as the Minister does about certain procedures that are normally covered by liquidations under maritime law.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister give us any reason why these ships should not return home at this stage?  Obviously if they are to be confiscated they will arrive at the various ports within the next two weeks.  The captains and chief engineers of these ships have made it quite clear that they do not know what will happen particularly in the case of the <i>Irish Rowan</i> which is to go to Taiwan shortly.  The Chinese people who are behind some of the deals that collapsed are not likely to take too kindly to what has happened.  I am sure that the liquidator, the Department and the Minister cannot give any assurances that these people are safe.</P>

      <P>I am not going into the reasons for ruling out questions. They were ruled out for different reasons, some on urgency and some for other reasons.  I ask Deputies please to listen to me and understand me.  I ruled on a number of questions today which were submitted to me on Private Notice Questions. I gave them the most careful consideration. I approached them with a perfectly open mind.  I got such advice as I asked for and I ruled on the questions in all good faith.  I would ask the Deputies to accept that ruling.  I say, and not in a jocose manner, that if any Deputies are not satisfied with my ruling it would not be orderly to have a barney or a wrangle or a hassle about it here.  Any Deputy is welcome to come to my office and discuss it with me and I assure him that I have neither a cross dog nor a cross woman there.</P>

Part of that ruling was that the Minister will ensure that the welfare of the staff and their families will be looked after.  I should like to ask the Minister, in relation to allotment money that is normally paid to the wives of crew members of Irish ships, and has been paid since 1941, what the position is now of the wives and families of the crew members who are likely to be stuck on the high seas or in ports thousands of miles from Ireland between now and Christmas.</P>

As the Deputy is aware, there is a liquidator in place who has responsibility now for all the affairs of Irish Shipping Limited. It is outside my responsibility and it would be very improper for me to intervene.

Is it the position that the fate and circumstances of <Col N="35" /> these employees and their families is to be left entirely to the liquidator or is the Minister, as the Minister answerable to the House for the affairs of Irish Shipping, taking a responsibility for and an interest in their conditions?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that liquidation law is very precise and responsibility in a liquidation lies with the liquidator.  However, I, as Minister for Communications, have general responsibility under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1906, in relation to the repatriation of crews.  I am assured that the liquidator has this well in hand.  Of course, I have an interest in it and I will continue to have an interest in it to ensure the safety and safe return of Irish crews as and when it becomes necessary to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>If anybody can make head or tail of that answer by the Minister they are cleverer than I am.  The liquidator has no interest in this but a commercial one.  He is bound by law to pursue certain commercial interests, considerations and nothing else.  Over and above that, does the Minister not recognise that there is a humanitarian aspect of this whole matter, of families being stranded, Irish citizens being left stranded abroad thousands of miles from home?  Is the Minister, the person responsible for liquidating this company and bringing about this situation, in a position to assure the House that he will look after these people and see to it that they are properly catered for?</P>

I specifically allowed part (c) of the question tabled by Deputy Bertie Ahern and rejected all the others on various grounds which I will explain to Members if they come to my office.  I allowed that part of the question by Deputy Ahern to the Minister for the very reason which has come out today, that he has a statutory obligation, duty or responsibility for repatriating seamen. Therefore, over and above the duty of the liquidator, the Minister has that duty. I regret to tell Deputy Wilson that I am not going to enter into an argument or discussion about this matter.</P>

I deliberately, in wording my question, avoided any mention of the liquidator and concentrated the question on the area of ministerial responsibility, and yet it was turned down.  I cannot understand why that was done.  I wanted the record of the locations of the ships and status of the ships, as Irish ships, affected.  A ship has now been arrested in Savannah, Georgia.</P>

    <Title>Age of Majority Bill, 1984: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I intend to reply to the remarks made by Deputies during the Second Stage debate.  Some of the most important points can be dealt with in greater detail on Committee Stage, but there are some comments I would like to make now.  In a sense I will be summarising and repeating what I dealt with briefly last week, and then I will pick up individual comments made by individual Deputies.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods and Deputy Shatter particularly, and some other Deputies queried the exclusion from the Bill of the Law Reform Commission's proposals relating to marriage.  Generally speaking, the commission proposed that the free age for marriage should be 18 years, that is, the age at which a person could marry without the consent of a third party such as a parent or guardian.  They also considered whether the absolute minimum age for marriage should be fixed at 16 or 18 years.  In their proposed legislation they opted for 16 years as the absolute minimum age and recommended that a marriage contracted by a person under that age should be null and void.  Consent of a parent, guardian or of the court would be required for marriage of persons between 16 and 18 years and absence of consent would invalidate the marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the reduction of the free age of marriage, section 18 of the Marriages Act, 1972, already gives power to the Minister for Health to make regulations substituting for the present age of 21 years a lower age as the age at which parental consent for marriage ceases to be necessary.  Therefore, a change to make 18 the free age for marriage, rather than 21 years, could be accomplished <Col N="118" /> without legislation by order of the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>As regards the minimum age for marriage, it is reasonable to suppose that there could be a divergence of views about what the law should be concerning marriage before the age of 16 years and between the ages of 16 years and 18 years. These proposals are not in any way related to the question of what the age of majority should be and it is reasonable to say that we should deal with them separately.  Indeed, it would be undesirable to have provisions relating to such an important aspect of life contained in any legislation other than a Marriage Act.  In the past, marriage law has always been the subject of separate legislation.  There appears to be no good reason why that principle should apply in relation to the matters we are now considering.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the report by the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown may be due in the not too distant future, but it is by no means certain what action will be taken on foot of the recommendations in that report.  Whatever proposals may issue from the committee, they will require full and careful consideration by the Government and the Minister for Health who has the primary responsibility in this area before they, or any variation of them, can be incorporated in legislation.</P>
    <P>As I said in my opening remarks, the Joint Committee on Legislation considered the Law Reform Commission's overall recommendations in this area. That committee recognised that the proposals connected with the law of marriage might well be controversial and decided to confine their examination to the central proposals in relation to reduction in the age of majority.  In fact, the committee considered only the age of majority aspects of the commission's report principally because the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown already had the marriage proposals under examination.</P>
    <P>Briefly, in relation to the age of marriage, this is an area which could possibly be controversial.  It is a totally separate issue from the age of majority and it is <Col N="119" /> an area which needs to be debated and considered separately.  As soon as I have had time to evaluate the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown dealing with the age of marriage, I propose to act on them.  I do not propose to deal with the age of marriage as if it were a minor consideration to be dealt with under the overall heading of the age of majority when it is a major consideration to be dealt with within the auspices of a Marriage Act.  The Marriage Acts are matters for the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>The position in summary is this: we are lowering the age of majority from 21 years to 18 years.  If the Minister for Health, with the consent of the Government, considers that the free age for marriage should be 18 years, he can lower that age to 18 years by way of regulation; he does not need legislation.  When we are talking about the age of marriage we are talking about two ages &mdash; the free age of marriage and whether there should be a lower age at which people could marry with the consent of parents, guardians or the court.</P>
    <P>From what I have heard already in the House, there seems to be a divergence of views.  Some Deputies seem to think there should be a minimum age for marriage, 18 years, and that nobody should be allowed marry under that age, regardless of circumstances, and that there would be one age only for marriage, the free age of marriage.  There are many marriages where one partner is over 18, and there are a number of other marriages, probably 50 or 60, where both partners are under 18 years, but other considerations should also be taken into account.</P>
    <P>There are, for example itinerant groups where people marry at quite a young age.  The House should consider very carefully whether to pick an age for marriage which would make it impossible to marry under that age &mdash; the age of 18 &mdash; and not recognise any marriage under that age, with its adverse effects on children of any arrangement made <Col N="120" /> under that age.  It is not a simple question or a minor issue to be dealt with in the context of the overall age of majority.  It is a question which I think the House should deal with separately and that is my approach.</P>
    <P>I do not disagree at all with the opinions expressed by Deputy Woods with regard to marital breakdown having as a contributory factor early marriage. We are dealing here with the age of majority, and the age of marriage is a separate issue.  We should await the advice of the full report on martial breakdown and then deal with the age of marriage as a separate issue.  I am sure that very many Deputies will have much to say on that matter because it is by no means an open and shut case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods asked why should a person be able to take out funds lodged in court at 18 but not trust funds until he reaches 21.  There may be a misunderstanding of what is involved here.  The provision in paragraph 3 of the Schedule relates to trust instruments made before the commencment of the Act.  It is right that we should not interfere with the intentions of a person who set up a trust before the Act comes into force.  That person would have taken account of the relevant provisions of the Conveyancing Act, 1881, in deciding on the terms of the trust.  The object of the paragraph is to preserve the trust instrument as it stood before the commencement of the Act.  The paragraph includes, however, an enabling provision that allows the trustees to pay income from a trust to the beneficiary at the age of majority in addition to the power already conferred on them under the 1881 Act to pay such income to his parent or guardian for his maintenance or education.</P>
    <P>The question of changing the age for membership of the Dáil (which would involve a similar change for Seanad membership) was raised by several Deputies. This would require an amendment of the Constitution.  Such a proposal could not be included in this Bill as Article 46 of the Constitution provides that a Bill to amend the Constitution may not include any other proposals.  A proposal to <Col N="121" /> reduce the age for membership to 18 was not proceeded with in 1972 when the Constitution was amended to reduce the voting age to 18.  It was decided then that the age for membership of the Houses of the Oireachtas should remain at 21 years of age.  In most member states of the EC the age for election to parliament is higher than the voting age.  For example, in Belguim it is 25 as against 21 years of age, in Italy and the Netherlands 25 as against 18, in France 23 as against 18, in Luxembourg and the United Kingdom it is 21 as against 18.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods suggested that there was an inconsistency in not considering adjustment of other age limits specified by law in line with the changes in the age of majority.  He asked, for example, whether I was considering a change in the age of criminal responsibility.  First of all, it would not be appropriate to deal with the age of criminal responsibility in a Bill which is principally concerned with a reform of the civil law.  Furthermore, I would not wish to pre-empt any decision which the Minister for Health may take in relation to the age of criminal responsibility in connection with the Children Bill.  I made my position quite clear in this regard during the debates on the Criminal Justice Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods also referred to the possibility of the Bill leading to a reduction in the maximum age of 21 &mdash; rather than 19 as the Deputy thought &mdash; up to which a young offender could be sent to St. Patrick's Institution, with the result that more juveniles would be mixing with older and more hardened offenders in Mountjoy Prison.  It is not intended that the Bill should affect any age limits prescribed in legislation relating to imprisonment or detention.  I am very grateful to Deputy Woods for pointing out this potential problem area and I will move an amendment on Committee Stage to meet the point which he raises.</P>
    <P>Deputy Myra Barry raised the question of persons over 18 who are living at home and who had applied for dole payments being assessed on the basis of parents' income.  This Bill is not the appropriate place to deal with that kind of issue. <Col N="122" /> It seems to be relevant solely to social welfare legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter raised an important point about the effect of the Bill on maintenance orders.  He put forward some very persuasive arguments why maintenance payments should be allowed to continue up to 21 years of age in certain cases.  Deputy Myra Barry also referred to this question.</P>
    <P>At present under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976 or under the Illegitimate Children (Affiliation Orders) Act, 1930 (as amended by the 1976 Act) a maintenance order may be made in respect of a child up to 16 years of age.  This may be extended to 21 years of age if the child is receiving full time education.  Under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, a maintenance order may be made in respect of a child up to 21 years of age.  The effect of section 2 of the Bill as initiated would be that a reference to 21 years of age in these Acts would be construed as a reference to 18.  Consequently, the courts would not be empowered to make maintenance orders for children between 18 and 21 after the commencement of the Act.  The Bill does not, of course, affect the position of physically or mentally handicapped children for whom there will be no statutory upper age limit.  In fact, section 6 of the Bill improves the existing position in this regard by enabling the courts to make maintenance orders under the Guardianship of Infants Act for incapacitated children who have attained the age of majority, thus bringing it into line with the similar existing provision in the 1976 Act.</P>
    <P>The question of maintenance of children who have attained the age of majority was considered by the Law Reform Commission.  In the Working Paper on the Age of Majority they indicated that they were in favour of retaining existing entitlement to maintenance up to 21 years of age, Paragraph 5.22, but in their Final Report they concluded that it would not be desirable to impose continuing maintenance obligations on parents of children &mdash; other than those who are mentally or physically disabled &mdash; who <Col N="123" /> have reached the age of majority, even if they are receiving fulltime education. The commission considered that the balance of the argument favoured the view that a necessary implication of attaining majority is that a person is sufficiently mature and independent to be responsible for his or her own maintenance rather than looking to the parents for support.  The Bill was drafted on the basis of the recommendation in the commission's final report.</P>
    <P>Clearly, there are arguments on both sides of the matter.  On the one hand, maintenance under our laws has never been payable beyond the age of majority, except in the case of handicapped children, and it can be argued that once the law accepts that a person has attained adulthood, obligations on his parents to support him beyond that age in the normal case, where no question of handicap arises, should not be imposed by law. It can also be argued that it is only where parents are separated and in dispute that one or other will, in practice, be obliged by law to maintain a child in higher education and that this is unfair.  For the majority of children whose parents are living together there will be no question of one or other of the parents being obliged to maintain the child in higher education. There is a strong argument that it should be left to parents themselves to agree together as to whether or not they should maintain their child at university.  On the other hand, it can be argued that the reduction in the age of majority, which is intended to be of benefit to young people should not operate to the detriment of some of them who may have difficult family circumstances and who are not in a position to support themselves.</P>
    <P>I have given the question further consideration and while I appreciate the arguments adduced by the Law Reform Commission in support of their proposal, I have formed the conclusion that it would not be unreasonable to preserve the existing situation.  Accordingly, I propose to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to preserve the existing <Col N="124" /> right to seek maintenance up to 21 years when the young person is in full time education.  I would be opposed to any extension beyond 21 years of age in these cases.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell referred to the fact that the Bill will not allow parents to claim the benefits of covenants to pay sums to children under 21 since tax legislation is excepted from its scope.  This question raises important budgetary and revenue considerations that would be more appropriate for consideration in the context of a Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with most of the points that were raised in that section of the debate.  I am sure other points will come up on Committee Stage and can be dealt with there.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea, in a wide-ranging critique of the legislation suggested that we were simply copying the British in changing the common law rule for calculating age without giving any reasons why the change should be made.  He was supported in this view by Deputy Kelly.  The common law rule is being changed because it is considered to be illogical and contrary to commonsense that a person should be deemed to reach a particular age on the day before his birthday.  There is no question of imitating British legislation. The Law Reform Commission recommended this change and I see no good reason for not accepting what I consider to be a sensible recommendation. Moreover, this change will bring the method of calculating age into line with the existing statutory provision in section 2 (2) (c) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, which provides that a person shall be deemed not to have reached any particular age for the purposes of that Act until the commencement of the relevant birthday.</P>
    <P>On a similar note Deputy Kelly suggested that we were merely following the British example in changing the age of majority.  He thought that this Bill would not be before the House if a similar change had not been made in Britain. Deputy Skelly in a somewhat similar point suggested that there had been no <Col N="125" /> research carried out that would justify the proposed change.</P>
    <P>The age of majority has been reduced, not only in Britain but in most Western European countries and in the majority of States in the USA.  It reflects the widespread recognition throughout the western world that young people are nowadays reaching maturity at an earlier age.  I would also remind the Deputies that the Council of Europe, of which this State is a member, recommended a reduction in the age of majority in their Resolution 29 of 1972 twelve years ago. Moreover, the Law Reform Commission considered this matter very thoroughly and had regard to the position in very many countries before reaching the conclusion that it would be appropriate to make the change now proposed in the Bill.  Furthermore, the Joint Committee on Legislation who considered the report of the commission agreed with the proposal to reduce the age of majority to 18. It would be unfair to the commission to imply &mdash; and I would reject any such implication &mdash; that the result of their work is based solely on the example of another jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly spoke at some length on the danger of encouraging young people to marry before they are ready to take on the responsibilities of married life.  He thought that the Bill is ill-considered in so far as it might encourage people to marry too young.  He pointed to the evidence that the age of marriage is related to the incidence of marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>I dealt earlier in my reply with the question of the age for marriage and the reasons why proposals in this area have not been included in the Bill, but I should like to refer briefly to the matter again in connection with the points made by Deputy Kelly.</P>
    <P>While I would not agree that a change in the age of majority would have the result the Deputy suggests, he made a very impressive argument for dealing with any proposals regarding the appropriate age for marriage separately from this Bill.  He has demonstrated that opinions can differ very much on this subject and that any proposals for <Col N="126" /> changes in the age of marriage or the age at which consent would be required should be considered on their merits independently of the age of majority.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea asked when we could expect to see legislation on the commission's proposals in relation to marriage. This will be a matter primarily for the Minister for Health, who has responsibility for marriage laws.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly asked if I had received any guarantee from the Irish banks that they would reduce the age at which they would lend money so as to achieve the objective I had mentioned of removing an obstacle in the way of young married couples seeking to buy a house.  I accept the Deputy's assurance that he was not being sarcastic in making this point.  All I can say in reply is that I have not received any such guarantee, nor indeed would I expect one or look for one.  As the Deputy rightly remarked, there is no legal compulsion on a bank to lend money to anybody if the bank decides that he or she is not a good risk.  Commercial considerations, other than the consideration of age, will of course always apply in these matters.</P>
    <P>What we are doing in this Bill is removing one important legal obstacle in the way of lending agencies in dealing with young married couples.  I hope that the result will be that it will improve the situation in this regard and that the finance institutions concerned will take account of the changed legal position in deciding whether to grant loans to young people for housing and other desirable purposes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly suggested also that the change in the age of majority might influence any decision as to the age at which contraceptives would be made available.  There is no basis for this suggestion.  It would not be appropriate for me to go any further into this question at this time except to say that I have no doubt that it will be very fully and thoroughly debated on its own merits when the relevant legislation is published.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea wondered whether the proposed commencement date of the <Col N="127" /> Act, March 1985, would allow sufficient time for people to adjust to the change in the age of majority.  This will depend to some extent on the length of time that the Oireachtas will need to enact this legislation.  I would consider that this would be before the end of this session. This would allow a period of two to three months before the change takes effect.  I think this should be adequate, but it is something that can be kept in mind as the Bill progresses.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea queried the exclusion of the Adoption Acts from the scope of section 2.  I referred to this in my opening statement when I said that question of ages in relation to adoption had never been directly related to the age of majority and would be more appropriate for consideration in the context of the report of the Review Committee on Adoption Services.  I would refer the Deputy to a reply to a parliamentary question given by the Minister for Health on 25 October 1984, which is reported at column 615 of the Official Report, where he indicated that he would be seeking Government approval to the drafting of a Bill to amend the Adoption Acts when examination of the report of the review committee has been completed.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea asked why the commission's recommendation that the age up to which parents should be legally obliged to maintain children should be raised from 16 to 18, was not being implemented in this Bill.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my opening statement it was considered that this is not a matter directly related to the age of majority and is not appropriate to this Bill.  The Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981 provides, for the purposes of supplementary welfare allowances, that parents are obliged to maintain their children up to the age of 16.  Any change in that would be a matter primarily for the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The question of whether changes in tax or social welfare legislation would be made as a result of the changes in the age of majority was raised also by Deputy O'Dea.  Any change in age limits in such <Col N="128" /> legislation would be a matter for consideration in the first instance by the members of the Government with responsibility for those areas, having regard, no doubt, to the important financial and social implications involved.</P>
    <P>It was suggested also by the same Deputy that a separate rule was being introduced in section 4 in relation to the attainment of the age for voting.  He asked if there might be a conflict between the new rule for calculating age and the method of calculating the voting age. First, the section does not lay down any rule regarding the calculation of the age for voting.  The voting age is provided for in the Constitution, Article 16.  The references to voting age in electoral legislation reflect the constitutional provision. I am advised that there is a strong argument that this Bill could not purport to affect those provisions.  Any question that might arise as to the interpretation of these references would have to be decided in the context of the references to age in the Constitution and without reference to this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea queried the necessity for subsection (2) of section 7 which preserves the existing construction of references to &ldquo;full age&rdquo;, &ldquo;infancy&rdquo;, &ldquo;minority&rdquo;, etc. in wills or codicils made before the commencement of the Act notwithstanding that will or codicil is confirmed by a codicil executed after the commencement date.  He made the point that under existing law extrinsic evidence would be admitted to clarify the intentions of a testator.</P>
    <P>The position covered by subsection (2) relates to a will made before the commencement date but confirmed by a codicil made after it.  Under the existing rule of law, construction of expressions in the will is determined by the date of confirmation rather than by the date of execution of the will.  This would mean that construction of references to full age, etc., would automatically be construed as references to the new age of majority unless a saving provision were inserted. The purpose of the subsection is to ensure that the change in construction of references to full age, etc., brought about <Col N="129" /> by the Act would not interfere with the construction of the will.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy said, extrinsic evidence is admissible under section 90 of the Succession Act, 1965 to show the intention of the testator where there are references to full age etc., in the will and in the confirming codicil.  What the subsection ensures is that the fact that the latter document was made on or after the commencement date of the Age of Majority Bill will not of itself decide the matter.</P>
    <P>The question of why we are not repealing section 49 of the Statute of Limitations, 1957, as recommended by the commission, was raised also by Deputy O'Dea.  He referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of <i>O'Brien v. Keogh,</i> 1972, <i>Irish Reports,</i> page 144, to the effect that a provision, relating to extension of the limitation period in the case of a person under a disability, in section 49 of the 1957 Act was unconstitutional. The commission considered that repeal would be desirable in order to assist readers and compilers of indexes.</P>
    <P>This was considered but I was advised that it would not be appropriate to include a repeal of the provision in a Bill of this kind and that it would be more appropriate to other legislation, for example, a Bill amending the 1957 Act, or to a Statute Law revision Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea had other queries in relation to section 2 and paragraph 3 of the Schedule.  As these concern matters of detail and drafting they might be more appropriately for Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I thank all those Deputies who have contributed to the Second Stage debate. As I have said, I intend moving a number of amendments on Committee Stage to meet points raised.  One amendment which will be to the Schedule is of a technical nature.  Another is to meet a point raised by Deputy Woods regarding the age of persons sent to prisons or to St. Patrick's Institution.  A third amendment will be to enable the present situation to be maintained in respect of maintenance orders so that it will be possible for a court to issue a maintenance order that would apply to a person above the age of 18 but under 21.  In that way there will <Col N="130" /> be no disadvantage to young people of broken marriages who are in full time education and who otherwise might be cut off from their source of income while in the middle of their education.</P>
    <P>The initial report of the Law Reform Commission suggested that we should maintain the present situation, but their final report recommended change.  The original provisions in the Bill were along the lines of the final report, but in consideration of what was said here by Deputy Shatter, supported by others &mdash; I think this is the feeling of the House &mdash; I decided that we should maintain the present situation in regard to maintenance. Accordingly, I intend to move an amendment on Committee Stage to bring that about.  I am sure I will have the support of Deputy Woods and his party.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Donnellan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This Bill is being brought in to replace the existing legislation governing the registration and control of persons practising dentistry and the maintenance of standards of dental education and training in this country.  The existing legislation is the Dentists Act of 1928 which has served its purpose well over the years but is now outdated.</P>
      <P>The changing trends in dentistry, particularly over the past few years, necessitated changes in the legislation governing the profession if we here in Ireland were to keep pace with these changes and maintain the high standing internationally to which Irish dentistry has become accustomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation is designed to meet present needs and, in so far as possible, to facilitate anticipated changes in the future.  I am, of course, aware that no <Col N="131" /> legislation, no matter how well thought out, can provide for every eventuality, but every effort has been made to ensure that the Bill incorporates the best in modern thinking in relation to dentistry. It does not seek to bring about change for change's sake as will be evident from the fact that many of the excellent provisions of the 1928 Act are retained and are being re-enacted in this legislation. The new Bill is in many ways parallel legislation to the Medical Practitioners Act of 1978 which updated and improved the laws governing the medical profession, but it has, of course, certain provisions which are peculiar to the dental profession alone.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of the Bill the Dental Board, who have served the interests of the general public as well as those of the profession itself over the years, will be abolished and replaced by a new body to be known as the Dental Council. It is appropriate at this point that I should extend my sincerest thanks to all those who served as members of the Dental Board down through the years.  They have done an excellent job and are largely responsible for the high standing which Irish dentistry has attained and the esteem in which it is held throughout the world today.  The dedication and enthusiasm of successive Dental Boards is quite remarkable, particularly when it is considered that active membership must inevitably result in a certain amount of inconvenience and disruption of routine for the individual member.</P>
    <P>The present membership of the Dental Board had an extra burden placed on them when they were asked to serve for an extended period beyond the normal term of office of board members.  This was necessary in order to facilitate the smooth transition from Dental Board to Dental Council arising from this legislation. To a man the membership of the board agreed to serve for an extra two years and I would like to extend a special thanks to them for their generous response.</P>
    <P>In updating the legislation governing <Col N="132" /> dentistry and providing for future developments it was necessary to consult on a very wide basis, not only with representatives of the profession and others directly concerned, but with all those who might be affected one way or another by the Bill's provisions as well as those who might have an input into the legislation. Naturally enough not every suggestion and view put forward was incorporated in the Bill &mdash; that would have been impossible given that differences of opinion exist even among those who profess the same ideals and share the same goals.</P>
    <P>However, consideration was given to every shade of opinion put forward by those consulted.  The Bill before the House is essentially that which was introduced in Seanad Éireann last March.  The Bill generated great interest and was the subject of lengthy debate in the Seanad and there were quite a few amendments to it on Committee and Report Stages in that House.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, its basic provisions remain the same.  Not every amendment tabled in the Seanad was accepted by me but I think it is fair to say that I adopted a very flexible approach in the matter and was quite amenable to changes which were considered to be for the betterment of the Bill, regardless of their origin.  The amendments to the Bill which I accepted in the Seanad have served to strengthen the legislation, while not detracting from or diluting its underlying principles. Indeed I commended the Members of Seanad Éireann for their interest in the Bill and for the remarkably constructive and lively debate which the Bill generated. I will now give the House a brief run-down on the main provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part I contains the normal provisions for interpretation by defining certain words and phrases which occur throughout the Bill and provides for the fixing of commencement dates for bringing into operation certain provisions in the Bill.  It provides also for the repeal of the existing legislation on dentistry, namely, the Dentists Act, 1928 and the Dentists (Amendment) Act, 1983.  This latter Act was enacted last year in order to extend <Col N="133" /> the term of office of the Dental Board. The board's five year term of office was due to expire in November 1983.</P>
    <P>In order to appoint a new membership of the board it would have been necessary to hold an election of registered dentists to fill their five places on the board.  Considering that the new Dentists Bill, which would abolish the Dental Board and involve another election of registered dentists to the new Dental Council, was about to be introduced it was thought preferable to extend the term of office of the existing Dental Board for a period of two years.  Under the 1928 Act there was no provision for extending the term of office of board members beyond the stipulated five years period &mdash; hence the need for the Dentists (Amendment) Act, 1983.  The extension of the period of office of the Dental Board served to avoid two elections of registered dentists being held within a relatively short period &mdash; the second election would possibly have generated little response from the profession and this would have got the Dental Council off to a bad start.  As well as this, the Dental Board were saved the expense of holding an election of registered dentists. Given the cost of these elections and having regard to their financial position at the time, the board were happy not to have to undergo the expense of an election.</P>
    <P>The dissolution of the Dental Board and their replacement by the new Dental Council are among matters provided for under Part II of the Bill.  In numbers and in composition the new Dental Council will differ greatly from the Dental Board. The council will have a total of 19 members whereas the existing board have only nine.  Of more significance is the make-up of the new council compared with the board.  The increased role of the council in the education and training of dentists is reflected in the representation given to educational interests.  Four members will represent the undergraduate teaching interests&mdash;two appointed by Trinity College, Dublin and two by University College, Cork.  The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland will appoint one member to the council to represent the <Col N="134" /> post-graduate teaching interests.  There will also be a nominee of the Minister for Education bringing the total educational representation to six on the 19 member council.  The present board have three of their nine members nominated by the Medical Council but there will be only two nominees of the Medical Council on the new Dental Council.  The reduced Medical Council representation and increased representation of educational interests reflects the increased independence and responsibility of the new council in relation to the education and training of dentists.  The practising profession will have seven representatives on the Dental Council elected by their fellow dentists as against five on the Dental Board.</P>
    <P>Although they have increased representation on the new council the elected dentists will not form a majority of members on the council as they do on the Dental Board at present.  Nevertheless the practising profession will form the biggest single group represented on the council.</P>
    <P>It was suggested in Seanad Éireann that health board dentists should have specific representation on the council. However, since they form approximately 25 per cent of the dentists registered in the State they are almost certainly going to have representatives on the council in any event &mdash; as they do at present on the Dental Board.  In fact their representation on the council seems assured considering that the elections of registered dentists by their fellow dentists will be by means of the single transferable vote, that is, by proportional representation. This provision was written into the Bill following an amendment tabled in Seanad Éireann and convincing arguments in its favour which I accepted. The remaining four places on the Dental Council will be filled by my own nominees. However, the Bill lays down that at least two of these must be non-dentists who will represent the interests of the general public as consumers of dental services.  This consumer representation is something that will be welcomed generally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="135" /> Part II also deals with committees of the council and provides that there shall be three particular committees dealing with the functions of the council in relation to education and training, fitness to practise and auxiliary dental workers.</P>
    <P>In regard to the make-up of the council there were representations made and, indeed, amendments were tabled in Seanad Éireann to change and extend the membership and to give representation on the council to various groups.  These included teachers organisations, students and auxiliary dental workers.  Considering that the primary function of the Dental Council is to regulate the dental profession &mdash; the actual delivery of dental services is not their function &mdash; the proposed make-up of the council is generally regarded as giving a reasonable balance of representation between the various interests involved.  These are broadly the educational, working profession and consumer interests as well as my own nominees.</P>
    <P>I accept that members of the teaching profession can play a valuable role in promoting dental health care among their pupils, but to have a representative of the profession on the Dental Council would be inappropriate in the light of the council's functions.  There would be nothing to prevent me from including a representative of students of auxiliary dental workers among my own nominees to the council but I would not agree with the idea of specific statutory representation for them under the provisions of the Bill.  If such groups were to be given places on the council there would be a problem &mdash; certainly in relation to auxiliary dental workers &mdash; in deciding which particular group of auxiliary workers should be represented and of deciding which organisations should be regarded as representing them.  I am satisfied that the composition of the council as detailed in the Bill is just about right in the present circumstances.  If at some future time due to changed circumstances it is found necessary to alter the make-up of the council there is provision for this in the Bill also.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="136" /> Part II also covers the make-up of the three specific committees of the council. There is provision for each class of auxiliary dental workers established under the Bill being allocated places on the committee of the council that will deal with auxiliary dental workers.</P>
    <P>The remainder of Part II deals with the setting up and staffing of the Dental Council and the various powers of the council including their power to charge fees for registration.</P>
    <P>Part III deals with the registration of dentists.  The provisions in relation to those entitled to registration in the basic register of dentists established under the 1928 Act are being changed to meet present day requirements.  For instance, the 1928 Act gave access to registration here to persons whose names appeared in the Commonwealth and foreign lists of the British Dental Register.  Since this provision is no longer relevant it has been omitted from the new legislation.  On the other hand, provision has had to be made for the registration here of nationals, of member states of the European Community who possess the necessary qualifications. We are obliged to recognise certain qualifications in dentistry issued by other member states under directives issued by the EC which came into effect here in 1980.  It is also obligatory under these directives to permit those who hold the recognised qualifications to practice dentistry anywhere in the EC.</P>
    <P>An agreement concluded in 1927 between this country and the United Kingdom and incorporated into the 1928 Dentists Act already provides for the mutual recognition of qualifications in dentistry issued in these islands.  In the light of our membership of the EC and our obligations under the EC directives on dentistry this agreement is no longer relevant and provision is made later in the Bill for its termination.</P>
    <P>There is provision also under Part III for the establishment of a register of dental specialists in addition to the basic register, should the Dental Council consider it desirable to set up such a register at some future date.  Registers of dental <Col N="137" /> specialists already exist in many countries, for example in France, West Germany, Holland, the USA and Canada. Orthodontists and oral surgeons are among the classes of specialists whose names would appear on such a register. The registration of specialists enables the general public to recognise those who are qualified and who specialise in particular branches of dentistry.  It also serves to permit the public to clarify whether or not any particular practitioner possesses the qualifications which he purports to possess.  There are persons who argue against specialist registration on various ground but I would like to make it clear that what I am introducing here is not the establishment of a specialist register. What I am doing is providing the enabling legislation which will facilitate its establishment at some future date if the Dental Council see fit to do so.  There is also a possibility that specialist registration could become mandatory here due to a directive of the EC and, if it did not already exist, new legislation would be required to put the directive into effect. On balance, it would be remiss of me not to make the enabling provision for specialist registration in this new legislation. There is a similar provision in the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978 but to date no register of medical specialists has in fact been established.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill, which covers education and training, sets out the duties of the council in relation to the education of dentists at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels.  The council are obliged to satisfy themselves as to the suitability of the education provided and as to the standards of education and clinical experience required for basic qualifications in dentistry in the dental schools in Dublin and Cork &mdash; that is to say at Trinity College, Dublin, and University College, Cork.  At present the Medical Council have certain powers in relation to undergraduate dental education which the new Bill assigns to the Dental Council so that the educational role of the council will be far more responsible than that exercised by the present Dental Board.</P>
    <P>The transfer of responsibility for dental <Col N="138" /> education from the Medical Council to the Dental Council is something which is long awaited and will be welcomed by both professions.  The Dental Council are also required under this part of the Bill to satisfy themselves as to the standards of postgraduate education and training in dentistry in the State.  It has duties also in relation to compliance with EC directives regarding minimum requirements for qualifications in dentistry in member states.  The council's responsibilities in relation to EC requirements regarding specialised dentistry are also set out in this part of the Bill.  As I said earlier, the standard of dentistry here in Ireland is second to none and this could hardly have been brought about if the standards of education and training here were not of the highest order also.  Attaining the minimum standards laid down by the EC will pose no problems for the council.  I know that the target of the council will be standards that are considerably higher than the minimum required by the EC.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill deals with the discipline of members of the profession.  It is indeed a rare occurrence to have disciplinary measures taken against a member of the dental profession.  Nevertheless, such provisions must be made in the interests of the general public and indeed in the interests of the profession.  The powers in relation to discipline which the new council will have will be far more wide-ranging than those enjoyed by the Dental Board at present.  The problem with the existing legislation is that the only disciplinary measure open to the Dental Board is the removal of a dentist's name from the register.  Obviously cases will arise where some disciplinary measure is warranted but where the rather drastic measure of removal from the register is not merited.  Under the new legislation there is provision for suspension of a dentist's name from the register for a period and the council can also advise, admonish or censure a dentist in relation to his professional conduct or attach conditions to his continued registration. Over the years difficulties have arisen about the constitutionality of the <Col N="139" /> disciplinary powers of registration councils and other such bodies.  Part V of the Bill has, therefore, been very carefully drafted to ensure that the powers of the Dental Council cannot be successfully challenged on constitutional grounds. The Bill provides for each disciplinary decision of the council being subject to the approval of the High Court either by means of an appeal by the dentist or by way of application to the court by the council in cases where no appeal is made. As well as disciplinary action arising out of professional misconduct the Bill also gives the council the authority to take disciplinary action against a dentist because of his unfitness to practise due to his physical or mental disability.  There is no such provision under the existing legislation.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill describes those persons who are entitled to practise dentistry in the State.  It excludes auxiliary dental workers from the general prohibition on the practice of dentistry by non-dentists subject to certain provisions which are set out in Part VII of the Bill.  The penalties for the illegal practice of dentistry, and for all other offences throughout the Bill, have been updated.</P>
    <P>Part VII of the Bill is where provision is made for the recognition and registration of classes of auxiliary dental workers. The Dental Council will have the power, subject to my approval, to determine the nature of the dental work an auxiliary worker may undertake and the circumstances under which it may be undertaken. As Deputies know, we already have dental mechanics and dental surgery assistants working here but neither category can be registered under the existing legislation. There are other classes of auxiliary dental workers in countries abroad who are trained to carry out procedures which it would be illegal for them to perform here under the existing legislation. Dental hygienists, for instance, can perform a very useful service and I would be anxious to see them introduced here.  The hygienists carry out certain clinical work such as the scaling and polishing of teeth but they are particularly useful in <Col N="140" /> instructing patients in preventive measures such as oral hygiene and dental health education generally.  The dental profession would welcome the introduction of hygienists here.  They could provide valuable assistance in private practice and could make a very significant contribution to the health board service by permitting the dentists to get on with the clinical work and not have their time taken up with oral hygiene instruction.</P>
    <P>The Bill will permit the establishment of a class of auxiliary dental workers fully trained and competent to supply dentures direct to persons of 18 years of age and over &mdash; they will not of course be permitted to perform any work on living tissue. It is important for me to stress that these auxiliary workers will have to be fully qualified in this particular area of dentistry. The Restrictives Practices Commission, following their inquiry in 1982 into the legal restriction of the supply of dentures to the public, came up with alternative recommendations, one of which was that there should be no restriction whatsoever on the supply of dentures direct to persons of 18 years of age and over provided it did not involve work on living tissue.  The second alternative of the commission was that the 1928 Dentists Act should be amended so as to provide that the general prohibition on the carrying on of dentistry by a non-dentist should not apply to the provision of dentures by a denturist to a person of 18 years of age or over provided it did not involve work done on living tissue.  It suggested that a denturist for this purpose would be the holder of qualifications recognised by regulations which the Minister for Health might make from time to time.  The commission opted for the first alternative.</P>
    <P>However, the Government felt that the complete de-restriction of the supply of dentures would not be in the best interests of the public and that the second alternative was preferable.  Consequently, the Bill has been drafted in such a way as to permit the implementation of the principle of the second alternative of the Restrictive Practices Commission. There has of course been considerable opposition to this on various grounds. <Col N="141" /> The introduction of a class of qualified denturist dealing directly with the public will not, however, result in a lowering of standards.  The fact that only qualified and competent persons will be allowed to deal with the public direct will in fact represent an improvement over the existing situation in which it is well known that certain persons are already operating in breach of the law.  The increased penalties for the illegal practice of dentistry, combined with the introduction of the new class of qualified denturists, should provide greater protection for the public from the activities of illegal operators. Preliminary moves towards the introduction of the new denturist class of auxiliary dental workers will be made as soon as possible after the Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>There is provision also under this part of the Bill for the Minister, if he sees fit, to make an order directing the council to exercise their powers in relation to the establishment of a particular class of auxiliary dental workers, either on a permanent basis or for a trial period.  Any order made by the Minister under these provisions must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and can be annulled by a resolution of either House.</P>
    <P>Part VIII of the Bill contains miscellaneous provisions including, in section 65, provision for the keeping in force for the time being of the agreement between this country and the United Kingdom, which I referred to earlier that is the agreement under which there is mutual recognition of qualifications in dentistry awarded in these islands.  The agreement is now obsolete in the light of our membership of the EC and it will be formally terminated as soon as the Bill is enacted. In fact correspondence with the UK authorities towards this end has already been initiated.</P>
    <P>There are two Schedules attached to the Bill one of which sets out the rules regarding membership and meetings of the Dental Council and covers such matters as tenure of office of members, resignations and termination of membership, casual vacancies, quorum, proceedings at meetings, etc.  The provisions are on the <Col N="142" /> lines of the normal rules governing this type of body.</P>
    <P>The other Schedule lists the primary qualifications in dentistry which are awarded in the State at present.</P>
    <P>The new Dentists Bill is primarily for the purpose of updating and improving the laws regulating the dental profession so before I conclude I think it appropriate that I should record my appreciation of the enormous contribution which the dental profession has made to our society.  Their dedication is not only to the clinical element in the delivery of dental treatment but also to the maintaining of the highest standards of dental education and training.  This was brought home to me when I saw the interest which all aspects of this new legislation generated among the profession generally. There were submissions made to me by many individual dentists as well as those which one might expect from such bodies as the Irish Dental Association and the Dental Board.  Many of the submissions from dentists in private practice were in relation to matters of an academic nature and this is the best illustration of the genuine interest of the profession in the new legislation.</P>
    <P>This legislation is long awaited and its provisions are of a non-controversial nature.  I would remind the House that the Bill is not about the delivery of dental services so that criticisms of the dental services, whether valid or not, are not really appropriate in the context of debate on this legislation.  The Bill as it now appears is the product of co-operation and compromise following widespread consultations and lengthy and informed debate in Seanad Éireann.  In the circumstances I would appreciate Deputies' co-operation in its speedy passage through this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has already been through the Seanad.  Some 50 amendments were proposed in the Seanad: the Minister accepted a number of them and he removed some of the more controversial parts from the Bill. The Bill now before us is not a controversial Bill.  I join with the Minister in paying <Col N="143" /> tribute to the Dental Board.  They have served the public and the dental profession well since 1928.  I also join with him in paying a tribute to the dental profession.  They are very conscientious in their work and they have been highly regarded in our own country and in the countries where they have worked.  If I have one regret it is that so many of them went abroad during the years to work when we would have been very pleased to have them work here.  This Bill will update existing legislation and this is to be welcomed.  It will bring us into line in the eighties, particularly in view of our EC membership.  It is appropriate that the Dental Council should have responsibility for the education of dentists.</P>
      <P>Section 4 deals with the establishment day.  As in the case of the Bill dealing with medical practitioners and the proposed nurses Bill I wonder why provision is not made to have the new council brought into operation on a specific date?  This legislation can go through this House, be signed by the President and yet it can lie there for quite some time.  In this kind of legislation there should be a specific time limit after the passage of the Bill, whether it be six or 12 months, when the new Act will come into operation.  In legislation like this where there has to be elections to a council it is necessary to allow sufficient time to set up the mechanism for the elections and to hold them, but nevertheless, a specific time limit should be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill enlarges the composition of the Dental Council from nine to 19.  It is balanced in that there are seven elected members from the dental profession, six representing educational interests, two representing the Medical Council and four representing consumers.  There have been representations from the dental auxiliaries that their group be represented. The Minister has pointed out that this is specifically a Bill to deal with the registration and regulation of the dental profession and I accept his reasoning on that.  However, in the four people representing the consumers he might <Col N="144" /> consider the possibility of having someone to represent groups that could be considered interested parties.  Senator Fallon recommended that the representative of the Minister for Education might be a member of the INTO.  While I accept that might not have a direct input into the education of dentists, it would be very valuable in bringing to the attention of the Dental Council the manpower needs in relation to the administration of dental services for children.</P>
    <P>Section 9(2) gives the Minister the power to alter the composition of the Dental Council.  That subsection states:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, by regulations made after consultation with the Council, vary the provisions of subsection (1) of this section.</P>
    <P>When a Bill goes through both Houses of the Oireachtas, and particularly on Committee Stage, it is well debated.  If the Houses of the Oireachtas decide in their wisdom that the composition is correct, I do not see why it is necessary for the Minister to have the power to change the composition.  If it is necessary to change the composition of the council at any time, the Minister could come before the Houses with amending legislation, something similar to what he did when he wanted to amend the provisions of the 1928 Act and to extend the period of office of the present Dental Board.  That is a much more satisfactory way of dealing with legislation, rather than giving the Minister power by regulation to make these changes.</P>
    <P>There will be three committees of the council dealing with education and training, with discipline, with fitness to practice and with the auxiliary dental workers.  It is important that the council should have responsibility for the training and education of dentists rather than as at present where the Medical Council have a major input in that regard.  I wonder what will be the future of the postgraduate medical and dental education council in the light of this legislation. Will it have any effect on it when responsibility for education is transferred to the Dental Council?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="145" /> Our dentists are excellent and compare favourably with any throughout the world.  That is to their credit because the buildings in which they worked were in a poor condition for many years.  In recent times we have had a modern dental hospital in Cork and we welcome this.</P>
    <P>The Minister explained why there is provision for a specialist register and he made it very clear that it will be the Dental Council who will decide if such a decision is made, when to implement that section of the Bill.  As the Minister said, there are specialist registers in various countries of the world, in the EC, the USA and Canada, mainly for oral surgeons and orthodontists.  The Minister has dealt fairly with that in that it will be a matter for the Dental Council themselves to decide if and when to introduce the specialist register.</P>
    <P>On the question of reciprocation, while we will be obliged to register dentists from the EC, I ask the Minister to let us know when he is replying if there is reciprocation with any other country.  I understand that our graduates are accepted in Australia and I wonder if we have reciprocation with other countries for the register of dentists, as we recognise qualifications from other countries outside the EC.</P>
    <P>Section 25 (f) provides for the council to charge a fee for giving a certificate of registration.  I wonder about the need for that section because such a provision appears in other similar legislation, but I understand that the dentist will receive a certificate of registration when he registers. I do not expect that that certificate will be given to anybody other than the dental surgeon.  If I were to ask for a certificate for somebody who is a dental surgeon I could not receive one in the same way as one could apply to, say, the Registrar of Births and Deaths and receive a certificate.  Therefore, I wonder if this section is necessary.</P>
    <P>On the question of the registration of dental surgery assistants, the working party recommended that they should be registered and should have proper training and that we should set up proper <Col N="146" /> training for them in this country.  The representatives of dental schools, the Dental Association, the health boards and the Department of Health on that working party recommended that we should have proper training facilities for them.</P>
    <P>The section dealing with fitness to practice extends the discretionary powers of the Dental Board.  This is to be welcomed because for over the last 50 years they have had the power only to erase a name from the register.  It is important both in the interest of the general public and in fairness to the dentists themselves that those powers should be extended to suspend or to attach conditions or to censure. I can see a dilemma for the Dental Board in that if a misdemeanour was not too great but deserved some sort of penalty the name would not be erased and then there would be no punishment, or perhaps somebody's name would be erased where a lesser punishment would have sufficed.  Some of the professions who have this type of legislation worry about the power of the fitness to practice committee regarding the alleged unfitness to engage in such practice by reason of physical or mental disability. Perhaps the wording of that sounds stark, but this is new to the Dental Board.  That subsection dealing with fitness to practice through physical or mental disability was not in it, but from experience anyone will find that that section is rarely if ever used and generally a person who would through physical or mental disability be unable to work would have given up work long before it would come to the attention of the particular registration council.  I do not think that anybody could point to any incident where that section has been used incorrectly in other legislation such as the Medical Practitioners Act which has a similar provision.  Another point on that section is that if a dentist's name is erased from the register the council are obliged to notify the Minister, as is provided in section 47 of the Bill, which provides that:</P>
    <P>The Council shall notify the Minister on the occasion of&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="147" /> (a) the erasure of the name...</P>
    <P>(d) the termination of a period of suspension...</P>
    <P>(e) the attachment of conditions...</P>
    <P>I wonder why the employer is not included.  If a dental surgeon was working, say, for a health board and his name was erased from the register I would consider that the health board should be notified of such erasure as well as the Minister and that where a dental surgeon is an employee of any organisation or hospital his employer would be notified that the name has been erased from the register.  There is the usual provision for appeal to the High Court, which is to be welcomed, and there is an obligation in this legislation on the Dental Council to go to the High Court and make a recommendation to erase the name and have the support of the High Court for such decision.</P>
    <P>The sections to which most of the debate in the Seanad was devoted were sections six and seven dealing with dental auxiliaries.  The Minister brought in amendments in the Seanad and removed much of the controversy, particularly in regard to the type of work which dental auxiliaries carry out.  The Dental Council will have responsibility for the reorganisation and recognition of the dental auxiliaries and the council will determine their training and qualifications.  I see no problem about that in the medium to long term.  In the short term what would be the position of persons who are working, perhaps some of them illegally, in regard to their recognition by the Dental Council as denturists?  Certainly we have no proper training in this country for these people at present.  The training in AnCO is very limited and there is need for proper training.  It is appropriate that the Dental Council should have responsibility for deciding on the type of training for these people and also the nature of work that they would carry out and to set up a register or licence system.  That <Col N="148" /> would be in the interests of the general public and the dentists.</P>
    <P>There are various opinions as to the type of work that dental auxiliaries might carry out.  The Minister told us that hygienists would polish and clean teeth and give advice on prevention.  I am sure that will be welcomed by the health boards who do not have sufficient dental surgeons to cope with the number of people who need dental treatment.  A lot of the time of dental surgeons is taken up doing jobs that could be done by the hygienists.  I am sure the dentists will welcome that provision.</P>
    <P>On the question of the extraction of teeth I wonder, while the Minister removed a controversial section in the Seanad, if in section 55 he still has the power to direct the council to set up a scheme under which the dental auxiliaries can extract teeth.  That is not clear in the section and, perhaps, the Minister will deal with that matter when replying.</P>
    <P>A former Minister for Health, now Leader of our party, Deputy Haughey, in 1979 when referring to an amendment to the 1928 Act said:</P>
    <P>In any amendment which might be made the welfare of the patient must take priority.  Dentists undergo a lengthy detailed and highly professional training before they are authorised to operate on the mouths of patients and I would not be prepared to lower legislative safeguards which are there to protect the general public.</P>
    <P>That view is as valid today as it was in 1979 and I am sure all the Members will agree with it.  That highlights the importance of having the type of work to be carried out by dental auxiliaries governed by a body such as the Dental Council who are broadly representative, and are qualified to look after the interests of patients and to set up the necessary scheme as they see fit.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Practices Commission inquiry in 1982 recommended that the Dentists Bill be amended to provide that the general prohibition on the carrying on of dentistry by a non-dentist should <Col N="149" /> not apply to the provision of dentures to a person of 18 years of age or over provided it does not involve work being done on living tissue.  They gave an alternative recommendation which the Minister has accepted.  All interests, including those of the auxiliaries, will be best served by having the responsibility vested in the Dental Council for any work the auxiliaries will do.  Training and education will have to be dealt with very rapidly after the establishment of the council.</P>
    <P>Section 55 gives the Minister wide ranging powers.  I accept that he amended it in the Seanad and provided that any regulation he would make would be the subject of an order to be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas when members would have the opportunity to revoke it if they so wished.  I wonder if there is power in the section for the dental auxiliaries to extract teeth.</P>
    <P>Under section 54 dental auxiliaries are precluded from doing any work on natural teeth or living tissue.  In that regard I wonder about the fitting of dentures.  In my view that would involve working on living tissue and I wonder, if the Minister is anxious to give auxiliaries the authority to fit dentures, it will be necessary to change that wording.  Gums are considered as living tissue.</P>
    <P>In general, we welcome the provisions of the Bill.  On Committee Stage we will table the amendments we consider necessary but, bearing in mind that 50 amendments were dealt with in the Seanad and that the Minister accepted a number of them, Committee Stage here will not merit the lengthy debate given to it in the Seanad.  The Bill is primarily concerned with the regulation of the practice of dentistry.  In the Seanad the Minister accepted that there were points in relation to the administration of the service that were important and interlinked with the establishment of the Dental Council.  For example, the emphasis must in future be on prevention.  All persons working in the dental service must be motivated by the prevention approach. I accept that dental surgeons are well motivated towards prevention.  Dental hygienists have an important role to play <Col N="150" /> in helping to prevent dental decay and they could be engaged to screen children for the health boards.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Dental Council will have a role to play in reconstituting the dental health foundation with the Health Education Bureau.  Fluoridation was introduced here almost 20 years ago and there is no doubt that it has resulted in a reduction in the level of dental caries.  Some sources say the reduction was as much as 50 per cent.  It is unfortunate that there are so many schemes where flouridation is not available due to a lack of funds. That matter should be given priority because of the value of fluoridation although I have read comments recently from Japan that they do not intend to follow our example and fluoridate the water there.</P>
    <P>A major problem that is relevant to the setting up of the Dental Council is the question of manpower in the dental services.  There is no doubt that the number of dentists registered here has increased considerably in the last 40 years, from 519 in 1941 to 1,048 in 1981. The ratio was 1:5,700 in 1941 and was 1:3,290 in 1981.  I understand that the position now is that there is one dentist to 2,234 adults and one dentist per 1,109 children.  I regret to say that in the constituency Cavan-Monaghan, which the Chair and I represent, we have only one dentist to 8,081 people.  That concerns me greatly.</P>

      <P>In the public health service in 1965 there were 88 dentists while in 1980, 204 were employed.  While the number of dentists has increased over the years nevertheless there is still a shortage of them.  I understand that in the region of 28 established posts with the health boards have not been filled.  This a matter of concern, although in the past the North-Western Health Board sponsored dental students to work in their own health board area.  The recent salary increase might make it more attractive for some dentists to work in their own country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="151" /> The health boards are not fulfilling their statutory obligations because of the inadequate number of dentists on their staff and because of insufficient funds in the <i>ad hoc</i> scheme in many areas, and there are some areas where dentists do not participate in the <i>ad hoc</i> scheme.  The Dental Association have been concerned about the fact that the <i>ad hoc</i> scheme has been in operation since 1979 and no permanent contract has yet been worked out.  It would be in the interests of the dental health of the nation if the Minister looked at this to see if a properly drawn up scheme could be agreed between the Department and the Dental Association. That would improve the situation.  The <i>ad hoc</i> scheme has been suspended in the Southern Health Board area through lack of funds.</P>
    <P>We spend a very small proportion of our health budget on dental services compared with other countries.  In 1983 we spent £12.5 million, which represented 1.25 per cent of the budget for the public service, and if we include the private dental service, that figure increases to 2 per cent.  Australia spends 11 per cent, Denmark 8 per cent, West Germany 10 per cent and the United Kingdom 5 per cent.  We are very far down that list.  This is something that should also be looked at.</P>
    <P>The extension of the dental services to those between the ages of 12 and 16 years is very desirable.  Dependants of insured workers do not have access to dental services on their husband's insurance. This is of concern to all.  It would be very desirable if we transferred responsibility for all health matters from the Department of Social Welfare to the Department of Health, especially the dental and optical services which would be more appropriately administered by the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>I received a letter on behalf of the parents of pupils of Lucan boys' national school who are concerned about the waiting list for appointments which is so great that a child who requires a filling must wait up to six months to make an appointment. Very often by that time the tooth <Col N="152" /> is beyond saving or the parents have paid to have the tooth filled privately, at great cost.  This highlights the difficult situation in the administration of the dental services.</P>
    <P>I thank the Chair for his forbearance if I move from the Bill, but because of the implications, particularly in terms of education and manpower, it is important that we make passing reference, as I did, to our existing dental services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a few observations on this Bill.  In the Minister's words, this Bill aims at the advancement of the standards of the practice of dentistry and the safeguarding of the general public.  This is a very comprehensive measure which seeks to regulate practices in this area.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to the area of regulation, but with particular application to this measure.  This is an area to which we have not given a great deal of thought but one is struck by the amount of legislation, and the detail of the legislation, which seeks to regulate increasingly almost any area of commerce or human interaction.  We should bear in mind that inevitably we are incorporating in legislative statute a philosophy about the way the affairs of commerce and social and economic behaviour should be regulated. There is a philosophic question in that and I am not sure it has ever been properly debated or discussed in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a move towards deregulation in other countries.  One needs at least minimal regulation, but in this Bill there are a number of references which are hard to justify &mdash; the need for approval by the Minister, to seek the consent of the Minister and so on.  There seems to be an obsession with the need for central control in an area which in an ideal world would be self-regulated and, even in this less than perfect world, might arguably do with some degree less regulation than is potentially possible in this measure, although I accept in practice that it is probable that the full potential of regulatory power and control will not operate in the normal way.  I wanted to make the point that a lot of the legislation coming <Col N="153" /> before us has this desire to regulate, and I wonder about it because it will inevitably pose very serious problems relating to enforcement, the cost of such bureaucracy and individual freedoms.</P>
    <P>Provided the Dáil asks and answers these questions I am reasonably satisfied to go along with the conclusions but we should not allow ourselves to slide gently on a raft of legislation over a number of years into a very tightly, too closely regulated area where we find that gradually individual freedoms have been eroded and expenses have soared because of such regulation which may or may not be necessary.  That basic question underlies this Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill is the replacement of the Dentist Act, 1928.  In the Seanad the Minister accepted a very comprehensive range of amendments which strengthened the measure and sought to bring reasonable order into this area.  The Dental Association and other professional bodies should be involved wherever possible in pre-emptive self-regulation.  I believe it is far better for professions to regulate their own affairs, to discipline their members and to insist on their own standards rather than bringing the State, with its cumbersome and expensive machinery, into the area.</P>
    <P>In this case, for a variety of reasons we are well into the area of regulating the practices and procedures in the dentistry field.  The Bill got a very general welcome from almost everybody associated with this subject, but even within this ambit a great deal of responsibility for regulating will fall on the new Dental Council.  I am far from impressed with the degree to which other professional associations have managed to order their affairs when dealing with complaints from consumers about members of their own profession. I urge therefore that the Dental Council be very rigorous, through and absolutely just in their dealings with their members and with consumer interests.  If they set that example at the outset we will be assured that the composition of the Dental Council is correct and that this Bill is appropriate.</P>
    <P>In the Seanad the Minister said that <Col N="154" /> statutory registration is to the mutual benefit and advantage of the general public and the practitioner.  That is true to a very large extent, but it is not necessarily always to the benefit of either the practitioner or the public unless the standards and criteria which apply are extremely just and open to some kind of public scrutiny.</P>
    <P>When I see a move to have statutory registration and regulation, inevitably I come to the conclusion that costs to the consumer will increase.  I hope that will not be the case here.  It is reasonable that we should have this type of regulation, because this is an area of medical health or health care.  Therefore, the standards which we apply must be clear and precise and there can be no deviation from them. It is fair to say that over the years such standards have applied, particularly in the areas of dentistry.  As a practising public representative, unlike the number of complaints received about other professions, I do not remember receiving even one complaint about dentists.  That is not to say that there may not have been complaints, but they did not come to me. In essence, a statutory regulation is a good thing to a large extent but there are some dangers implicit in it and I hope that will be borne in mind and that after a reasonable period of time we should look again at the effects of this Bill to see whether fears that some of us, and the dentists' professional association and many individual dentists have are not proved justified.  One would be the fear of a closed shop or a monopoly where a Dental Council dominated by the dental profession would draw up standards and insist on criteria which would be principally self-suiting.  I know that is not the wish of the dentists' professional association at present and they are taking great pains to spell this out for anyone who wants to listen.  They are interested in ensuring that this Bill will work.  However, that <i>caveat</i> must be entered, that where one tends towards a monopoly there are dangers about which all of us should be alert and in respect of which we should take appropriate action.</P>
    <P>Leaving that small qualification or <Col N="155" /> doubt to one side, the area of statutory registration is important and is welcome if it genuinely seeks &mdash; and in day to day operation acts &mdash; to protect the consumer and improve, if possible, standards in the general area.  I do not know if there are cost implications involved and whether it is likely that because of the relatively new strictures which would apply to the registration of dentists, with all the accompanying bureaucracy, costs would arise which inevitably would be passed on to the public.  If there are such costs, I would be grateful to hear about them and would appreciate if the Minister might mention whether consideration had been given to that aspect.  It is unreasonable, I presume, to expect the dentists to accept a burden of costs which arises from the State seeking to enforce regulations upon them.  If it is unreasonable to ask them to do so, then somebody else must pay the bill and that may be the taxpayer.  I do not know if that is a significant matter but I would appreciate some comment from the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is another option to this kind of measure which seeks to regulate, in close detail, every facet of the dentist's business, right down to insisting on writing into legislation, for example, that members of the council and people writing to the council are notified by post-paid envelope and all the minutiae and detail contained in the Bill.  There is a philosophy which says you could reasonably allow for the operation of what one might call in the economic area free market forces, given strong consumer legislation and extremely severe penalties for transgressions.  The old adage of <i>caveat emptor</i> would normally apply in the commercial, retail or certain other areas.  It is reasonable to hold it in suspension to some extent in the area of medical wellbeing, where the repercussions of a bad decision could be critical, indeed, in the area of one's health.  Under my hypothesis, there would be strong consumer legislation on the books and any transgressions which were proved would be subject to very heavy penalties, indeed.  That is another alternative to the <Col N="156" /> idea of very tight regulations as contained in the Bill.  I paint this scenario because I worry about extremely closely written Bills of this very comprehensive nature from the enforcement point of view.  I do not know how this Bill will be enforced. I do not believe that it is open to easy enforcement.  There are so many areas of possible transgression in every section of the Bill that I honestly believe it to be a Bill which will be extremely difficult to enforce.  Any measure which is difficult to enforce or which is not likely to be enforced should be brought in here only as a last resort.  The other resort is one that I commend for consideration, not in opposition of this measure, which is essentially a good Bill, but there is an alternative method which would work in the area of minimal regulation and the protections previously mentioned.  Those protections do not now exist and perhaps the Bill points the right way.</P>
    <P>Consumer interest concerns me, even in the context of the make-up of the Dental Council.  The consumer interest is represented by the appointment of two nominees of the Minister representing, broadly speaking, that area of interest. Might that be looked at again?  It might be in the best interests of the council, the profession in general and the public if that area were to be improved.  The council are dominated either by nominees of the dentists themselves or by allied areas of professional interest &mdash; one might even say with no sense of hurt involved &mdash; of self-interest.  That is quite right.  Where else would a repository of standards and criteria for application in this area be except among the profession?  The council have other obligations.  They are charged with an enormous amount of work and I am sure we all wish them well in carrying out that function.  To what extent may there be some dissatisfaction about the degree of consumer representation? I wonder if the Minister might like to think about that again.</P>
    <P>The make-up of the membership of the new council is comprehensive in some respects.  There will be four members appointed by the undergraduate educational institution, one member by post <Col N="157" /> graduate interests and a nominee of the Minister for Education.  The number of representatives of the practising profession elected by their colleagues would be increased from five to seven.  While this would not give them a majority on the council, as is the case on the present Dental Board, it will nevertheless ensure that the practising profession will form the single largest group on the council. Two members of the new council will be nominated by the Medical Council which has three representatives on the Dental Board at present.  The reduced Medical Council representation reflects the increased independence and responsibility of the Dental Council in the matter of the education and training of dentists.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in the Seanad that the remaining four places on the new council will be filled by his nominees and that at least two of these would be non-dentists, representing the general public as consumers of dental services. Although this is in line with the provisions of the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978 giving similar representation on the Medical Council to consumers of medical services, I am not sure that it goes far enough.  If the Minister is quoting the Medical Council Act, then with respect I think he should be consistent and apply it in relation to matters to which I shall come in a moment.</P>
    <P>The Dental Council must be seen to work.  One way of doing that might be to consider increasing the two out of 19 specifically consumer orientated representatives. I appreciate that every other one of the other x 17 has, to some extent, an interest in protecting the consumer also, but their primary obligation and the cap which they wear principally is not that of the consumer.</P>
    <P>Because of the major responsibilities entrusted to the council, I should like to ask the Minister whether adequate thought has been given to ensuring that the council are facilitated in doing their job.  For example, will the council need funding?  They will at least need money to pay the travelling and subsistence expenses incurred in connection with meetings.  If, as the Bill implies clearly, <Col N="158" /> the council are to become involved in the area of regulating access to their registers and on occasion to deregistering or censuring in some other way, there will be a good deal of expense involved, including the area of legal action and representation in the courts if necessary since the High Court would be involved in one or two areas.  I am not aware of provision in that respect for the coming year.  While I would not purport to speak on behalf of the dentists, I am sure they too would be interested in this matter of funding. Except in some relatively elite areas, professional associations are operated largely by way of voluntary help, by hard working people who in that way serve both their profession and their country well.</P>
    <P>When we are setting up a comprehensive council of this nature and assigning them the range of responsibilities as outlined, we should not expect them to be all dressed up without giving them the expenses involved in travelling to their destinations.  Therefore, the question of funding arises and I shall be interested in hearing whether the Minister has given consideration to this aspect.</P>
    <P>I note that the term of office for the council is to be five years with no member being allowed to serve for more than two terms.  Perhaps there would be an advantage in providing for some kind of rolling membership &mdash; in other words, ensuring some continuity.  I suggest for consideration the possibility of maintaining some echelon of membership while some members are being changed by regulation.  In this way we would eliminate the possibility of an entirely different body being elected every five or ten years. We must have regard to the good relations that those who had been in office for a term would have established with other medical agencies and subsidiary organisations.  Perhaps if we regulate for a situation in which three, four or five members would change every number of years, we would overcome this problem. The Dental Council will have to be both strong and effective and we can ensure this by legislating for the necessary funding and power.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="159" /> Throughout the Bill there are references to such phrases as &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister&rdquo;, &ldquo;by direction of the Minister&rdquo; and &ldquo;with the Minister's approval&rdquo;. These kinds of clauses in legislation always concern me.  In this case they make it clear that if the council do not act as the Minister wishes they may be dismissed.  Inevitably the State will seek those kind of central safeguards, but if we were to provide for such control in every piece of legislation we would end up with a very expensive bureaucratic maze whereby every act from the boiling of an egg to the capping of one's tooth would be subject to some regulation which in turn might be subject to a number of different regulations and all adding up to an enforcement problem of gigantic dimensions with the inevitable expensive bill for the taxpayer.  We had an example of this this morning in the apparently innocuous legislation relating to the unfortunate potato growers who are now to be regulated.</P>
    <P>In the sort of case we are dealing with, regulations and controls should be minimal, no more than what are necessary to safeguard public health.  In a democratic and free society we do not need maximum control, but if we are to have such control the case for it should first be proven by the State.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals, too, with the registration of dentists.  There is provision for the establishment of a register of dental specialists should the council consider that desirable.  The registration of specialists is of benefit to the public in enabling them to identify who are qualified and who are not.  However that area of control should be monitored carefully because, despite good motives, a professional group, whether dentists, doctors, politicians or others, will often believe that exclusively they have a monopoly of concern, care or wisdom in their area. Either accidentally or deliberately they could slip into a form of regulation which would serve their own interests principally.</P>
    <P>I am always anxious in regard to professional groups whose job it is to regulate <Col N="160" /> in respect of people who might be applying for membership of the group.  However, this council are to be sufficiently comprehensive to be able to take on board such fears, to ensure that they are without foundation.  Any piece of legislation which involves such regulation, where the dominant interest are the profession themselves, is open to suspicion and concern.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that the Dental Council are to be asked to undertake responsibility in the area of education. Their duties are spelled out in relation to undergraduate and postgraduate education. That is heartening.  I hope the voice of the council will be strong and effective in that respect.  In the Seanad debate a number of important points were made on this important matter of the educational role, including the need for an educational role in the general area of dental health.  With the exception of work done by the Health Education Bureau or some particularly interested teachers, the general field is one of attempts at curative action.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the Dental Council, the profession generally and the good interests of the consumer would demand that there be a very strong preventive campaign in relation to dental health. Unfortunately, statistics in Ireland in this respect do not give cause for comfort.  In the eight to nine year age group, 60 per cent are found to have dental decay which is untreated while the corresponding figure for 13 to 14-year-olds is 37 per cent. The joint working party emphasised the importance of giving priority to the preventive aspect of dental care.  They stressed that the establishment of an improved dental service in the absence of a preventive philosophy was unlikely to bring about an improvement in the overall dental health of the community.  Therefore, the area of prevention should commend itself to the council.  I do not envisage it as being the prime responsibility of the council but they should have something to say in that respect.</P>
    <P>The causes of this dental misfortune are not difficult to ascertain.  Basically they are due either to maleducation or to <Col N="161" /> no education in respect of the dietary habits of children.  I recall endeavouring, during my teaching days to persuade some schools to give up the practice of having a tuck shop.  I have nothing against tuck shops as such but inevitably they are laden with very sugary sweets, which cause decay in children's teeth, instead of being laden with the perhaps less attractive but more healthy foods such as fruit.  I wish the council well in their educational role and I appeal to them in advance to take on the job of suggesting to the public generally and to the Government of the day that there is a need for a preventive campaign in respect of dental health.</P>
    <P>We need a proper dental service for 900,000 children.  We have a service catering for about 600,000 children who are eligible.  We need a community dental service for about 600,000 fully eligible adults.  Our services are less than satisfactory. Although we have one dentist for about 3,500 people it does not compare well with certain parts of Europe, but I suppose we could take some solace from the fact that there are other parts of Europe and the world which are so undeveloped as to bring home to us the fact that in their estimation dental care is very far down their lists, so we cannot be too negative about it.  However, I repeat that £1 worth of prevention would be as good as £1,000 worth of attempted cure.  I encourage all those involved to develop that philosophy.  There is no reason why school curricula should not be changed to embody as an essential the teaching of proper hygiene and health care.  I have often wondered why the root of a Latin verb was considered to be more important to a boy than how to wash himself. That remains the position despite some progress in the general area.</P>
    <P>It is very important that from the outset the Dental Coucil would make their ground-rules very clear and act swiftly and with ruthlessness where it is necessary. There will not be any obligation on them to publish an annual report, but I suggest that communication with the public in regard to the work and the standards they will be applying would be good <Col N="162" /> in itself.  It would help us all to understand how they will come to grips with their work.  I hope they will consider issuing regular reports on their progress.  These could embody references to how they will be coping with problems which come to them because such problems will relate directly to the confidence the public and the Government will have in the way they operate.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about registration.  Inevitably it means that by giving these powers we are entrusting the council with responsibility for deciding who will and who will not practise dentistry.  We are accepting that some people will not be allowed to register or that they may be deregistered, probably for the best reasons in all cases.  However, we should consider very carefully the implications in regard to people's livelihoods, their right to earn a living in their profession.</P>
    <P>There is legislation to protect the consumer &mdash; possibly it is inadequate &mdash; and a strengthening of that might help the work of the Dental Council.  It would help if ordinary citizens were given easy recourse to litigation in the event that they felt they had been hard done by by any professional body or individual, whether he be a dentist, a doctor or an optician.  Such a framework of law is not available now and therefore the option of a regulating body has been introduced, a reasonable proposition which I support in principle.  Consideration has been given to the constitutional implications in regard to registration, and other bodies dealing with the regulation of certain specialists. We know of instances in which the exercise of these powers has been found to be unconstitutional.  The Minister has given much thought to that and believes that the provisions in the Bill would not give rise to any constitutional actions.</P>
    <P>I am more concerned about the spirit behind this, the matter of ensuring that anybody who is reasonably entitled to do so would be allowed to practice and that the Dental Council would not feel the need to be over-protective about safeguarding the livelihood of their members. I know that is in line with the philosophy <Col N="163" /> expounded at present by the Dental Board.  I should like to see the Dental Council referring to this in one of their early reports.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the setting up of auxiliary dental workers, dental hygienists and all the possibilities which the council will afford to this end &mdash; the possibility of drawing up lists of specialists and categories.  This debate gives us an opportunity to refer briefly to the only discordant note that has arisen in relation to this measure.  It relates to the views expressed by the Irish Association for Dental Prothesists.  They have suggested that denturists, as they will be called in this Act, will be put in a vulnerable position. There are about 250 of those whose practice has been to make impressions and to manufacture and fit dentures directly.  They fear &mdash; it must be put on the record somewhere &mdash; that the powers of the new Dental Council may disadvantage them in relation to continuing their livelihoods.  It is well founded.</P>
    <P>They have suggested, and it is worth considering, a provision in earlier legislation which allowed for people who had been practising satisfactorily for a period, say the last seven years, operate under the general guidelines of the Dental Council.  That applied in the Opticians Bill, 1956 whereby persons who could prove that they had been practising for seven years as opticians would be allowed to qualify as opticians.  Dental technicians have been asking why they would not be allowed to qualify as denturists in the same way.  It may not be possible to do it as easily as that, but they have a point.</P>
    <P>When the Minister introduced this Bill in the Seanad he cited earlier legislation as a reason why he could not pursue a certain line of action.  I think the case made by the dental technicians is not unreasonable.  I am not talking about people involved in extractions or in dealing with live tissue, the expression used here, or crowns or bridges, but people who have made their livelihoods by simply manufacturing and fitting dentures. Those people should get the most <Col N="164" /> sysmpathetic consideration possible from the new council.  That body of men and women have been giving a service. Unfortunatley, they may not have the same training and qualifications as their European counterparts.  In the Netherlands, for example, there is a training period of five years whereas here it is something like six months.  Nobody could approve of that, but when we introduce regulations to ensure a proper standard of public service we should be careful to ensure that people who have practised satisfactorily would not be shut out totally. I ask the Minister to look at that specific point.  He has met this group and they say they had a good meeting with him.  In support of their claim they said that a restrictive practices inquiry in 1982 found in their favour.  It recommended that section 45 of the Dentists Act, 1928 should be amended to provide that the general prohibition on the carrying on of dentistry by non-dentists should not apply to the provision of dentures to persons of 18 years of age or over.  They have a case. in the context of the debate here and in the Seanad that case was not put forcibly.  I want to put on the record so that the Minister can consider it.</P>

      <P>I propose, a Cheann Comhairle, to make a statement on my meeting with the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, in Chequers on 18 and 19 November.  The meeting was attended on the Irish side by the Tánaiste, Deputy Dick Spring, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Peter Barry.  The Prime Minister was accompanied by the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, QC, MP, and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Douglas Hurd, MP.</P>
      <P>Deputies have available to them in the Dáil Library a copy of the agreed communiqué issued after the meeting.  The text of that communiqué summarises our conclusions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I should say that I and <Col N="165" /> my colleagues approached this meeting with the same seriousness of purpose and sense of responsibility which as participants in the New Ireland Forum we and the members of other parties brought to our joint efforts to promote peace and stability against a background of terrible human suffering in Northern Ireland, before which all party differences must in the common interest be set aside.  It is in the same spirit, and with the same concern for national solidarity &mdash; so essential for any successful outcome &mdash; that I report to the Dáil today on this meeting.</P>
    <P>Before going on to deal in more detail with the meeting I should, I believe, set it in context.  That context is provided by the proposals for a framework within which a new Ireland could emerge set out in paragraph 5.2 of the Forum Report. That paragraph, containing as it does the only proposals in this report, constitutes the operational section of the report.  It describes the fundamental criterion for any new structures and processes as being their capacity to provide lasting peace and stability.  Having rejected violence it goes on to recognise that the new Ireland which the Forum seeks can come about only through agreement and must have a democratic basis and that agreement means that the political arrangements for a new and sovereign Ireland would have to be freely negotiated and agreed to by the people of the North and by the people of the South.  There is no room for any ambiguity here as to the need for consent by the people of both areas to any change in sovereignty.  The Provisional IRA thesis which denies this concept of consent is explicitly rejected once and for all by those who participated in the Forum and signed its report.</P>
    <P>The Forum report goes on to assert that new arrangements must provide structures and institutions, including security structures, with which both Nationalists and Unionists can identify on the basis of political consensus; such arrangements must overcome alienation in Northern Ireland and strengthen the stability and security for all the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="166" /> The programme for action set out by the unanimous will of the four main constitutional Nationalist parties in this island in these proposals must provide the basis for any discussions or any negotations with the British Government or with the parties in Northern Ireland, as we pursue the fundamental objectives for which the Forum was established &mdash; the achievement of lasting peace and stability in a new Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the preparations for this meeting with the British Prime Minister and her Cabinet colleagues and at the meeting itself it has been my purpose, and that of the Tánaiste and the Minister for Foreign Affairs accompanying me, to seek to establish common ground with the British Government on these objectives of the Forum.</P>
    <P>A first step in making any progress in this direction must be an acceptance that the achievement of lasting peace and stability in Northern Ireland is not merely an Irish interest but is a major interest of both Ireland and Britain.  Recognition of this is set out in the communiqué following this meeting.</P>
    <P>Next, if progress is to be made, the divisions between the two communities in Northern Ireland have to be diminished and the two major traditions that exist in the two parts of Ireland have to be reconciled.  This, too, is specifically recognised in the communiqué.</P>
    <P>Next, it is necessary that the focus of chapter five of the Forum report on the need to accept the validity of both the Nationalist and Unionist identities, and on the need to give them equally satisfactory, secure and durable expression and protection, should be accepted as the only basis on which lasting stability can be found.  This, too, has been given clear expression in the communique in which the British Government have joined with the Irish Government for the first time in recognising that here lies the fundamental problem that we both have to tackle in conjunction with the constitutional representatives of the people of Northern Ireland.  It may be noted that at her press conference the Prime Minister referred <Col N="167" /> to the equal respect due to these two identities.</P>
    <P>All of us in this House are agreed that in the past the process of government in Northern Ireland has not been such as to provide the people of both communities with the confidence that their rights will be safeguarded; the minority community, in particular, has had bitter experiences in this respect.  There can be no progress unless the process of government in Northern Ireland is such as to provide the people of both communities with the confidence that their rights will be safeguarded. Again this conviction, shared by us all, finds clear and unambiguous expression in this precise form in the list of points upon which the Prime Minister and myself agreed during the course of these discussions and recorded in the communiqué.</P>
    <P>Intimately connected with these issues is the question of security.  There is at present no real security in Northern Ireland. The majority community are being subjected to an inhuman campaign of murder, which they cannot but see as having genocidal overtones.  All of them have been put in fear of their lives.  They know that they are never safe from the bullet and the bomb employed indiscriminately to murder people at worship, to shoot down judge's daughter on her way from Mass, or to blow to pieces innocent people just because they happen to be about their business in a place and at a time when terrorists decide to mount an indiscriminate explosion.</P>
    <P>But what has needed to be recognised in Britain more clearly than it has hitherto been recognised is the fact that for the minority too there is no such thing as security in Northern Ireland.  Many members of the minority live in areas which are not the subject of normal policing because the police force as at present constituted do not have the confidence of a substantial part of the population. People living in these areas have no protection against the violence and intimidation of the subversive organisations operating their protection rackets and threatening with mutilation or death <Col N="168" /> anyone who does not go along with their campaign of murder directed against the majority community.  At the same time, because the efforts of the security forces have been concentrated against the IRA and the INLA, more especially in recent years when these organisations have, overwhelmingly, been the source of violence in the community, the people of these areas are subjected to a degree of harassment by the security forces, which, especially in the case of the younger generation, has been eroding their confidence in any form of public order and their belief that their human rights will be safeguarded by the rule of law.</P>
    <P>No community can survive if the system of security and, indeed, the judicial process itself lacks the confidence of a substantial part of the population.</P>
    <P>These things must be changed if peace and stability are to be secured.  A system of security must be provided deriving its authority from a political system with which those sections of the community can identify.  It is about these grave matters, upon which peace and stability in this island ultimately depend that I, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have been conferring with the British Prime Minister and her Secretaries of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affarirs and for Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Much remains to be done before the process thus commenced can be brought to a satisfactory conclusion, as it must be if our two Governments are to be seen to carry out their duty to the people of Northern Ireland, the victims of a history they did not write but the tragic consequences of which they read about day by day, day after day, or suffer in their own persons.</P>
    <P>I am glad that in the discussions that we have had we have made progress in securing the acceptance by the British Government of those aspects of the Forum report to which I have already referred.  I would add that I am also glad that the Prime Minister in the House of Commons this afternoon recognised the need for a stable political framework <Col N="169" /> which will be acceptable to both communities. Similarly, at her press conference she also recognised the need for an improvement in security in Northern Ireland &mdash; defined by the Prime Minister as including the prison and judicial systems as well as policing &mdash; on a basis which in her words &ldquo;must be very much better for all the citizens of Northern Ireland&rdquo; than what now exists and which involves devising &ldquo;a way that is acceptable to all the people there, and it must be acceptable&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;if it is to be improved&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We can, I believe, build something worthwhile on these principles.  There would be little hope of building anything were these principles of acceptability of the political framework and the security system to both communities not to be part of the common ground between our two Governments.</P>
    <P>Progress now depends upon the dialogue to which both Governments have publicly committed themselves as a preliminary to a further meeting between the Prime Minister and myself early in the new year.  I can assure this House that in this dialogue we will not be found wanting in our openness to any ideas that may further the objectives of the Forum report as I cited them at the outset of my remarks.  I hope that on the British side there will be a similar openness and that the British Government, like our Government, will place above any other consideration the objective to which the Forum parties set themselves &mdash; the achievement of lasting peace and stability.</P>
    <P>As will be clear from what I have said, the outcome of the summit is not to be underestimated in the extent to which common ground now exists between the British Government and ourselves on a number of underlying principles raised in the Forum report.  It is, however, necessary also to acknowledge frankly that important differences remain to be overcome between the British and ourselves and many difficult practical issues would have to be resolved before the objectives of a new political framework and new security arrangements commanding the <Col N="170" /> assent of the minority as well as the majority community could be realised.</P>
    <P>The dialogue in which we are engaged is but the latest of many efforts to find peace and stability in Ireland.  The fact that the Irish Government are now involved with the British Government in a new, intense effort, based on the work of the Forum report, is in itself an achievement. If this effort is to succeed, generosity will be required on all sides.  As we embark on the crucial and critical phase of the discussions, I ask for the support of all who wish Ireland well and who share our passionate desire for lasting peace and stability in the island of Ireland and for a relationship of friendship and trust between the peoples of both islands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the Taoiseach at the press conference and to what he has said now, I wonder whether words mean anything.  It is of crucial importance that we endeavour to assess the present position in regard to Northern Ireland, its status as an issue in Anglo-Irish relations and what, after Chequers, are the prospects for the future.</P>
      <P>The summit, in particular the British Prime Minister's press conference following it, can only be seen by a reasonable person as a defeat for Irish nationalism of historic dimensions.  The way the Forum report, its analyses and conclusions have been totally and completely rejected by the British Government is only part of the picture, only one element of what amounted to a complete disaster.  The language used in rejecting the combined wisdom of Irish constitutional Nationalist politicians was of a brutality far beyond anything called for by the circumstances. Much more was said and promulgated at that press conference which will go down in history as one of the black spots in Anglo-Irish relations.</P>
      <P>The Unionist position in Northern Ireland has been copperfastened in detail in a way that has not been witnessed in modern times.  Nationalist hopes and aspirations of even the most modest kind have been trampled into the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="171" /> There was no mention of an Irish dimension to the problem of Northern Ireland, no mention of any role or part of any kind for an Irish Government in helping to find a solution.  There was no mention of power sharing.  Yesterday's summit between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister was one of the most depressing and humilitating meetings between heads of Government that I can ever recall.</P>
    <P>The report of the New Ireland Forum, the carefully considered view of the democratic Nationalist representatives of three-quarters of the Irish people was unceremoniously and aggressively rejected by the British Prime Minister and this rejection was accepted without a whisper of remonstration from the Taoiseach.  There can be no escape from the dismal fact that constitutional nationalism took a beating yesterday and the evasiveness and incoherence of the Taoiseach in his press conference afterwards served only to accentuate that humiliating reality.</P>
    <P>When we recall some of the things that were assiduously fed out and canvassed before the meeting, we can begin to grasp the fraudulent nature of the Government, their propaganda and those who serve them.  In an election speech on 18 November 1982 the Taoiseach proclaimed that a complete and radical rethinking of British policy was now needed, and needed quickly, if the situation was to be retrieved from a drift towards chaos.  He said that it must be the purpose and prime objective of the Government elected to office on 14 December to secure from the British Government a recognition of the need for such a radical review of their policy while there is yet time to save the situation. It was evident from the whole tone and quality of the British Prime Minister's press conference that whatever rethinking has taken place it was not directed towards political progress or towards a solution of the Northern Ireland problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice claimed at Béal na mBláth on 26 August 1984 that <Col N="172" /> the present indications are that London has come to share our sense of urgency about this problem and that this sense of urgency must be transformed into a major Anglo-Irish initiative.  A sense of urgency?  A major Anglo-Irish initiative? We were told by the British Prime Minister that the situation was not new, that it had lasted for generations and centuries and that it would drag on.  Béal na mBláth is clearly a long way from Chequers.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs claimed on 23 July that Britain is now more interested in solving the Northern Ireland problem than at any time in the past ten years.  At the press conference yesterday such an interest was no more in evidence than the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>

    </P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach, in an interview with <i>Newsweek</i> on 24 September stated:</P>
      <P>We have identified the problem as the alienation of the minority in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>He claimed that for the first time the British now recognise the alienation of the minority so that we are now approaching the problem in the same perspective. However, Mrs. Thatcher explicitly rejected any such concept.  She stated:</P>
      <P>Well, this word alienation has come in somehow in the last year and I'm bound to say that as far as my information is concerned one could not find alienation... somehow this word alienation has crept into the vocabulary &mdash; I don't think it is a very good one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, as late as 20 October in an interview in <i>The Irish Times</i> the Taoiseach claimed that the British and Irish Governments had a similar analysis of what the problem is.  It is now quite obvious that there is no basis for that claim.  It was fraudulent.  The alienation of the Nationalist community, which was <Col N="173" /> perhaps the basic premise of the Forum report, has been totally rejected by the British Prime Minister.  Worst of all, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs had claimed that there could be some dramatic breakthrough at the summit.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, at the British-Irish Association on 15 September 1984, claimed that one way or another our relations are about to be transformed.  Transformed they have been &mdash; to the clear disadvantage of all the people in this country who want to see the problem of Northern Ireland solved.</P>
    <P>Nor did the British Prime Minister hesitate to castigate those who roused expectations about the British response to the Forum report.  All those media manipulators around the Taoiseach have discovered the hard way that floating stories in a domestic media can be counter-productive. The fostering of illusions about British interests, goodwill, receptiveness, 20 year treaties and personal preferences led to a cold, calculated reprimand by the British Prime Minister for master and servant.</P>
    <P>A rebuff to the Taoiseach is one thing, but let us now look at the rebuff to the Forum.  Yesterday the British Prime Minister rejected not merely the conclusion of the report and the other constitutional models outlined, but also every single thesis of consequence contained in the report.  She also threw out the realities and the requirements which had been so often emphasised by the Taoiseach.  The central thesis of the New Ireland Forum report was a rejection of British Government thinking hitherto that the risks of doing something to tackle the fundamental issues are greater than the risks of doing nothing.  The British Prime Minister clearly refuses to accept that concept. She stated that the situation had gone on for a long time, that a solution could not be imposed from Westminister and that the situation would drag on.  The Forum report adverted to the obstructive nature of the constitutional guarantee.  In Chapter 4.1 it stated:</P>
    <P>In practice, however, this has been extended from consent to change in <Col N="174" /> the constitutional status of the North within the United Kingdom into an effective Unionist veto on any political change affecting the exercise of nationalist rights and in the form of government for Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The British Prime Minister repeatedly emphasised yesterday that any proposal would have to have the agreement both of the majority and the minority.  Any proposals, not just constitutional proposals, would have to be agreed by the majority.  Yesterday, very clearly and explicitly, she expanded the constitutional guarantee in precisely the manner of which the Forum had complained.  As I stated last night, this completely precludes any prospect of political progress.</P>
    <P>Another fundamental thesis in the Forum report was that:</P>
    <P>A settlement which recognises the legitimate rights of Nationalists and Unionists must transcend the context of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In an RTE interview on 6 May the Taoiseach agreed that an internal solution on its own was not on.  He said:</P>
    <P>I think at this stage the degree of alienation among the minority is such that it is difficult to see their coming back into the consensus and being willing to accept political structures and security structures if they are to be solely within the existing Northern Ireland area as part of the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Clearly this has been rejected by the British Prime Minister who yesterday made it clear that her only interest is in the internal situation of Northern Ireland with no all-Ireland dimension of any kind.  The communique, to which the Taoiseach has subscribed, effectively underwrites Mrs. Thatcher's position when it states:</P>
    <P>The identities of both the majority and the minority communities in Northern Ireland should be recognised and respected, and reflected in the structures and processes of Northern <Col N="175" /> Ireland in ways acceptable to both communities.</P>
    <P>I want to accuse the Taoiseach of again misleading the House in connection with this matter.  In his statement just now he said:</P>
    <P>It may be noted that at her press conference the Prime Minister referred to the equal respect due to these two identities.</P>
    <P>She did not.  She did exactly the opposite.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no idea what that silly old geriatric is saying over there.  The Taoiseach has subscribed on the dotted line to a renewed attempt by the British Government to achieve nothing more than an internal improvement without any reference to an Irish dimension. Neither is there any reference to power-sharing which has been regarded by this Taoiseach in the past as a minimum requirement for an internal solution.  As <i>The Irish Times</i> cogently pointed out this morning:</P>
      <P>... the communique does not say that the identities of both majority and minority communities will or shall be respected and reflected.  It is a mere aspiration, not a binding political commitment.</P>
      <P>When the British Prime Minister was asked whether the right of the majority and the minority communities should be recognised as equal she replied clearly and deliberately: &ldquo;That is not what we said.  We said `recognised and respected'.&rdquo; The passage in the communiqué about identities does not reflect, as is alleged, the thinking in the Forum report, which stated:</P>
      <P>The validity of both the Nationalist and Unionist identities in Ireland and the democratic rights of every citizen on this island must be accepted; both of these identities must have equally satisfactory, secure and durable, political, administrative and symbolic expression and protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing there about them being acceptable to the minority.  It is a tragic <Col N="177" /> betrayal of the position of all the Nationalist parties in the Forum that the Taoiseach should have agreed to underwrite the vain search for another internal political solution.  He knows it offends against the first two realities in the Forum report that &ldquo;existing structures and practices in Northern Ireland have failed to secure either peace, stability or reconciliation&rdquo; and, secondly, that &ldquo;the conflict of Nationalist and Unionist identities has been concentrated within the narrow ground of Northern Ireland.  This has prevented constructive interaction between the two traditions&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Forum report had important things to say about security as an acute symptom of the crisis in Northern Ireland and that the Nationalist community will not accept the security forces without a change of political context.  The Taoiseach knows that is what the Forum report said.  All parties have insisted that a new political framework is required, that existing security policies simply amount to crisis management that contribute nothing towards a solution.  Yet, in paragraph 4 of the communique the only role envisaged for the Irish Government is one of security.  It states:</P>
    <P>Co-operation between the two Governments in matters of security should be maintained and, where possible, improved.</P>
    <P>Apparently this is the only role the Irish Government are permitted to have.  Once again the communiqué reflects an object capitulation to a new British intrasigence and a craven desertion of the principles of the Forum report.</P>
    <P>There has been no acceptance by the British Government in any significant way of the realities or the requirements laid out in the Forum report.  They have not been accepted as a basis of discussion or negotiation.  I invite Members of this House to go through the ten realities and the 11 requirements and to see in the light of the communiqué and the comments of the British Prime Minister whether there has been any significant acceptance of them.  The answer must be no.  In my <Col N="178" /> view, they have been simply brushed aside and ignored.</P>
    <P>I was alarmed to hear the Taoiseach suggest last night that the four points in the communiqué will be substituted for the realities and the requirements contained in the Forum report as a basis for further discussion.  In my view the statements of the British Prime Minister yesterday constitute a flat and comprehensive rejection of the entire report of the New Ireland Forum.  It is no good the Taoiseach deluding himself by saying, &ldquo;We had a considered reaction, but by no means a complete considered action&rdquo;. What does that mean?  What does it mean in the light of what the British Prime Minister said: United Ireland, out; confederal solution out; joint authority proposal, out.  &ldquo;We had a considered reaction, but by no means a complete considered reaction&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Nobody is taken in by the suggestion that something of more significance is to come.  After all, what is left of the Forum report when every proposal, conclusion, argument or idea of any consequence has been rejected?  The new secretary of State, Mr. Hurd, spelled out the British view when he said that no amount of summit meetings would solve the problems facing the parties in the North.  Why have them then?  Where do we stand now with 2,500 killed in Northern Ireland since 1969?  No agreement of political structures in Northern Ireland is even remotely likely.  Now the British Prime Minister has announced a policy of attrition, of trying to wear down the communities in Northern Ireland until they agree on something within the present British context.  The people of Northern Ireland have been callously condemned to more bloodshed, more violence, more misery indefinitely.  The Northern Ireland economy is in a state of decline and stagnation with the highest unemployment and some of the worst social conditions existing there.  There is no hope of recovery in investment without peace and stability. No hope of any kind is offered except to continue in the same old rut for ever. Constitutional nationalism, the democratic voice of three-quarters of the Irish <Col N="179" /> people as presented in the New Ireland Forum report has been rejected by the British Prime Minister and that rejection has been acquiesced in by this Taoiseach. This could have the gravest consequences on the ground in Northern Ireland, and everybody must be very much aware of that fact.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was pathetic in his unconvincing talk about a new framework and process.  Giving a complete veto to the majority has effectively rules these out.  What is the point of another summit if the Taoiseach is to be walked all over once again?  Is there any point in summit meetings if we cannot be reasonably confident of contructive results? Why should the Taoiseach pretend that there is Anglo-Irish harmony and agreement when all can see that they do not exist?  This Government are trying to force us all to live a lie.</P>
    <P>One appalling aspect of yesterday's proceedings was that the general public could see clearly that one or other of the two principal actors in that drama was trying to mislead them.  When the Taoiseach claimed, &ldquo;We have got down to discussion in earnest, to brass tacks&rdquo; the British Prime Minister stated that yesterday they were discussing only generalities.</P>

      <P>When asked about alienation and this was probably the theme that most people noticed most specifically and directly in the two press conferences, the Taoiseach endeavoured to mislead everyone concerned.  He conveyed the impression that the British Prime Minister had been discussing alienation with him and also some security arrangements which would help to alleviate or reduce alienation, but everybody looking at the televised press conference knew that there was no doubt whatever that the Prime Minister had rejected totally any idea of alienation.  That was one thing that we could all hear loud and clear, but why did the Taoiseach attempt to mislead the people in that very important respect about what was discussed?</P>
      <P>Some people for different motives have sought to find some encouragement in paragraph 2 of the communiqué.  Let me quote paragraph 2:</P>
      <P>The identities of both the majority and minority communities in Northern Ireland should be recognised and respected, and reflected in the structures and processes of Northern Ireland in ways acceptable to both communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, the key words in that paragraph are: &ldquo;in ways acceptable to both communities.&rdquo;  In other words, in so far as the minority are concerned, there can be no recognition or respect or reflections unless they are accepted by the majority, and we know what that means.  We know what the spokesmen for the majority have said about anything of that nature. That paragraph is of no benefit or significance whatever in so far as the Nationalists in Northern Ireland are concerned, because it means that the recognition of their identity depends totally on the consent of the majority to any such recognition. That is the basic problem in <Col N="181" /> Northern Ireland since it was founded 60 years ago.</P>
    <P>The official voice of Nationalist Ireland was so muffled yesterday as to be almost inaudible.  The British Prime Minister was direct, intransigent and brutally frank.  Let me also be direct and frank. We who represent Nationalist Ireland will not accept the rejection of the New Ireland Forum report and with it all the hopes and aspirations of the majority of the Irish people.  We will continue to fight at home and abroad for the only solution that will bring lasting peace and justice to this land of ours.</P>
    <P>On a previous occasion in this House I sought to warn the present Taoiseach about the danger inherent in his approach and attitude to Anglo-Irish relations in both its personal and official aspects.  My warning had no effect and the Taoiseach continued along his foolish way until it brought him finally to yesterday's humiliation. The timing of the two press conferences in London yesterday and their content must surely by now have taught this Taoiseach the most bitter lesson of his political life.  For many months he engaged in an exercise of accommodation, undertaking a series of steps designed to inculcate an atmosphere of personal friendliness, helpfulness and acceptability.  Events have shown this behaviour to have been damaging and detrimental to a deadly extent.  International relations, international discussions, international negotiations are not kindergarten matters nor are they conducted as if they were some kind of amicable parlour game.  The humiliation inflicted on the Taoiseach yesterday could and should have been foreseen, if not by him at least by his advisers if he was prepared to listen to those among them who have some experience of these matters.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to comprehend why the outcome of yesterday's summit took the brutal form that it took.  Unfortunately, there can be only one explanation.  The British Prime Minister and the British Government have settled on a clear, definite policy with regard to Northern Ireland and the position that Northern <Col N="182" /> Ireland's problems will occupy in Anglo-Irish relations.  They have gone right back to the old position that the Six Counties of Northern Ireland are to be regarded as an integral part of the UK, a territory over which British sovereignty is to be maintained, and that the Unionist position is inviolate and untouchable.  After all the comings and goings, the accommodating statements and actions, after all the ingratiation, we came right back yesterday to the old, sterile, negative policy.  To this Taoiseach I say, &ldquo;You have led this country into the greatest humiliation in recent history.  You have failed ignominiously in an area of vital national interest.  Because of your incompetence, misjudgment and ineffectiveness you have done grevious damage to our national political interests and our national pride.  History will tell us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think we were all somewhat embarrassed at the Taoiseach last night in his press conference as he attempted to put words together in some coherent fashion, and his inability to give a direct reply to any question put to him at the press conference.  It was obvious that he had got nothing from an intransigent Mrs. Thatcher and therefore he had nothing to say.  His statement here today, although put together in a much more coherent fashion, still has nothing to say from his meeting with Mrs. Thatcher.  It seems that we cannot avoid the conclusion that Mrs. Thatcher is far more interested in her efforts to smash the NUM and the miners' strike than she is to bring peace and progress to Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Forum was long dead before Chequers and effectively it was buried <Col N="183" /> there.  In correspondence with the Taoiseach in March 1983 at the time he was inviting parties to participate in the Forum I pointed out a major defect in the proposals and I said in behalf of my party that we were disappointed at the haste with which the Taoiseach had acted in establishing such a Forum.  I told him that we had expected from our meeting with him and with Deputy Barry on 4 March that discussions would first take place between interested parties in the Oireachtas to see if agreement could be reached on the best method of proceeding to broader discussions.  It was certainly our opinion that fairly long and patient negotiaions would be required in order to broaden the scope of discussion beyond the Nationalist-Catholic base of the SDLP.  I added that in view of the hurried and public nature of developments so far and the declared intention of the Official Unionists, the DUP and Alliance not to take part in the Forum I must now consult as to whether there was any value in participating in such a narrowly based forum.  The Taoiseach replied that participation would be open to the OUP, DUP and Alliance parties. I pointed out to him on 18 March:</P>
    <P>If you were anxious for such participation, surely the way to go about achieving it would be to approach these parties through their own democratically elected political forum, the Northern Ireland Assembly.  The fact that you totally ignore the existence of this Assembly, and that you have publicly supported the SDLP boycott of it casts doubt as to the seriousness of your intentions.</P>
    <P>Reading between the lines of the communiqué, and the Taoiseach's statement in the House, it now seems that both the British and Irish Governments accept, however reluctantly, that the State of Northern Ireland exists and must develop political institutions which have the support of all its people.  In view of this, is the Taoiseach prepared to recommend to the SDLP now that they take their seats in the Assembly and make it the base <Col N="184" /> for their political campaign for power-sharing or whatever other political policies they wish to promote?  An opinion poll published in October 1984 showed that 89 per cent of Protestants and 53 per cent of Catholics felt that the SDLP should enter the Assembly while 33 per cent of Catholics felt they should not.</P>
    <P>There are strong arguments to support Deputy Haughey's thesis that the Northern Ireland state is no longer viable. Indeed, the British Government regarded it as politically non-viable over a decade ago when they introduced direct rule, abolishing Stormont, but the State is still there.  Since then that State has become economically non-viable and is supported only by a massive subvention of between £1 billion and £2 billion by the British Government.  But then one could argue also that this State is economically non-viable also and must similarly be supported by massive loans from world banks of the order of almost £10 billion. Politically it is also rapidly losing credibility and quickly becoming just as non-viable as the North but there is always a way around non-viability such as direct rule in Northern Ireland or military dictatorship and US aid as in El Salvador. Non-viable states can always be maintained.</P>
    <P>Viable or non-viable the State still exists in Northern Ireland and the bombings, killings and general terror continue also.  Despite all the condemnations of these killings we still appear to view them and report them in the media with a biased Catholic mind.  Every killing of a Catholic is reported in the press, on radio and TV as a sectarian murder while killings of Protestants are always related to the former connections of the person concerned with the security forces.  Any Protestant farmer killed on his tractor, or urban worker, or milkman doing his rounds, who was once a member of the UDR or police reserve, even ten years ago, is somehow accepted by the media as a legitimate target and not a sectarian assassination.</P>

Northern Ireland is urgently in need of a period of peace and democracy.  It needs:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  An Assembly and a government <Col N="186" /> with limited but gradually increasing powers,</P>
    <P>(2)  Democratic reforms built into a Bill of Rights as a constitutional framework under which an Assembly or government would operate.  This must have the fullest guarantees by the British and Irish Governments and by the UN and the EC.  The Bill of Rights must cover repressive laws, courts, discrimination, police, and so on.</P>
    <P>(3)  Demilitarisation which should be begun unilaterally by withdrawal of British army to barracks, thus undermining the paramilitary base in Catholic communities.  There must also be a review of the role or existence of the UDR.</P>
    <P>(4)  A much more rapid reform of the RUC, including civilian control, and an independent complaints procedure.</P>
    <P>(5)  Dismantling of sectarian institutions and habits and traditions, especially in the area of education and youth services.  A poll taken in August last showed that 74 per cent of the people of the North favoured integrated education and only 21 per cent opposed it.</P>
    <P>(6)  Heavy investment in job creation, laying the basis for a new industrial take off.</P>
    <P>These are the immediate issues that must be tackled for the next meeting if there is another between the Taoiseach and Mrs. Thatcher.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier I referred to the need for the Minister, and the Dental Council, to give a degree of consideration to the problem of dental technicians.  I accept that this is not as heady an item as the previous issue but, nevertheless, it is of importance.  It has been suggested <Col N="187" /> to us that as two provisions in the medical Practitioners Act, 1978 and the Opticians Act, 1976 facilitated the incorporation into the new legislation groups of people who had been acting in a freelance operation outside the network of legislation prior to the passing of those Bills, this method could be applied in this case also. I do not know if that is the right answer. It is very important, even if denturists or dental technicians are to be involved in the area of fitting and manufacturing of dentures, that there should be an insistence by the council and the Department on proper training and standards.  There should not be any equivocation about that area of training so that there will not be any chance of slipshod standards or any type of unsatisfactory methods operating in that respect.  People have been operating &mdash; I understand that the number is about 250 &mdash; and I am not aware of any major dissatisfaction with their work.  I suspect that the largely mechanical job of fitting and manufacturing these dentures is one which could be handled by people who are qualified and trained but are not necessarily dentists. It should be possible to introduce a formula to allow for people to be open to training or retraining and then facilitate them by allowing them to operate or provide a service under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would all be loath to put out of business people who have been giving a service and who, as far as I am aware, have not been unsatisfactory although there may have been individual complaints as there is about every profession. In the course of his speech in the Seanad the Minister referred to the timing of the establishment of services auxiliary to the dental profession.  He hoped that they would come into being very early after the passage of the Bill.  It might help if those discussions took place soon so that any marginal fears there might be about those working in the area of dental hygiene or other peripheral areas of dentistry might be dealt with rather than waiting for the passage of the Bill and the establishment of the council.  I am arguing for earlier rather than later <Col N="188" /> dialogue with those who have a legitimate interest in this area of activity.</P>
    <P>I hope that all the moves implicit in this Bill will not give rise to any form of monopoly and will not result in dentistry and allied activities being controlled by a small group.  Nobody wants that.  I know that is not the intention of the Minister or the Government nor is it the desire of the Dental Board or the dental professional groups.  We should ensure that this does not happen.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that this very comprehensive legislation is not permeated by reference to statutes of over 50 or 100 years ago, in other words, it is not legislation by reference, as one of the Senators referred to it.  I commend that approach to other Ministers who might make legislation a little more intelligible to lay people and to Members of this House by excluding where possible references to existing Bills and by incorporating the full amendment in the up to date provision in the Bill as presented in this House so that we will know exactly what we are talking about without the aid of a veritable small reference library.</P>
    <P>The original proposal to amend this legislation goes back to 1927.  That says a little about the way we order our affairs in this House.  I am not suggesting that this Bill is the same as the Bill suggested at that time, but this gives an indication of how little attention, legislatively speaking, has been given to this area over those decades.  I hope this measure is successful and I ask the Minister to reply to the points I have raised.</P>
    <P>At some stage, rather than taking one Bill after another, we should have a forum where we could look at the cumulative effects of all these new Bills and regulations in terms of the minutiae involved in sections and subsections and in terms of the implication of their enforcement and the other regulatory practices that are inevitably involved.  I am not sure that we, collectively, want a society that is so tightly regulated as might happen if we continue down that road.  This is something this House has not had a chance to consider, but if that chance <Col N="189" /> presents itself and if we reach the conclusion that we want such a society, I will be happy to go along with it.  In the meantime I would prefer if we did not continue to have a tightly regulated society by what we might call default or by stealth.</P>
    <P>The implications of what I am speaking about will be visible in other legislation. The current legislation I am speaking about would include the Nurses Bill, the Air Transport Bill, the Broadcasting Bill and so on, all of which put the State in the central control position as opposed to the individual or the free group.  I am not sure if that is properly the role of the State.  If it is, we should discuss it because that presents a fundamental change in the kind of society we have, a change in respect of which I do not believe there is a mandate at present.  This Bill brings a fair amount of sense and order into an area in which it is to some extent lacking. I wish the Bill and the Minister every success.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  As Deputy O'Hanlon said, we in Fianna Fáil welcome this Bill and in general find it acceptable.  Therefore, I do not intend to take up too much time of the House.</P>
      <P>This Bill provides for the establishment of a council to be known as the Dental Council which will provide for the registration and control of persons engaged in the practice of dentistry and to provide for other matters relating to the practice of dentistry.  It also attempts to cater for the area of auxiliary dental workers.  Prior to this the affairs of dentists and the dental organisation were catered for by the Dental Board which was set up over 56 years ago, in 1928.  During these years it has served the profession well, for which we owe the members of the board our thanks.  They have acted as the watchdog of the profession, and the service the dental profession have provided for the country speaks for itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This board shows a new concept in that not alone are the profession adequately represented but, for the first time, the consumer is included.  This is a concept which is acceptable to the profession.  In <Col N="190" /> relation to the membership of the board, I have had a number of visits during the past week from various groups with vested interests in this area.  I had a deputation from the Irish Association of Dental Prosthesists.  They requested that they should have at least one member on the council &mdash; Deputy Keating referred to this earlier and is in agreement &mdash; in other words, that a member from the auxiliary dental workers' group should be on the council.  The proposed Dental Council will comprise 19 members.  I do not believe one out of 19 is an outlandish or unreasonable request.  I urge the Minister to consider their request.  I know the Minister can nominate four members to the council and he may include one of these dental auxiliary workers, but I would rather see them having a guarantee of membership on the council.  There is no guarantee under the present structure. As I said, one out of 19 is not an unreasonable or outlandish request.</P>
    <P>This Bill was initiated in the Seanad. There was a very extensive and worthwhile debate for which we should all convey our thanks to the Members of that House.  It was a job well done.</P>

      <P>From speaking to a number of my dental colleagues and members of the Dental Association, I know that in general they find the Bill acceptable in its present form.  They submitted approximately ten or 11 amendments which were acceptable to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is being set up to register and control those in dental practice and to control their education and training.  It provides for their membership and method of appointment to the council <Col N="191" /> and most importantly, it provides for the recognition of both dental specialists and classes of auxiliary dental workers.  I do not intend to go through the Bill section by section because that has been covered adequately by Deputy O'Hanlon and the Minister.  This Bill is accepted by all sides and we will not be opposing it at this stage, although we will have some comments to make on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The problems of dental care in Ireland are enormous.  At present the service is trying to provide care for about 600,000 children and a similar number of eligible adults.  As a member of a health board, I have seen the drawbacks in the present service either through lack of funds or lack of properly trained staff.  We cannot claim to be providing a service that is urgently needed in the community.  I will give one example.  The <i>ad hoc</i> dental scheme has been abandoned in Cork due to a lack of funds.  Dental hygiene has become a major factor in the practice of dentistry today, when the emphasis is on conservation rather than heretofore the practice of extraction.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Flynn on Tuesday, 13 November 1984:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government's failure to control the price of electricity and, in view of the serious hardship the high cost of electricity is causing countless families and the loss of jobs in industry resulting from lack of competitiveness, calls upon the Government to withdraw its approval for the recent price increase pending the publication and a full debate on the report of the enquiry into the high cost of electricity in Ireland.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>&ldquo;notes that the Tánaiste and Minister for Energy has recently received for examination the report of the Inquiry into Electricity Prices, notes that the costs behind electricity supply result from decisions taken over many decades with the approval of successive Governments, notes that the finances of the ESB must be assured to maintain an appropriate level of service to all consumers, endorses the view of the Minister for Energy that it is likely that electricity prices can only be reduced through long term structural measures which allow for the regional, employment, and social, as well as economic aspects of electricity supply, and approves the decision of the Government to allow the recent increase in electricity charges, as recommended by the National Prices Commission, which keeps the increase in electricity prices below the already reduced level of general inflation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for the Environment).</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing last week with the cost of electricity to industry and the detrimental effect of any further increase.  There is a direct relationship between the unemployment figure of 200,000 and this price level because by their policies the Government have depressed the economy and the demand for electricity has been reduced.  It does not require much imagination to realise how much electricity Fords and Dunlops were using before they closed down.  The demand will be further reduced by the closure of Cork dockyard on 30 November, despite the many appeals to the Government to keep it open as a repairing and shipbuilding yard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESB now find they have overcapacity in electricity generation as well as a reduction in income.  The remaining consumers in industry, agriculture and the private sector are being asked to bear <Col N="193" /> the burden of an increase of 6.83 per cent from January.  There is a parallel here with the policy of the Government which has brought about diminishing returns in customs and excise duties.  Government policies of financial rectitude, described by so many blasé phrases, are affecting every aspect of life.  They realised what was happening in regard to diminishing returns and there was something of an about face recently.  The people who are still at work have to support those who are out of work and I place the blame on incorrect Government policies which have pushed the economy downwards.</P>
    <P>It is only reasonable to expect the ESB to maintain employment, although some people may claim that there is over-employment in the ESB.  I leave that to somebody else to judge.  They must meet their running costs and they are expected to do so out of diminishing returns because of lack of economic development and the closure of factories.  The same people who are out of work are expected by the Government to bear a further increase of 6.83 per cent on electricity bills this winter.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that ESB consumers have contributed enormously to the huge profits made by Bord na Móna and An Bord Gáis, but these same consumers are being asked to pay this new increase. Our natural resources should be used for the benefit of the people of the nation. They should be used for the protection of jobs and the creation of further jobs. Unfavourable price calculations should not be used by the Government to close down Bord na Móna peat bogs.  Should these price calculations be used to bolster the balance of payments of other countries from whom we buy oil and coal? Where is the sense in allowing this to happen?  The Government disregard our natural resources or underutilise them and our whole economic development has been put at risk by their mismanagement. The increase in electricity charges highlights the situation that has been allowed to develop.</P>
    <P>We need a Government capable of pursuing policies whereby all sectors of <Col N="194" /> the economy will benefit from a sustained increase in manufacturing output.  This would include small scale subcontractors, service firms, transport firms, electricity and telecommunications facilities, the postal service and banks.</P>
    <P>The sustaining of manufacturing growth which would steadily reduce unemployment would require an annual investment in fixed assets and a working capital of at least £1,000 million per annum.  These funds must come from a combination of retained earnings, new equity finance, loans and grant capital. The prospects for investment depend essentially on the possibility of earning an adequate return on capital.  This would require a favourable trading climate at home and abroad, low inflation at home combined with the provision of services which would be competitive in price and quality.  Surely electricity must be foremost in maintaining competitiveness.  It also needs conditions which will encourage individuals and organisations who have funds to invest &mdash; and they are there&mdash; to channel these funds into productive enterprises given the proper encouragement and incentives.  I have no hesitation in repeating that these economic policies &mdash; and after yesterday we can add a few more &mdash; are to the detriment of this nation.</P>

    <P>While I do not suggest for a moment that criticism on this score is necessarily a bad thing in itself &mdash; in fact, a certain <Col N="195" /> amount of criticism could have a beneficial effect on the level and quality of performance by anybody in the trading sector or the semi-State sector &mdash; I urge the Opposition to accept that, if this criticism is to be effective and if it is to have the desired effect, it should be properly informed.  I ask the House, and particularly the movers of this motion, to face up to the facts of the situation in regard to electricity prices.  As in the case of any other commodity or service, the basic costs of producing electricity are subject to inflationary trends.  For the ESB these costs are fuel, labour and capital costs, none of which has escaped the general effects of inflation.</P>
    <P>Control of electricity prices is, if anything, more rigorous than that which applies to any other industry.  By virtue of the Prices (Amendment) Act, 1972, the price increase applications for the ESB are submitted to the National Prices Commission.  When a recommendation has been made on the application by the NPC and has been approved by the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism the matter is then put to the Government for decision.  The most recent price increase of 6.83 per cent allowed by the Government is neither more nor less than that which had been recommended by the National Prices Commission.</P>
    <P>In fact, the application made by the ESB had been for a higher percentage increase to apply from 1 April of this year, whereas the increase allowed will not come into effect until the November-December billing period.  The net effect of this later application of the increase is that some £24 million less will be recovered in additional revenue in the current financial year than would have been the case if the same increase had been applied from 1 April 1984.  I am convinced that the increase allowed is the absolute minimum which will enable the ESB to hold down their accumulating deficits.  The board's cumulative deficit at end of March 1984 was over £37 million and, even allowing for the recent price increase, this deficit is projected by the <Col N="196" /> ESB to increase to £57 million by the end of March 1985.</P>
    <P>The ESB are a service utility and as such they are constantly in the public gaze.  Their activities are probably reported on more fully than any other commercial institution in this country. They provide a consistent flow of statistical information to the public about their activities in their annual reports and, therefore, there is little excuse for inappropriate or ill-informed criticism.  I believe that it is essential to deal fairly with the ESB in regard to their prices and this is the approach which the Government took when they commissioned the inquiry into electricity prices.</P>
    <P>The Electricity Supply Board are one of the largest undertakings in this country, and because they serve well over 1,000,000 houses and premises, they support most of the community's essential business, industrial, commercial and residential activities.  For example, the ESB now provide electricity directly to the transport sector since the DART system was commissioned and this is one example of continuous progress in extending the applications of electricity.</P>
    <P>There is no dispute as to the essential nature of the electricity service.  If it is to be discussed, then it is important to examine the functions of our electricity supply authority in the context within which they have been called by the community as a whole to provide a service. Such a discussion, if it is to be of any value to the consumer in moving towards a more effective and less costly service, will have to take place within a framework of appreciation for the technical, economic and social constraints which the ESB face in managing the enormous resources entrusted to the board by the community.</P>
    <P>In fact, the board and employees of the ESB hold a position of trust granted by the entire community.  Ownership of the electricity service is entirely in public hands so we, the consumers, are the masters of our own fate.  There is no third party to whom we can turn to shoulder blame for any of our present difficulties. Therefore, I hope it will be possible to <Col N="197" /> discuss the issues raised in a logical fashion, despite the emotions which are created frequently in discussions of this subject.</P>
    <P>Electricity sales grew by 4.5 per cent in the last ESB financial year, that is, in the period 1 April 1983 to 31 March 1984. This represents a remarkable recovery from the doldrums of recent previous years, and it occurred primarily in the industrial and commercial sectors.  In fact, industry used almost 6 per cent more electricity than in the previous year. Apart from the revenue which the ESB earned from these sales, which were achieved despite a reduction in overall staff levels of over 400, the implications of a resumption in growth are very significant for the electricity industry.  Continued growth of this nature will inevitably lead to a more economic use of existing plant, particularly if growth does not concentrate in the peak demand sectors.  A more economic use of existing plant, lowering production costs, will lead to lower prices for electricity in the medium term.</P>
    <P>A second fundamental point to bear in mind about the growth rate in electricity consumption is that the capacity to meet demand must be planned for, evaluated, selected, designed, constructed and commissioned into operation before the demand occurs.  This procedure must anticipate the demand by from five to ten years, depending on the kind of plant involved, site availability, etc.  When the demand has been changing about, as it has been for the last five years, the original plans require modification, and costs per unit produced are inevitably higher than they would have been in the absence of recession and oil price rises.  I shall refer later to some important aspects of these external influences.</P>
    <P>The difficulties experienced by the ESB in recent years must of course be examined carefully for the lessons which must be drawn about future actions.  It is essential to do this against a background of some matters of fact.  There is a tendency in some quarters to criticise the ESB as if they were somehow deficient in areas in which the critics could solve the board's problems.  In fact, several hundred ESB <Col N="198" /> employees have been involved in overseas work in 14 countries during the past year, and this must weigh heavily as evidence of the employees' ability and the board's determination to earn revenues in the international constructing area &mdash; itself the victim of severe recession.  The importance of this work in broadening the experience of Irish personnel and as a possible introduction for other Irish services, in addition to its revenue earnings, must be valued appropriately.  The propects for competently emerging from present difficulties must be greatly enhanced by the skills and new expertise available to the board as a result of this work.</P>
    <P>In case this reference to overseas work draws any foolish comment that the ESB should confine their activities solely to the problems of their Irish consumers, I would draw your attention to the fact that nearly 26,000 new houses were connected to the ESB system last year.  Few Irish undertakings have operations which are required to maintain services to existing consumers while continuously investing in the expansion of their distribution system on this scale.  Last year ESB investment in transmission and distribution to bring power to people where they want it was over £50 million, while current expenditure on capital, operation and maintenance on the distribution system was over £90 million.  The view that investment capital is not needed because surplus capacity is available for some years hence is a misleading one.</P>
    <P>The international circumstances within which the ESB operate must also be carefully evaluated.  Although the ESB are responsible for electricity sales within Ireland, their operations are vulnerable to international prices to an extent that is not always appreciated.  The ESB spent approximately £90 million on oil imports last year.  This was after use of peat, hydro, and the increased allocation of natural gas.  The price of oil is widely reported in the media as falling and people's expectations recently have been that prices based on oil must fall.  But because the dollar has strengthened so much against the European currencies, <Col N="199" /> and against our punt, the price of fuel oil in Irish punts rose by nearly 40 per cent since January of last year.  This may be partly due to a temporary increased demand for fuel oil in western Europe, but nonetheless the fuel must be bought and paid for at market rates.  There is no magic formula for avoiding cost increases of this nature and when they occur the consumer must ultimately pay an increased price if the financial stability of the ESB is to be maintained.  In some quarters it may be represented that such cost increases may be matched by increased borrowings.  I do not think there are many Deputies who would advocate further borrowing to pay our current expenditure such as our fuel bills.</P>
    <P>The long-term financial viability of the ESB is of primary importance to this country.  To deny to them the ability to recover through the price mechanism cost increases which are outside their control would obviously make what is already a difficult situation even worse. One effect would be to build up a cumulative deficit which would render it impossible for the board to borrow for their capital purposes.  In the final analysis it would be the Exchequer and, in effect, the taxpayers who would be called upon to bear the cost of putting the ESB back on the rails.  While the Government are concerned about electricity prices, they have a responsibility to all sections of the community and must look to the long-term effects of their action &mdash; they are not in the business of gaining short-term popularity such as might accrue from the course of action proposed in the motion.</P>
    <P>The continued development of our electricity system must be planned and carried out in anticipation of the demand for electricity supply up to ten years hence.  We are all aware of the increase in electricity consumption which accompanies improvements in our standards of living.  Although much machinery has become more energy efficient in the last few years, new applications are found for electricity all the time.  Our growing population will itself increase our <Col N="200" /> demand for electricity as people are housed and use public and commercial services.</P>
    <P>Against this background of rising demand we face a number of problems which increase the future costs of providing electricity.  Electricity supply companies all over the world have to face growing opposition to the large scale of their operations and to the environmental consequences of building and operating power stations and transmission and distribution lines.  Alternative solutions to the problems created can be found, but only at a cost which must be paid by the electricity consumer.  The balance between the need for cleaner air, proper waste disposal, properly landscaped facilities, underground cables and the resulting extra costs of electricity production must be struck so that it does not prevent the economic growth we are committed to creating for all our people.</P>
    <P>We must also be careful to avoid attributing to electricity supply problems which are largely caused by other fuel uses, such as in transport, or through the widespread use of solid fuels in urban areas. At the moment the European Community is considering legislation regarding emissions from power plants.  We as a Government support the view that other countries should strive to enjoy the air quality which is still largely the case in Ireland.  We are concerned to ensure that efforts to curtail the growing menace of air pollution in Europe are concentrated on those areas suffering from heavy industrial, transport and power station emissions.  We are concerned to avoid a situation whereby expensive remedies for serious problems in other countries are enforced on us in Ireland in a manner which makes no significant contribution to the air quality problems which, indeed, must be resolved.  The increases in electricity prices which could arise from implementation of stringent measures which are not necessary in Ireland would be very damaging to our economy.</P>
    <P>Deputies are rightly concerned about the cost of electricity &mdash; a service we have come to regard as an essential feature of modern life.  In striving to ensure that <Col N="201" /> everything which ought to be done to lower the cost of electricity is being done, we must recognise the real difficulties we face.  Our electricity system is the only major system in Europe which is deprived of interconnection with its neighbours, apart from the Northern Ireland Electricity Service.  This handicap arises because our interconnection link with the North has been severed for many years now on the Northern side.  We do not have the cost advantages of very large scale stations which are typical of European countries and we do not have very high consumption level per consumer.</P>
    <P>The second amendment put down by Deputies Mac Giolla and De Rossa makes three suggestions for Government action which it is claimed would eliminate the need for the recent 6.83 per cent rise in prices.  There are two very serious misconceptions behind this amendment and it is important to tease out what they are and to demonstrate why they make this proposition unacceptable.  All Deputies will know that it is very simple to suggest price reductions.  If these are not accompanied by cost reductions &mdash; as such suggestions seldom are &mdash; they become a wish list.  We have a sufficient list of problems caused by not recognising the true costs of our actions, and it would be foolish in the extreme to add to them.</P>
    <P>The first misconception which lies behind this amendment is the belief that a large and complex organisation like the ESB can address their very real problems by tinkering with the commercial conditions in which the organisation operate. This has been tried in the past and has produced unsatisfactory results.  It is futile to look at one or two aspects of the ESB and conclude that by adjusting those aspects everything can be patched together for another while.  This &ldquo;make it up as you go along&rdquo; approach, which sacrifices the future to apparently immediate but actually deceptive satisfaction of the general desire for lower prices, will not do.</P>
    <P>The community deserve something better and the Government have taken action to put the concerted planning of the ESB on a medium to long term basis. <Col N="202" /> First, the Government have instituted the inquiry into electricity prices to which the Minister for the Environment referred during last week's debate on this motion. I have announced already that I have received the report of the inquiry and that it is being examined at present.  It will be submitted to Government for consideration at an early date and it will then be published so that all interested parties will have an opportunity to study its findings.  The Government also required of the ESB, as of all their major semi-State bodies, a corporate plan for the next five years.  The National Planning Board published a detailed analysis of the performance and problems of commercial State-sponsored bodies, including the ESB, and the Government have produced the national plan.  This work is the essential work of analysis and discussion which is absolutely required as a basis for real improvement in this area.  For example, the planning board have provided an analysis to show how better performance of the State-sponsored commercial bodies in terms of benefits obtained for the money they have borrowed must be measured.</P>
    <P>In ensuring that funds borrowed are matched by corresponding productive assets, and by the efficient use of assets once they have been created, market forces cannot always be relied on to generate better performance, and proxies must be developed.  The right pricing policy advocated by that analysis is targeted at bringing their selling prices into line with the prices in other European countries.  But current subsidies should not be used to achieve this parity of prices.</P>
    <P>The first ground therefore on which I urge the House to reject this amendment is that it is a short-sighted, live for today, unplanned proposition which is made unnecessary by the constructive actions the Government are taking to address the fundamental issues over the long haul.  But, even if we give further consideration to the bits and pieces approach, we find it defective in the extreme.  The levy in lieu of rates is a removal of an advantage originally granted to the ESB <Col N="203" /><i>vis-à-vis</i> other commercial spheres of activity.  The level of rates which it is appropriate for the ESB to pay is a matter for expert arbitration.  But the principle of taxation involved is clear.  There is an onus on anyone who proposes lifting taxation to say which services he proposes to suspend, since he will not provide the funds to meet their costs.</P>
    <P>We might all have our views on which form of revenue collection we would most like to see diminished or abolished. But to single out one productive function such as electricity supply and to suggest that it should not pay its share of the rates burden is a whimsical approach to Government.  No responsible Government could accept it, as a naked proposition without some supporting analysis. Such analysis can only be carried out in the light of all the major considerations which are relevant to electricity prices and costs and since these are still under examination I cannot presume to prejudge the outcome.  But I can point out what some of the major considerations in regard to this particular issue are likely to be.</P>
    <P>Likewise, the fuel oil tax.  No sensible Member of this House likes this tax any more than he likes other taxes.  If the proposers of this amendment were prepared to discuss the abolition of services and costs which give rise to a need for this or for any other tax, then this amendment would have a purpose.  But as it stands it has only the merit of opportunism.</P>
    <P>The last suggested action in the amendment &mdash; calling on the Government to reduce the price of natural gas &mdash; is the element in this proposal which must cause raised eyebrows.  The simple fact is that when an international oil company supply oil to the ESB they must be paid the international market-price.  But here we have a proposal that the Irish State-owned supplier of natural gas, Bord Gáis Éireann, should be paid a lower price for a depleting native resource.  One would expect from all sides of the House fundamental agreement on the proposition that when the taxpayer owns a resource it is <Col N="204" /> not to be handed over for use at the cheapest possible price.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may rely on me.  Wait until after Christmas, I should not wish to trip myself up as the Deputy did.</P>
      <P>In their report on &ldquo;Irish Energy Policy&rdquo;, the National Economic and Social Council drew attention to the implicit subsidy which arises when the market price is not charged: the critical point is that the benefits of such a cheap gas policy accrue to large energy consumers rather than to the citizens as a whole. The Government must balance the benefits to be attained by natural gas users.  In the case of electricity the price of natural gas has been held constant for two years running despite the generally adverse conditions in the economy and the fact that general inflation has increased by about 14 per cent since the last price review.</P>
      <P>The suggestion in the Deputies' amendment that their suggested lowering of gas prices would eliminate the need for the recent rise in prices is ill founded. Whatever else has caused the rise in costs and obliged the Government to accede to this price rise, it cannot be the price of natural gas.  To suggest this remedy is to borrow from oneself to pay off another creditor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I invite Deputies to await the publication of the report of the inquiry into electricity prices.  But I do not pretend that this means that an easy solution lies around the corner.  For every gimmicky proposition to lower electricity prices which is bandied around, there is generally a corresponding payment to be made elsewhere.  Most Deputies are aware of this, employees of the semi-State bodies <Col N="205" /> are aware of it and consumers are aware of it.</P>
    <P>In the context of the situation I have outlined, that is, the effects of increased fuel and other costs, the efforts of the board to gain revenue abroad through their consultancy activities and also their efforts in home markets, the Government, while considering the report of the prices inquiry, will be receptive to constructive criticism.  It will be open to receive practical suggestions from any quarter which might help toward alleviating the problem.  I believe that this debate can be a useful preliminary exercise.  But in that regard problems of the ESB and of their consumers will not be solved by useless recriminations.  It is through a rational constructive approach to the problem that a solution will be found. This was the Government's aim when they commissioned the inquiry into electricity prices.  The clear establishment of the facts and their analysis in as scientific a manner as possible is clearly the first step towards a solution.  Mention has been made already of the criticism levelled in recent times that industrial and commercial electricity tariffs are unduly high and that they are subsidising domestic tariffs.  I believe that any such questions relating to a fundamental restructuring of the tariff should be addressed in the context of the consideration of the report of the inquiry and not in the context of a price increase which is in accordance with a recommendation of the National Prices Commission.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by acknowledging the tribute paid by Deputy Lyons in his contribution to the debate last week to the workforce of the ESB.  I wish to add my appreciation and the appreciation of my Department to the management and staff of the board for the way in which they have carried out their work.</P>

      <P>I will take only two minutes.  Seeing that the Minister is in such a buoyant mood this evening I will ask him to initiate an inquiry into the charges for connections to new houses being made by the ESB in rural areas.  It affects his constituency in Kerry as well as mine in Galway.</P>
      <P>The cost for the installation of electricity to new houses far exceeds normal commercial rates.  The ESB pricing structure for young married couples in particular is a true example of the absence of free market forces.  It is an example of a dangerous monopoly at work.  I am quite satisfied that a more competitive, efficient private enterprise outfit would be in a position to arrange for the erection of poles for the carrying of current to new houses at a far lower cost.</P>
      <P>We have numerous examples of very large sums being charged to young people in rural areas for connections to their new houses.  In the west in particular we have young couples living in newly constructed houses who do not have ESB current because they cannot pay the £2,000 or £3,000 being demanded by the ESB.  I will give a perfect example of the telephone numbers the ESB are pulling out of the sky in the form of estimated figures they are giving to young people who want connections.  I have two estimates given to the same person, one on 3 June 1984 at £1,741 and one on 8 October 1984, four months later, for £3,120.  That kind of effort by the ESB has to be stopped and I am asking the Minister to initiate an inquiry into the charges being made to new applicants for electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I simply want to deal with the three points made by the Minister when speaking about my amendment, relating to the levy on the ESB, the hydrocarbon fuel oil tax and the price of natural gas.  Such levies were first put on the ESB in 1981.  The ESB were founded in 1927 and from then until 1981 there was no such levy in existence. Yet the Minister said that no responsible Government could accept its absence as a naked proposition without some suporting analysis.  In other words, every <Col N="207" /> Government between 1927 and 1981 were totally irresponsible because they did not have a supporting analysis for refusing to impose such a levy.</P>
      <P>The levy this year is £20 million and the ESB losses in the year to 31 March, according to their report, was £23.3 million, the worst trading result ever experienced by them.  Of course, £20 million of that was taken by the Government in a levy &mdash; the ESB paid £20 million into the State coffers.</P>
      <P>I am not asking the Government to reduce a tax that had been there for the last 50 years, as a Government did in regard to rates on property.  I am simply asking them to restore the position from 1927 until 1981.  When the Government began to look around for simple measures to get money into the Exchequer they forced the ESB to pay £20 million and thereby put up the price of electricity to consumers.  Of course this is an indirect method of taxation: instead of imposing a tax that would bring in £20 million, the Government simply levied £20 million on the ESB and forced the ESB to put up the price to the consumers.  If the ESB were not allowed to increase their prices they would have had to borrow more money which would create further problems for them.</P>
      <P>The other matter to which our amendment refers is the hydrocarbon fuel oil tax.  This has been referred to repeatedly by the CII.  A few weeks ago they said it is the highest tax rate paid by any user of hydrocarbon fuel.  Of course, the Government's aim was to bring an easy £10 million into the Exchequer.  It has been suggested to me &mdash; I have no proof of this &mdash; that the new Alumina Contractors' plant in Aughinish is free of duty on hydrocarbon oil.  That may well be one of the incentives towards the development there but surely if it is true and if all other users are paying rates lower than the ESB, the Minister is totally irresponsible because he is compelling ESB consumers to pay a further indirect tax to the Government.  It is a further reason why the ESB had to increase their prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also a further reason why their <Col N="208" /> losses are increasing.  Their deficit last year was £23 million.  According to the Minister for the Environment today the cumulative deficit next year will be £37 million and it is estimated there will be a further deficit of £40 million, bringing the total deficit to £77 million.  They are a company who have been completely viable since 1927.  They did not take a penny from the taxpayers; they operated on their own revenue and borrowings and gave a fantastic service to the people and for our development as a people.  Now they are being crushed into the ground by levies and taxes.</P>
    <P>My final point is the price being charged for natural gas.  When Bord Gáis Eireann began to bring natural gas ashore they needed, first of all, a high user, some body who would use it immediately.  They asked the ESB and the ESB agreed and said they would build a special power station in Cork to take natural gas.  They built that special station and they were told they would have the gas for only about ten years.  Then they would have to stop.  The ESB can get coal cheaper than they can get natural gas from Bord Gáis Éireann.  Bord Gáis Éireann made £68 million profit and that goes into Alan Dukes' Exchequer.</P>

      <P>It goes to the Minister for Finance.  That is another easy way of bringing money into the Exchequer at the expense of the ESB consumer.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the interconnector in Northern Ireland which was blown up by the Provos.  It was never replaced.  The ESB have to have a higher capacity as a result.  They must have a minimum of 35 per cent over-capacity in production in case of a breakdown in a major power station.  In other words, at all times they must have at least 35 per cent more than is necessary.  If they had an interconnector they would need less capacity.  The Government made no effort to help the ESB to replace the interconnector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is claimed by the ESB union, <Col N="209" /> ESBOA, that last year the Government forced the ESB to pay an exhorbitant price for turf well above the price recommended by the Prices Commission.  Bord na Móna made a profit, but the ESB make a loss.  It is the Government who have broken down and wrecked the finances of the ESB and forced them into a position of constantly having to increase prices.  They must charge high domestic and commercial prices which makes things difficult for every business.  The Eastern Health Board had to pay 30,000 ESB bills last year on behalf of consumers who could not afford to pay their bills.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak in support of this motion.  I find the Government amendment totally negative, regressive and displaying a contemptuous disregard for the widespread dissatisfaction and concern among the public and industry at the escalating cost of electricity.  For a Government which claims to be concerned about issues such as this the amendment is astonishing, reflecting as it does a callous and very conservative attitude.  It is a reflection on the Labour participants in the Government who masquerade as the champions of the poor, the very people who will be most affected by these increases.  Labour are concerned about unemployment, which will increase following the decision to raise electricity prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, the Government's negative attitude disturbs me.  The justification for increasing the charges is &ldquo;that electricity prices can only be reduced through long term structural measures which allow for regional employment and social as well as economic aspects of electricity supply&rdquo;.  The Government's argument totally ignores the recommendation of the NESC Report, No. 74, 1983.  The recommendation of that report was that in a case of excessive capacity of electricity, which is what we have today, any price which could be obtained for an additional unit of electricity greater than the additional fuel operating cost incurred in generating that additional unit would make a contribution towards the capital costs incurred <Col N="210" /> in installing existing capacity.  This marginal cost pricing strategy, if adopted, would encourage demand for electricity and thus bring down the price.</P>
    <P>While this strategy could not continue indefinitely because it would run counter to conservation measures, the NESC report stated that its adoption could be appropriate in present circumstances since capital costs are already sunk and less advantageous capital spending or other forms of energy would be curtailed. This strategy could be designed so that the bulk of the benefits accrue to the trading sectors.  The Government ignored this recommendation.  Why did they do so?  Why did they not introduce this strategy as an alternative to price increases?  Why did the Government not relax their demand on the ESB so that they would not be obliged to purchase quantities of oil from the Irish National Petroleum Corporation at prices considerably in excess of those available elsewhere? In 1983 the extra cost to the ESB was £5 million.</P>
    <P>Is it not obvious that it is Government policy which is responsible for ESB price increases?  Government policy in relation to the price of turf to the ESB is a major factor in the high cost of electricity. Government policy in regard to energy prices, as the NESC report states, is <i>ad hoc</i> and unco-ordinated.  Again the NESC lay the blame at the door of the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government's answer to the Opposition motion is lamentable.  It displays a lack of concern and inability to examine other possibilities such as the NESC recommendations.  The Government's policy displays a bankrupt approach to the question of electricity prices.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  The Government seek the easy way out: grant the increase and be done with it.  This Government's attitude and Labour's endorsement of it is a shame on the <Col N="211" /> Labour Party which professes concern for the needy, the deprived and underprivileged. This increase most assuredly will result in increased unemployment.  To say that nothing can be done is a downright insult.  Shame on the Labour Minister who approved this increase.  Shame on the Labour Ministers who supported him and shame on the Labour backbenchers who will walk through the division lobbies in support of it.  I feel ashamed that I was ever associated with this party which claims to be a party of concern and to champion the cause of the needy.  I say to the Labour Party their decision to endorse this increase, indeed to initiate it, and to come into the House with a feeble reason for that decision, will long be remembered by those they claim to represent.  The people whose cause they claim to champion are being asked to accept a pay freeze, tighten their belts and suffer the humiliation and despair of job loss.  They have the audacity to say that they care.  Their one chance to redeem themselves is to have the political courage to overturn this increase and reject the political pressures of their so-called partners who are making them bite the dust.  Reject their demands, save the soul of the Labour Party and save the country this added burden.</P>
      <P>There are alternatives to this price increase.  They need only take the trouble to examine them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important motion which is before the House and there are many Deputies who wish to speak on it.  We are trying to compromise as best we can and so give everyone a chance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the middle of a by-election I was just about to enter the arena when all of a sudden the great Labour Party and Fine Gael Party came out of their shell.  We did not know what kind of shell it was. However, a week before the election they brought out a report saying they would keep the generating station in the midlands. They are winding down stations in other areas.  In my part of the country <Col N="212" /> we call that mothballing.  They are very intelligent in my part of the country and, if there was a by-election, they would dump Fine Gael and Labour.  Last November we moved a motion in regard to the future of the ESB turf burning generators but we got a negative response from the Government.  Other Members and I received a document in the post which said there would be closures and when we checked we found that there was a report but that the contents could not be made known.  I demanded to see that report and during a resumed debate on Private Members' Business, the Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy Eddie Collins, interrupted to say that he now had a report and was going to release it.  How do we explain that to the people?</P>
    <P>They then overturned those proposals and introduced a new set which I call a three card trick.  It is just not on.  When I was director of elections in Laois-Offaly I asked the Minister for Energy and other members of the Fine Gael Party where they stood.  I asked them to spell out their position and they called a conference in the Shelbourne Hotel.  Journalists, especially those from provincial papers, asked a lot of questions which the Government did not like but the people of Laois-Offaly rejected their answers. The Government are dithering from one arena to another, calling to the Lord to send oil or some other source of revenue which will take them out of their financial dilemma.  I estimate that about 5,000 jobs will be lost as a result of these increases in the price of electricity.  What will that mean in the loss of PRSI and taxation? The Government gave an undertaking that they were going to have a plan for energy but we have heard nothing about it.  I should like to go into this in more detail but I do not have the time.  The Government have much to explain and when the people are called on to give a verdict on thir performance they will do so in no uncertain terms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government and the Minister for Energy are very confused. During the summer, the Minister for <Col N="213" /> Industry, Commerce, Trade and Tourism, Deputy Bruton, said that he was in favour of increasing electricity costs to the consumer in order to lower the cost to industry.  We were told that the Minister for Energy disagreed with this policy and that is just one example of their confusion.  There are many other examples, especially with regard to the peat burning stations.  Perhaps the by-election in Laois-Offaly saved the power stations in those constituencies but the Government decided very quickly to close the Screeb power station in Connemara, an area which is one of the poorest in the country.  There are 3,400 people registered as unemployed there and 70 per cent of all holdings are less than 30 acres. The unemployment rate is 40 per cent which is nearly treble the national average.</P>
      <P>The Government are very choosey in deciding which stations they will keep open or close.  The ESB invested £200,000 in 1983 in the complete overhaul and modernisation of the station at Screeb and this investment gave the impression, rightly or wrongly, and encouragement to other investors that the plant at Screeb would not be closed in the immediate future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reorganisation proposals put to the ESB by the consultants, Miller Barry, affect County Galway and Galway city. What cost savings are involved in these reorganisation proposals?  I do not believe that the changes proposed for Galway district will contribute in any way to the aim of reducing the cost of electricity nationally.  I am still awaiting a reply from the Minister as to what the cost savings will be.  I tried to raise this in the House as it was raised in Galway County Council as far back as last August but we have not had the courtesy of a reply from the Minister or the Department.  I understand that the engineering works at Tuam are to be closed and that 60 workers will be transferred from Galway to Limerick and that the Galway district management will be completely closed.  I cannot understand why we are uprooting families and transferring them to Limerick, transferring business from Galway to Sligo in the <Col N="214" /> north, from Galway to Limerick in the south and from the east Galway area to Dundalk.  The whole situation is ludicrous especially as the Minister referred to the new houses that have to be connected and the western package of which we are so proud.  We discussed the problems associated with group water schemes here last week.  How can we have a consumer service when the whole Galway district management is being abandoned?  Three district managers at Galway, Sligo and Limerick will be replaced by two regional managers.  I hope the Minister can explain the reasons behind this; at least he should have the courtesy to reply to public representatives and local councillors as to why these drastic reorganisation proposals are taking place.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at job losses because of the proposed increases in electricity charges.  Many factories have closed this year.  The Burlington Textile Plant announced their closure the other day with a loss of 250 jobs.  The CII have said that the ESB price increases will lead to a loss of 3,000 jobs in industry and that £50 million will be lost in industry over the whole year.  Let us hope that the Government will be more concerned about the competitiveness of Irish industry and exports.  We must also limit imports.  There are figures in the Córas Tráchtála export review telling us how industrial electricity prices have increased.  In 1983 Ireland was the fourth highest in the EC after the Netherlands, Denmark and Italy, 8.6 per cent above the average EC price.  This is in contrast to the position in 1973 when Irish prices were the lowest in the Community and were nearly one-third lower than the average.  That is a clear indication of how our electricity prices have hit industry. Last week a Dublin mother had to go to court to get her entitlements under the free fuel scheme.  It is hitting the consumers and industry and I call on the Government to withdraw their proposal that electricity prices be increased.</P>

      <P>In the <Col N="215" /> short time available to me I wish to make a few points.  The ESB applied to the National Prices Commission for an increase in electricity charges, which claim was substantiated and proved beyond doubt.  I was amazed to hear Deputy Connolly rant about the power stations in the midlands.  The proposal put to the Government by the ESB was, as Deputy Connolly pointed out, leaked to the public before it even left the ESB offices.  In that proposal there was reference to the closure of most of the power stations in the midlands but that did not happen.</P>

      <P>Despite the ranting and raving of Deputy Connolly it did not happen and it will not happen.  The ESB must get this increase if they are to continue to use small power stations, particularly in the midlands.  The ESB are the most substantial user of peat from Bord na Móna.  Are the Opposition saying the ESB power stations should be closed in order to reduce the price of electricity?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>We were the &ldquo;baddies&rdquo; who were going to close the stations and all of this was due to a stolen report from the ESB.  At that time I gave an undertaking to my people in the Allenwood power station that I would fight to keep the station open.  The stations in Portarlington and Allenwood are open and I am proud of that.  We have kept these stations open even though they are loss-making so far as the ESB are concerned.</P>
      <P>The ESB are the largest users of turf in the country.  They use more than 35 per cent of machine won turf and almost 70 per cent of milled peat sold by Bord na Móna.  People are saying that everything must be taken into account, that we should not use these products in order to reduce the cost of electricity.  I remember when only one industry used turf as a raw material but it closed because Ministers in different Governments &mdash; Deputy Reynolds was one &mdash; said they could not subsidise the price of turf due to some ESB regulation.  Thirty men were put out of work but I am not blaming Deputy Reynolds or the other Minister.</P>
      <P>I want to see the small power stations open and burning turf.  I want this for the sake of the workers in the midlands and elsewhere.  We could use natural gas which would be the cheapest of all but I do not want to see that, and I am sure Deputy Reynolds does not want to see that happen.  Despite all his shouting and ranting, Deputy Connolly could hardly want it to happen either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for State appears to be under some misapprehensions as to where this party stand in relation to Bord na Móna and what mix of fuel should be used by the ESB.  I endorse what he said that the Bord na Móna fuel mix should be continued until the resources are totally exploited.  If any power station is to close the first one to close <Col N="217" /> should be an oil-fired station.  I am not making the case for inefficiency.  I was amazed to hear Deputy Mac Giolla talk about the dear price of milled peat to the ESB.  One would think Bord na Móna should be the St. Vincent de Paul Society for the ESB to allow them to produce a great balance sheet.  He worked in the ESB.  Does he want Bord na Móna destroyed?</P>
      <P>The most recent report of the ESB is interesting.  The Minister of State spoke about Allenwood in County Kildare but I will start with my own county, namely, the Lanesboro' station in County Longford. In their report the ESB gave the fuel cost per unit for a milled peat station as 2.924 p.  Let us consider the situation with regard to oil.  At Great Island, County Wexford, the cost is given at 4.109 p.; Poolbeg, Dublin, 3 p; Tarbert, County Kerry, 3.952 p.  Does that suggest that Bord na Móna are selling their milled peat at too high a price to the ESB?  It does not suggest it to me.  The ESB should stop putting forward an argument that does no stand up.  We acknowledge they have a major problem but they should not use such arguments.  Some of the famous consultants here who write reports about these matters do not know the facts either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want a new direction in relation to energy policy and we want a new strategy. We are not taking an empty popular line.  What we are talking about is plain commonsense.  The Minister comes in here and delivers 11 or 12 pages in the vein that there is no alternative to the position.  I remind him that that is only a repetition of the defeatist attitude of every member of this Government all of whom are totally bereft of any new approach, idea or innovation about where they are going and are bankrupt in their ideas as to how to approach it. This Government are merely skirting around the problem as they have done in the case of every other major problem facing this economy.  The Minister, his colleague Deputy Desmond and the Labour Party, subscribe to the view that it is much more important to talk about contraception and divorce than about <Col N="218" /> 215,000 people on the dole, the 10,000 young people leaving our shores every year for the last couple of years, the 30,000 hard-pressed people who had to have their bills paid by the Midland Health Board or the large part of the million homes that this increase will hit this winter when the lights will go out for many of them because they will not be in a position to pay this increase.  The Government prefer to skirt around the problem and talk about red herrings and things that are far away and foreign than about the problems of this economy. They are feeding their giddy minds with foreign twaddle.  That is the way I describe the actions or inactions of this Government.</P>
    <P>With regard to the damage that this increase is going to do, there is a document that I should have thrown into the fire long ago.  The Government are going around the country trying to sell it not alone to outsiders but to their own supporters. I know what they were told in my area and if they go to County Kildare, Deputy Bermingham's area, they will be told the same.  It is a non-starter, a con job based on spurious assumptions and phoney figures that will not stand up.  It is based on projections of interest rates that now are going in the opposite direction to what that document suggests.  So much for that document.</P>
    <P>Earlier this summer we had the White Paper on industrial policy.  What did that say?  That addressed the problem of the non-competitive situation in which Irish industry found itself because of the high cost of electricity, telecommunications and Government services.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, time and time again in the newspapers and on radio and television said his priority was to eliminate that non-competitiveness.  The Government, as we know, say one thing and do another.  They preach one principle but perform in the opposite direction.  They brought in a 7 per cent increase in the cost of electricity and they say there is not other way out.  There is another way out if they are interested in listening to it, but they prefer to take the easy way out by <Col N="219" /> saying that the ESB must get this increase.  Let us examine the facts.</P>
    <P>Will the Government decide to bring in the report on industrial costs and, side by side with it, the report that was commissioned in October 1982 when the decision was taken to make this inquiry?  Now in November 1984 it sits on the Minister's desk where probably it will gather cobwebs because he does not intend to give it the light of day.  If he did so intend he would have brought it in with this increase in an effort to substantiate his argument.  Obviously the report of the committee of inquiry does not stand behind his argument and he would be shown up as being rather stupid in bringing it forward.  Maybe he does not intend to do so, but when I get the opportunity I will debate the full details.</P>
    <P>The ESB brought out their annual report which said that they were in deficit of £23 million.  If they were any other commercial business in this country what would be the true figure on those accounts from the ESB?  If it was I, in my own business, or anybody else in business, that set of accounts would not show a £23 million deficit if it was in accordance with commercial practices and principles that must be practised by every commercial concern in this country.  It would show a profit of £36 million because buried in those ESB accounts is a factor called double depreciation.  In our own businesses we are allowed only single depreciation.  The ESB have been allowed double depreciation since they were set up.  It is time to blow the myth that they are running a really commercial concern.  Therein lies the hiding of large sums of money, and that is recognised.  In their annual report for the first time it has now been brought down slightly from what it was, adjusted maybe £1 million or £2 million.</P>
    <P>Double depreciation was given to the ESB when they were set up to enable them to generate enough cash to carry on with their development programme.  I suggest that the time has come for the last programme of development by the ESB for a long time into the future with <Col N="220" /> the building of stages 1, 2 and 3 at Money-point, on the basis that the power stations which the Minister, Deputy Bermingham, referred to are kept in operation. If they are not, then in 1990 over-capacity might not be as great as it is today.  I am not one of those defeatists who believe that the Irish economy is dead for all time, despite the best efforts of this Government and every decision they have taken and every budget they have brought in to ensure that major industry, which at the end of the day produces the wealth that sustains the people, is buried.  I do not know whether they can see the light of day or what makes the economy tick, but they have not shown that they do in their actions of the last two years in Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister argued that it is silly to say that we can reduce the price of electricity, that somebody must pay the tax. I suggest that it is time he looked around and at the outside world and realised that 215,000 people are on the dole and that the taxpayers are paying for the borrowings to sustain those people on the dole. I suggest to him that there is a different philosophy from the one he and his Labour Party colleagues adopt.  That is, the more people you put back to work, the more tax and revenue will be created for the Exchequer and the less money you need to borrow to pay for it.</P>
    <P>This Government came into power preaching competitiveness, from the sermonising of the Taoiseach down to the speeches of every other Minister, and they have made sure that Irish industry has become more uncompetitive.  In the middle of 1983, with the problem they had in trying to balance their books, what did they do?  They put up the price of natural gas by 50 per cent to the ESB, from 16.07p per therm to 24p.  Why? They cannot say that they were going to charge what is the commercial price of gas to any outside consumer because if they say that they should have put it to 32p or 33p.  They put it up from 16p to 24p.  The Minister and the Government can easily take it back and absorb that 7 per cent for a short period until every Member of this House gets a look at the <Col N="221" /> report of the committee of inquiry and we have an opportunity to devise a new energy policy, but obviously this Government have no intention of doing that.</P>
    <P>When I left the Department of Energy a lovely contract lay on the table there, ready to be signed, that in 1984 terms would bring in approximately £600 million in revenue to this State from the North of Ireland and the British Exchequer. The Government let it run on from day to day.  I do not know what they did with it.  I challenge the Minister and the Taoiseach to come in and tell us why that contract was not put into practice.  If they had not slipped up on that they would not need any more of this revenue that they are talking about in relation to this and they could give the ESB natural gas at a reasonable price.  The one thing that this economy has to its advantage at the moment is that we have natural gas, yet the Minister suggests that there is no other use for it, that we leave it at the bottom of the sea for the next 20 years, that there is no more gas to be found around our coasts.  That is nonsense.  The reports in his office are available to him as they were to me and if he has any judgment at all he will realise there are other sources of gas to be found around our coast.  We must develop the market for natural gas.  That is what I was doing in relation to the North.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that earlier this evening in this House our leader had to point out to the Taoiseach that time and time again we on this side said that the Government were going to be sold a dummy and made a fool of by the British Prime Minister in all their dealings with her.  The same British Prime Minister wrote the most sarcastic letter that could be written to an Irish Prime Minister in relation to the North of Ireland gas deal.  He did not publish that but if he had the commonsense and wisdom to read between the lines he would know what to have expected in Downing Street yesterday when she dug his grave for him at 5 p.m. Indeed, the national handlers here are digging the grave and they will see him buried.  If he had listened to commonsense &mdash; it appears he is not prepared to <Col N="222" /> do so &mdash; he would not have turned out to be, as he was regrettably yesterday, a national embarrassment.  Again we were told by Britain that we do not count, the Empire still rules and Britannia still rules our shores.</P>
    <P>The Government sank our national fleet last week.  They made a national disgrace of us yesterday evening and now when we are trying to preach commonsense to them in relation to an energy policy that can improve the competitiveness of Irish Industry, that they should use our natural gas resources to alleviate the problems of our economy, they fail to recognise those opportunities.  I say to the Government, &ldquo;Take up that, do the job the people elected you to do or else, as Mrs. Thatcher said yesterday evening, out, out, out.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Question, &ldquo;That the amendment be made&rdquo;, put, and a division being demanded, it was posponed in accordance with the order of today until 8.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 21 November, 1984</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the cutbacks in the Health Services and calls on the Government to take immediate steps to provide the necessary financial assistance so as to restore the standard of general medical services and of patient care to the levels which have hitherto prevailed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for the motion is the obvious hardship being inflicted on our people by the savage cutbacks in the health services, especially since the Coalition took office two years ago.  We are concerned about the effect they are having on the less well off, not alone those in the lower income group but also those who are now being described as the new poor because of the amount of taxation and the number of levies they have to pay.  Many people who are just above medical card limits are unable to meet their commitments. The limit in the refund drugs scheme went from £12 to £28 per month since the Government took office.  Those without medical cards are now obliged to pay <Col N="223" /> for school transport.  In other words, the medical card is being used as a guideline not alone for health purposes but also for school transport, something that no Member could ever envisage or any person in his sanity should have accepted.</P>
    <P>The amount of tax or PRSI a person pays is not taken into account when a person applies for a medical card.  I am aware of a person with five children with a gross income of £140 per week, paying £28 tax and PRSI leaving him with £112 in take home pay, who was not considered eligible for a medical card.  The Government went before the people on a Joint Programme for Government and it is no harm to recall what they said about their policy on health care.  In their document they stated:</P>
    <P>We recognise that there is a need for a radical review of the operation of Health Boards and that a shift in emphasis from hospital to community services is necessary both to provide the type of service most appropriate to the needs of patients and to reduce the wasteful use of scarce resources.  In carrying through this programme of reform we shall ensure that the existing level and quality of health care will be maintained.</P>
    <P>In particular, care must be taken to ensure that any adjustments do not militate against the less well off.</P>
    <P>The Government are doing the exact opposite.  The joint programme commitment in regard to the existing level and quality of health care has not been carried out.  The quality has not been maintained and the people will recognise that before 1985.  It is my belief that the services will collapse before the end of next month.  It is the less well off who are suffering most.</P>
    <P>A Labour backbencher when speaking to the motion of no confidence on the day the last Fianna Fáil Government fell in November 1982 warned the Minister, and the incoming Government, the present Coalition, that any attempt to worsen the health service would be resisted with all the powers at the disposal <Col N="224" /> of the Labour Party.  However, here we have a Labour Minister responsible for administering the savage cutbacks agreed by the Government.  There have been cutbacks in all services but, in particular, in the community care service.  The Government were not long in power when they removed medical cards from old age pensioners.  Such cards were given automatically to those people by Deputy Woods when he was Minister for Health. The Coalition also removed medical cards from students.</P>
    <P>The Minister promised a review of the 900 items removed in the summer of 1982 and, in fairness to him, he carried out that review but what did he do?  The Minister took more items off that list. Before that second review the simple stomach mixture, the simple white bottle, so necessary for many people, the elderly in particular, was on the list but the Minister removed it.  The result is there is no antacid on the list.  Such people must now buy the white mixture.  It is significant that in the last year that these antacids were allowed it cost £500,000 while in 1983 the substitute, Cimethadine cost £1.8 million and was the most expensive drug on the list of prescribed drugs in the GMS.  That has been brought about by the behaviour of the Government.</P>
    <P>Health boards are doing their best within their reduced allocation.  They made savings on maintenance, the amount of stock they hold and on transport. In fact the saving on transport has been so much that the scheme has been brought to a level where it is totally inadequate. I am aware of dispensary patients who have to pay £28 to travel from Carrickmacross to Monaghan to attend a clinic.  That is more than half an old age pension.  I am aware of a mother who had an appointment with a surgeon while her child had an appointment with a paediatrician but because they were on two different days in the same week, the mother who could only afford the car once, opted to bring the child to the paediatrician thereby neglecting her own health.  That is an indication of what is going on.</P>
    <P>The Minister closed the maternity unit <Col N="225" /> at Bantry hospital and in my constituency he threatened to close Monaghan hospital and sell it before he would agree to open a hospital in Cavan.  He has partially reversed that decision and, hopefully, wisdom will prevail and he will go the rest of the way and ensure the continuance of the maternity facilities at Monaghan County Hospital.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are not opposed to reviewing the cost of the health services because we accept that they are expensive.  We believe in greater efficiency in that service but I accuse the Government of being so preoccupied with financial rectitude that they have no concern for the people.  They are totally insensitive to the hardship and poverty they have created as a result of their social policy.  The only figure they quote in relation to our costs as against those of other countries is the GNP because our GNP is relatively high compared to other EC member states and OECD countries.  If one looks at the <i>per capita</i> cost, one will see that we are the second lowest in Europe &mdash; only Greece has a lower <i>per capita</i> cost for health services.  The time has come when the Government must ask themselves what kind of health service they intend providing.  If they do not provide a sufficient allocation to run at least a minimal health service, the whole service will collapse.</P>
    <P>We have fewer doctors than any other EC country, including Greece.  I appeal to the Government not to be so hung up on the GNP and financial rectitude that they will dismantle a health service which took many years and a lot of hard work on the part of Governments, Departments, health boards, county councils and the many people who worked in the administration of a health service, to build.</P>
    <P>There has been a cut down in the number of hospital beds and admissions to hospitals, wards were closed in practically every county during the summer months, some for one or two months; <i>locum</i> cover, overtime and weekend cover has been reduced.  All this has created very serious problems for many people.</P>
    <P>The operations for the replacement of <Col N="226" /> knee joints have come to a halt.  In Cork they are not doing any hip replacements at present.  I understand it is only because of good management on the part of staff in the existing orthopaedic hospitals that they are able to carry out hip replacements, they happen to have a supply of hip joints in stock.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to know how the psychiatric services will carry on next year.  In the Eastern Health Board area the number attending the out-patients department have increased dramatically. There is a big demand for admission of the elderly because they are not able to maintain themselves and their relatives are not able to maintain them in the community.  There has been an increase in out-patients because of depression and the people have lost confidence because of the policies this Government have pursued. Over the last two years unemployment has increased by over 60,000.  This has created a loss of confidence which is reflected in the figures of those attending psychiatric services, particularly in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>The rehabilitation service are unable to find jobs for those who previously would have been easy to place.  This is a direct result of the Government policy.  In the spring of 1983 the Taoiseach told us that, because of financial rectitude their policies would be diametrically opposed to the policies necessary to create jobs.</P>
    <P>All over the country equipment and buildings are standing idle.  When I asked the Minister if he could tell me what buildings and equipment were vacant as a result of insufficient funding the answer I got was:</P>
    <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not collected by my Department on a routine basis.  The Deputy may get the information he requires by addressing an appropriate inquiry to the chief executive officers of the health boards who are in a position to provide the information requested.</P>
    <P>It is an indictment of the Government and the Minister that he is not sufficiently interested to know what is happening <Col N="227" /> around the country as a result of Government policies.  A cat-scanner which cost £500,000 is not in use.  A maternity unit in Galway is not in use because there are no funds.  There are any number of buildings vacant around the country. Fourteen buildings for the mentally handicapped are lying idle.  The Minister's reply to my question on 12 June 1984 was that &ldquo;because of the current restrictions on recruitment in the public sector and the lack of development funds are not operational&rdquo;.  In their economic plan the Government said they would develop facilities for the mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>I will give examples of the kind of letters I got from hospitals.  I will quote from a letter I got from a doctor about a young man who is bleeding from his kidney, a potentially very serious condition:</P>
    <P>We will get these investigations carried out as soon as possible.  As you are very well aware, we have some problems with cutbacks in so far as 40% of our beds in the G.U. are closed at present.</P>
    <P>Another letter to a doctor at the other end of the country, from Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, reads:</P>
    <P>Clinics were booked in anticipation of there being available Senior Staff, sufficient in number, to service three OPD Clinics on an on-going basis. Unfortunately in the absence of approval from the Department of Health of staff required to support these Clinics it has been necessary to reduce, with effect from 1st May, 1984, the extent of service available and to re-schedule existing appointment.</P>
    <P>We regret, therefore, it is not possible at this time to make the appointment you request.</P>
    <P>That is the type of letters which are issuing from hospitals.  From the Wilton Hospital, Cork, a doctor wrote to me saying:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="228" /> ...The chaos caused by these closures made it obvious that further closures were unthinkable, and that at this time, the number of beds closed down stands at approximately thirty-five. ...Sick patients are put through the hardship of waiting for as long as five hours in day rooms, from which they can observe wards full of empty beds. Patients find this absurd, and the Nursing and Medical Staff have to take the brunt of their indignation.</P>
    <P>This is very understandable.</P>
    <P>As a result of the increased difficulty in admitting patients, the backlog at the Out-Patient Department has got worse.  In addition, out-patient facilities have also been cut.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board placed an advertisement in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> on 11 October telling the public they were not able to provide the level of service and the steps they were taking to ensure that they would be able to live within their reduced allocation for the remainder of 1984.</P>
    <P>On the community care side, the dental services have been cut; there are no <i>ad hoc</i> dental services in the Southern Health Board area.  The opthalmic service has been cut.  There is a waiting list of four years in County Louth for the sight testing scheme, 12 to 14 months in Cavan-Monaghan and there is no scheme in the Southern Health Board or the Mid-Western Health Boards.  These are the types of problems people are confronted with and still the Government seem to be totally unaware of them.  In every statement the Minister says there is money for this and money for that.  If he stopped telling the people that it would be something. He is giving people false hopes and false expectations that there is money available for essential services.  The reality is that there is not.</P>
    <P>In this year's allocation there was no word that the Government would remove food subsidies at the beginning of the summer.  That created chaos for the health boards and for everybody else and had a penal effect on poorer people.  They <Col N="229" /> got no compensation from the State.  It cost the Eastern Health Board £80,000 and the Southern Health Board £85,000. That would have helped to create an <i>ad hoc</i> dental service or an ophthalmic service and would have prevented people from waiting an inordinate time for these services.</P>
    <P>On 1 November I asked the Minister the estimated deficit in each health board for the current year and he replied as follows:</P>
    <P>It is not possible at this stage to predict with any degree of certainty the extent to which health boards will succeed in curtailing expenditure within approved limits.</P>
    <P>The Government are responsible for the allocation to health boards yet on 1 November the Minister for Health did not know the estimated deficit expected in each of the eight health boards, although all the health boards had publicly announced what the deficit would be. Anybody who read the newspapers knew what the deficit would be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps he knew that the health boards would be £10 million short and perhaps he did not want to disclose it.  Maybe he thought we did not read the newspapers or that we might know only what was happening in our own health board area.  He may not have wanted us to know it.  It is even worse if he did not know the figure.  It is a very serious indictment of the Government and of the Minister for Health in particular that they were not sufficiently interested in the consequences of their action in 1984 to find out the expected deficit in each area.  The figures are as follows: The South-Eastern Health Board, £1.8 million; the Eastern Health Board, £2 million; the Southern Health Board, £2.6 million; the North-Eastern Health Board, £0.4 million; the Mid-Western Health Board, £1 million; the North-Western Health Board, £750,000; the Western Health Board, £600,000; and <Col N="230" /> the Midland Health Board, £0.5 million. That is the situation in 1984.</P>
      <P>The Minister has pointed out on many occasions that the deficit must be the first charge on the allocation in 1985. Presumably the health boards will suffer the same deficit in 1985 and the minimum deficits will be as follows: the South Eastern Health Board, £5.4 million; the Eastern Health Board, £9 million; the Southern Health Board, £7.8 million; the North-Eastern Health Board, £2.45 million; the Mid-Western Health Board, £5.89 million; the North-Western Health Board, £2.8 million; the Western Health Board, £4.04 million; and the Midland Health Board, £1.9 million.  That gives a total deficit of £36.84 million.  It would be impossible for the health boards to deliver any kind of service.  There is an obligation on the Minister to tell the health boards what they are to do because they have a statutory obligation to implement and deliver services and it would be a tragedy if they were to eliminate those services which are non-statutory, such as grants to voluntary bodies and the home help service.  Somebody must tell them what to do.</P>
      <P>The Minister met the CEOs and the chairmen of the health boards last Friday and spelled out certain aspects of the national plan.  One area of the plan is the promotion of good health but in another section of the plan the Government announce their intention to extend the licensing laws.  That could be a debate on its own but certainly it is not in the interests of promoting good health to extend the licensing laws since one of the greatest causes of ill health is the excessive drinking of alcohol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that any excess expenditure in 1984 must be absorbed in 1985.  A very serious situation will develop in 1985 because up to now health boards have been able to maintain permanent staff, although a number of temporary staff have been let go.  The training schools have gone in a number of places, including St. Davnet's hospital in Monaghan. For the last two years no student psychiatric nurses have been taken into that excellent school.  It is detrimental <Col N="231" /> to the interests of this hospital which is recognised for the standard of its teaching. If that situation is allowed to continue there will be very serious problems in the psychiatric service.  Davnet's is not alone.  In six of the eight health board areas they did not take in any students this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister said last Friday that there would be a £45 million reduction in the payroll over the next three years.  He told us about two months ago in the House that the reduction would be £30 million but it has now been increased to £45 million.  That means 4,500 jobs in the health service.  In the document he circulated he stated:</P>
    <P>The Government has decided that, throughout 1985, the arrangements whereby two thirds of vacancies occurring in the Civil Service (excluding vacancies arising from career breaks) are held open will continue in force and that measures at least equivalent in effect in terms of the numbers of posts, which must remain unfilled and/or pay their costs, are to be applied in health agencies.</P>
    <P>How in the name of all that is wonderful could you run a health service and reduce staff by two-thirds?  Operating theatres will have to close down.  Areas of the country will be left without doctors and public health nurses.  I do not believe the people who conceived this idea know how the service operates, particularly in rural Ireland.  The Minister stressed again that any excess expenditure in 1984 must be a primary charge on the accounts of 1985. In other words, the health boards will be bankrupt by the end of 1985, although my view is that they will not be able to carry on until then in the situation as outlined by the Minister last Friday.</P>
    <P>Private and semi-private charges will be increased in State hospitals.  In 1978 the cost was £91 per week but in 1984 it is £500 per week for a private bed in a public hospital.  It is more expensive now for a private bed in a public hospital <Col N="232" /> than it is in St. Vincent's Private Nursing Home in Elm Park.  I know that the Minister's philosophy is against private medicine but nevertheless if people want private treatment it is their right.  It also relieves the Exchequer because it cuts waiting lists and relieves public beds for public patients.  It is not to be deprecated by the Minister or the Government.  Each year 60,000 people are leaving the VHI. These are people who were prepared to pay their own way but they are now leaving the VHI and crowding the already overloaded public sector.  The Minister decided to charge consultants for the use of equipment in private hospitals.  He tried to get the consultants to agree to this.  I will read from a letter dated 13 August 1984 from the secretary of the Department to the chief executive officers of each Health Board and to the secretary managers of each public voluntary hospital board.  There is one paragraph dealing with his consultations with the consultants.  The letter stated that it did not prove possible to reach agreement on this matter in the discussions which took place between the Minister and the organisation and the Minister informed the organisation of his intention to proceed with his decision by way of discussion at local level.  He went on to say that accordingly health boards and the other public hospital management were directed to enter into discussions with the consultants or their representatives with a view to securing a reasonable contribution.</P>
    <P>That contribution will be passed on to the consumer who is already over taxed and is paying for health services through tax and health contributions.  In the document handed out last Friday the Minister said that every possible effort must be made to maintain good relations with all staff and all trade unions and to avoid damaging disputes.  How does he reconcile the two?  He is directing the health boards to get into conflict with the consultants about charging for the use of equipment in public hospitals and, at the same time, he is telling them to maintain good relations.  The consultants in the hospitals have done their job well.  All workers in <Col N="233" /> hospitals have pulled their weight in an effort to ensure that the health boards can survive within their allocations.  I will conclude now because I am giving some time to my colleague, Deputy Conaghan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody in the service has worked hard and diligently to live within the reduced allocations for 1984.  The Minister is directing the health boards to consult with the consultants about this matter.  That is destined to cause problems.  This is a very ill-timed and ill-judged decision.  The £1.4 million the Minister wants will not come out of the pockets of the consultants.  It will come out of the pockets of the consumer. It will be passed on to the patient, and the patient will have to pay.  The tragedy is that this will put further pressure on the Voluntary Health Insurance Board, a semi-State body who have served the people well.  Approximately 20 per cent of the population are not entitled to full, free and comprehensive hospital care and they depend on the VHI.  The policies being pursued by the Government will create such serious problems that more and more people will not be able to afford voluntary health insurance.  Between excessive charges for private accommodation in public hospitals and the extra money the Minister wants to take in &mdash; £1.4 million from the consultants and £4.6 million by way of increased charges in 1985 &mdash; serious problems will be created for people who want to pay their way and get something to which they are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told the CEOs and the chairmen of health boards that he had other ideas on how they might deal with their reduced allocation next year.  He said the first and, indeed, obvious suggestion was to reduce the level of admissions to hospitals and institutions.  He suggested more rigorous admission and casualty department policies in general hospitals to ensure that patients who can be treated in the community are not admitted to or treated in hospitals.  That sounds very good in the sense that, if people can be <Col N="234" /> treated in the community, they should not be admitted to hospital.  The reality is that because of the reduced funding they cannot be treated in the community or in outpatient departments.  There is none of the transfer which the Government talked about in their policy on community care.  There is a reduction in community care just as there is a reduction in every other service.  Therefore people cannot be treated in the community. There is a reduction in outpatient facilities and it is not possible to treat them in outpatient departments.</P>
    <P>The psychiatric service maintain that there is a bigger and bigger demand for admission to hospital beds for the elderly because of poverty.  That is a social welfare problem and I will not go into it now.  Because of poverty more and more people are demanding admission to hospital because they cannot survive on the money they have as a result of totally inadequate funding by the Government. Any country can be judged on the way it treats the less well off in society.  Over the past two years we have fallen down very badly in that respect.  We are providing a totally inadequate health service and we are providing totally insufficient money for the unfortunate people who have to depend on social welfare.  It is no wonder that the psychiatric service tell us that more and more people are demanding admission into hospital.</P>
    <P>The Minister said we should identify and close surplus facilities.  I do not know what that means.  I do not know where these surplus facilities are.  The demand is there for the existing facilities.  I said that when wards were closed for a month or two in the summer there was chaos.  A young man could not be taken in for investigation.  He was bleeding from a kidney, a potentially hazardous condition. The Minister recommended that they should face the shortfall and reduce seven day beds to five day beds.  Illness is not like that.  Unfortunately it is seven days a week and 24 hours a day, and the service must be provided for 24 hours a day seven days of the week.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested that they should reduce locum cover and eliminate <Col N="235" /> substitution.  Locum cover has been reduced.  Nurses, doctors, social workers and all the staff were very co-operative in ensuring that the level of service was maintained as far as possible.  The quality of the service was maintained.  Obviously the level of service had to drop.</P>
    <P>He suggested that they should cut out all premiums to staff.  That suggests that staff working in the health care service should not get overtime like anybody else, that they should work a 40 hour week and if they work overtime they should be treated as if they were working in the health service.  Nurses and people working in the health service work extremely hard at week-ends and when they are on night duty.  It is beyond comprehension that anyone should suggest that.</P>
    <P>The Minister also talked about the elimination of advertising.  That is very interesting.  Formerly health boards advertised jobs.  Now they are advertising to tell the people about the facilities which are not available.  Both advertisements are important: advertising to recruit new staff and to tell people you are no longer in a position to provide statutory services which you have an obligation to provide.  The Western Health Board have put in that type of advertisement.  I quoted from one in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> in October.  The Minister referred to a restriction on the number of people seeking acute hospital services. I do not know how you could do that.  By and large the service works very well. There is a very good balance between the general practitioner service and the hospital service.  I do not see how the Minister can use words like &ldquo;restriction&rdquo; and &ldquo;restraint&rdquo;&mdash; and they are the Minister's words &mdash; on the number of people seeking acute hospital services.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested reducing sick leave levels to not more than 4 per cent. How do you do that if there is a flu epidemic?  Nobody in this house or in the health services has control over that.  I should love to know the answer.  I hope the Minister of State will have the answer <Col N="236" /> for me when he speaks.  I find that fascinating. How can a health board reduce sick leave levels to not more than 4 per cent?</P>
    <P>The Government have no concept of the effect their social policies are having on the people.  They have no concept of what happened in the health services over the past few years.  If they had they would not career downhill in this manner.  It will create very serious problems.  There will be very serious consequences, hopefully not tragic consequences.  From what I read about what is supposed to happen next year, I would not be surprised if there are tragic consequences for some people.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the health services are slowly being dismantled and will not be able to go through 1985 without some major collapse of the services.  In conclusion, I want to quote from a debate on 3 November 1982 &mdash; confidence motion in the Government, the speaker being Deputy B. Desmond, as he then was, column 678, Volume 388, No. 4:</P>
    <P>While there should not be waste in the delivery of public expenditure programmes and waste should be eliminated at all levels in programmes, nevertheless we must maintain basic Exchequer moneys and taxation to ensure that the best standards of health care are available to those in need.</P>
    <P>I would fully support the then Deputy, now Minister for Health, in that statement. I ask the question &mdash; why the U-turn?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Donnellan) Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Donnellan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Donnellan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. A 1.</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;notes that the Government has continued to provide an excellent standard of health care within the allocation of £986 million for 1984 and will continue to do so within the allocation of £1,019 million for 1985, <Col N="237" /> £1,078 million for 1986 and £1,123 million for 1987.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I would like in the first place to clarify the situation as regards the funds which will be available for health services in the period to 1987.</P>
    <P>As regards the current year, it has been made clear repeatedly that no extra funds can be provided for health services by way of a Supplementary Estimate.  This situation cannot be changed.</P>
    <P>With regard to future years, Deputies will be aware that the Government, in the national plan, have determined what the Exchequer provision will be for each or the years, 1985 to 1987.  The non-capital provision for 1985 will be £1,019 million.  The provision for 1986 will be £1,078 million and the provision for 1987 will be £1,123 million.  The expenditure by health agencies cannot exceed the levels which these allocations will support. By any standards these are substantial expenditure levels.  In this regard it is interesting to recall that in 1973-1974 net non-capital expenditure on health services amounted to about £143 million, representing about 5.2 per cent of GNP. In the current year expenditure is estimated at £1,087 million, representing about 7.5% of GNP.  Undoubtedly, over the years we have as a nation succeeded in bringing our health services and health indicators into line with the developed wealthy countries.  From the mid-sixties onwards the range of our services has grown at a rapid rate and took on board the ever-growing technological advances and other developments which were a feature of those times.  There was a matching increase in staffing numbers from 40,000 to 60,000.</P>
    <P>No one would deny that this has been a difficult year as regards the management and provision of health services.  In the aftermath of a decade and more which had witnessed a steady, sustained and unparallelled growth in the level of financial and personnel resources made available to the health services, in common with many other sectors of the public service, the urgent need to control the levels of public expenditure has meant <Col N="238" /> that the resources available to the health services have had to be limited, in line with the overall budgetary limits on public expenditure.</P>
    <P>It would be unrealistic to expect that in a situation which called for curbs in the growth of public expenditure generally, the health services, which absorb almost 20 per cent of overall public expenditure, could be exempted from the requirement to secure reductions in costs.  The situation required immediate action to identify and implement measures to secure alignment of expenditure with allocation levels.  I am glad to say that in general health agencies responded in a most co-operative way and by various strategies succeeded in reducing health costs substantially.  The range of measures adopted included the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>On the non-pay side: reduction in stock levels, generally and improved stock control; economies in catering, heating, etc.; deferment of non-essential purchases of equipment; streamlining of maintenance expenditure.</P>
    <P>On the pay side: non-filling of vacancies arising, wherever possible; minimisation of supplements to basic pay such as overtime, locums and premia payments etc.</P>
    <P>The major changes in services activity necessitated by these measures were limited and included carefully selected ward closures, mainly in the summer months, by particular hospitals.</P>
    <P>One comment I would like to make is that nobody who required urgent treatment during the year was denied that treatment because of financial restrictions. I would emphasise that we intend to ensure that this approach will be maintained in the next three years.</P>
    <P>Despite the efforts of the various health agencies, it now seems likely that excesses on allocation levels will arise in 1984.  It is difficult to be precise at this stage about the extent of the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The outlook for 1985 would be considerably improved if overruns in 1984 could be eliminated or minimised. Clearly there is still some way to go before expenditure is brought into line with what can be afforded and, to do that, I think it is clear that we have to work together in a more planned, purposeful and co-ordinated way.</P>
      <P>I find it strange, as will taxpayers burdened by penal rates of taxation, that some wish us to increase health expenditure in cash terms <i>ad infinitum</i>, while paying scant and negligible regard to the taxation resources base from which services must at the end of the day be funded.  The major problem inherent in the constantly escalating cost of delivery of any given volume of health services is one that simply must be faced, tackled and overcome.  Although spending on health services in real terms has roughly doubled in the last decade or so, no one will seriously attempt to argue that the population are twice as healthy now as they were then.  This and the overall need to control public expenditure within a planned framework impelled the Government to include in the national plan specific allocations for health services for each of the years 1985 to 1987 as well as certain decisions as regards where costs should be reduced and some planning guidelines.  This leads me to the national plan and its main thrust so far as the health services are concerned.</P>
      <P>There are three points stressed in the plan in relation to approach and attitudes which I think are worth recounting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quote:&mdash; (i) First, wherever possible and justifiable, Government assistance in the social area should become more specific and more carefully aimed at, and <Col N="240" /> delivered to, the poor and under privileged &mdash; those in need &mdash; instead of using generalised measures which provide help to the better off, who do not need it, as well as to the poor.  (ii) Second, all possible measures must be taken to increase the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the administration of the social services. (iii) Third, it is important that everyone in the community &mdash; whether those in the public sector administering the social services, or the recipients of the services, or all taxpayers financing the services &mdash; should be prepared to accept changes over the years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not in the general policy of the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I continue the quotation:</P>
      <P>The needs of the country have changed greatly in the last decade so that the range of social services and the way in which they are provided must also change.  We must all be prepared to accept a reduction in, and even abandonment of, established services and structures which are no longer appropriate to current needs or requirements, so as to enable an efficient and streamlined system to provide economically for the needs of the future.</P>
      <P>In relation to the health services, a number of tasks have been highlighted. These might be summarised as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i) Promote health (a task which involves many Departments and agencies) and prevent illness; (ii) Wherever possible (provided it is cost-effective) provides services on a community or out-patient basis; in the medium to long term bring about a redistribution away from institutional services; (iii) Make necessary inpatient care available to all; improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness by closures of outmoded or non-essential facilities and by improvement of information systems; (iv) Maintain a range of care and support (welfare) services, with particular reference to children at risk, low <Col N="241" /> income groups not availing of services, and the disabled; (v) Continue to improve efficiency.</P>
    <P>We must take account also of the objectives and targets which have arisen or will arise out of recent or pending reviews of aspects of the health services, for example:</P>
    <P>Review of organisation of community care; report of working party on GMS; review of psychiatric services; review of mental handicap services; implementation of the Green Paper on the Disabled; review of the public health nursing service; implementation of systems policy and programme; implementation of Children and Adoption Bills.</P>
    <P>While these reviews will lead to a more rational and effective use of resources, net additional costs of perhaps £5 million to £8 million could arise on both the capital and revenue fronts during the period of the plan.  As I have mentioned already, the revenue Exchequer allocations for each of the three years have been determined at £1,019 million in 1985, £1,078 million in 1986 and £1,123 million in 1987.  The expenditure on health services must be aligned with these allocations.  The allocations take into account the specific measures incorporated in the national plan and the Government decisions associated with it. The main features include the following:</P>
    <P>(i)  Specific decisions in relation to pay budgets; (ii) Any excess expenditure over budget in 1984 or indeed, subsequent years, must be absorbed; (iii) Private and semi-private in-patient charges will be increased by perhaps as much as 20 per cent in 1985.  These will realise about £4.6 million in 1985; (iv) A contribution of about £1.4 million in 1985 is to be secured from hospital consultants in respect of the use of public facilities for private practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>(v) Savings on drugs expenditure in the GMS of £2.0 million are to be achieved in 1985; (vi) The Government have decided that, throughout 1985, the arrangements whereby two-thirds of vacancies occurring in the Civil Service, excluding vacancies arising from career breaks, are held open will continue in force and that measures at least equivalent in effect in terms of the numbers of posts, which must remain unfilled and/or their pay costs, are to be applied in health agencies.</P>
      <P>In spite of the constraints affecting public spending generally the Government see fit to allocate money in the plan for the following specific purposes in the health services: a sum of £2.5 million has been set aside in each of the three years for improvements in community services; I have allocated already from this sum £500,000 to the Health Education Bureau for health promotion purposes; &mdash; a similar provision has been made to enable a limited number of new units of accommodation to be commissioned.</P>
      <P>I am under no illusion as to the magnitude of the task we face.  If there were not any overruns in 1984 our task would be considerably easier.  The position in respect of the two subsequent years will not be quite so difficult provided the budget allocations for 1985 are adhered to in full.  I must stress that any excess expenditure in 1984 must be made a primary charge on the accounts for 1985.</P>
      <P>We obviously need to have a clear strategy, a detailed plan, and arrangements for implementation which will be capable of being closely monitored and adapted, as circumstances require.  I should now like to address these issues.</P>
      <P>Our initial thinking should be radical and should not be unduly influenced by past negative experience.  Otherwise, some desirable options may be ignored. Decisions in relation to any curtailment of the quantity or quality of services and the reduction of pay budgets must be seen to be taken on a planned, co-ordinated and logical basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strategy must take account of the objectives to be achieved during the full period of the plan.  Any initiatives or <Col N="243" /> development, capital or revenue, must have manageable revenue consequences in the years subsequent to the plan.</P>
    <P>The health sector of the plan must not fail because of any individual or collective lack of will, imagination or commitment on the part of those charged with directing and managing the services.  Steps taken by managment in implementing the plan must be seen to be realistic and constructive and deserving of the Government's full support.  If these conditions can be fulfilled, we can be reasonably optimistic about the chances of success.</P>
    <P>All health agencies will be informed shortly of the level of permissible spending in 1985 and will, in the light of the funds that can be provided, have to determine the measures to be taken in 1985.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the obvious areas which must be looked at deserve to be mentioned.  The first and, indeed, obvious suggestion is to reduce the level of admissions to hospitals and institutions. A more rigorous admission and casualty department policy is needed in <Col N="244" /> general hospitals to ensure that patients who can be treated in the community are not admitted to or treated in hospitals. Secondly, surplus institutional facilities should be identified and closed.  This is a very difficult issue.  But it makes no sense to allow the quality of service in essential facilities to be threatened while we waste resources by maintaining facilities that are functioning for no better reason than their being there.</P>
      <P>Any closures might be undertaken on the understanding that no compulsory redundancies will be involved, provided there is full co-operation on redeployment, retraining, relocation and, where necessary, change of employer.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, careful and detailed consideration should be given to changes in the role or use of certain in-patient facilities. A number of approaches could be envisaged under this heading.  Various combinations of the following actions might be taken:</P>
      <P>(i)  reduce number of seven day in-patient beds;</P>
      <P>(ii)  reduce seven day beds to five day beds;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>This is nonsensical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that various combinations of these actions might be taken. It is a matter basically for a health board to operate the services within the amounts of money allocated to them.  I shall continue: (iii) increase use of outpatient facilities; (iv) convert small hospital to health centre-hostel-day activity centre; (v) redeploy or retrain staff for work in their existing institution or in another institution or in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="245" /> The basic assumption would be that the resources now devoted to the facility would be left within the health board area and would be redeployed to reflect local need and the objectives of the plan, while reducing pay costs.  It is perhaps mainly through this strategem and the use of the limited development funds available under the plan that additional resources can be deployed to community services.</P>
    <P>Fourth, and very obviously, we have to reduce expenditure on pay.  The actions taken in relation to the closure or change of use of hospitals could contribute under this heading.  In addition, action could be taken under various other combinations. For example, we need to examine very carefully the extent to which we can:</P>
    <P>(i) Maximise non-filling of vacant posts, consistent with maintenance of agreed standards of service.</P>
    <P>(ii)&nbsp; Reduce locum cover.  <i>Prima facie,</i> there are wide variations between boards in the extent to which savings are being achieved under this heading.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Restructure rosters to improve efficiency.  There is insufficient information available to enable an assessment to be made of the potential savings under this heading. However, it is an option that should be quickly examined and the implications of change fully assessed.</P>
    <P>(iv)  Introduce permanent, part-time staff.  This would enable a more flexible approach to rostering and would enable staff to be concentrated on the work at the busiest times.  This suggestion is already being examined by my Department.</P>
    <P>(v)&nbsp; Reduce the volume of premium pay.  The key question is to what extent we can run our hospital services on a five or six day week basis.  The rostering of staffs on Sunday is particularly expensive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>These are but a few suggestions which might be considered. Other policy initiatives which are a matter for central determination are being considered by my Department.  I am confident that the general excellence of current patient care can be fully maintained in this framework.</P>
      <P>In addition to the relevant steps which I have suggested earlier, the following steps might be considered:</P>
      <P>(a)&nbsp; Accelerate and extend the present range of reviews and establish a suitable mechanism for monitoring implementation and results.  I have already redeployed staff to this work within my Department.</P>
      <P>(b)&nbsp; Review role of hospital consultants to extend role of consultant and reduce reliance on junior hospital doctors.  Any suggestions from health agencies on changes which might prove most beneficial and cost-effective would be welcomed.</P>
      <P>(c)&nbsp; Push ahead with systems implementation, giving priority to community care, to major hospitals, to financial and personnel systems.</P>
      <P>(d)&nbsp; Establish management development committee to help improve management potential and performance, particularly at senior levels.  The benefits of developing a more uniform management philosophy and style seems to me to be worthy of urgent consideration.</P>
      <P>(e)&nbsp; Establish nursing practice research unit in a large general hospital to constantly review effectiveness of nursing procedures and communicate results throughout the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have stated earlier the successful implementation of the plan requires a co-ordinated, planned approach to the management of the service as a whole and tremendous co-operation among all parts of the service.  It will not be enough for each agency to allocate the available <Col N="247" /> funds between programmes, even if these allocations accurately reflect the philosophy, intent and decisions of the plan. Clearly, in the light of previous experience and having regard to the multiplicity of fronts on which the problems must be tackled, a detailed plan must be drawn up by each health board and agency, setting out in sufficient detail the precise actions which have to be taken in order to ensure that the level of expenditure is brought into line with the approved allocations.  The decisions required to do this will have to be taken quickly.  After all, the biggest challenge arises in 1985.</P>
    <P>Over the next month or so, therefore, the concentration must be on achieving three things.  First, it will be necessary for each agency to draw up a realistic action plan setting out how it proposes to ensure that its expenditure in 1985 will be in line with the approved allocation, taking full account of the liability arising from any excess expenditure incurred in 1984. Second, in the case of health boards the available funds must be distributed between programmes to reflect the assumption made in the action plan and the policies for health set out in the national plan.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware that all of this and the continuing effort through the period of the plan will place a great strain on health agencies and their staffs.  Nevertheless, I suspect that most people will welcome a situation in which we now clearly know what has to be achieved over the next three years and will recognise that, as well as difficulties, there will be opportunities to do sensible things which might not otherwise be done.  With the co-operation of all concerned I am confident that we can secure the necessary realignment of services over the next few years within the framework of the national plan.</P>

If Deputy <Col N="248" /> O'Hanlon does not know about this Deputy Gallagher will give him an education about the way that service was abused over the years.  They have been critical of the Government without saying what they would do themselves if they were in a position to do anything.  The cost of the health service in 1983 was £1,043 million.  This year it is £1,064 million. The number of people employed in the service had been 40,000.  It is now 60,000.  Deputy O'Hanlon, as a medical doctor, must realise how necessary it is to get the cost of the service down to a sensible proportion of GNP.</P>

      <P>Or is he afraid to face us?  I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  All of us who are discerning people must have felt that all our problems concerning health had come to an end when we were presented with a Labour Minister for Health in December 1982.  We as medical people felt that our cup runneth over when we heard that Deputy Barry Desmond had been appointed as Minister.  He was the most outspoken member of the Labour Party when in Opposition against the supposed health cuts at that time.  Did he not help to bring down the then Fianna Fáil Government in November 1982 on the basis of health cuts?  His party colleague, Deputy Seán Treacy spoke during the confidence motion and stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="249" /> No matter what the financial difficulties of any Government might be, certain things should be sacrosanct.  The Labour Party believe that health is sacrosanct.  We helped to create the welfare state by our stance in this House and the ideology to which we have always subscribed, and we will not lightly stand for the tearing down of services, especially health services.</P>
    <P>I warn the Minister and the next Government to be established in this House that any attempt to worsen the health services or interfere with the hospitals in South Tipperary will be resisted with all the powers and influence at our disposal.</P>
    <P>I hope he will be consistent tomorrow night when he votes on this motion.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health was the most outspoken member of the Coalition in relation to the retention of food subsidies but we all saw how he and his Labour colleagues performed in relation to that issue.  Not only did they row in behind their Coalition colleagues but they even went before the people to declare their great deeds.</P>
    <P>This motion states:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the cutbacks in the Health Services and calls on the Government to take immediate steps to provide the necessary financial assistance so as to restore the standard of general medical services and of patient care to the levels which have hitherto prevailed.</P>
    <P>I sometimes feel that this Minister is suffering from delusions of grandeur.  He seems to regards himself as a surgeon, certainly in relation to the cutbacks he is making at present.  More specifically, he is asking the health boards to implement these cutbacks and he has managed to avoid facing the public in relation to any of these cuts.  He is expecting the health boards to do the entire job for him.  I can assure the Minister that the South-Eastern Health Board will not do his dirty work.  He can do it himself.</P>

      <P>The reality is very much different.  That figure is very short of the mark.  In the South-Eastern Health Board the situation is even worse.  Vacancies are not being filled, temporary positions are unfilled and the CEO in an effort to achieve further savings has suggested that we abolish <i>locum</i> cover.  In the document presented to the chairmen of the health boards last Friday this proposal was also mentioned.  The Minister has consistently said that there will be no cutbacks and no deterioration of service but surely any normal intelligent being must understand that if you refuse to provide cover for one of the two surgeons or physicians in county hospitals the service must suffer.  It means that the one person remaining will be on duty 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  In effect he can provide only an emergency service. Is it the Minister's intention to provide only an emergency health service?  Certainly he will not be in a position to provide anything else.</P>

      <P>Patients must suffer. Operations will not be performed.  Waiting lists will become even longer.  The Minister will achieve further savings but at the expense of the poor, the needy and the sick.</P>
      <P>Then there is the other proposal concerning the five-day syndrome. Obviously one can be sick only on five days of the week because the wards will be closed at weekends.  Certainly one could not afford to be sick on a Sunday because we could not afford double time.</P>
      <P>The meeting on Friday was a useless PR exercise because the allocations had already been made to the health boards. We had a meeting of the South-Eastern Health Board last Thursday and we knew our allocation then.  Our shortfall this year is already £1.8 million and as this is the first charge on the 1985 allocation our shortfall for 1985 will be a massive £5.4 million.  I cannot speak for the other health boards but there was a suggestion in last Saturday's <i>Irish Independent</i> that there would be a total shortfall of £37 million.  I believe it will be far in excess of that figure.  The Government and the Minister made no provision for the additional costs last year for which the boards were not responsible.  I refer specifically to the halving of the food subsidies.  No provision was made for this, yet the health boards had to pick up the tab.  We are working on an inflation rate of 5.5 per cent but in reality the inflation rate in 1985 is much more likely to be 7 or 7.5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the Secretary General of the IMO in April this year the proportion of Irish GNP represented by health <Col N="252" /> spending stopped rising in 1980 and dropped gradually over the next few years before falling sharply this year.  There had been an increase of 11 per cent in the Government's overall budget spending this year but health spending only increased by 3 per cent.  Apart from representing a severe cutback in the real level of health spending this meant that the Government cutbacks were totally unequal and health suffered the brunt.  It is strange that all this comes from an outspoken Minister for Health who promised to look after the health of the sick and the needy and was committed to them.  The country's eight health boards were expected to save a total of £24 million this year.  We all knew that they could not possibly achieve this and the shortfall will be the first charge on 1985, meaning in effect that if they could not achieve the savings in 1984 the shortfall in 1985 would be at least double that because the same savings will not be achieved in 1985.</P>
    <P>The Mid-Western Health Board were asked to achieve cuts of £3.2 million in their spending this year.  The latest reports suggest that their deficit at the end of the year will be something in the region of £1.5 million.  In 1985 it will become £3 million as well as the other shortfalls which will be included in their present allocation, which means that the deficit will probably be in the region of £4.5 million.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board were faced with a shortfall of £4.6 million at the start of the year and after most stringent cutbacks and closing of wards &mdash; for example, the new hospital in Tralee has only opened two-thirds of its beds &mdash; they seem set to have a deficit of £2.6 million. When you consider that in terms of 1985 prices you are probably talking of about £7 million shortfall.</P>
    <P>The Midland Health Board will have a deficit of about £400,000 this year and their CEO says that this is partially due to the Government's decision to cut food subsidies.  The health board will have to take up these additional costs.  This is the situation for 1984, so you can imagine what it will be like in 1985.  Units which have cost more than £7 million to build <Col N="253" /> are lying idle because the Department have refused to provide the money to open or staff them.  What kind of economic madness is this?  Will they do as they did in relation to Irish Shipping and send in liquidators to the health boards also?</P>
    <P>The maternity unit in Galway, so dear to the Minister's heart, which cost over £4 million to build remains unopened because funds have not been provided although I understand that there was an attempt to open it recently as a PR exercise even though it is neither equipped nor staffed.  The new 30 bed maternity unit at Cahercahill near Ennis, costing £750,000, lies idle because of lack of staff. A 14 bed gynaecology unit at St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny, built at a cost of £25,000 has been idle now for two years despite severe overcrowding at St. Luke's Hospital.</P>
    <P>A geriatric assessment unit was built in Ardkeen Hospital approximately six months ago which also lies idle because the Minister refused to staff it.  This was done in spite of the pious platitudes contained in <i>Building on Reality</i> which states that it is the Government's intention to make provision for the needs of the increasing number of elderly people.  We are told that there will be improvements in the many institutions which provide for geriatric patients.  They are lovely sentiments, but the reality is different.  This all comes from a Labour Minister for Health who is committed to catering for the sick, needy and the aged.  Money has been spent on providing paediatric facilities in the general hospital in the midlands but these cannot be opened because there is no money available to appoint consultants and other staff. Money has been earmarked to provide badly needed orthopaedic facilities in the midlands at the District Hospital, Athlone, but now the Minister says that the Midland Health Board will have to find the money within their allocation to fund these posts.  I have bad news for the Midland Health Board because when we were faced with a similar situation in the south-east we managed to fund additional <Col N="254" /> funds from within our allocation to provide for two casualty officers and a radiographer but we were then told by the Department of Health that, because we would have a deficit for 1984, these funds had to go to correcting this deficit.  Therefore, even if you manage to find the funds within your allocation, you still lose out.</P>
    <P>Wards have been closed during the year at a number of voluntary hospitals including the Meath, the Mater and the Adelaide.  Faced with a deficit of £1 million this year, the authorities at St. James's Hospital, Dublin, were forced to withdraw tinned fruit and ice cream from their patients.  How low can we get?</P>
    <P>In <i>Building on Reality</i> it states that in order to raise additional revenue it is proposed to raise the fees for private and semi-private accommodation by &mdash; I thought 15 per cent &mdash; but I discovered tonight that they propose to raise them by 20 per cent.  This means that many patients who at present opt for this accommodation through the VHI will now be priced out of that organisation and will have to revert to an already overstretched and overcrowded public hospital service.  They cannot cope with the demands on them at present and now the Minister is preposing to add to their problems.  I wonder if the Taoiseach and the Donnybrook set are aware of the implications of this decision.</P>

      <P>I have a letter from the sister in charge of St. Vincent's Private Nursing Home concerning the implications of the Minister's decision in relation to semi-private and private accommodation. She recognises the dangers in increasing the cost of this accommodation and has asked the Fianna Fáil Party to intercede and to prevent the recommendations from being implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the outlook for 1985, the financial allocations of last week suggest that the health services will gradually grind to a halt as they cannot possibly continue with a shortfall of at least £37 <Col N="255" /> million.  We have had our allocation since last Thursday&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It indicates a shortfall of £5.4 million in the south-east.  The North Eastern Health Board got their allocation yesterday.  There is now another proposal from the Department of Health that they will introduce discriminatory funding, with the bigger hospitals receiving more money than others.  This could lead to a huge gulf in Irish medicine with a small number of hospitals properly financed and well equipped while the remainder struggle with inadequate funding and outdated equipment.  I thought the Minister for Health would be present tonight and I was going to appeal to him and other Labour members, especially Deputy Seán Treacy, in view of his statement in November 1982, to reverse this decision. If the Labour Party have a conscience and hope to retain credibility they should support our motion.  They were set up in relation to food subsidies and they should not let that happen again with regard to the health of the sick and the needy, the people they claim to care for.  If they do, they will not be thanked by the electorate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister for Defence aware of the serious unrest in the Army resulting from the recent appointment of a non-recommended person to a clerical position at the Curragh Army Camp and will he inform Dáil Éireann, as a matter of urgency, of the circumstances surrounding this appointment? This is a very serious matter and I wish to thank the Chair for giving us the opportunity to discuss it and also the Minister for being present.  I wish to share <Col N="256" /> my time with Deputy Power, a former Minister for Defence.</P>
      <P>We wish to ascertain the facts relating to the appointment of a person to the position of clerical officer, Grade III, in the NCO section of the Army at the Curragh Army Barracks, County Kildare. There has been widespread dissatisfaction of late because of several civilian appointments which have been made in the Army.  This dissatisfaction has culminated in the proposed appointment of a Mr. Culla to this aforementioned Grade III clerical position.  Mr. Culla was an applicant for this position although not employed by the Army which leads to several questions which the Minister for Defence must answer clearly in this House tonight.  First, was this position advertised publicly?  If so, when, where and who was in charge of scrutinising the applicants?  Secondly, was this position advertised internally among the existing Army staff?  If so, was this the only advertising done, how was the post declared vacant to existing Army staff and when was this done?</P>
      <P>These are very important questions. There are about 2,000 civilian staff in our Army and in proportion to the size of the Army that is very high and would not compare favourably with the ratio of civilian staff in other armies throughout the world.  From this pool of experience and resources there must be an ample number of applicants with the necessary skills, expertise, ability and experience to fill this post adequately.  Moreover, Army work at this level is much different from the ordinary, run-of-the-mill clerical work that clerical officers do in private and public sector offices.  It would be much more varied than the normal Army duties which would be strictly military administration.  More important, due to the peculiar and particular work in Army duties like this there is the necessity to ensure that equality of opportunity with regard to promotion prevails for all staff who are available in such large numbers in the civilian section of our Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister seems to have totally gone outside the normal criteria in <Col N="257" /> making such appointments.  The interview board found the aforementioned person unsuitable for the post and did not recommend him.  Normally the Minister would appoint some person from the recommended suitable list but on this occasion the Minister chose to ignore this list.  He proceeded to appoint the aforementioned person to this prestigious position which carries a salary of approximately £10,000 per annum.  This is very sad because the person concerned is employed at present.  What about the young jobless people?  What about the 200,000 people out of work?  What about the hopes and aspirations of young people leaving school or those who have left school in the past two or three years and who are still unemployed?  What type of Government standards and Government leadership is this for those people who are in this hopeless situation?</P>
    <P>There is another reason why this Mr. Culla was recommended for appointment to the position.  It appears his father is a close friend of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes, the person in charge of our national finances.  This is what makes it all the more serious.  We recognise the right of the Minister for Defence to make certain decisions <i>vis-à-vis</i> Army administration but when we find another Minister conspiring to have one of his friends appointed to this very important position it brings into the public forum the whole question of the integrity of the Government. It shows the vice-like grip that Deputy Dukes has on the whole Cabinet operation.  Through him the Taoiseach is imposing penal measures on all our citizens and we have to suffer severe reductions with regard to our public services.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if normal criteria were applied in this situation. In other appointments that were made lists were furnished but some names were not on the lists and the lists were returned.  Other names were added and requests were made for more interviews. The people interviewed on the second occasion were not placed on the recommended list but yet they were <Col N="258" /> appointed.  We recognise that the Minister for Defence has a delicate and sensitive portfolio.  We recognise the contribution of our Army and the important contribution made by all staff in the Army.  We realise that it must be seen that the Army cannot be the victim of political interference.  It is vital that there be equality of opportunity.  There is considerable skill and expertise in all sectors of our Army.  We should like the Minister to clear up the situation.  He is the man charged with administering the Army. We do not want to see the democratic powers vested in him usurped in any way to ensure that political friends are appointed to prestigious posts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Chair for his indulgence in allowing us to raise this matter on the tenth hour of a very long day.  I hope that as far as the Minister for Defence is concerned he will realise the seriousness of the situation and relent even at this late stage.  Our concern is based on a story which appeared yesterday in <i>The Irish Press</i> and which was attributed to its security correspondent, Tom Brady.  It was picked up by the other papers and published by them today.  It is backed up by people close to the scene, trade union officials and Army officers. The Minister for Defence has a public relations team at his disposal and he comes from a Cabinet who lay great stress on public relations.  Therefore, one would have thought he would have defused the time bomb before now or have denied the allegation if he could.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Army are constantly reminded of the political manoeuvring of Coalition Governments.  This is probably the worst and the most blatant case of jobbery since the infamous Army officers promotions in the days of the former Minister, Mr. Donegan.  There is a similarity here.  Both Mr. Donegan and the present Minister are decent people but they are not able to stand up to the pressures from within the Cabinet.  Mr. Donegan did the bidding of his Taoiseach with regard to Army promotions and now it appears that this Minister has succumbed to the overtures of the Minister for Finance.  It is that <Col N="259" /> Minister who must take most of the blame for this appointment.  The dénouement of this dirty deed will see the real Coalition image of this discredited Cabinet. They portrayed a whiter than white image in the first flush of publicity but that was followed by a sorry and sordid saga of political partonage, jobbery and mean, petty acts.  I am not surprised. People in Kildare who have a knowledge of Kildare Post Office remember the interference of Deputy Dukes in a job that was filled there some years ago.</P>
    <P>It appears that the man earmarked for this post is the son of a leading Fine Gael man in Kildare town.  I believe he already had a job but was advised to apply for this clerical post in the Curragh.  The post is of a distinctly technical nature.  The Minister had a panel to interview applicants and short-list those who were suitable. I am told that one of the people short-listed had 15 years experience and was eminently suitable but the Minister did not consider the suitable applicants for the post.</P>
    <P>Despite the recommendation of the interviewers, the Minister did not consider those people because they lacked one vital ingredient, Fine Gael allegiance. They also lacked the <i>imprimatur</i> of the Minister for Finance.  Despite the fact that this political friend was classified as unsuitable, it is proposed now to appoint him to the post and he will be expecting some of those who were passed over to train him for the four months or so before he is fit to fill this post.  If this was related to horses the steward of the Turf Club would be very likely to call in to the Minister to ask him to explain why he was using the Curragh as a schooling ground for this entrant before he was fit to race.  Many posts in the Curragh which remain to be filled are not filled because of the ban on recruitment in the public service.  It would be hard to make any reasonable case for the applicant in this instance being appointed and also for the passing over of the other highly qualified satisfactory applicants.</P>
    <P>I am sure there are vacancies in Athlone too, and the Minister realises <Col N="260" /> that in a garrison town you are dealing with a very sensitive matter when you deal with defence.  It is a pity that he has not ruled to defuse this situation before now.  This is the nub of the problem.  A person who was deemed unsatisfactory by the interview board is now to be appointed.  This is just not done.  The Minister may quote some rule to me that enables him to take this action.  A judge at a race meeting because of fog or something else might decide that the fourth horse had finished in front, he might stick to his guns and the bookmakers might have to pay out, but that would not mean that he was right.  This should not be done and I can say safely that it was not done in my time as Minister.  It should not be tolerated.  This blatant jobbery is first of all a slight on the interview board.  Why do you set them up at all if you are not going to use their advice?  It is a slur on the Army and a blow to the morale of the Defence Forces and to their civilian employees.</P>
    <P>When the Minister goes to the next commissioning ceremony in the Curragh and sees the young cadets there take the oath to be loyal to their country and avoid political allegiance, how can he face them if he is responsible for this act?  I know that two brothers of the political appointee are already officers in the Army.  I can understand why it is necessary to transfer one of them recently from a posting that he had.  I know that these fine young men were selected and promoted on merit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sure that every officer in the Defence Forces would feel that he was promoted on merit, although some of them might wonder if they look back after a while.  Anyhow, because of the Minister's action, for evermore the names of Cooney and Culla will be interlinked and will blight the future of that man's family as well as the Minister's future.  How do we know how future vacancies might be filled or what format <Col N="261" /> might be used in Army barracks throughout the country?  As this happened in November, is it now quite possible that if an applicant arrived wearing a poppy in his lapel this might enhance his chance of being selected by a certain interview board or being appointed even if he was not selected?</P>
      <P>I am sorry that this example of political patronage had to be raised here tonight. It cannot be too late yet to block the appointment.  I advise the Minister not to go ahead with the horse trading.  No matter what the Minister for Finance offered him in return for this, it is simply not worth it.  The Taoiseach promised the country clean, open government, and most people were naive enough to accept that.  Unless he blocks this appointment he, along with his discredited Ministers, will be seen for the shoddy sham that they are.  It has been said that the evil that men do lives after them, and I forecast that if the Minister goes ahead with this rash act the names Cooney, Culla and the Curragh will long be remembered, and not for the right reasons.</P>

      <P>What I have read about this matter so far and what I have heard here this evening point up the truth of the old adage that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.  The truth of that is compounded in this situation when the little knowledge is motivated by cant and hypocrisy.  The Private Notice Question asks if I am aware of the serious unrest within the Army.  That, of course, is a most serious thing to put down in a parliamentary question.  It is the height of nonsense and irresponsibility for an Opposition spokesman on Defence and a past Minister for Defence to use such a phrase concerning this matter when it has absolutely no foundation. &ldquo;Resulting from the recent appointment of a non-recommended person&rdquo; is totally false.  Deputy Power stated that his information is based on newspaper reports and he went on to say &ldquo;and from people close to the scene&rdquo;.  I would have expected that if Deputy Power or Deputy Tracy were interested in the welfare of the Army and were concerned about the <Col N="262" /> status of the Army and that the Army would not be demeaned by their demeanour here this evening&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is untrue to say that the candidate who has been appointed was cast as unsuitable or was rejected by the interview board.  He was found suitable and was recommended to me and on that basis he has been appointed, and I make no apology for the appointment.  That information would have been made available to Deputy Treacy and Deputy Power if they had thought fit to ask me for it, but that would not have suited them.</P>

      <P>I will give an extract from the report of the chairman of the board on this man: &ldquo;During the 30 minute interview he acquitted himself in an excellent manner and I found him to be very much above average&rdquo;.  That is an exact quote from the report to me from the chairman of that board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="263" /> Again I remind the two Deputies opposite that the appointing authority in this matter is the Minister for Defence, a political person.  That has been the situation for decades past with regard to these appointments.  For newspapers to suggest that because I made this appointment there is political interference is totally at odds with the legal position.  The appointing authority is the Minister for Defence of the day.  When Deputy Power was in this position he made numerous appointments of this type.  The status of an interview board is to assist the Minister in making the appointment in finding for the Minister people who are suitable to be appointed.  The person I am appointing in this case came up to me from a lawfully constituted board as being suitable and qualified and was recommended to me as a person fit for this appointment.</P>
    <P>I want to give some facts and figures that might be interesting to Deputy Power.  In the past Deputy Power has had the advantage and benefit of interview boards.  Not merely did those boards form a suitable panel from which Deputy Power could make a selection, as is the case we are debating this evening, but those interview boards place the candidates in order of merit.  However, on four occasions Deputy Power chose to ignore the order of merit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not talking about a very weighty position, nevertheless it is of sufficient moment to Members of the Opposition to drag the Army and the Army's reputation into this House in a most discreditable fashion.  On 1 June 1982 Deputy Power appointed a storeman. He chose the person who was placed No. 6 in the order of merit.  On 30 September 1982 he appointed another storeman and he picked the person placed No. 3 in the order of merit.  He was getting the bit between his teeth now, <Col N="264" /> and we come to 19 October 1982 when he had to appoint a clerk of works.  His conscience might have been getting at him a bit because he appointed the person who was No.2 on the order of merit. Again, with the bit between his teeth, on the following day, 20 October 1982, he appointed another storeman who was not No. 1 on the order of merit but No. 2. For Deputy Power to come in here and lecture me about standards in view of his record is an incredible cheek and an incredible impertinence.</P>
      <P>That adds point to what I am saying, that the whole object of this exercise was not concern for the Army, not concern with the quality of the applicant, the merits of the application or of the post or to do the right thing for the Army but to try to score a silly, cheap political point. The Deputies were prepared to come to the House and talk about serious unrest in the Army, about a non-recommended person on the basis of rumours that appeared in the newspapers and of &ldquo;who told you&rdquo; and &ldquo;somebody told me&rdquo;.  There were half rumours picked up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in the gossip corridors of the Curragh.  I advise Deputy Treacy, the recently appointed spokesman on Defence, to take a lesson from tonight's episode and before he comes in with anything like this again to sort out his ground and not to jump in feet first with his eyes closed.  If he continues to do that he will continue to land into a political mess. Deputy Treacy asked how the post was advertised.  It was advertised in the normal fashion for posts of this nature, which has prevailed for decades past. Invitations to serving personnel to apply were issued and, in addition, National Manpower Service were informed of the vacancy and asked if they had any persons interested and suitable to send them forward for interview.  That was the way the post was filled and it was in accordance with normal procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Treacy has gone on record as <Col N="265" /> referring to this as a £10,000 per year post.  He disregarded the facts.  One has to be accurate when one comes to the House with facts.  This post carries a commencing salary of £133 per week moving after eight yearly increments to £184 per week.  That is just a point of correction for Deputy Treacy.  If he was concerned about this matter and not just concerned with making crude political points he could have approached me and I would have given him all the facts gladly.  This matter could have been defused and the unfortunate misrepresentation that has appeared in the newspapers could have been avoided and, I have to say, this unseemly debate would not have had to take place.  I make no apologies for what has been done because it has been strictly in accordance with set procedures.</P>

      <P>I should like to make some comments on what appeared in the newspapers.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> of 19 November alleged that the candidate concerned was rejected by an interview board.  That is not so and it is wrong.  Again, that could have been checked out in advance.  <i>The Irish Press</i> of 19 November spoke about a major row over alleged political interference but I have already made it clear that the person who appoints people to these positions is the Minister of the day, a political person.  There was no political interference in the sense implied in that article.</P>

I regret that the Army has been dragged into this in a political fashion.  I must emphasise to Deputy Treacy &mdash; I should not have to do it to Deputy Power but he appears to be confused about the matter &mdash; that what is concerned here is the appointment of a civilian operative, it is not an Army appointment.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): It is not true that Mr. Fajujonu and his wife are to be deported from this country on 20 November.  The actual position is that Mr. Fajujonu was informed by letter dated 15 October 1984 that his application for permission to stay in this country was being refused, that he should make arrangements for his departure as soon as possible and that he was being allowed to stay until 20 November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the decision in that regard was properly arrived at, having regard to the provisions of the Aliens Act, 1935, and the regulations made under that Act.  The reasons for refusing <Col N="42" /> Mr. Fajujonu permission to stay were:&mdash;(i) he was not in a position to support himself and his family without assistance from the State; (ii) he had attempted to enter the United Kingdom from the State at a time when he was debarred from the UK; and (iii) he had been in possession of a forged Irish birth certificate when attempting to enter the UK.</P>
    <P>Mr. Fajujonu's presence in this country only came to the notice of my Department earlier this year.  It is difficult to accept that his failure to comply with the immigration laws was due to ignorance of the law as he had had quite an amount of dealings with the immigration authorities in the UK.  He was refused permission to stay there any longer and he had appealed against that decision.  His appeal was refused.</P>
    <P>The fact that an alien &mdash; otherwise considered unsuitable &mdash; is the parent of a child born here is not regarded as sufficient grounds to allow the parent stay here.  Mr. Fajujonu's permission to stay in the country expires today.  If he does not comply with the request to leave, consideration will have to be given to what further action should be taken.</P>

      <P>The embargo whereby only one vacancy in every three in the Civil Service may be filled came into operation on 23 December 1981 and has resulted in substantial economies in numbers employed. In the vast majority of Departments/ offices overtime expenditure in the last full year since then, viz 1983, has been contained at 1981 outturn levels or reduced.  When account is taken of such factors as increases in pay rates and incremental progression there was, in fact, a significant decrease in the volume of overtime during the period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 612 and 613 together.  The <i>Citadalete</i> was a French fishing trawler which sank off Tuskar Rock on 12 January 1983 with the loss of its crew of ten.  The French authorities carried out an investigation of the incident and found that the casualty was caused by the vessel becoming entangled in old abandoned fishing gear on the sea bed.  The possible involvement of a submarine in the incident was rejected by the French authorities.</P>
      <P>To date only one of the reported incidents involving fishing vessels in the Irish Sea has been proven to have been caused by a submarine.  In that instance &mdash; the loss of the <i>Sharelga</i> in April 1982 &mdash; my predecessor ordered a preliminary inquiry under section 465 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894.  Before that inquiry was completed the United Kingdom admitted that one of its submarines had been responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government take a very serious view of the dangers posed by submerged <Col N="56" /> submarines to other sea craft.  My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and his officials have voiced the concern of the government to the representatives of the Governments of the USA, the USSR and to our EC partners.</P>
    <P>I have recently conveyed to the Secretary General of the International Maritime Organisation &mdash; the United Nations agency with general responsibility for maritime safety &mdash; my serious concern about the growth of incidents involving fishing vessels and submerged submarines and have requested that this problem be examined as a matter of urgency with a view to promoting appropriate action to eliminate the dangers to other seagoing craft arising from the peacetime operations of submarines.  The Department of Foreign Affairs has approached certain other Governments for their support in having this problem thoroughly investigated within the International Maritime Organisation.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may not be aware that last year I made 21 Statutory Instruments to give effect to the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention, 1974, and the 1978 Protocol thereto, including the following:</P>

    <P>Taken together with the Merchant Shipping (Life-Saving Appliances) Rules, 1967, and the Merchant Shipping (Fire Appliances) Rules, 1967, these Statutory Instruments cover in a comprehensive manner the equipping of cargo, passenger and fishing vessels with life saving and other safety appliances.  Pleasure craft over 45 feet in length are also comprehended by the rules.</P>
    <P>Vessels carrying fewer than 12 persons for hire or reward are the responsibility of the relevant local authority under the Public Health (Amendment) Act, 1907.

      <P>The Central Development Committee, which operates under the aegis of the Department of Finance, has overall responsibility for the affairs of inhabited non-Gaeltacht Islands.  This committee has been asked to consider whether expenditure on improving landing facilities at Innisturk would be justified.  The Office of Public Works has estimated that harbour works at Innisturk would cost up to £275,000 and it is quite clear that the level of fishing alone would not justify expenditure at this level.  However, the case of Innisturk must be considered in the light of the overall needs of the islanders and the Central Development Committee is at present consulting all the relevant Departments and official agencies. It must also be considered in the light of transport policy in general and the availability of public funds.  It seems unlikely, given the present state of the <Col N="59" /> public finances, that funds will be available for work at Innisturk in the immediate future.</P>

      <P>In assessing means of an applicant for unemployment assistance purposes the weekly value of capital is calculated by taking 5 per cent of the first £400 and if he has capital in excess of £400 by taking 10 per cent of the balance. The sum so calculated is divided by 52 and the amount arrived at is deemed to be the weekly value of the capital.</P>

The net weekly value of his capital was accordingly calculated at £16.25 weekly. He is accordingly being paid unemployment assistance at £25 weekly being the rate appropriate to him £41.25 less £16.25 means.

      <P>All disability benefit payable to 13 November 1984, the date of the latest medical certificate received, has been issued to the husband in respect of his claim.  Payment is normally made on receipt of medical evidence of incapacity in the Department.  However, the RSI number on a medical certificate dated 5 November 1984 was illegible and there was, therefore, a delay in issuing payment for the period 31 October 1984 to 6 November 1984.  Payment for this period was issued on 12 November 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wife has been in receipt of disability benefit since 21 June 1982, and payment is issued on receipt of medical certificates in the Department.

      <P>They appealed to the Circuit Court and the appeal was heard on 14 January 1981. The Circuit Court affirmed the order of the District Court but it imposed a sentence of three months imprisonment on both defendants in lieu of the fine.  They were taken into custody in the Bridewell Garda Station on that date.  They were released on 15 January 1981 to attend the High Court on an application for <i>habeas corpus</i>.  This application was refused and both defendants were committed to Mountjoy prison later on the same day. They then sought and obtained a Conditional Order of <i>certiorari</i> from the High Court and were released on bail pending the outcome of this application.  On 1 June 1983 the High Court discharged the Conditional Order of <i>certiorari</i> and ordered that the District Court issue warrants for the enforcement of the sentence which had been imposed by the Circuit Court.  A stay of 21 days was allowed for the service of a notice of appeal.</P>
      <P>The defendants gave notice of their intention to appeal the order of the High Court to the Supreme Court.  However the appeal was struck out on 10 July 1984 for want of prosecution.</P>

    <P>I cannot give specific information on measures being taken by the Garda in relation to drug pushing in the area mentioned because the publication of information of this kind could prejudice the success of Garda operations.

      <P>
      </P>
      <P>(a)  Various conditions which give rise to learning difficulties may be diagnosed by the schools' medical service during the routine examination of pupils in primary schools.  In addition teachers are urged to note particular difficulties pupils may have and to bring these difficulties to the attention of parents.  Advice on these matters is provided for teachers during pre-service and in-service training.</P>
      <P>(b)  There are some 800 full time remedial teachers in primary schools who are concerned with the prevention and remediation of learning disabilities, including serious reading disability.  Approximately 200 full time remedial teachers are employed in post primary schools and a further 200 teachers are engaged part time in remedial education in these schools.  In addition to these services a number of child guidance clinics run by hospitals and voluntary bodies provide services in remedial education, which are grant-aided by my Department, for children with complex reading and other learning problems for whom multi-disciplinary intervention is necessary.  In order to meet the needs of the relatively small number of children whose specific reading disabilities cannot adequately be catered for by the services already mentioned, three special schools have been established, two in Dublin and one in Cork.  It is my intention, as stated in the Programme for Action in Education to strengthen the remedial services in schools by the assignment of extra teaching posts for this work as resources permit, to review in consultation with the principals of the schools the organisation and application of the remedial services within them and to strengthen the teacher's capacity to identify and cope with learning disability through measures taken in the pre-service and in-service training of teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  I am advised that the term &ldquo;dyslexia&rdquo; is used very loosely in the description of reading difficulty whatever its <Col N="107" /> origin and that a specific disability such as dyslexia, is not the most common cause for reading failure.  Accordingly it is difficult to have an accurate estimate of the incidence of such a specific learning disability and I am not therefore in a position to comment on the existence or otherwise of correlation of the type to which the Deputy refers.</P>
