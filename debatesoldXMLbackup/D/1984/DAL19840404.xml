      <P>Yesterday I endeavoured to raise the outcome of the recent Agricultural Council meeting of the European Communities when a regime of prices, arrangements for a milk super-levy and many other matters of far-reaching importance to Irish farmers were decided.  Can the Tánaiste indicate if the Minister for Agriculture will make a statement to the House on the outcome of that Council meeting?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy's first question, the Government are most anxious that the Dáil would have a discussion on the outcome of the negotiations. That will be arranged between the Whips.  We can arrange to have any document circulated to all Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be reasonable.  The Deputy is now asking if the Minister for Foreign Affairs or some other Minister will make a statement on something that happened in Northern Ireland.  That is quite different from Deputy Haughey's request.  Deputy Haughey asked for a statement on negotiations in Brussels.  If I were to allow Deputy Collins to put his question and if I allowed it to be answered I would have the House engaged in a mini-debate on some very controversial things in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Chair will forgive me for commenting that the Taoiseach would be better employed being here for the Order of Business this morning particularly in view of the wage <i>diktat</i> launched by the Government on Monday &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Will the Deputy relate his remarks to the Finance Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Some years ago a comparable situation made the then Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, hasten home from France.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I was speaking about the 2 per cent levy, employment generally and the absence of any incentives or a job creation programme in this Bill or in the budget.  I said the majority of people would be prepared to pay an employment levy if they saw that money being used specifically for job creation, especially for young people.  Many questions are asked about how this money is being spent, how many new real jobs have been created and how many training places have been created.  In reality the number is very small when compared with the amount of publicity involved in getting this levy and the Youth Employment Agency launched.</P>
      <P>I dwelt on taxation at length and the insignificant effect this Bill will have on the take-home pay of the ordinary PAYE worker.  I also said there was nothing in this Bill to generate an increase in activity. An essential part of this Bill is the tax code and the 2 per cent levy, which is being continued for another year, as they relate to employment.  The day has gone when we can isolate taxation and its impact on take-home pay, job creation, training and education.  In other words, it is the complete package that counts because gross income is the workers' net take-home pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Monday's announcement was a <Col N="1145" /><i>diktat</i> to the workers telling them how the Government saw the gross pay guidelines over the next 18 months.  That was a very unwise decision because everybody believes, acknowledges and accepts the need for wage restraint.  Today's trade union member is as concerned about tax, jobs, education and training as he is about pay because members of his family or his neighbour's may be unemployed or seeking jobs for the first time.  I do not understand the attitude of the Labour members in this Government because the Government seem to be seeking confrontation with the trade union movement. No pressure was being exerted within the trade unions for high wage increases&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have to relate his remarks to taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already qualified what I started to say and I am within my rights because a worker's gross pay is the same as his take-home pay.  No longer can any Government divorce pay from tax, tax from employment, education or training or any other combination. Those elements are fundamentally related and there is only one way we can make progress and that is through consultation and negotiation with the trade union movement and the employer organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trade union member is concerned about pay, tax, the 2 per cent levy and other issues.  He is aware of the necessity for wage restraint and low wage increases but I object to the method employed by this Government which is composed of a number of Labour Ministers who lectured us on our much milder approach when we sought a three month deferment of a 5 per cent third phase payment for the public service.  The then Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, hastened home from his holiday in France to restore what he described as industrial chaos and said at Dublin Airport that he was prepared to bring down the Government on this issue, but when this announcement was made on Monday, he hastened to Rome <Col N="1146" /> to launch a Christian Democrats campaign.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair heard the Deputy's submission regarding the relationship between pay, taxation and employment and he is prepared to allow a passing reference to pay on the basis that the debate is on taxation and that references to extraneous matters can be only passing references.  I cannot and will not allow the debate to be turned on its head into a detailed debate on the nuts, bolts and machinery of fixing pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The people who elected me and you would find it very hard to understand how you could divorce pay from taxation.  They would think you were irrelevant, not me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to stay within the order.  An immense amount of time was put into the drafting of this Bill but the changes are insignificant and give very limited relief, especially to the PAYE worker.  The Government must consult and have discussions with regard to taxation, pay, employment, job creation, education and training.  These matters cannot be divorced from each other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The events of Monday have encouraged militancy where it did not exist and it appears that the Government are seeking confrontation.  Everybody recognises the need for restraint but they should not be dictated to as to how that restraint is to be achieved.  I would prefer encouragement and incentive through the tax system so that people could more readily accept the need for overall restraint.  The Government have made a major mistake but the Minister for Finance seemed on television last night to be watering down what was said on Monday.  Perhaps this is because he realises a mistake has been made or it may be due to pressure from the Labour Ministers.  I understand there is a Labour Party meeting this morning and I would like to be a fly on the wall in <Col N="1147" /> order to hear what the backbenchers are saying to their Ministers who were party to that <i>diktat.</i></P>
    <P>The Finance Bill and the budget have a part to play in determining what the rate of inflation will be.  The figure for the quarter ending in mid-February was 2.4 per cent.  In the document issued on Monday the Government called it 2.5 per cent and they made a vague statement, for which there are no grounds, that the rate of inflation going into 1985 would be 5 per cent.  It is difficult to understand how that has been calculated because the best figures available from the ESRI and the Central Bank show a rate of approximately 7.5 per cent at November.  It is a mystery how anyone can convert the existing rate of 2.5 per cent and the projected rate of 7.5 per cent in November into 5 per cent as we go into 1985.  I do not understand that kind of arithmetic.  It is not the arithmetic of the Minister for Finance or his Department.  It is probably the arithmetic of the handlers of this Government who would be more concerned with the image of the Government than the level of inflation.</P>
    <P>What is the present position regarding income from the 2 per cent levy and what has been contributed by the various sectors, the PAYE workers, the farming community, the self-employed and so on?  I should appreciate that information from the Minister when replying.</P>
    <P>I now refer to the danger of the Government following the line adopted in the United Kingdom and the United States of using the weapon of unemployment to depress wages.  There appears to be a risk of that happening.  The alternative is consultation with the various groups concerned as to the best way ahead combining taxation, pay, job creation, employment and education and training.  It could be very dangerous to use the employment weapon to depress wages and I suspect this Government would like to do it.  I suspect that was the thinking behind Monday's announcement but I hope the Minister for Finance was indicating a U-turn last night and adopting a more common-sense approach.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Finance Bill has not given much joy and has not dealt with the areas where incentives should be given.  I appreciate the need for revenue but we want to see a balance.  The greater the level of indirect taxation the more quickly one sees a down-turn in the business affected.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy spelled out in detail the drop in revenue target figures, and the further extension of VAT on many products can only have a depressing effect and further reduce the level of activity.  This militates against employment and job creation.  This Government have been contributing in this way to fewer jobs being saved and created. There is an urgent need for the Minister for Finance to review the line he is taking. He must review job incentives with the State boards, even within the terms of the Finance Bill.  We must create a better climate and assist risk taking in the interests of job creation.  It is easy to extend the 2 per cent levy and collect a certain income but there is no new thinking there.  I would ask the Minister to spell out what has been achieved by way of numbers on the ground.  I suggest that those numbers will be very small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware of the many factory closures.  I want to give an instance which was extremely important to a small group of people.  A factory closed.  A few people were prepared to try to maintain some of the jobs.  That small enterprise are endeavouring to get assistance from the various State agencies.  The ESB demanded payment of £6,000 in a lump sum.  There are between 12 to 20 jobs involved.  That kind of cash problem can mean the success or failure of the venture. The maintenance of those jobs should be encouraged.  I approached the Tánaiste and asked him to intervene with the ESB to get phased payments.  They did not want free electricity.

    <P>I wish the Youth Employment Agency every success.  I supported them when I was Minister despite the fact that I had serious and grave reservations about the amount of thought which had been given to the agency.  At that stage the levy was 1 per cent and I was criticised because the money was not given in total to the Youth Employment Agency for disbursement among the other agencies such as AnCO, CERT, and so on.</P>

I understood that the Minister was in favour of reform of the Dáil.  It is tightening the reins a bit too much if one cannot make a passing reference to the spending of the 2 per cent income levy which is included in this Bill. This levy is collected from every PAYE taxpayer.  There is no objection to an employment levy if it is used for the proper purposes.  It is most unfair, a Cheann Comhairle, for you to say I cannot question how this levy is being spent. I am entitled to do that.</P>

      <P>I can read the section for you if you wish.  It is one of <Col N="1150" /> the earlier sections in the Bill.  It continues the 2 per cent levy for another year. Surely I am entitled to say I do not believe it has been a stimulant to employment or used in the interests of our youth to the extent to which it should have been used. Surely it is valid to make that criticism on the Finance Bill and to tell the Minister he is going in the wrong direction.</P>
      <P>More imagination is needed from the Minister and the Government to create the climate necessary to encourage enterprise. I cited a case which is fresh in my mind.  I could cite many others and I am sure other Members of the House could cite many too.  To have a section in the Bill continuing the 2 per cent levy for another year is not enough.  It is not a contribution to employment.  It is not the kind of contribution which is appreciated by the people at present.</P>
      <P>We will have a long, tough Committee Stage on this Bill.  We will put down many amendments to try to get the message across that the biggest single problem of our time is unemployment which is rising at an alarming rate.  We will have at least 20,000 young people coming on the books in two months' time.  We must never forget that.  While I am in this House I will not allow the Government to forget the fact that that is their biggest problem.  They made promises which they broke and which can be laughed at with hindsight.  The Government are paying lip service to the problem by suggesting that a <i>diktat</i> on pay will create more jobs.  It could have the reverse effect.  A proper package properly negotiated is the way forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to say that Deputy Fitzgerald's criticism of the Minister for Agriculture was not fair.  I will leave it at that.  We are all very conscious of the unemployment problem.  Deputy Fitzgerald dealt with it at length.  The Minister's budget was described as neutral by many economic commentators.  I believe the provisions in the Finance Bill are ideal for the situation in which we find ourselves.  Recent indications show that there will be an upswing in the world economy as a result of the improvement in the United States economy.  Therefore we must be in a position to take advantage of that upswing.  The recent announcement in the United States that the United States budget deficit for 1985 will be in the region of $180 billion compared with $184 billion dollars this year indicates that there will be little or no change in American policy this year in what is a presidential election year.  After the American presidential election there is a danger that the United States will take measures to cut back on their budget deficit which could have serious consequences for this country.  The fact that the most recent budget provisions and those of the Finance Bill now being debated are described as neutral constitutes no condemnation at all.  Rather they should be looked upon as constituting an advantage for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present we do not know how long the worldwide economic recovery will continue or what will be its ultimate <Col N="1152" /> impact on this country.  Therefore, we must take care of the less well-off in our society until such time as that uncertainty evaporates.  The budgetary provisions and those of the Finance Bill have taken care of the less well-off by giving the poorer sections increases that would maintain their standard of living in line with inflation.  In the last few days we were told that inflation should be in the region of 5 per cent by the end of this year.  Therefore, it will be seen that the increase provided will at least be in line with that inflation rate.  Those increases may not be as great as some people would have wished but they show recognition of the plight of the unemployed.</P>
    <P>In the last few weeks there have been many irresponsible statements made, no greater example of which was a recent interview given in <i>Business and Finance</i> along with calls from the Leader of the Opposition and some of his party's spokespersons for greater increases in all areas at practically every level while at the same time calling for a reduction in taxation rates and an improvement in all types of services.  I do not think the electorate will be conned by any attempt on the part of anybody to be all things to all people.  We cannot hope for a drop in taxation along with an increase in services; that is just not on.  People may be unhappy with the performance of the present Government in some respects. That is natural when unpopular and difficult decisions have to be taken but they are even more dissatisfied with recent irresponsible statements by members of the Opposition.  I might deal with some of these comments on the budgetary provisions and those of the Finance Bill now before us.  In an article called &ldquo;The Alternative Budget&rdquo; the Leader of the Opposition stated that there was need for a reduction in the levels of indirect taxation because ours are the highest in Europe. He said our personal taxation rates have become much too high while total tax this year will increase by £663 million and income tax will rise by 20 per cent in 1984.  In that interview he is also on record as saying that the current budget deficit should definitely have been kept below £1,000 million.  At the same time <Col N="1153" /> he said there was no way in which the size of the public sector could be tackled. Therefore, he implied that we drop taxation rates while maintaining the present level of public sector spending.  In the same interview he said that the increase of 7 per cent in social welfare payments was inadequate, that he was in favour of their being increased even more, that he would reduce the upper level of taxation to 60 per cent, would take small farmers out of the tax net to save administrative costs, would abolish the residential property tax and at the same time would plough between £100 million and £200 million extra into the construction industry. I am not contending that such injection into the construction industry is not required but one must ask where would the money come from.  The question must be posed: how could the Fianna Fáil four-year plan of investment in agriculture be implemented?  How could they arrange financial packages which would bring the Scarriff and Clondalkin Paper Mills into full production, how would the gas pipe lines be extended into Waterford and Limerick at the same time decentralising Government Departments and effecting a drop in taxation.  That is impossible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gene Fitzgerald calls it defeatism; I call it unrealism. Looking at the provisions of the Minister for Finance and the pie-in-the-sky proposals of the Opposition Leader it is clear that the public is left with no choice.</P>
      <P>Our main preoccupation must be unemployment.  We all agree that there is now an unemployment crisis.  There are at present in excess of 215,000 unemployed. Deputy Gene Fitzgerald will agree that our constituency, north and south, is one of the worst affected.  I do not need to set out in detail the social consequences of unemployment &mdash; they have been well aired in this House on previous occasions &mdash; except to say that people today are feeling its effects in many different ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My contribution on this Bill will not be <Col N="1154" /> negative.  I feel strongly that anybody debating the provisions of this Bill must take a positive line.  For example, we must talk about how employment can be created.  The major problem confronting the programme for job creation is that of very high interest rates strangling recovery from the recession and discouraging capital investment so urgently needed. Opposition spokesperson's criticism of the Government's performance in relation to unemployment has ignored the fact that the Government have been hampered in their approach to unemployment by the need to bring Government spending into line with revenue which, in turn, has meant that labour-intensive projects have been unable to commence. If the Government do embark on major capital-intensive projects in the next year I hope these will have a high labour content.</P>
    <P>As I have said already the construction industry has been badly hit.  Deputy Gene Fitzgerald and I are aware of the submissions made to us in the Cork region by the local branch of the Construction Industry Federation.  It must be remembered that this industry provides vital employment for tradespeople, apprentices and unskilled workers.  Another factor to be remembered is that 95 per cent of all household construction materials are Irish which generates more employment in manufacturing concrete products, electrical wiring, fitted kitchens and so on.  In the last two-and-a-half years we have seen a net loss of approximately 30,000 jobs in that industry and, but for the record number of jobs created by State agencies, the net figures would be even worse.</P>
    <P>The industrial sector has faced reduced consumer demand at home and abroad. Its problems have been aggravated by a wide range of revenue-raising measures on the part of successive Governments who have put many industries in the position of being no longer competitive. Along with the growth in public sector employment this phenomenon has forced the Government to raise more and more revenue.  Therefore it is ironic to observe the proposals of the Leader of the Opposition that we maintain a high level of <Col N="1155" /> public sector employment.  I cannot understand the reasoning behind the recent report published advocating an even greater increase in public sector employment.  In so doing one would be ignoring the taxes that must be imposed on the private sector because of the need to pay the cost of a lot of non-productive public sector jobs.</P>
    <P>We have the fastest growing labour force in Europe.  It grows at a rate of 3 per cent per annum.  In order to accommodate that, the economy will have to grow at about 7 per cent.  That presents a formidable challenge since the projection for the coming year is for a growth rate of 2 to 3 per cent.  If we are to resolve the problem of unemployment inflation must be brought down to the European average and the current budget deficit must be further reduced.  If these proposals are implemented industry will have a chance to recover.</P>
    <P>High inflation rates affect our exports. It is only through increased exports that we can start to cut our external deficit and reduce our foreign debt which is in the region of £6 billion.  The effect of inflation on exports to Britain can be seen from the figures which were recently released.  In four years the following was the trend of exports to Britain: Irish exports were up by 30 per cent, German exports were up by 60 per cent, Belgium exports were up by 66 per cent and Dutch exports were up by 70 per cent.  Those are the major problems which must be faced up as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>The Opposition party's economic policy from 1977 onwards was to expand the public service by increasing the numbers of gardaí, nurses, teachers and civil servants. This policy was unproductive and a drain on the State.  State involvement cannot be ruled out because it must be involved in production especially in fishing and food processing and in the provision of infrastructural needs such as roads and telecommunications.  This would create thousands of productive jobs in the public sector.  We must encourage private enterprise to provide jobs and facilitate employers by means of tax reliefs, grants, subsidies and interest <Col N="1156" /> premiums to encourage them to expand and employ more people.  The IDA must place an increased emphasis on Irish-owned exporting companies.  I am glad to see they have started to do this by setting up the small industries division in the IDA and national enterprise centres in Cork and Dublin.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that I have got away with so much in relation to employment. I am devoting some time to it in this debate because it is the major challenge facing any Government in bringing forward a budget or a Finance Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with Deputy Fitzgerald's comments in relation to wage restraint and the plea for moderation in wage claims.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>An important factor for our economy is the necessity for moderate wage claims if we are to bring down the rate of inflation and make our goods competitive abroad.  Any increase in wages and salaries must be allied to increased productivity.  Figures are available to prove that 4,000 jobs were lost because of the decline in our competitiveness in the last three years.  A recent EEC publication shows that Ireland and Greece have lost out as regards competitiveness in recent times.  The competitiveness of our products is determined by a variety of factors &mdash; the high rate of inflation, stagnant output and lack of growth in some of our key industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with the budget and the Finance Bill the Minister had to take into consideration the fact that the public sector had increased by almost 100,000 in the last decade while the total labour force has increased by only 4 per cent. The cost of public sector pay is about 20 per cent of our national output.  The combination of public sector pay and repayments of Government borrowings abroad <Col N="1157" /> absorbs over three-quarters of our tax revenue.  A Finance Bill must be accompanied by a detailed analysis of public expenditure to ensure that taxpayers get value for money.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Public Expenditure I have seen evidence of the need for greater cost analysis of public projects. The cost of servicing the State is placing an intolerable burden on industry and on taxpayers.  The public sector pay bill comprises 50 per cent of current Government spending.</P>
    <P>The major consideration for the economy this year remains the need for further progress in moderate wage claims, bringing down the rate of inflation and, most importantly, a rise in productivity. Employment and not the protection of living standards for those at work should be the national priority for a number of years.</P>
    <P>Despite what Opposition spokesmen have said, the 8 per cent VAT on clothing will help the Irish clothing industry. Many people I have spoken to in the industry welcomed the measure.  The Opposition ignored the fact that 70 per cent of clothing is imported and that anyone bringing in a shipment will now have to pay VAT at the point of entry.  There are certain benefits in buying Irish made clothes in that suppliers will not have to pay VAT immediately.  This, when cash flow is so important in business, is no minor advantage.  Up to now manufacturers had to pay VAT on imported raw materials whereas imported finished products were VAT free.  Home produced goods were at a big disadvantage price-wise.</P>
    <P>As regards the tourist industry and the provisions in the Finance Bill in relation to it, I was given some figures by a person in that industry which show that we have 700 hotels which employ 23,000 people all year round as well as 3,000 seasonal workers.  The total turnover on rooms, food and drink was £255.233 million.  This is a labour intensive industry with a huge turnover.  Any measures which will help this industry are more than welcome especially in my area, the Cork-Kerry region, which is underdeveloped as regards tourism and needs every possible <Col N="1158" /> encouragement.  We must also encourage home holidays.  I am glad to see that there was an increase in the value of these from £45 million in 1972 to £260 million in 1983.</P>
    <P>A survey shows that 73 per cent of Irish people consider the tourist industry vital to the Irish economy and even at this stage 20 per cent of UK residents would not rule out Ireland as a place to come to for holidays.  The 48 per cent of people interviewed abroad who turned down Ireland did so because of price factors. Politicians and even the media seem unaware at times of the importance of tourism to the country.  Therefore, I welcome the provision which awards £300,000 increased funds for promotional purposes for tourism, which also has been helped enormously by the reduction by 5 per cent of car hire VAT and by the proposed VAT refund scheme on souvenirs and gifts.  These items, along with the new range of incentives, will help the tourist industry, and I hope that this trend in increased aids will continue in future years.</P>
    <P>I dealt earlier with the importance of the construction industry to our economy and the fact that VAT on concrete has been reduced to 5 per cent.  Along with the £8 million for roads, £3 million for SDA housing and the other provisions that will have a very positive effect on the employment situation in the construction industry.  That, allied to the announcement of a £2 million allocation for the provision of a deep-water berth in Ringaskiddy, will help that industry a good deal.  I have referred to the deep-water berth which I know is not in the Finance Bill but I thought that something in relation to a free port could have been part of the Bill's provisions.  It is important that a commitment be made to the concept of a free port zone at Ringaskiddy in Cork which would make the Cork harbour area more attractive internationally.</P>
    <P>I hope that at an early date the Minister for Finance, even though he has not done so in the Finance Bill, will consider seriously the concept of a free port in the Cork area.  One already established very successfully in the Shannon area covers about 300 acres, employs about 800 persons <Col N="1159" /> in about 100 businesses and earns something in the region of £130 million per year in foreign exchange.  I realise that a condition of entitlement to operate within a free port is that a high proportion of the produce must be exported.  Prior to our entry to the EEC, zone users in Shannon were entitled to relief on all goods imported for processing.  Following accession to the EEC, relief was available on goods processed for export to Third World countries only.  Membership of the EEC also restricted the incentives which could be offered to firms setting up in the zone and the only fiscal advantage that could now be enjoyed by people setting up in a free zone in Ringaskiddy would be a reduced rate of profits tax applying to exported services.</P>
    <P>I will not go into too much detail, but I feel that it is relevant to the Finance Bill, since it relates to duties and VAT, so I will go into some detail on the concept of a free port.  Free ports must have certain necessary conditions as follows: the areas themselves must be duty free, and this gives them several immediate advantages.  Goods can be processed for export without duty being paid on the components.  A free port gets extra-territorial status and this offers relief from regulations which would otherwise impede trading activities.  In other words, goods can enter the free port without having to conform to quality, labelling and safety standards of the host country. Re-packaging and re-labelling could be done in the free port area to bring them in line with the host country's standards or the standards of the countries to which they would be re-exported.</P>
    <P>The concept of a free port provides a protected environment within which there is freedom to operate and where contact with duties and regulations comes only at the times the goods leave the zone.  Goods or components coming from outside the EEC could stop over in a free port just short of a final destination and this pause could allow any exporter to other countries to wait until market conditions are appropriate or until currency changes swing to advantage before the goods are brought out to complete the last leg of the trip.</P>

      <P>I will go on to deal with the newspaper industry which was referred to previously. Before I deal with the VAT impositions on the newspaper industry I must say that newspaper groups must look at their own operations to find out how best they can adapt to change.  Very strong, determined but to date unsuccessful attempts have been made to reduce VAT on Irish newspapers.  The imposition of VAT on newspapers here has resulted in the dumping here of British newspapers with a lower VAT rate. While I support the pleas of our newspaper industry, one must ask the fair question of how the British newspaper industry are coping with the difficulties now endemic in that industry.  Our newspaper industry must examine their own difficulties and be prepared to go to some lengths to introduce much needed reforms towards bringing the whole industry into the modern era of technology.</P>
      <P>From the close contact which I have with our own newspaper in Cork, I am glad to say that it is one of the few which have stepped into that era.  At the same time, we must look fairly at VAT rates on newspapers.  There have been attempts by the Opposition party to make this subject into a political football, but the Opposition should remember that it was they who put a 35 per cent rate on imported newsprint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must look realistically at the problems of this industry.  In 1983, the volume sales of English newspapers have increased by 35 per cent, while those of our own newspapers have decreased steadily since the increase in VAT rate which commenced in September 1981.  I am heartened that the Taoiseach recently acknowledged the need for a serious look <Col N="1162" /> at the problems of this industry.  I have never bought these products coming from Britain but just bought them today&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Some English newspapers are priced at 16p sterling, exclusive of VAT, because there is a zero VAT rate in the UK.  When sold in Ireland, they are subject to 23 per cent VAT, which brings the price to 20p sterling. Converted, that price should be approximately 26p on the Irish market. In fact, they are selling here at 20p and 21p, which indicates that the British newspaper industry are involved in a dumping exercise.  Not only must we look at our VAT rates, but the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism must look at the question of this dumping.</P>

      <P>There is need for an industry which treats Irish society in a responsible way, not displaying the attitudes which are becoming more and more apparent.  Allied to the contents of the Finance Bill the waste of public money must be examined in depth by the different Departments involved in the Oireachtas Committees.  Even if a small percentage of that money were saved, it would go a long way towards resolving some of our problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The first matter which needs a comment is the major difference between the Finance Bill and the Minister's budget speech.  We are used to regarding the budget speech as the final decisions of a Government, after long thought and discussion and the results of these as being produced in a Finance Bill. In the case of this Finance Bill, a number <Col N="1163" /> of items appearing in the budget have now been substantially altered.  In his opening speech the Minister made the following extraordinary remark: &ldquo;I aim to reduce income tax and rationalise VAT&rdquo;.  This is extraordinary in the context of the budget of this year and last and the Finance Bill which has evolved as a result of the budget.  In the first place, far from reducing income tax or giving any indication that in the future income tax will or can be reduced, it has been substantially increased, some say by 20 per cent, but I understood it to be approximately 17 per cent, by about £288 million.</P>
      <P>There has been no attempt to rationalise VAT.  The Minister has simply increased the number of items on which VAT must be paid.  There is no indication, even in the budget, that he has plans to reduce VAT in the future.  He aims to do things but apparently he does not hit.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Taxation Reform recently produced their second report. Their first has been lying there for nearly two years and very little notice has been taken of it unless perhaps a decision not to implement their recommendations.  A number of items proposed in the commission's first report were actually suggestions made by the Taoiseach some years ago and by both Fine Gael and the Labour Party at Ard-Fheiseanna.  Even though these items have come out in the commission's report, they have not yet been accepted by the Minister for Finance or by the Government.</P>
      <P>The alterations from the original budget are very significant in that they appeared at the time of the budget speech to be small concessions to the Labour Party in Coalition.  In that light, it is extraordinary that these items have now been altered.  The £25,000 mentioned in the budget as being capable of use by investment in new ventures &mdash; the tax-free item &mdash; has now in the Finance Bill been altered to investment in practically anything.  Certainly, new ventures are being changed into old ventures: those with £25,000 to spare, perhaps in the £40,000 to £50,000 a year income bracket, or those who have windfalls of some kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1164" /> The Minister tries to make it appear that the provision is for the benefit of redundant workers.  There was a time redundancy payments might have been as high as £25,000 but in the light of what happened in Fords and in various other companies in the past year, they are not likely to be anywhere near the £25,000 mark.  However, there are very many people in this society whose incomes are in excess of £25,000, £30,000 and even £40,000 per annum.  These people make substantial gains whether by way of capital gains as a result of Stock Exchange dealings or of the various other manipulations of the market, whether in regard to property or otherwise.  It is to benefit these people that the £25,000 tax-free investment provision was introduced in the budget.  At that time the impression was given that this would be a great incentive for the new ventures that are required now that the older industries are closing, but any such incentive seems to have disappeared in so far as the Finance Bill is concerned because of the alteration to extend the benefit to older ventures.</P>
    <P>A great deal of publicity was given to the provision in relation to bond washing. Again, this provision was seen to be a gain for the Labour Party in that the bond washers were to be scrubbed, but in the Bill the Minister has altered the provision significantly.  Obviously, he has been subjected to strong lobbying in the past couple of months by financial interests, by speculators and so on.  The proposal now is that the new measures which are aimed at bond-washing transactions will not apply in certain circumstances, namely, where securities have been held by the same owner for a continuous period of at least two years.  That was not part of the original proposal.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the greatest change in this Bill <i>vis-à-vis</i> the budget is the section 84 operation.  Here again the Minister tries to give the impression that the original budget decision is to apply in respect of section 84 but subject to certain exceptions. That phrase can cover everything. Included are manufacturing companies and service activities as well as agricultural and fishery co-operatives.  I should <Col N="1165" /> like the Minister to let us know who and what are covered by the original decision in section 84.  We know who are not included.  I think it was the Minister for Health who said recently that only about £3 million would have been involved in this provision in any case.  That is totally opposed to what the Minister for Finance said and to what various economic commentators have said, that is, that the figure for this year would have been £7 million and that the income in the future would have been of the order of £55 million.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health went on to say that the situation had to be changed in the light of 6,000 jobs being at risk.  How did the Minister arrive at that figure? There is no indication from any source that that is the situation or indeed that any job is at risk as a result of this provision. The threat of job losses seems now to cover everything.  Regardless of which new screw is being turned we are told that it is in the interest of preventing job losses.  We are told that if water charges are not paid, local authority jobs will be lost.  Labour councillors particularly are active throughout the country in saying that.  This is blackmail.  The same applies to the proposal I am talking of.  So far as the non-payment of water charges is concerned, the people in question will already have paid their taxes to the Government.  They would expect local authorities to be refunded in full from the Exchequer the total amount of the domestic rates.  That was the guarantee. Therefore, the Government are the ones who will be responsible for job losses and not those who fail to pay water charges.  In the case of the proposal in question the Government, too, will be responsible for whatever job losses may occur and not the fact that they closed a tax-evasion loophole that existed in section 84.  If one considers the arguments in favour of this change, one realises that it relates to low-cost loans which manufacturing companies and co-operatives can avail of, but surely that is a matter for the Minister for Finance.  Is it not for him to decide whether companies should be subsidised in terms of low-cost loans?  Should he not put the boot in and tell the banks <Col N="1166" /> to reduce interest rates?  Instead, the Minister is handing over the decision-making to the banks who can then decide on whether to subsidise manufacturing companies and co-operatives by way of low-cost loans.  In those circumstances nobody will be aware of what the hidden subsidy is or of what is the loss to the Exchequer.  The banks will be making the decisions in regard to what companies or co-operatives should be helped in this way.  The Minister should not hand over his responsibility to banks and other financial institutions.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Taxation made precisely this point before the Government made this highly dangerous alteration in the Finance Bill.  The commission made the point that where such help is necessary it should be given by way of subsidy and not by way of tax relief or incentives.  In the case of direct subsidy we would know exactly what was needed and where the money was allocated to. In other words, the whole matter would be open and above board.  When the decision-making is handed over to the financial institutions we are left arguing in this House as to the level of the aid given, as to whether it was £3 million, as the Minister for Health said, or £5 million, which is possibly closer to the truth. Nobody will ever know.</P>
    <P>Last year we were promised that the question of abuses in the insurance-linked investment schemes would be tackled in this year's Finance Bill.  The Minister says now that he had the legislation prepared but that after discussion with the insurance companies it was decided not to bring in the legislation as they are to produce a voluntary code of practice. Obviously, the Minister has been subjected to pressure and lobbying of various kinds.  Now the insurance companies are to tell the Minister that they have made this voluntary code of practice and they do not want him to make any law about it.  They are saying they will cover it up this way or that way.  The Minister has acceded to this voluntary code of practice. How many workers would get away with saying that they will have a voluntary code of practice about how much they earn and they will have a voluntary code <Col N="1167" /> of practice about how many nixers they will do?  Would the Minister accept that? They would not get away with anything like codes of practice of that type or agreements with the Minister for Finance to do fiddles in a better way than they had done them before.  A more acceptable way to tax fiddle and evasion is what is being done in the insurance companies, the various banks and finance houses.</P>
    <P>The Government are not tackling high interest rates, which are crippling various companies all over the country, the self-employed, farmers and industry.  The Minister is not taking any decision in relation to that matter.  We were promised that the self-employed would be taxed on current year's earnings.  This was put before us on a number of occasions over the last few years and it has come nearer and nearer.  It could not be done immediately but certainly next year it will be done.  This year there is no mention of taxing self-employed on current year's earnings and using the same method as that is used for PAYE workers.  This strengthens the argument of the PAYE workers that they are being treated differently, they are being treated unfairly and are being milked for every penny they earn.  No decisions are being taken in regard to the self-employed, banks, insurance companies or other people like that.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of years ago the Taoiseach gloried in the idea of tax credits.  It was his special baby and he pushed it as a marvellous thing.  The Fine Gael Party were pushing it and several Ministers for Finance said it was a great thing.  The Commission on Taxation then said it was a good thing.  The more people are for it now the more Fine Gael and the Taoiseach are pulling away from it.  Now they do not want it at all.  It is now seen by them as a bad thing because other people are beginning to regard it as a good thing. This year's Finance Bill does not do anything about tax credits instead of tax incentives, reliefs and various devices for evasion and avoidance which the whole system of the Revenue Commissioners is riddled with as well as the various Finance Bills over the years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1168" /> Revenue from income tax will increase by 17 per cent this year over last year's figure.  The revenue will increase by £288 million.  It is against this background that we must look at the various tax concessions made in the budget and in the Finance Bill and see who benefits from the tax concessions and who pays the bulk of the taxes.  There is reference to the need for incentives in several sections of the Finance Bill.  There are incentives to industry, farmers and the self-employed. What about an incentive to workers?  There is no incentive in this enormous tax bill for workers, which is going higher each year.  The tax bill has increased by 17 per cent this year.  The Government are calling for a pay freeze and are telling PAYE workers they must pay more tax and get less wages.  Workers are being told that their wage increases must be less than the increase in inflation. In fact they are being told their wages must not increase at all this year although inflation will increase by approximately 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>Capital taxes have been reducing.  In theory capital tax this year is the same as last year but in fact, due to a number of measures which have been taken, the income has been reduced from £24 million in 1983 to an expected yield this year of £22 million.  The expected income of £10 million from property tax in 1983 became £1 million.  The estimated receipts from this tax this year are £3 million, so we will probably get about £500,000.</P>
    <P>The January OECD report pointed out that our capital taxes are the lowest in Europe, that our tax base is too narrow and they made several comments on our taxation system which makes it unique. The report said our total capital tax has reduced from 11.2 per cent in 1974 and this fell consistently every year to 4.7 per cent in 1981.  The Minister has estimated that it will be about 4 per cent this year. He said 4 per cent is very substantial by any calculations.  That is about one-third of what the capital taxation brings in in the UK.  The January OECD report says that in Ireland the corporate share of taxes is relatively low and has fallen appreciably since 1970.  The report goes <Col N="1169" /> on to say that the share of property taxes has decreased after the abolition of rates on houses in 1978 &mdash; this is quite true &mdash; and this has not been replaced.  The report also says that the level of tax on agricultural incomes is very low and it has never accounted for more than 1 per cent of total tax levied on income and wealth in the recent past.  The report says that in 1982 it was as low as 0.3 per cent.  A total of 0.3 per cent of all taxation came from tax on agricultural incomes in 1982.</P>
    <P>Since then farmers have succeeded in getting rates abolished.  They took constitutional action in the High Court and they got the valuation system declared unconstitutional so rates have not been levied on farmers since then.  The amount of taxation coming from farmers since the abolition of rates is even less than 0.3 per cent.  Is it .1 per cent net?  We have not got the figure.  No one seems to know what percentage tax farmers pay now and what percentage outflow they get from the Exchequer.  What percentage of Exchequer outflow goes to agriculture?</P>
    <P>The OECD make the point that our tax base is much too narrow and confined to too small a range of people.  The report says we have consistently reduced the level of tax taken in in corporation tax, on capital, on property, on agricultural incomes.  This is something the Minister must tackle seriously.  It is something he should have tackled in this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that in 1983 there were 45,000 farmers in the tax net. It was announced last year that &mdash; I think it was 90,000 or 50,000, I am not quite sure of the number &mdash; a large number of additional farmers were to be brought into the tax net but nothing has ever been done about that.  Of course, bringing them into the tax net is one thing, taking tax off them is another.  The 45,000 in the tax net did not all pay tax by any means.  It is interesting to see the tax form which has been designed for farmers: &ldquo;Total farm receipts for the year ending 31 December 1982 (where known): State the amount of your total farm receipts for the year or estimate the amount to the nearest £1,000&rdquo;.  What kind of income tax form is that?  This is what is being sent <Col N="1170" /> to farmers.  State the amount of your farm receipts or estimate them to the nearest £1,000.  On the next page it says under &ldquo;Farm Receipts&rdquo;, which is the most important and significant item in the whole form, &ldquo;Completion of this section while optional would help considerably&rdquo;. The tax form which goes out to the worker states that if he or she does not complete the form or completes it wrongly that will cost the worker £1,000, or £2,000, or whatever.  The penalty is quite clearly mandatory.  If the correct tax is not paid the taxpayer will be penalised but the farmer has an option.  The form says, &ldquo;Completion of this section while optional would help considerably&rdquo;. It is optional.  If you do complete it all you need do is estimate to the nearest £1,000.  What a joke?  Who designs this form?  Does the Minister really consider that to be a serious form for reckoning income and collecting tax from farmers in the same way as tax is collected from every other section?</P>
    <P>The 8 per cent VAT on clothing has been altered in this Bill.  We were told in the budget the scheme was designed for children under ten years of age.  Their clothing would be exempt from value-added tax but there would be VAT on all clothing for those over the age of ten. That has been changed.  Tax will not now go on the basis of age.  It will go on the basis of size.  A small person will now be able to avail of zero rating VAT on clothes but the child who is bigger than normal will be caught.  In the case of some children of eight, nine or ten the parents will have to pay VAT on their clothes while other children who did not grow to the same extent will be zero-rated.  I think the less said about this the better.  It is somewhat like the VAT on shoes a couple of years ago.  The Taoiseach explained that women with small feet could wear children's shoes and so VAT was put on children's shoes in case women with small feet would get away without paying VAT.  We are coming very close to the same situation now. Great difficulties will be created for many parents with this ridiculous VAT on children's clothes.</P>
    <P>It is worth looking again at the programme <Col N="1171" /> published by Fine Gael in the summer of 1982.  Under the heading of &ldquo;Income tax and Indirect Taxation&rdquo; the programme stated that the proportion of tax derived from PAYE on wages and salaries will be reduced.  Again a joke, of course, but a rather sick joke.  It also said that indirect taxes were to be minimised in order to help reduce inflation.  Indirect taxes are a major part of inflation but they have also consistently gone up and will be going up again as a result of the budget.  Tax credits were to be substituted for tax allowances to secure greater equity between income groups.  In regard to the provision of taxation on financial institutions to increase their yield, in fact less tax is coming from corporations and financial institutions.  Income from all sources will be subject to tax; that again has to be read against the background of those who evade taxes and who have not been subjected to any new taxes.  All income taxation to be on a current year basis in regard to the self-employed.  That was the programme in 1982.  They did not expect any difficulties to arise.  They repeated it again last year but as yet no attempt has been made to make the self-employed pay tax on the income in the current year.</P>
    <P>There was reference to anti-avoidance measures and capital taxation measures in particular.  It was stated that a sum of £100 million would be realised by 1984. This was Point 6 of the Programme for Government in regard to the measures outlined in the preceding paragraphs and other anti-avoidance and capital taxation measures.  This is 1984 and I would ask the Minister to tell us now what has happened to the £100 million.</P>
    <P>The last point in this rather dishonoured document is under the heading &ldquo;Development Plan: a 10 per cent tax on derelict sites will be levied&rdquo;.  These were the reforms promised by the people who subsequently took office.  One could go through every point in this document and show how every point has been totally abandoned.  One of the things which has shocked everybody, even the farmers, in the budget is the failure to bring in a land tax.  When domestic rates were abolished <Col N="1172" /> it was expected that some new tax would be brought in to replace them.  The most obvious was a land tax because it could be designed to bring in specific and easily quantified amounts of revenue which would be equal to the amount the rates brought in.  It was widely recommended by agriculturalists and economists as a tax which would ensure better use of our land.  Considerable work has been done over a number of years in pointing out the amount of land which is lying fallow and practically unused.  As much as 25 per cent of our agricultural land is not being used as it should and a tax of this nature would ensure that people would not neglect the land while taking a job elsewhere or drawing the dole.  If they had to pay taxes on it they would certainly use it so that it would yield an income.</P>
    <P>At the time of the budget even the farmers had accepted that there would be a land tax and were amazed that it was not introduced.  They were all set to shout and roar about it, as they always do when they are asked to pay tax, but nevertheless they expected and would have accepted it.  How can one be surprised if there is urban-rural confrontation?  When you discuss the relationship between farmers' income and taxation with those of the workers you are told by people like the Snipe Healy that this is the politics of envy.  It is important for people in this House to realise that it is not the politics of envy but the politics of anger.  This anger has been burning slowly but the consequences will be all the greater when the conflagration takes place.</P>
    <P>Workers marched quietly and in good spirits but in great numbers almost four years ago and made their feelings very well known without confrontation, open anger or attacking anybody.  They simply said they were paying too great a share of taxes and that they could not bear it any longer.  There was never a march of so many people seen in the history of the State.  On one day 750,000 people came out on the streets, 350,000 marched in the city of Dublin.  However, there was a total lack of response to their demands. That was evident when the march was called this year; it was poorly attended and even those who came said they were <Col N="1173" /> there just to show solidarity, that they knew it would not do any good.  They also said that their colleagues would not come because more than marching is now required.  Although the numbers marching were small, politicians should not get the idea that the anger is gone.  The anger is greater than ever and a small turnout was just their way of saying that unless they bring everything to a halt no-one will listen.  Farmers bring everything to a standstill and they are listened to.  Other pressure groups also do this and workers will also do so unless justice is done.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the anger of the workers at present will be reflected in the area of local government charges because it is the people who were protesting who are now being asked to pay these charges and who are refusing to do so.  Their refusal is not based simply on the amount involved, it is because they know that the huge amounts they have been paying in taxes and which they marched against four years ago were for local government services, education and health services. All these services have been cut back. Medical cards have been withdrawn and services reduced.  The health boards are being left short of money and education has been cut back.  Every week parents are being asked to pay for heating of schools.  They now have to pay for all the services which they previously got by paying their taxes.  They are told that nothing is free.  They know this but they have already paid large taxes.  They keep the State going and they realise that some people pay nothing at all.  They can see how quickly the owners of capital and finance houses can change the budget. Section 84 and the bond washing were highly publicised because they seemed to be doing something but we now see that this is being changed.  When the ordinary workers marched in their thousands they got nowhere.  There was a commission set up to inquire into taxation but nobody heeded that report.</P>
    <P>The whole area of taxation and tax avoidance is going to spill over into something which this House will be unable to contain.  If anyone was looking at the &ldquo;Public Account&rdquo; programme last night they might have learned why nothing is <Col N="1174" /> being done about tackling those who are evading tax.  The programme was about illegal bookmakers and avoidance of tax by them and also by punters.  Two Members of this House, Deputy Brendan McGahon and Deputy Charlie McCreevy, said they would not pay a betting tax, they never had paid it and they have no intention of ever doing so. Deputy McGahon, the great law and order man, said that betting tax is immoral. We have heard from many pulpits that gambling is immoral but to suggest that a tax on gambling is immoral is ludicrous.</P>
    <P>The public regard all Members of this House as the Government, not just Fine Gael and Labour.  We are all responsible for legislation and here were two Deputies making a laugh of legislation passed here in regard to tax on gambling.  They joked about it and said they would not pay the tax.  How many other taxes do Deputy McGahon and Deputy McCreevy not pay?  How many other taxes do they consider immoral?  Do they think that only the taxes that apply to them are immoral?  I should say that is about it.  To tax other people is fine.  They should pay water charges, income tax and so on but a tax on gambling is immoral. All of this tells us a lot about what is happening in this society, why some people get away with it and others are stamped into the ground.  It also tells us something about the hypocrisy and the double-think that goes on.  What is happening is making people sick at this stage. Everyone has had enough.</P>
    <P>In the Finance Bill the Minister is trying to give the impression that he is dealing with the evasion of betting tax but he is not dealing with it.  He has said there will be higher penalties on those who do not pay their tax in time, but what he is doing is penalising the handful of honest bookies who are declaring returns and who are paying tax.  If those people do not pay in time the penalty is increased but what is the Minister doing about the people whose tax levels he does not know, who are engaging in illegal gambling in pubs?  What is he doing about people who are taking £50 bets but who are marking down the bets as 50p?  Nothing <Col N="1175" /> is being done about all this fiddle. Nothing is being done about the phone calls to London putting down bets of £1,000.  The tax is paid in Britain but nothing is done about that.</P>
    <P>When a question on this matter was raised here the Minister said there was no evidence that there was any evasion of tax.  Yet the total amount taken in respect of tax from 900 betting shops down here was only slightly higher than the total amount taken in the North from 300 shops.  The amount of tax taken &mdash; I am not sure if this was in respect of last year or 1982 &mdash; was £22 million.  It is estimated that was only 22 per cent of the amount due; in other words, the amount should be £100 million tax on gambling and betting.  In this case there was a hand-out of £80 million.</P>
    <P>The Government always ask where will we get the money for various services. There is an endless list of new taxes that could be imposed and an endless list of current taxes that are not being paid.  The total amount not paid is equal to the budget deficit but the Minister does not appear to worry about that.  Presumably that would hurt the wrong people and, therefore, others have to pay.  The same people have to pay for those who avoid and who evade payment of tax while Members of this House are saying it is all right to evade tax, that taxes are immoral. What about the credibility of the House, the Government and the State?  It is called into question when two Deputies &mdash; one Fianna Fáil and one Fine Gael &mdash; make public statements on television to that effect.  What is the point of the Minister bringing in a Finance Bill and of this House passing it when Deputies make a laugh and a joke of it and refuse to pay tax.</P>
    <P>This Finance Bill is not really tackling the problem of gambling and betting.  It is not tackling the matter of the loss of money to the Exchequer, it is not taking into account the farmers who are not paying rates now.  Nothing has been put in the place of rates.  It is not tackling the problem of the self-employed people who are not being taxed on the current year's earnings.  In the manufacturing and services area evasion and avoidance of <Col N="1176" /> tax is on a large scale.  In addition, there are concealed subsidies as well as direct grants which cost the Exchequer huge sums.  The banks and finance companies are making major financial decisions in regard to lending policy and interest rate policy.  They are taking over the functions of the Minister in giving relief and subsidies to manufacturing and service companies and co-operatives.  They are making the decisions the Minister should make.</P>
    <P>The workers are the people who must pay for all.  Without their constant and regular payment of taxes the whole apparatus would collapse.  There would not be a Department of Agriculture to handle farmers' subsidies; there would not be any subsidies to give.  Now the Government are imposing a pay freeze on the only loyal and faithful members of society who have kept the economy going and who will continue to keep it going.  They only want justice and fair play.  The pay freeze is another attempt to give a further transfer to employers from the workers. It does not matter if it is public sector employers or employers in the private sector.  The Government are trying to make decisions before any negotiations take place that workers must take home less pay and employers must get more.</P>
    <P>There is no hard evidence for the argument they advance about our lack of competitiveness. There is no evidence of a direct link between pay increases and job losses.  In fact, there is a greater link between tax increases such as PRSI increases and job losses.  If the Government want to lower pay levels in order to maintain competitiveness as they say, they must lower the taxes.  They had that option this time.  It was put to them last year and they knew what they could do to keep pay levels down this year.  They had to lower taxation levels on personal income but they did not do that.</P>
    <P>The argument put forward by the Government and Members on that side of the House in regard to competitiveness was shot down by the <i>Economic Background to the Budget, 1984</i> which dealt in its opening with the general argument in regard to our lack of competitiveness.  It stated:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1177" /> Hourly earnings in Irish manufacturing industry increased by over 11 per cent in 1983 whereas output prices increased by only 6½ per cent.  While the increase in earnings was some three percentage points lower than that recorded in 1982, it was still well in excess of earnings increases in our main trading partners.  In the UK the average increase was only 8 per cent (ours was 11 per cent), in Germany, 3 per cent and in the Netherlands, 4 per cent, increases of 4 and 4½ per cent were recorded in the US and Japan respectively.</P>
    <P>Up to that point it would seem that we were lacking in competitiveness.  I should like to refer to the remainder of that quotation on competitiveness which states:</P>
    <P>However, the effect on competitiveness of this relatively high increase in earnings was more than offset by a more rapid increase in output per head which largely reflected the sharper fall in employment in Ireland.  As a consequence of this productivity increase, unit wage costs in Ireland fell by about 1 per cent in 1983 as compared with increases of 3½ per cent in our main trading partners and 1½ per cent in the UK.</P>
    <P>Our unit wage costs here last year fell by about 1 per cent although they increased in other countries.  That is the Government's argument against their own comments about lack of competitiveness.  In spite of the fact that we had an 11 per cent increase in earnings we finished with a 1 per cent reduction in unit wage costs compared to our trading partners.  That statement is based on Government information.</P>
    <P>Why is it that Government Ministers and Members on that side of the House put up the argument about our lack of competitiveness because our workers got an increase in earnings when they did not take account of the increase in productivity achieved in recent years in industry? <Col N="1178" /> The argument about lack of competitiveness is not on for this year.  It will not be accepted by workers and will be seen for what it is, an effort to transfer further amounts from workers to employers.  We are a low wage economy unable to compete for some reason with the highest wage economies in the world, those in Western Europe.  Workers in those countries enjoy higher wages and a higher standard of living than us.  We are the poor relation out in the Atlantic and we cannot compete with other countries even with low wages.  What is wrong? There is something else wrong apart from wage levels.  There is something wrong in management, marketing and in the amount of investment in industries where workers are trying to cope with obsolete plant and are expected to produce the same quantity as workers in other countries using high technology.  That is the area where the Government should put the boot in.  They should not be putting the boot into the workers who are producing the goods.</P>

      <P>The previous speaker no doubt articulated the views of the large number of farmers in his constituency and a number of other interested groups. His comments highlighted the growing division between urban and rural communities. The only warning I will give to people embarking too freely on that kind of policy is that eventually they can fall victims to the creatures they create.  We should address ourselves to this in the future.  This division has become more apparent in recent times particularly in relation to the whole issue of taxation. Politicians seem to be able to row in behind what they consider to be the strongest lobby in their constituency and they support and pursue the objectives of those lobbies regardless of the consequences. That is a very dangerous policy. I am not suggesting that PAYE workers are not feeling the pinch in respect of taxation.  That is accepted, but we should be careful not to tell those unfortunate people that there is a hidden crock of gold around the corner there for the taking and that we can all get it if we go the right way about it.  That would be deluding <Col N="1179" /> the public and the Members of the House.</P>
      <P>Reference was also made by the last speaker to local charges.  I was sorry to hear the old platitudes about blackmail. Those of us who said such charges should be introduced because it otherwise would militate against the workers who are employed were accused of using a form of blackmail.  Whether we like it or not many workers are employed in the local authority system and if a method is not devised to permit those bodies to continue in existence and finance themselves, the reality is that there will not be any jobs.  There were 35,000 jobs in that area last year and there is considerable scope for the creation of more jobs.</P>
      <P>There is a story going around that people are being taxed twice for these services, they are taxed by direct charge and through general taxation.  A lot of people are beginning to believe that. That may appear to be the case at first glance but, whether we are taxed once or twice for the services, the fact is that we do not have sufficient funds to provide the services.</P>

      <P>The reason is that the cost of providing the service has increased.  We should address ourselves to that now and stop avoiding the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that it is the duty of the Government, and the Minister for Finance, in the budget and the Finance Bill to create the right type of climate for enterprise and, through taxation policies, to attract investment and get across to workers the advantage of being in gainful employment. Many workers in my constituency have expressed concern that the average person who tries honestly to make a living, pays all taxes and gets involved in a legitimate business, is under threat by those operating in the black economy or, in some cases, by those who are in the early stages of unemployment.  This is typical of the way workers look at it. They ask whether they would be as well off to be unemployed instead of continuing to work in employment that would not be highly remunerative but would <Col N="1180" /> cause them all the hassle involved in short time or casual employment.</P>
    <P>Many people these days have concluded that they are better off if they opt out of the system, go out of the taxation net and become engaged in the black economy.  Some of our European partners have remained economically viable because of their large black economies. What we must do is revise our taxation system so that it will be more attractive for people to engage in the labour force or in legitimate business, rather than outside it.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides many changes from proposals in the budget about which there had been considerable concern in regard to the effect such proposals would have had.  I dealt earlier with stock relief and it is hoped that the Finance Bill provisions will ensure that the highest possible level of investment will be embarked on and that that effort will be allowed to continue unhindered.  In regard to section 84, in these straitened times we should be very careful to ensure that nothing will be done which will have the net result of creating further problems for those who are now employed or who hope to become employed.  For that reason I welcome the changes in section 84.</P>
    <P>The section in relation to long-term risk capital will have the same effect.  It is there to encourage those prepared to invest, and the more encouragement they get the better for the open economy we have.  There are some in the House who would find themselves idealistically opposed to incentives for those in the risk business or in ordinary investment undertakings on the ground that the objective ultimately of those people is to make profits.  But all business is about profits &mdash; if it does not make a profit it will not exist.  All the competitors that Irish industry has to face up to are in the business of making profits.  The more efficient the business the more profit that will be made.  Such competitors are putting our production at risk because they are able to make such profits and if we are to compete with them in an open market the only way we can help them is to give an even chance to native investors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1181" /> I do not intend to deviate from the terms of the Bill but I wish to stress that with our economic climate at present it is important we appreciate that our taxation policy should be generally geared towards improving employment levels, towards encouraging those who are now unemployed or whose jobs are at risk towards the belief that their position will not get any worse and that the situation in relation to the burden of taxation will not get worse.  Because of our open type economy we must not do anything that would result in a reduction of revenue from taxation, but we must take a risk and try to blaze a trail by encouraging employers.  In our type of economy we should rely more on the private sector to take risks and carry burdens but we must give them incentives through the tax system.  We should particularly give incentives to firms who employ 100 people in the production sector, perhaps exporting companies, provided they have a good record over the years and provided they will take on more employees through improving their marketing and sales.  That would not cost the Exchequer a penny because the people absorbed into the labour force would be paying tax.</P>
    <P>This should be given favourable consideration.  There is another good reason why it should be done.  Most employers are concerned about the increased administrative burden of taking on even a single worker.  It costs between £1,200 and £1,400 to put one person on the payroll.  If my suggestion was followed it would help to reduce the overall impact of that burden on the general labour force within a company.  In the course of the year I suggest that the Minister and the Government might give some consideration to initiating such incentives.  Employers would welcome such an opportunity and, as I said, it would not cost the State anything.  I spoke about incentives for major companies who could show good track records, good marketing organisations because they would be in the best position to capitalise on such proposals.</P>
    <P>I have suggested many times that the local authority system is another way to <Col N="1182" /> absorb the unemployed.  I refer to this on the Finance Bill because any measures we can take to increase the level of employment will have a bearing ultimately on the general level of taxation. Last year approximately 35,000 people were employed by local authorities and that figure could be doubled without a great deal of ingenuity.  I have felt for a long time that many unemployed people &mdash; trainees, technicians, architects, landscape artists and so on &mdash; could be absorbed into the local authority system provided money was transferred from the Department of Social Welfare.  We could have them employ people in receipt of social welfare benefits who are costing the working public a considerable amount of money.  This could have a dramatic impact on the level of taxation to be paid by the PAYE and other taxpayers. It would also be a positive response to the people who have been unemployed for a long time and who see little prospect for the future.  It would be a positive response to those who are now employed but who are paying very high rates of taxation and see no let up for the future.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it is possible for any one sector to carry the burden of responsibility to take the initiative which will rejuvenate our economy.  There should be a combination of the measures I have already outlined and which many other speakers have mentioned on numerous occasions in the past.  It behoves us all to come forward with any constructive suggestions we have.  I am not suggesting that one side make more constructive suggestions than the other.  My colleague, Deputy Power, is not here at the moment but on the last occasion he slightly misinterpreted what I had to say on this matter.</P>
    <P>If we do as I suggest we will be doing ourselves as public representatives a good turn because the general public are fed up listening to hackneyed phrases day after day and week after week from politicians generally and from those who see themselves as future politicians.  They are tired listening to people who give the impression that they have discovered the panacea for all our ills.  Nobody has that <Col N="1183" /> remedy because if he did he would put it into operation.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with the simplification of the procedure in relation to casual work.  I mentioned this already in the context of overheads for the employers and the prospects of a potential employee hoping to obtain employment in a small firm, taking into account what he or she is faced with from the employer's and from the employee's point of view.  The employer knows the present taxation will lean very heavily on him; the potential employee knows the present taxation will lean very heavily on him too.  I would like to see some kind of simplification which would remove this grey area as well as the area for tax evasion and involvement in the black economy.  A potential employee should have some kind of record system assuring him that his deductions will be made from day one and the employer should recognise that his liabilities were from day one also.  I say this because there is a great need for a simplification of the PRSI and PAYE deduction systems.  In the old days there was a stamp system but that was changed because it was difficult to operate, but as far as I can see, there were not nearly as many abuses of the system as there are today.  Every employee knew that one of his basic rights was that his card was stamped.  If that was not done his statutory entitlement should he become unemployed would not be paid. Now we have a complicated system which very often leaves a sour taste in the mouths of many people who suddenly find themselves redundant but learn that their contributions have not been paid to date.  This matter should be looked at very carefully.  I do not think it would take an Einstein to come up with a better system.</P>
    <P>Earlier I mentioned the need for incentives to attract foreign investment.  Some speakers suggested free ports, free areas and so on, and in my view a little thought should be given to this.  I am not suggesting that we create a tax haven, but the fact remains that as a society and as a workforce we are very heavily taxed in order to provide the services we operate <Col N="1184" /> at present and to which we aspire for the future.  For that reason we should look further afield and try to utilise funds which are afloat because people want to invest and make a profit.  There is nothing wrong in giving people an incentive to invest here if it means that we will have a better standard of living; more people will be employed and our economy will be more vibrant.  There is nothing wrong in making a profit provided the country in which the profit is made is the net beneficiary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla referred to the proposals on bookmaking in this Bill.  He spoke at length about two Members of this House who mentioned their preferences on a recent television programme. I come from a county which has a considerable interest in the betting business and all I can say is that the proposals in this Bill were sought to a considerable extent by legitimate bookmakers.  They did not want the system which prevailed up to now where illegal betting was easily available.  People were using premises for illegal betting and there appeared to be little or no chance of the authorities taking any action against those people. There are provisions in this Bill which will militate against people who organised that system and who have been putting at risk the jobs of the people involved in the legitimate bookmaking business. What people do after that is their own business but when a Ministry feel certain changes should be made by way of legislation it is the job of the Government to meet those requirements.  That is being done and I welcome the proposals in the Bill.  Under the relevant section there will be a refusal to certify as to the suitability of premises which have been used for illegal betting purposes.  The legitimate bookmaking industry has been very concerned about this matter and I hope the section will have the desired results.</P>
    <P>We should never have a taxation policy which kills off incentive and investment in the private sector.  This sector is very mobile and people who have funds for investment purposes can invest in other parts of the world where it is more remunerative. It is up to us to make the investment climate attractive and to improve <Col N="1185" /> our economy in order to alleviate the burden of taxation and improve employment prospects.  All revenue from taxation originates in the private sector. Taxation also applies to the various services run by the State but in many cases State enterprises are the recipients of subventions.  The money for those subventions must be raised internally or externally by loans or by taxation within the State from the productive sector.  The burden of providing the revenue originally is borne by the productive sector. Where the money is circulated afterwards is incidental.  When the productive sector is under pressure the tax-paying public are also under pressure because sufficient revenue is not being generated.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers have mentioned farm taxation.  In the past there was a strong lobby among the farming community for change in the taxation system. They probably will not like my views on this matter but one should always be prepared to push out the boat and express a constructive point of view.  Up to ten or 12 years ago before taxation was introduced farmers having up to 100 acres were paying rates.  This was an inequitable system because it did not take account of ability to pay or production from an individual farm unit, but the fact remains that money was coming from that sector into the local authority system and it was a fairly solid and useful support. Now we have a changed system whereby all farms, regardless of size, are within the tax net.  This is in response to a call for this system from the farming community and also from the large urban communities.  The urban communities were misled and misguided because now a farmer with 40 or 50 acres has to employ the services of a tax consultant and the net result is that neither the local authority nor the Exchequer benefits.  It would be far better to have a system whereby those with under 100 acres would know in advance their tax liabilities for the year.  Liability for tax would be determined on the basis of the productive capacity of a farm.  This information is fairly readily gleaned from the Agricultural Institute or other institutions.  Many farmers would probably opt for such a <Col N="1186" /> system on the basis that they would only have to pay once and would not incur expenses of £500 or £1,000 for the services of a tax consultant and would be better off paying tax directly to the local authority.  The country would also be better off.  Many of my friends who are accountants and tax consultants, among whom are some of my political colleagues in Kildare, will not like this suggestion. Revenue in that area is not necessarily being put to the best use because it is being absorbed in administration costs. It would be better to eliminate that and have the money paid directly to an institution such as a local authority to enable them to provide essential services.</P>
    <P>A number of services have come under increased pressure due to the burden of VAT.  The Minister is well aware of this problem, having met numerous deputations since the budget.  Let us take, for example, the hairdressing business.  A large number of people are employed in that sector.  Many girls who have completed their apprenticeship are in a position to provide employment for themselves or obtain jobs in salons.  However, the scale of VAT is now so high that it is driving them out of the legitimate arena and into the black economy.  Those who are trying to carry the burden of meeting their statutory obligations are at a disadvantage. It would be better to consider a reduction of VAT in that area which would result in making it at least as attractive for people who hope to become involved in that industry to become so involved in legitimate aspects of the industry rather than in the black economy.</P>
    <P>In relation to services I should like to make one final point.  Yesterday Deputy Fitzgerald or Deputy O'Kennedy referred to the vast area of services as a possible means of resolving our unemployment and general economic problems. That is quite true up to a point.  It is particularly true in relation to services such as the tourist industry which can be supported by those from outside the State.  The degree of services any economy can carry is closely related to the extent of the productive sector.</P>
    <P>If you have not got production in the <Col N="1187" /> first place, if you have not got a healthy productive sector, it does not matter what services are available.  There will be no demand for them for the simple reason that people will not be able to pay for them.  That applies whether we like it or not.  While I accept that there is a certain amount of scope for an improvement in the service area we can improve only along the lines of what we can afford.  It would be ridiculous for us to delude ourselves into thinking otherwise.</P>
    <P>Over the next 12 months I hope people on all sides of this House will come to grips with the fact that they are, or should be, trend setters in recognising our taxation and unemployment problems.  They should face up to their full responsibility and, instead of deluding themselves and the public, they should come forward with something reasonable and constructive. We should put aside the kind of throw-away remarks and the public posturing which have come to be associated with politics in recent times.  We will do ourselves a great injustice if we pursue that course for too long.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the serious nature of the unemployment problem in our society today, speakers in this debate have very rightly concentrated on the Finance Bill as it relates to employment and the possibility of raising the level of jobs and dealing with this very fundamental problem.  I should like to set the Finance Bill in the context of the fact that we have heavy job losses, growing unemployment, a lack of commitment by the Government to capital investment which would raise the level of public investment, and also the lack of taxation incentives to raise the level of private investment and to create a growing environment for a further expansion of the economy and the creation of further jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately there has been a cut in capital expenditure in vital areas, particularly in the building and construction industry and the services associated with it.  In the building industry we could trigger off employment fairly quickly.  There is a pool of skills available and a high <Col N="1188" /> labour content.  There is a high utilisation of home manufactured materials to the extent of 70 per cent to 80 per cent.  We see an amazing neglect of and lack of commitment on the part of the Government to a vital industry which could trigger off activity in other productive enterprises in the State.</P>
    <P>Side by side with that lack of commitment to the capital investment programme in building and construction there is a lack of commitment in the Finance Bill towards the necessary incentives across the board to stimulate investment not just in the building and construction industry but in various other areas and particularly in the area of small and medium sized firms.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance may say that in Chapter III of his Bill he is making an effort in that direction.  From section 11 to section 27 we have over 21 pages of the most cumbersome drafting.  A new provision is introduced for an exemption tax relief where a person invests up to £25,000 a year over a three year period in a manufacturing enterprise.  Here is the first classic limitation.  It is narrowed down to manufacturing enterprises, and no more than that, when in fact future employment in modern societies generally, and not just in Ireland, will be in services whether building and construction services, hotel and tourism services or other productive services.</P>
    <P>The whole pattern of investment throughout the world, and not just in Ireland, relates to manufacturing industry. There is a reduction in the number of people employed and a greater emphasis on machinery in regard to the improvement and expansion of manufacturing enterprises.  Straight away the Minister is narrowing down this relief to a small, though important, segment where there will be the lowest job increase possibilities.  Most of the cumbersome drafting later on in the Bill is designed to ensure that that narrowed down version of the incentive is implemented.</P>
    <P>Why did the Government, through the Minister for Finance, not get out of their neutral stance, or neutral corner, make an act of faith and say, &ldquo;We will give this <Col N="1189" /> incentive, income tax relief up to £25,000 a year, right across the board, right across the whole range of industry and services&rdquo; and, if necessary, build into it, as suggested by Deputy Durkan, some form of extra incentive whether by way of grant, or interest subsidy, or further tax incentive related to employment and jobs?</P>
    <P>If and when unfortunate applicants qualify, after wading through the sections in Chapter III of the Bill, they will be confined to a narrowed down manufacturing industry sector and that will be largely related to taking on more machines and more equipment without the necessary emphasis on employment. The incentive does not apply to the basic service areas where the new jobs will be, where the new expansion in jobs will be, and where the future employment will be.</P>
    <P>I will mention two <i>en passant</i>.  There are a number of other growing service areas in our community, but the two big ones are the building and construction industry and the tourist industry, both of which are deliberately excluded.  The idea is right but, unfortunately, it was truncated and cut down by narrow considerations and by an excessive attention to the importance of ensuring that there is no avoidance aspect involved. They should have experimented with a provision which applied across the board to all industries and all services, tried it for a three-year period to see how it worked.</P>

      <P>What criteria is being used in deciding which schools should qualify for a disadvantaged areas grant? I ask the question because Scoil Aiséirí Críost An Rí, which is in my own area, has not qualified for the grant although this is a disadvantaged area and despite the fact that all the other schools in the locality have qualified for this grant. There is an unemployment rate of 37 per cent of the fathers of the children in this school and in addition there are many other statistics to justify the application of the grant to this area.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is asking a question about a specific school.  That is a separate question to which I cannot reply at this stage.  However, if he wishes to have any specific school examined for the purposes of the grant, I shall accommodate him.  The position is that the £500,000 available this year will not be sufficient to meet all the demands that have been made.  The criteria used in determining which schools should benefit were the pupil-teacher ratio in the context of its hampering effective schooling, poor environment, a factor that would relate to buildings, place space and so on, unemployment, vandalism, poor attendance of children, difficulty in controlling <Col N="1192" /> them and lack of community support.  In addition it was recognised that there should be a realistic representation of boys and girls in mixed schools, that there should be a fair geographic spread, that there should be a fair representation of various sizes of schools and that there should be included a number of schools where staff efforts have been relatively successful and others where morale is at a low ebb.  In the case of a boys' school and a girls' school that are connected physically or otherwise, both are to be selected and where a junior school and a senior school exist together, the particular circumstances of the area are to dictate which school should be selected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>With regard to the provision of additional classrooms in national schools, and the improvement of classrooms which are considered to be inadequate, the Rules for National Schools make provision on the application of school authorities for granting financial assistance towards the cost of building, enlarging or otherwise improving such schools.  Currently my Department, with the Commissioners of Public Works, are dealing with approximately 800 applications for financial assistance towards the cost of building and enlarging national schools, and a similar number of applications for financial assistance towards improvement of existing national school accommodation.  In the current financial year a sum of £28.75 million is being made available for these purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the Department a policy in regard to providing conventional-type classrooms by way of additional accommodation rather than supplying pre-fab buildings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1194" />
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the pre-fab buildings were provided before I took office. They were usually provided in cases of emergency.  It is the policy of the Department to endeavour, in so far as possible within the resources available, to provide conventional-type accommodation for primary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister say that that is the policy of the Department. Would he accept that in many instances when a prefabricated classroom arrives in a small two-teacher school people feel that that school will be closed down or amalgamated with a larger school?  Is he aware that that is the feeling of the communities in rural areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that could very well be the feeling and that those feelings in some instances may be justified.  The fact is that prefabricated buildings are provided in many schools where urgent extensions are needed to cater for increased numbers at primary level and it would not be in any way right to take a blanket view that the provision of pre-fabricated buildings would mean the school was to close down.  I accept that there are isolated incidents of where the prefabricated buildings are provided and it is an indication that the schools will be amalgamated with other schools.  This is a very rare occurrence.</P>

I have not the dates when each application was made.  I want to emphasise the extra resource rather than talking of special classes.  I am advised that in the best interests of such pupils they should not be confined to special classes at second level but should be integrated into as much of the general school activity as is appropriate.  I want to leave it to the school management to decide the extent of such integration in the light of their own circumstances.</P>

      <P>Cuirfidh mé an cheist i mBéarla mar sílim go mbeidh deacracht ag an Aire le Gaeilge Chonnachtach. Would the Minister of State accept that the present position in relation to providing new schools in rural areas is not satisfactory as many boards of management are slow in having the proper facilities provided for children? Would he accept that it is time for the Department to take some initiative in having proper facilities provided in areas where schools are badly in need of replacement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedure in the Department is that where adequate or <Col N="1197" /> extra accommodation is needed the school management board in the normal way make an application to the Department. The procedure is adopted, particularly in primary schools, that the Board of Works are asked to assess the accommodation available and it goes through the normal channels.  I believe the Deputy is asking that the Department should take the initiative in carrying out a survey.  As I have answered previous questions in relation to the same subject, it is my experience that school management boards are not slow in pointing out to the Department any inadequate facilities. I do not see any reason to change the existing system which has operated pretty successfully in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State accept that there are many areas where reports have been sent in by county medical officers in relation to the condition of schools and that this position continues because there are some boards of management who do not take any action?  Is it not a fact that it is most unfair having children attending schools which are in very bad condition?  In those areas the Department should at least take some initiative in trying to provide proper facilities for the children.</P>

      <P>I accept that we have poor accommodation in some cases at primary level.  We have over 800 applications on hand at the moment for extensions to primary schools, new schools replacements or alterations of some kind.  I do not see the advantage at this stage in the Department carrying out a survey of all the primary schools available and recommending changes.  We are fairly well aware of the condition of most of the schools because we are kept informed by the boards of management.  It is possible, as the Deputy says, that there could be a board of management who are not very active but if they are not the teachers or the parents will take action.  I assure the Deputy that the local public representatives are well informed as I am well aware.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 9 inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major study on the education of deaf and hearing impaired children was that published in 1972 in the report entitled <i>The Education of Children who are Handicapped by Impaired Hearing.</i> These children are catered for in five special schools, three of which are in Dublin, one in Cork and one in Limerick. The Dublin schools provide residential placement for children from the provinces as well as catering on a daily basis for pupils from the general area of Dublin.  In addition, my Department operate a visiting teacher service which provides special instruction at the pre-school stage and which assists pupils who suffer from hearing impairment who are attending ordinary national schools.  The <Col N="1199" /> total number of pupils in the special schools for the hearing impaired is 845.</P>
    <P>The present arrangements permit of a concentration of expertise and facilities for imparting specialised language and other skills and I am advised that such arrangements are in the best interests of the majority of the pupils.  Suitable travel arrangements are made to enable residential pupils to spend week-ends at home.  There is no evidence available to me that parents, in general, are not satisfied that the present provision is reasonable and of high standard.</P>
    <P>Two local organisations have recently made application for the establishment of special classes attached to local national schools which would cater for hearing impaired children.  These applications are under consideration in my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the two local organisations I presume one of them the Minister is referring to is from the midlands?  Has the Minister or his Department given any special consideration to setting up a pilot scheme in some midland area for a period of 12 months or two years.  What would be the possibility of having such a scheme looked at? What would be the possibility of monitoring such a scheme over a specific period to see what progress had been made and also to see if such a scheme should be extended to other areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>We are considering a scheme of that kind in the context of the Offaly application.  Whilst I can understand the concern of some parents in regard to putting their children on a bus or train to travel to Dublin, I am advised by experts that where you have a centre available with all the equipment and all the facilities requisite a much better educational service can be provided for these children than might be provided in smaller localised centres.  The position is being examined and I hope in the not too distant future to communicate a decision to those concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider the problem of the four year old <Col N="1200" /> child being put on a bus in some part of rural Ireland on a Sunday evening to travel to Dublin?  Would he consider that problem from the point of view of the child's ability to communicate?  Because of the importance of the whole issue, would he try to expedite his decision and, in coming to his decision, would he take into account the possible traumatic effect of this kind of travel on such children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already said I will take all of that into account.  I am aware of that in a minority of cases.  As I said, I am having the whole matter examined and, when that examination is completed, I shall communicate with the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that very young children of four, five and six years of age are travelling on these trains on Sunday night and some of these young children are not able to cope.  In the case of a particular family in the Athlone area a mother has asked the Midland Health Board if they will allow her to bring her children by car on Monday morning rather than issue her with a free ticket and have them travel by train on Sunday night.  I will give the Minister the details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is now talking about a completely different matter but if the Deputy gives me the particulars I shall have the matter examined.  I understand there are cases where parents are concerned about putting their children on buses or trains but what we have been talking about are the facilities available. According to all the experts better facilities are available at centralised schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister says about the experts and the specialisation in some of the larger centres. That is highly desirable but would the Minister consider extending such facilities to major towns in particular areas where equivalent expertise and specialisation could be provided?  I have become aware of the problem within the last nine months or so but I believe all this travel has a traumatic effect on these young children, particularly if the children have any disability from the point of view of communication.  From that point of view I would ask the Minister to extend the scheme on a county or regional basis to cater for particular catchment areas?</P>

Their findings and recommendations are confidential and, accordingly, it would not be appropriate for me to divulge them.  Arising from replies given by the Minister for Health and by the Minister for Agriculture to Parliamentary Questions No. 3 of 1 December 1983 and No. 8 of 29 February 1984 respectively, the Deputy will be aware of certain further investigations which have been and are being carried out.  In addition, a report prepared by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards for Tipperary (South Riding) County Council on the efficiency of the solvent incinerator at the factory plant has been completed and is being examined by the local authority.

The position now is that all but two tests are available but specific work is being carried out by the Department of Health and by the local health board.

      <P>As far as the Government committee are concerned, the area which is likely to remain outstanding longest is the work of the Department of Health who are engaged on an epidemiological study on human health patterns in the Ballydine district. That involves an analysis of the complaints of patients visiting their doctors in that area contrasted with a control area. The information available is that 300 consultations in each areas are required in order for the survey to be statistically significant.  It will be some time before that is available but all the other work is either complete or almost complete. What I or any other Member of the House can say is constrained to a degree because there is a court case pending in this matter and no actions by the Government or the committee reporting to the Government can interfere with the progress of the court case.</P>

      <P>The committee referred to consisted of the Minister for Labour, The Minister for Health, the Minister for Industry and Energy, the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for the Environment.  That committee presented their interim report to the Government on 7 July.  As I indicated in my earlier reply, the findings of that committee are confidential but the Deputy will be aware, as this is not the first time this has been debated in the House, that a number of tests are ongoing.  I have reported to the House on where the tests stand today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that and I have put down a number of questions regarding this matter.  The Minister says that this report is confidential, presumably to the Members of this House as well as everybody else.  Is the Minister not further contributing to the difficulties pointed out by other Deputies by referring to secret reports?  Could the Minister ask the Government if these details can be made available to the Deputies concerned?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister for Agriculture answered a similar question he informed the House that the results of the tests then available gave no indication of any exceptional animal health problems in the animals from which the specimens were taken.  The findings are not unusual and do not in themselves conform to any specific disease pattern which might be indicative of any unusual animal health problem on the farm in question.  There is a case pending in the High Court in which the plaintiff is the farm owner in question and the defendant is the factory in question. The issues which will arise at that <Col N="1208" /> court hearing obviously relate to matters which were considered by the Government Department and, in those circumstances, it would be quite improper for me to say anything.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>From the outset the Government have regarded this as a matter of urgency and have approached it on that basis.  There were many tests to be carried out, some in this country, some in the United Kingdom and some in Sweden. They are all nearly completed.  The remaining matter outstanding is the health survey to which I referred and that will be analysed and completed as soon as possible.  However, I have indicated there are statistical constraints.  There is no point in undertaking such an exercise if the results are not statistically valid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the Minister is awaiting the report and further details of the study by the Department of Health which will be of considerable importance. In his reply the Minister said that the results gave no indication of any specific disease.  If that is so the question must be asked, why did approximately 20 cattle die?  Is anyone in a position to say what caused the deaths if there was no specific disease?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>It was because of the public unease that has been in a sense ventilated by Deputy Enright that the Government embarked on this task.  The Department of Agriculture, co-operating with Mr. Hanrahan, slaughtered and had samples taken of a number of animals, some cattle and some pigs.  Some were <Col N="1209" /> the property of Mr. Hanrahan and others were the property of neighbours.  The total was seven cattle and one pig.  They were subjected to the most exhaustive examination in the State Laboratory here, in the laboratory of the Government Chemist in London and in the Department of Clinical Chemistry in the College of Veterinary Medicine in Uppsala in Sweden.  The net result of all those tests was there were no unusual findings to report.  What was found does not, in itself, conform to any specific disease pattern.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Agriculture indicated the findings in summary, that the results then available gave no indications of any exceptional animal health problem.  I have repeated that today.  To go beyond that would be to answer the specific question that will have <Col N="1210" /> to be addressed by the judge of the High Court who hears the case.  The issue that judge will have to consider is whether there were, as alleged, deaths and health problems in the area in question and whether, as alleged, those problems were attributable to the actions of this factory.

      <P>My understanding is that copies were made available to Deputies.  Following a Government decision to that effect, the report was laid before the House.  If for some reason or other some Deputies have not got copies I will guarantee to make them available. Specifically I will see to it that Deputy Daly gets a copy within the next 24 hours. The commission's report was very comprehensive. In all there are up to 70 individual recommendations.  Those recommendations were described by those who participated in the committee as being a negotiated consensus.  The Government have indicated their determination to study the report very speedily, to invite comments from those who have made submissions and from other interested parties, and, following that, to consider what action may be appropriate.  The whole tone and tenor of the report was to emphasise that this is not solely a legal problem, that we should not always look for more regulations, ever more stringently enforced.  The major message of the report was that safety at work begins in the workplace and the report is as much directed to management and workers as it is to Government.  In concentrating on the Government's response we should not ignore the fact that others have been addressed by the commission and they must respond also.</P>

Do I take it that the Government intend to have another round of communication, consultations and invitations to people to discuss an issue which has been dealt with by the commission?  Is this not a further delaying tactic by the Government to avoid taking the necessary legislative action to deal with the serious issues raised in the report?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have suggested that perhaps it would be appropriate to give a period of two or three months to those affected by the report to allow them an opportunity to comment and to put their views.  While <Col N="1212" /> that time is available to the interested bodies, the Government will not be standing idly by.  They will analyse what are the legislative and administrative implications and what structural changes would be required to give effect to the commission's report.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1214" /> I must emphasise here that I am speaking about accidents which have been reported to my Department.  The recent report of the Commission of Inquiry on Safety, Health and Welfare at Work has argued with some conviction that &ldquo;reported accidents&rdquo; are not a reliable index of our safety performance.  Our reporting system does not capture information on all accidents; many accidents are not reported; and we have not developed the kind of incidence, frequency or severity rates to enable us to establish trends over time, weighted by reference to the number of people at work.</P>
    <P>A reasonable assumption is that the pattern of accident reporting is improving according as the provisions of the Safety in Industry Act are better known and implemented.  This may go some way to explaining the 1982 data.  But we need better data and better application of statistical techniques to identify whether variations are random fluctuations or are truly significant.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the <i>Construction and Property News</i> of February 1984 stated that there was a record of seven fatal accidents and 191 more non-fatal accidents last year compared to the previous year?  Will the Minister agree that those figures are disturbing? Is the Minister satisfied that industrial inspectors are fully effective in carrying out inspections and in the spreading of safety advice?</P>

      <P>Before we start a debate on statistics I should like to make one comment with which I am sure <Col N="1215" /> all Members will agree, that accident rates and trends are far too high and that many of the accidents that occur are preventable. I should like to say something about the statistics.  Deputy Leonard referred to the number of fatal accidents and I should like to tell the House that one of the pleasing trends in recent years is the fact that the number of fatalities has decreased gradually each year.  In 1979 there were 32; in 1980, 30; in 1981 21; in 1982, 16 and in 1983, 15.  The 1983 statistic is still provisional and I will not be in a position to confirm it for some time yet.  I do not want any Member to think that that indicates a degree of complacency. I prefaced my remarks by saying that there are too many accidents, many of which could have been prevented.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that when the <i>Construction and Property News</i>, who are deeply worried about the accident rate in the construction industry, expressed concern at the number of fatal accidents it is time the Department looked at the reason for this particularly when there are fewer people at work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the number of accidents is appallingly high and that many of those accidents can be and should have been avoided.  There is some reason for satisfaction in the decrease in the number of fatal accidents. In regard to the fluctuations from year to year, I should like to point out to the Deputy that the Safety in Industry Act, 1980, makes some changes in the methods of reporting.  To some extent it tightens up the obligation to report an accident and that may account for some of the statistical increase.  In addition successive Ministers and Ministers of State and successive members of the inspectorate in the Department have been stressing the obligation to report.  It may be that that message is getting across also.</P>

      <P>I was pleased to note that the Department have authorised the appointment of more inspectors and officers to investigate these matters.  I should <Col N="1216" /> like to ask the Minister if a survey has been carried out in regard to the industries where the accident rate appears to be higher than the national average. Have the Department carried out an investigation where there is a higher accident rate to see if firms are not complying with the regulations?</P>

      <P>The statistics published annually contain an industry by industry breakdown.  That information is available.  The Deputy asked if we could identify particular black spots and give special attention to them and I should like to tell him that we have taken a policy decision to try to concentrate our inspection manpower potential on such areas which appear to be most at risk or which in the past had a bad track record.</P>

      <P>As the person who steered the 1980 Act through the House while Minister for Labour, I should like to welcome the Minister's comments on the improvement in the reporting technique.  Is the Minister concerned that there appears to be a contradiction in what he has said in regard to the 1980 Act and the report of the Commission regarding the danger of inaccuracy in the reporting of statistics on accidents? Does the Minister regard the doubt expressed by the Commission as serious and as a matter that should be tackled immediately to ensure that if there is a doubt about statistics subsequent to the 1980 Act something should be done immediately to eliminate it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to tell the House that even if the reporting techniques were met 100 per cent that would not be a satisfactory situation because we would be reporting only those accidents that give rise to a serious consequence, fatal or three days loss of work, depending on the industry.  The act of carelessness may be equal, or worse, without having those serious consequences. We do not get a report on all the individual acts or omissions within an industry that could be the concern of the people charged with improving safety.</P>

      <P>I do not think we have to get too academic about this subject and deal with the risks that may take place.  Will the Minister agree that as long as there is one death or one accident we must strive for improvement?  I do not see an improvement if we have one death in a year.  If there is a doubt about the more serious accident resulting in a loss of work for three days or more or up to a fatal accident, in regard to the accuracy of the information as a result of the 1980 Act then we have a serious situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse the comments of the Deputy that there is not a reason to be satisfied as long as even one fatality occurs.  As far as the Government are concerned there is no acceptable level of accidents at work.  In regard to the question about the adequacy of reporting procedures I should like to state that the evidence from the trends would seem to indicate that the Safety in Industry Act is working and that the reporting procedures as required by the Act are being improved.  In part that is a reflection on the degree of attention that successive administrations have placed in publicity and speeches in telling people that they must report.  I hope there will be further improvement in that area.  I readily acknowledge the contribution of the two Deputies opposite in this area.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gerry Collins asked for permission to raise a question on a court case yesterday in Northern Ireland.  The normal way to put questions to Ministers is on four-day notice.  An exception is made whereby questions may be asked on private notice of shorter than four days.  The Chair has a discretion.  Certain criteria are set down and one condition is that the matter is of great urgent importance.  Inherent in that is that it cannot wait, that something would go wrong if the normal procedure were followed.  The Chair must be careful to see that the regulations are complied with.  Otherwise the procedure would get out of hand and there would be more questions on private notice than on normal notice.  The Chair considered the question put forward by Deputy Collins and I regret very much that I had to come to the conclusion that it does not meet the criterion of urgency.</P>

    <Title>EEC Council of Ministers: Statement by Minister for Agriculture.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a statement to the House on the results of the Council of Agriculture Ministers which was held on 30-31 March.  The Council reached a comprehensive agreement on the adjustment of the Common Agricultural Policy which had been under discussion since last summer and on the price arrangements for 1984-85.</P>
      <P>The main difficulty for us related to the super-levy on milk.  Farmers here rightly saw the proposal put forward by the Commission as directly threatening their viability and indeed most people outside of agriculture saw it as having serious repercussions for the whole economy.</P>
      <P>The Commission had proposed that a super-levy should apply to milk deliveries in excess of the 1981 level plus 1 per cent. The choice of this base was in line with earlier arrangements from 1980 onwards on the control of milk production, which were formalised in 1982 by the adoption of a production threshold for the Community for 1981 deliveries plus 0.5 per cent a year, the estimated growth in consumption. The cost of disposing of production over the level would be recouped from producers.  The threshold for 1983 was therefore 1981 deliveries plus 1 per cent, which amounted to 97.2 million tonnes for the entire Community.  Actual production in the Community in 1983 was in fact some 6.5 million tonnes above that level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the cost involved were to be paid by producers, it would have necessitated an increase of more than 6 per cent in the co-responsibility levy or a price reduction of more than 12 per cent.  In those circumstances the Commission felt that the <Col N="1234" /> super-levy was a more acceptable and effective method of enforcing the production threshold, and controlling milk production which is running at some 20 per cent above the Community's internal requirements.</P>
    <P>For Ireland the Commission's proposal would have meant a production cut of almost 14 per cent on our 1983 level.  This was clearly unacceptable in itself and in addition all future expansion would be ruled out.  Following an unprecedented campaign of persuasion by the Taoiseach, other Ministers and myself, our partners accepted that we had a special case on the super-levy but they found great difficulty in accepting that it should be met by concessions in regard to milk production.  Structural aid to us was their preferred solution.  Our difficulties became more pronounced when at a Council meeting on 13 March the other member states agreed to a base of 1981 deliveries plus 1 per cent with some concessions to Italy and Luxembourg. We refused to go along with this agreement and continued to maintain our demand for special treatment.</P>
    <P>However, after some very difficult negotiations, we succeeded in reaching an agreement that gave us a basic entitlement of our 1983 level of deliveries, plus more than 4.6 per cent.  In addition, it was agreed that not only could this entitlement not be reduced in future years but that we would have priority in regard to the distribution of any additional quantities which become available, for example, from production shortfalls or market improvement.</P>
    <P>Against the background of the Community's serious financial difficulties and the surplus situation in the milk market, the arrangement achieved for this country is remarkably favourable.  It starts us off on a basis well above that applicable in most of the Community.  This is a satisfactory outcome indeed and goes well beyond what seemed possible throughout most of the negotiations.  This is borne out by the reactions in other EEC member states, where public comments are unanimous in regarding the deal as exceptionally favourable to this country while accepting also that the unique <Col N="1235" /> importance of dairying in the Irish economy warranted some special treatment for us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that we can be well satisfied with the outcome.  In the context of the massive oversupply of dairy products and of the very considerable sacrifices made by most other member states it is certainly a good result.  The latter aspect needs to be fully appreciated. Very real cutbacks in milk production have been accepted by the majority of other member states.  For instance, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom have to cut back to 6 per cent or 7 per cent below their 1983 levels of production.  These cuts have understandably been very strongly criticised by farmers in those countries.  In those circumstances it showed considerable generosity on the part of my colleagues in the Council to agree to allow further expansion in Ireland.  That they did so is a tribute to their political courage and to the extent to which they accepted the strong case we had made to them over the past nine months or so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Expressed as a percentage in the marketing year 1985-86 the countries will take cuts as follows: Denmark's milk output will be reduced by 6.7 per cent; Germany's milk output will be reduced by 7.7 per cent; Holland's output will be reduced by 7.2 per cent and the United Kingdom's output will be reduced by 7.8 per cent, a sizeable percentage reduction.</P>
      <P>It is up to us to make the best use of the opportunity given to us to produce milk of right quality in the right production pattern and to process it with a greater eye to the dictates of the commercial markets rather than to the convenience of intervention.  That point was graphically illustrated in this House by Deputy Joe Walsh four or five weeks ago when he spoke about the incorrect methods of marketing we have adopted and opting for two main commodity products rather than diversification.  That aspect is something about which we will shortly be talking to all concerned in the industry. More immediately we need to talk about and decide on the best use of the quota we have been given.  The precise details of operating the system will need to be worked out by my Department in consultation with farmers and their co-operatives over the next week or two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other parts of the new dairy arrangements are also favourable to us.  After allowing for an increase of 1 per cent in the co-responsibility levy, there will be a net price increase for milk of about 1.3p per gallon.  The Commission had proposed to suspend intervention buying of skim milk powder for part of the year but that proposal was dropped in the final settlement.  Part of the consumer subsidy on butter has been retained, despite the Commission's original proposal to abolish it.  The retention of an element of consumer subsidy, together with a change in the intervention price, means that the retail price of butter here will be affected only by the green pound change which I will be coming to later.  The overall <Col N="1238" /> result will be a price increase of about 4p per pound.</P>
    <P>In the beef sector there will be a net increase in the support price of between 3 per cent and 4 per cent.  The amount of the United Kingdom variable premium on beef is to be reduced and a clawback applied to beef exports from the United Kingdom.  The latter will be particularly valuable in restoring the competitive position of our meat exporters who had been at a disadvantage as compared with factories in Northern Ireland and Britain. From statements made by the meat trade I believe this should generate up to 500 extra jobs in our meat factories.</P>

      <P>These arrangements on the calf premium and the variable premium were agreed with much difficulty at an early hour last Saturday and the opinion of the European Parliament has to be obtained before the necessary implementing regulations can be made by the Council.</P>
      <P>Also in the beef sector, the carcase classification grid will come into force on a Community-wide basis on 9 April. After a phasing-in period identical prices will be paid right across the Community for beef of a given quality sold to intervention. This will mean better prices for higher beef qualities and will provide an incentive to producers and processors to turn out a really top quality product.  In the new situation following the entry into force of the community beef grid, the separate régime for stopping and starting intervention that has been in force here up to now will end and we will be on the same basis in that regard as the other member states.</P>

    <P>For sheepmeat there is a net price increase of 5 per cent.  The clawback of the United Kingdom variable premium <Col N="1239" /> on this product for exports to the continental member states continues and is to include seasoned lamb which has been causing us a particular problem.  Advance payments of the ewe premium will continue to be made in disadvantaged areas although the Commission had proposed to abolish advances completely.</P>
    <P>As regards other products there is a net price increase of 2.3 per cent for pigmeat cereals and sugar beet.  Also, the basis fior calculating MCAs on pigmeat will be changed from 1 November next to reduce significantly the MCAs on that product.  In the cereals sector the Council have agreed on a mandate for the Commission to negotiate with third countries on stabilisation on corn gluten imports. As Deputies know, cereals substitute imports have been causing a grave distortion in the market place and have been largely responsible for the huge milk surpluses which have been produced in the Community in recent years.  It is about time somebody did something about this and I am glad to say we were the first to do it.</P>

      <P>As Deputies are aware, Ireland has consistently sought over many years to have MCAs eliminated because of the difficulties and distortions they cause.  The recent agreement represents an important step forward in this direction.  As well as providing for sizeable reductions in current positive MCAs in Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, it provides for further reductions in January next and ensures that no fixed positive MCAs will be created in future following changes in monetary parities.  The current reductions are <Col N="1240" /> counterbalanced by new negative MCAs which are being eliminated at the beginning of the 1984-85 market year for each product.  The result for Ireland is that a change in our green rate raises Irish support prices by 3.4 per cent above what they otherwise would have been.</P>
      <P>The average price increase arising from the package is about 2.5 per cent in Irish pounds when both the support price changes and the green rate adjustment are taken into account.  The overall gain to the agricultural sector can be put at £250 million, including the very substantial saving from not having to apply the super-levy on the same basis as most other member states.</P>

    <P>The agreement follows many long days and nights of what were probably the most difficult negotiations that an Irish Minister for Agriculture has ever conducted. We had a vital and essential national interest in the milk sector and we made this clear.  We also had a vital <Col N="1241" /> interest in the survival of the Common Agricultural Policy and that is what was at stake this year.  Even as things now stand, there will be serious financial difficulties in running the Common Agricultural Policy but we now know that the CAP can continue.  That is probably the most important outcome of all the negotiations.</P>
    <P>Our main aims in the negotiation have been achieved.  We have obtained satisfactory settlement on the super-levy issue.  We have seen steps taken to remove distortions in the beef and lamb trade, to eliminate positive MCAs and to further the process of stabilising imports of cereal substitutes.

In that context I should like to pay a special tribute to the work of the chairman of the Council of Agriculture Ministers, Mr. Michel Rocard, the French Minister of Agriculture, who did fantastic work.  If it had not been for his tireless efforts over the past few months we could now be facing the collapse of the CAP, with all that would entail for Ireland and the other member states.  The French delegation and the French nation in general were very helpful to us, including President Mitterrand and all the French Ministers and negotiators.  The bulk of the other Ministers and other delegates involved in the talks at the end of the day also proved to be extremely helpful to us. We did have considerable resistance in the course of the negotiations from three or four countries.</P>

      <P>We must draw from the experience of the negotiations over the past nine months some conclusions about the way our agriculture must go.  It is clear that as regards the future of the CAP the winds have changed and are blowing in a certain direction and this is not in the direction of maintaining open-ended guarantees.  We must lessen our reliance on community support systems. Our farmers and processors will have to relate more closely to what commercial markets want and need, not to what can be sold easily into intervention. That coincides with what Deputy Walsh was saying some weeks ago.  We have obtained a satisfactory base level for our milk production, especially taking account of the flexibility that is possible within each co-operative, but in the longer term we need to spread our agricultural production over a more diversified <Col N="1243" /> range.  The Government cannot dictate to farmers or to traders but they can suggest that they should look more to their long-term than to their short-term interests.  Irish agriculture has to get into the position where we will be less vulnerable to changes at Community level and better able to use the commercial opportunities that exist.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Let us put the failed super-levy negotiations into perspective.  Ireland produces about 4.8 per cent of the total milk output of the European Community.  For centuries the British cheap food policy denied us the possibility of producing to our natural God given potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish people voted by an overwhelming majority to join the Common Market under major economic inducements and with benefit to our agriculture, recognising at the same time that accession would also entail losses in the industrial <Col N="1246" /> sphere.  We have paid the price in our industries.  We are now faced with an extreme penalty in our agricultural industry as well.</P>
    <P>To realise how unjust this is Deputies should ponder for a moment on the cause of the problem of dairy surpluses which the Community admittedly has.  The main cause lies in the factory farming of such countries as the Netherlands and West Germany, where monetary anomalies and a higher milk price give them an unfair advantage through cheap food imports for boosting milk yields and output. It is a well-known fact that cows are fed four times the volume of concentrate feed that ours are.  Now that they have created a problem, Ireland has to pay the penalty, a penalty doubly severe because we have not reached our potential on low cost production, while they have little room for a further increase in yield per cow.</P>
    <P>For a number of years I would expect a normal increase of up to 8 per cent per annum in the volume of Irish milk output. The super-levy deal condemns Ireland to a permanent penalty and relegates our farmers to being the poor relation of Europe.  The cowardice of the Government is shown in their failure to use their full powers and options within the Community.</P>
    <P>Our party have rightly suggested that Ireland, which is behind the countries of Europe in standards of milk yields, should be allowed to develop until the average European standards are reached.  This is mere commonsense.  We suggested alternative ways and means of how the surpluses in Europe could be attacked.  The Government seemed to be unwilling to put forward these proposals at Council meetings.  It has been proved beyond a shadow of doubt that their diplomatic missions were counter-productive. The Commission and the other member states were totally unaware of our vital national interest.  This has been proved by the failure of the Minister to get a total exemption for us, a commitment which he gave several times in this House and also at his own party's Ard Fheis last year when he said that nothing less than total exemption for this country <Col N="1247" /> would be accepted.  Hollow words from the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>It is also important to point out that our farmers need the incentive for extra production to offset their losses in income.  With the imposition of this super-levy the Minister has blocked any possibility of increased income or increased production for agriculture. This is disastrous in more ways than one.</P>
    <P>What of the future?  There is no guarantee on output beyond this year.  There is no guarantee on price beyond this year. Surely this means ruination for the Irish dairy farmer.  Over the past year and a half we have lost a great deal of our pride and ability as an agricultural based industry.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I should like to point out a few more details with regard to milk production.  There is a 2p per gallon delay in intervention payments. The Minister gave the bad example to the European Commission.  There will be 1p per gallon increase in the co-responsibility levy.  This is now increased to 1.9p per gallon.  There will be approximately 2p per gallon super-levy on all milk delivered to creameries in the 1984-85 year.  There will be a .3p per gallon disease levy and a further .5p per gallon Bord Bainne milk development levy, making a total of 5.8p per gallon or near enough to 6p per gallon of a decrease for the average dairy farmer.</P>
      <P>This is not the full story.  Increased costs this year will amount to a further 5p per gallon.  Fertilisers will mean an increase of 2p per gallon, feed stuffs an increase of 2p per gallon and other incidental increases will mean 1p per gallon. The total effect is a reduction of 11p per gallon on 1983 prices or £3,500 for the average dairy farmer.  One can ask the question what happened to the Athens offer?  In my opinion this was thrown away by the Government.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Let us take a look at this year's package from another angle.  The benefit, according to the Department of Agriculture, is in the region of £50 million.  If we compare this with three years ago, we find that Deputy Ray MacSharry, then Minister for Agriculture, <Col N="1254" /> negotiated for this country benefits of £250 million.  This is quite a contrast. This is the first year ever of a drop in farm prices of 1 per cent, that is, when one takes away the green pound devaluation. This is a far cry from Deputy Brian Lenihan's package of 11 per cent in price increases and Deputy Ray MacSharry's 14 per cent price package.  Then the Minister can talk about inflation irrespective of what has happened.  Surely the ballyhoo which took place at Dublin Airport when the Minister returned and the people who participated in that circus must surely be out of touch with the rural scene.  Certainly this does not go down well with our farmers.  It may be appropriate and more in keeping with the scene at a tea party in Dublin 4.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The Minister has brought back a drop of 6 per cent in milk prices.  As I have already indicated, it is the first time that the price of milk has dropped since we joined the EEC.  That added to increased costs will mean a total drop of about 16 per cent this year in real farm income.  Again, I ask, what other sections of the Community are prepared to take this drop of income?  The Ministers argument that we got off lightly does not stand up to questioning. The super-levy is being imposed on this country on an average of 750 gallons per cow, while it is applying to an average yield of 1,005 gallons per cow in the Netherlands.  Is that equitable?  Is the whole Common Agricultural Policy being undermined in this exercise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1255" /> Let us look at other aspects of this package.  It is very peculiar that the Minister or the Department in their press release made no mention of the lime and the AI subsidy schemes, which were won for this country by Fianna Fáil Ministers for Agriculture.  Let us look at the reduction of the calf premium.  I remember last year the Minister was blowing his trumpet on retaining the AI and the lime subsidy which schemes, as I have already indicated, were won for this country by Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The Minister said the package was worth £50 million.  One must question the losses or the costs and offset this against what has been won.  The super-levy will cost £20 million in tax, the increased co-responsibility levy will cost £11 million, the loss of the lime and the AI subsidy, will cost £12 million, and the calf premium is down by £23 million.  If we add up all these figures we get a total of £57 million which is in fact a net loss of £7 million to our farmers as a result of the Minister's package. This does not take into account the millions of pounds lost in the undermining of confidence in farming.  The sum total is that our farmers will have a loss this year in real income of 15 per cent.</P>

      <P>The attendance of Deputies today appears to me to emphasise the importance of the agricultural industry.  I have rarely seen so many Deputies present in any debate as have turned up today for a debate on the agricultural <Col N="1256" /> industry.  It is peculiar to experience the power the farming lobby has.  Indeed that same lobby has a peculiar power in the media also.  I have certainly never seen so many Deputies present in this House.  Last week there were only three Deputies present for the debate on the Social Welfare Bill.  Great numbers of people in our society today are dependent on social welfare.  There are more people unemployed than there are people directly engaged in agriculture. I am making the point that to me there would appear to be a disproportionate lobby for the agricultural industry as opposed to other major sectors of our economy.  There is rarely if ever the same interest shown in manufacturing industry, in unemployment, social welfare, health or any of these other areas which affect very large sections of the population outside of the agricultural industry.</P>
      <P>Having said that I make the point that our working party are opposed to the super-levy as a means of ironing out the problems of Irish agriculture.  It must be said, however, that the Minister for Agriculture has made a significant achievement in negotiations in bringing back a 4.7 per cent increase in production for this year given the overriding opposition to him.  The most significant part of the Minister's speech was the last paragraph where he puts it clearly before the House that the days of the Common Agricultural Policy are numbered and so it is foolish and quite unreal for the Fianna Fáil Party to try to indicate that, if they were in Government, they would in some way retrieve the Common Agricultural Policy and that the gravy train which has existed for the last five years in regard to agriculture would in some way continue in the future.  Now that is just not on.</P>

I am simply making my views clear and I am entitled to give my views.  Our agricultural produce has been sold to the Soviet Union at very low prices.  That is economic lunacy on our part and on the part of the EEC.

He also said the Government cannot dictate to farmers or traders how they ought to organise.  Now if a Government has any function at all it is to ensure that any industry which has such an enormous effect on the lives of so many in the State is properly organised.

The Common Agricultural Policy did not cause the present financial crisis in the EEC; that was caused by the reluctance of a number of countries to get down to the financial realities of the Community and to raise the ceiling on expenditure above 1 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another important aspect which is relevant to the Finance Bill has just been <Col N="1259" /> referred to by Deputy De Rossa, the whole question of the food processing industry which is linked to the milk production side of farming, especially the dairy industry.  In the last analysis the people who will be really hit by the super-levy curtailment are workers trying to hold on to their jobs in the huge and enterprising co-operative organisations which have built up here over the past ten or 15 years.  Organisations like Avonmore, Ballyclough, Nenagh, Mitchelstown, North Kerry and North Connacht have become substantial employers but their ability to maintain employment depends on rising and expanding milk production.  In many of these areas production is now running well ahead of 4 per cent or 5 per cent.  In Nenagh Co-operative production is expected to be around 10 per cent this year which is twice that of the super-levy exemption.</P>
    <P>That aspect is also relevant to section 39 of the Finance Bill which spells out what the Minister proposed in the budget in regard to the writing off of capital allowances on leased machinery and plant.  This provision has been used by the co-operatives to which I referred over the years as a means of leasing plant and equipment and making use of a leaselend type of operation in which they were enabled to write off against all income. The net effect of the arrangement that could be made by a co-operative or a firm going through an expansion programme in regard to machinery or further plant was that they were able to obtain credit or loan facilities at the rate of about 6 per cent.  Deputy Mac Giolla objected to the system on ideological grounds earlier on, and of course some criticism is justified as to the manner in which it was done.  It could have been done by way of direct State grant or subsidy or some other form of exemption, but the practice grew of allowing this type of leasing arrangement in regard to plant and machinery whereby a firm was able to extend and expand by borrowing at 5 per cent to 6 per cent, thereby saving about 5 per cent on the normal rate of 11 per cent to 12 per cent. The sum involved came to £200 million per year and it was channelled into firms <Col N="1260" /> and co-operatives who wished to expand or extend their plant and machinery, thereby giving more employment.</P>
    <P>Under this provision there is a withdrawal of moneys designed to provide facilities to industry to expand and that is a very serious matter.  Under section 39 the Minister is confining this loan to a grant-aided incentive package by one of the State industrial promotion agencies. It is limited purely to firms or co-operatives who get a grant from State aided agencies.  There is a very severe limitation here which is slightly irrational in that firms and co-operatives are being helped although they already get a State grant which may include loan facilities from the Industrial Credit Company as well as a grant from the IDA.  This seems unfair as people who are not participating in such a scheme cannot avail of this lending facility.  I hope the Minister for Finance will comment on this.</P>
    <P>I am also advised that, of the £200 million per year given out in this manner, a very small percentage will fall into the category of a grant-aided operation.  I should also like the Minister to comment on this because my information is that of the £200 million to which I have referred only something in the region of 5 to 10 per cent in effect will now be spent.  We are talking about £10 million to £20 million going into industry instead of £200 million because of the very small percentage of this money which will not be allocated to the limited number of grant-aided firms who are in the privileged position of being able to participate in this facility under section 39.</P>
    <P>This is all wrong when the whole thrust of our economic and social thinking must be in the direction of creating more jobs. A way already exists whereby £200 million could be pumped into job creation which would encourage the extension and expansion of firms through updating plant and equipment, providing additional plant and equipment and improving it.  Here we are withdrawing a large proportion of this facility which is being availed of at present by small and medium-sized firms.  Because of the restrictive nature of this section the facility will be confined to grant-aided operations: <Col N="1261" /> they are usually large operations and more than likely the small and medium-sized firms will be excluded. There are many such firms who do not participate in grant-aided schemes and who do not get any grants from the IDA and they are precisely the firms we should encourage.  It is my firm belief that if we wish to stimulate job activity and give employment to young people it will be done through the mechanism of small and medium-sized firms.  These are the firms who were benefiting under the scheme but under section 39 they will be excluded.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of which party are in Government, all of us must be united in devising means to stimulate more employment, whether by way of grant, loan, tax incentive, more credit facilities or reduced interest rates.  We should have a package of incentives and aids of that kind, in particular for small and medium-sized firms.  However, under section 39 we will do the reverse.  The scheme that exists at the moment should be expanded and developed, although not necessarily in the same form.  If Deputy Mac Giolla or any one else objects to the lending institutions participating in it and making a profit out of it, then let somebody else do the job.  I do not care if it is done by the ICC, the State or anyone else.  The principle of the scheme is excellent and it is regrettable that it will now be truncated and confined solely to grant-aided industries.</P>
    <P>Before we adjourned I referred to the earlier section of Chapter III of the Bill where the Minister's proposals are spelled out with regard to tax exemption for moneys up to £25,000 invested in manufacturing industry over a three-year period.  What is proposed is all right in its own way but it is limited to manufacturing industry and does not refer to the area of tourism, to the construction and building industry and to the major service industries.  Under section 39 there is also a provision to exclude service industries. Because the provision is confined to grant-aided industries, that means the whole range of service industries are excluded.  At the moment the IDA do not give grants to the service industries <Col N="1262" /> to which I am referring, namely those under the umbrella of tourism, building and construction.  Thus, the provision is limited to manufacturing industry under section 39 and also under Chapter III of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The trend in the more spohisticated countries is that jobs are going from the manufacturing sector into the service sector. That is an inevitable pattern of development which is a fact of economic and social life and this emerged in the Telesis Report where the IDA activities were examined.  We must remember that money invested in manufacturing industry is money invested in machines rather than in labour.  I accept it is welcome and necessary to give grants and loans to manufacturing industry.  We must have a sound productive base from the point of view of exports in particular and our industrial base, quite rightly, is export-oriented. I am not decrying the investment that is essential in this area so long as we remember that kind of investment will not create the jobs that are needed, High technology industries are necessary for Ireland but more and more of the finance, whether it be from the State, from lending institutions or from the firms themselves, will go into machinery and equipment rather than into personnel. The more efficient the manufacturing operation, the more machines will be required and, thus, less labour will be required.</P>
    <P>If we are thinking in terms of jobs we must think of a healthy and a vital service sector that can create the jobs.  I refer to the two obvious services here.  It is totally unlikely that the high labour content involved in the building and construction industry as well as in the hotel and restaurant industry will diminish. They will always be to a high degree labour intensive and we must keep that fact in mind.  It is a retrograde step, as is done in Chapter III of the Bill and also in section 39, to confine such tax exemptions to the manufacturing sector alone. It is looking backwards to a society that is rapidly disappearing and confining incentives and grants towards interest subsidisation of loans and other assistance <Col N="1263" /> to manufacturing industry that will use less on labour and more machinery. I recognise that is essential to have basic productive base but it must be balanced by a strong and expanding service industry and by people who have jobs.  If people do not have jobs there is little point in having a beautiful system whether it is a balanced budget or incentives and grants.</P>
    <P>There is a need to ensure that we recognise how important it is to help in every way the sectors in our economy that give employment and are likely to continue to do so.  The building and construction and tourist industries are going through a rough time but they are not getting any help from the Government in the capital investment sense.  Those industries are in dire need of positive support.  I accept that there is help in regard to VAT to the hotel industry but it is minuscule when one considers the problems of that industry. An avenue that has not been tried is a special scheme designed to help employers of labour.  Over and above a base year those who employ extra people should be given a tax exemption or a grant payment.  That should apply to service industries and, in particular, to the two industries I mentioned.</P>
    <P>Serious financial difficulties are being caused to the local authorities because of an inadequacy of Government funding this year.  Local authorities possess the skilled management and administration to stimulate desirable work activity immediately but because of a lack of finance from central funds are in the position that they must maintain a corps of skilled administrative and professional personnel who are not getting the funds to carry out any work.  In reality we are paying money to professional, technical and administrative staff to remain in their offices and not do any work.  The funds are not available for essential work in local authority areas.  If the Government were anxious to stimulate the economy and get desirable projects going it would be easy for them to avail of the expertise and professional administration that is available in the local authority area. Schemes of a productive nature could be <Col N="1264" /> commenced if the Government had the will to work out something positive between the Department of the Environment and local authorities.  There is no evidence of that type of thinking in anything that has emanated from the Government.</P>
    <P>We must get our priorities right.  The main priority now is the creation of jobs. We must create the right type of framework to do that by way of tax exemptions or by providing credit at a reasonable interest rate.  Those incentives should be given to stimulate economic activity and create jobs.  The small and medium size firms, service industries and local authorities are largely ignored in the Bill.  I appeal to the Minister to think again.  It is hardly likely that he will because he and the Government are wrapped up in a philosophy of complacency.  That was summed up by the Minister who boasted about bringing in a neutral budget.  We cannot have that type of thinking.  We do not want neutral budgets or neutral thinking.  We must have positive thinking. Fianna Fáil offer a positive alternative in regard to thinking and if the Government are anxious to persist in neutral thinking the place for them is on the Opposition benches so that positive people can take charge.  Those positive people do not think in terms of approaching vital problems such as unemployment in a neutral manner or adopting neutral attitudes to deal with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It was interesting to hear Deputy Lenihan's comments on section 84 lending.  I do not know if the Deputy read the section because agricultural and fishery co-ops are entitled to preferential share financing under the modifications of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that but that is separate to the point I was raising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lenihan spoke about the need for some relief or some incentive scheme to create jobs.  I have been most specific in this area.  I would like to see three specific measures for employment creation in the Bill.  I welcome a number of the measures in the <Col N="1265" /> Bill and I consider them as a recognition of some of the arguments put forward since the budget was introduced.  In regard to employment creation I should like to tell the House that in the United States there is a jobs tax credit scheme whereby employers get a credit on their tax liability, whether it is liability on the profits of the company, PAYE or PRSI, for every extra employee taken on.  It amounts to $1,800 in the first year and $900 in the second year.  I accept that the drafting of such a scheme would be complex but I suggest that next year the Finance Bill should contain a jobs tax credit scheme under which any employer will get relief in the first year amounting to £400 and in the second year £200 against any tax liabilities.  That would be an incentive to employers and coupled with the enterprise allowance and business expansion schemes, would represent a three-pronged approach towards employment creation.</P>
      <P>Another area that would be useful for employment creation would be an extension of the £10 per week corporation tax relief for extra employees in the service sector.  I do not know how much that would cost but such an extension would be useful.  Other countries are more open-minded about employment creation in the service sector.  I take the point that manufacturing industry, agriculture and so on, are primarily wealth producers. Employment in terms of numbers can be taken up in the service sector and this £10 per week extension of the corporation tax relief would be one way of doing it.</P>
      <P>In relation to employment creation tax reliefs, there must be some way to look for rebates on the PRSI contributions of employers.  If on foot of these three forms of relief people would take on workers for a minimum of a year or two years there could be avoidance of displacement of staff, people who get sick or have babies or retire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to the business expansion scheme provided for in Chapter III of the Bill.  Ironically, I have in front of me a statement I released on 15 January calling for an income tax relief scheme in the budget to generate new <Col N="1266" /> finance for industry from individual investors.  I am sorry that in paragraph 3 I suggested that the full income tax relief would be available for sums up to £25,000 per annum provided the investment would remain in the company for five years, and that eligibility of dividends and capital for tax relief would remain unaltered.  Having looked at the UK scheme in relation to business I have a number of queries.  First of all I welcome the Minister's initiative and it is very important that we appreciate the dual need in this area, particularly the need of small indigenous business which is starved for capital.  We saw evidence of this in a report commissioned by the NESC which states that there are many companies whose capital base is weak, they are over-burdened with loans whose repayment crippled their profitability in net terms.  The report stated that they need increased share capital.  At the same time, we see married people whose net incomes from £25,000 is not more than £6,500.  We have the dual problem of people being over-taxed on a personal basis and small companies who need finance.</P>
    <P>This scheme goes some way towards meeting that dual need.  I welcome the move to issue this benefit solely to non-quoted companies.  Companies that are on the Stock Exchange, through the issue of these new ordinary shares without the preferential rights, will be given the type of risk capital that they require.  The Small Businesses Committee, of which I am Chairman, have a proposal, which I hope will get due regard, to establish on the Stock Exchange a small businesses division whereby equity can be raised in that way.</P>
    <P>I have a number of queries in relation to Chapter III.  Is there any restriction on the company's capital structure?  In other words, does the tax relief equity that goes into the company have to be 50 per cent of the total equity capital of the company, or is there a limit?  In the parallel scheme in the UK there is a limit of 50 per cent but in the business expansion scheme there, introduced on 1983, that provision was scrapped.  This scheme will apply to Irish residents only and in the UK it <Col N="1267" /> applies to UK residents only.  What would the potential be if this was extended to EEC citizenship, considering that these people might bring money into the country which might otherwise not be brought here.  Is there a potential to attract overseas investment by loosening up that provision in regard to Irish residents?</P>
    <P>Will there be any controls on individuals who might buy these shares?  An individual might want to invest in a company and he might well have a controlling share in a competing company carrying out similar trade.  One can think of many types of manufacturing industries in which that would apply.  Will there be some vetting procedure on individuals to analyse what their motivation is in purchasing shares in a company?</P>
    <P>Are co-ops eligible for the whole scheme?  In relation to individual taxpayers in such companies, I notice that qualifiers cannot be paid directors, partners or their spouses.  If you allow employees, who in some instances might be taking more money from the company than directors, to qualify, is it not slightly unfair to exclude directors who have a legitimate vested interest in the company, as do the employees?  Is there not a contradiction there?  People in a company in which I am involved get payment purely by way of travelling expenses or reimbursement of certain expenses. Would that be considered here in order to determine whether a person was a paid director?  Where in the Act will the terms in relation to remuneration of directors be laid down?  Perhaps these points are laid out in every section of the Bill but I find it very difficult to make out the legal lingo of the Finance Bill.  I hope some of these questions will be taken up and answers given to them either on this Stage or on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I have figures available on a <i>pro rata</i> application here of the UK scheme to suggest that probably £3 million of investors' money would be taken up under this scheme.  It may be totally unfair to do such a <i>pro rata</i> assessment but I feel, and the Small Businesses Committee will be recommending, that this should be <Col N="1268" /> extended ultimately atter we get over the teething problems of the first year of operation to allow some provision for pension funds and insurance corporations to invest.  Young, small, indigenous industries are vulnerable and money should be directed towards them, possibly away from Government gilts or land speculation.  Funds should be directed into the productive sector that will be creating and adding to our wealth.  I hope the Minister and the Department will have discussions with the Stock Exchange with a view to having a small business section.  I should like to inquire about the up-to-date position in regard to approved investment funds or unit trusts being established here as in the UK.</P>
    <P>In relation to tax-based lending for which there is provision in section 84, I whole-heartedly welcome the change there.  It is not only prudent but it will be extremely beneficial.  It is a misnomer to describe section 84 lending as a concession to the banks.  I do not accept that. Any concession is passed on to the clients of the bank that is borrowing the money and availing of the cheaper money, and any restriction on section 84 lending will penalise the businesses concerned and not the banks.  Any argument in relation to the bank levy is outside the question of providing cheaper lending rates to certain types of businesses.  With this modification, however, I still think tourism is neglected from the point of view of loans. Hoteliers and so on cannot get grants, though Bord Fáilte have a scheme, which is not extensive&mdash;the total Bord Fáilte budget is £23 million.  There is not immediate scope here for helping hoteliers, who have been going through a rough time.  Section 84, therefore, should be revised to include tourism and possibly the construction industry.</P>
    <P>If we look at the inter-bank rate for the three months period ending last September and compare the Irish rate with the overseas rate, we notice that the inter-bank rate here is 12½ per cent, in the US and UK it is 9½ per cent, in Japan, 6.8 per cent, Germany, 5.8 per cent &mdash; all significantly less.  This shows that we must have cheaper lending rates to help businesses, especially the small businesses <Col N="1269" /> which are trying to expand.  This modification will help to restore our competitive position, profitability and employment.</P>
    <P>The growth in and the demand for this type of loan speaks for itself.  It is ironic that the Central Bank when making a submission to the Commission on Taxation in 1980 said that these loans were likely to be obsolete and unused with the advent of the 10 per cent corporation tax for manufacturing industry from 1 January 1981.  In their most recent report they say that section 84 type loans are the most buoyant type of loans and up to mid-August 1983 over 1982 showed a 27 per cent increase.  This proves that the arguments against abolishing section 84 loans are erroneous and to tamper with them is extremely dangerous.  I advise the Minister to think very carefully before making any changes in that area in future.</P>
    <P>The two sectors having difficulties at present are the construction industry and tourism.  It is often perceived that when the Coalition get into office some of these sectors do not do so well.  Of course, that is myth.  I would like to welcome the abolition of the certificates of reasonable value because they are no longer necessary given the very tight competition in the construction industry.  I also welcome the abolition of the clawback on stock relief.  Many builders and builders' providers have dropped their stocks significantly because of the recession and this concession will be of major benefit to them.</P>
    <P>Under section 27 of the 1983 Finance Act rental income is restricted to specific property developments as opposed to a more general application.  I accept that this is closing a loophole but any savings to the Exchequer made in that area could be made up by an extension of section 23 which gives tax relief to companies which might build extensions to their premises. If that tax relief applied across the board to the retail and distribution sectors, what was gained by the Exchequer under the restriction in section 27 could be made up by an expansion of section 23.  That would be a good day's work.</P>
    <P>I realise the Governments difficulties with regard to tourism but the tax burden <Col N="1270" /> through VAT and exise duties is enormous. We have two main rates, 23 per cent and 35 per cent.  If we compare our VAT rates with those of our European competitors we see that the German rate for the tourist sector is 13 per cent, the United Kingdom 15 per cent, Luxembourg 5 per cent, France 7 per cent and Holland 4 per cent.  If we add the crippling price of petrol and drink here, we see that we have a very big problem.  I understand that in 1983 hotels paid in excess of £80 million VAT.  The retail export refund scheme is welcome as is the 5 per cent reduction in the hiring of boats and caravans, but something more radical needs to be done.  While I recognise that the Exchequer desperately needs the money, what I would like to see is priority given to the service areas.</P>
    <P>In other words, whether it is changing sheets or waiting on tables.  I would like to give priority in the area of accommodation and meals.  I would hold the line on exise duties and the sale of goods.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with the small businesses. There are two problems with VAT: the first is VAT at the point of entry and the other is the very irritating and annoying amount of paperwork and administration the self-employed and employers have to do in running their businesses and working as agents on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners and the Government.  Last year total VAT receipts were in excess of £1.6 billion and to abolish VAT at point of entry in 1984 would cost £190 million.  I realise that that is a fairly substantial amount of money and that it would be unrealistic to expect that major modifications would be carried out, but I request that the guarantee aspect of VAT at the point of entry scheme be reviewed.  I am told by people who are importing raw materials and other essential goods that if there was a first warning system and payment was made on the given date in the two monthly period, it would be much better than having a continuous drain on their overdraft accommodation.  Some small businesses are not able to get the overdraft accommodation they need.  The case I heard about may be an isolated case, but in my view one case is one case <Col N="1271" /> too many.  I hope that that measure, coupled with the central office for bank drafts, will represent some easing of VAT at the point of entry without greatly affecting the Government's collection of £190 million.</P>
    <P>If there was light at the end of the tunnel and if the IDA had approved certain plant and equipment which was being imported, there should be an exemption for that plant and machinery at the point of entry.  I have been told that this is unworkable but I am convinced the IDA would operate this scheme because they have already investigated the firm and given a grant.  The IDA should be asked to take up this matter with the customs and exise people, and then we would have a more selective application of VAT at the point of entry.</P>
    <P>In relation to the unpaid paperwork which employers find so irritating, I suggest we grant a £500 credit.  On the old turnover tax credit was available to employers and all people registered for VAT.  A sum of £500 might be considered too high but in reply to a Parliamentary Question I learned that of the 97,000 people registered for VAT 54,000 would benefit, in other words, the net VAT paid by them to the Exchequer is in excess of £500, but 43,000 people would not benefit. These people are at the lower end of the scale and therefore that would probably be a bad application of this suggestion.</P>
    <P>I put forward this suggestion because it was already in operation by way of the turnover tax but I would be happy to hear any alteration of it.  There should be some recognition of the unpaid work done by employers not only by making VAT returns but by collecting PRSI and PAYE tax.  It has been suggested that quarterly or half yearly returns should be made instead of two-monthly returns but I do not think that this would be a solution. There should be some recognition of this problem.  What I suggest would cost £30 million and I suppose if I had that sum for small businesses I would not put it all in that area.  Something should be done about it, even as a token gesture.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1272" /> There are six rates of VAT ranging from zero to 35 per cent.  There are three rates too many.  The system is not only cumbersome and complex but highly confusing. In the long-term reform of the VAT code I should like to see three rates, the predominant rate being zero and another rate for goods and services.  If we had a rate for goods and services people would know exactly where they stood.  If all goods and services were included in the net, the system would meet with general approval and its simplicity would be a welcome breath of fresh air.</P>
    <P>I have had an increasing number of complaints recently about delays in VAT refunds.  I know one small company set up by four lads who were made redundant and they have been waiting for VAT refunds since last July.  This may seem a small matter but it is very important for a small company with a very tight cash flow.  I would hope that everything would be done to ensure that delays would not occur in the payment of VAT refunds.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is vital in a constituency such as mine.  There are 5,000 farmers in Wexford who have 10 per cent of total agricultural borrowings and most of our jobs are dependent on the input and output side of agriculture.  I wish to refer to three points, stock relief provisions, the 30 per cent restriction on capital allowances and the income levy.  In relation to stock relief, I very much welcome the Minister's statement when the Finance Bill was published that it is intended on Committee Stage to publish detailed amendments for stock relief for agriculture. It is also intended to retain the old system of stock relief and there will be a new provision to deal with the transfer of farms from spouses to children by way of inheritance and so on.  There are a number of changes I should like to see.  The ten-year base for clawbacks should at least be amended to seven years.  I understand that the land leasing plan being drawn up by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Deputy Connaughton, is near fruition and that the average recommended period of a lease will be seven years.  It would be a very welcome step if the ten-year base were reduced to seven years.  I could ask <Col N="1273" /> for a five-year base because that would meet with some of the animal cycles &mdash; the pig, sheep and cattle cycles &mdash; but seven years would be a fair period to start with.  I do not know what it would cost but I would very much welcome such a step.</P>
    <P>I will give one example of the way a farmer can be hit by stock relief.  Let us take the case of a farmer who has 100 acres and owes £80,000.  I know many people who owe in excess of £1,000 per acre in County Wexford.  If the ACC or other lending institution say they want a cash settlement or some solution to the problem the farmer may have to embark on a destocking programme and also sell some acreage.  He may have been claiming year after year income tax relief based on his increased stock value and an expansion of the herd and now, through no fault of his own, he has the tax man demanding a clawback.  That is the type of pincer movement which could happen without the provisions of this Bill.  I welcome them and I hope for a slight modification from ten years to seven years on the base dates.  We will look for a reduction to five years next year.  I also welcome the provisions in relation to transfers.</P>
    <P>Section 26 of the 1980 Finance Act imposes a 30 per cent restriction on capital allowances for farmers who invest in capital developments.  The most a farmer can claim in terms of depreciation on that outlay is 30 per cent and this is very unfair.  If a wholesaler buys a forklift truck he can obtain 100 per cent depreciation. A manufacturer can obtain 100 per cent depreciation on plant and machinery but Paddy the farmer cannot get it.  Tractor sales in 1978 and 1979 were in excess of 7,000 per annum but the figure is now down to about 2,000.  Not only is there a recession in agriculture but worn out machinery and second-hand equipment is being used and this cannot continue indefinitely.</P>
    <P>I will give a practical example.  Most farmers who are productive and highly efficient need to make three cuts of silage and must have the best equipment in order to have the right dry matter percentage. They must cut at exactly the right time and cannot afford costly breakdowns. <Col N="1274" /> Obviously it is better that they should use new equipment.  If a farmer were able to write off 100 per cent depreciation in one year he would have a real incentive and it would boost the agribusiness sector.  There is merit in this argument.  I know the total abolition would cost £2 million but even if it were increased to 50 per cent the Government would recoup in two ways.  The fact that the farmer cannot recoup after the first year means that he no longer has to refer to 30 per cent, and if he does well in succeeding years the Government will gain.  There is 23 per cent VAT on machinery generally and there would be immediate tax generation to the Government. This suggestion is cost effective, practical and realistic.  Perhaps next year or on Committee Stage the wisdom of my arguments will prevail and something will be done.</P>
    <P>There is one small problem with the machinery trade and that is the two-thirds/one-third rule for VAT, that is, the sale of goods versus servicing and the 50 per cent relief that is available.  If a machinery dealer buys a secondhand tractor, reconditions the engine, puts new tyres on it, does it up completely and then tries to sell the machine.  That is counted as sale of goods and therefore there is no VAT exemption.  I would ask that the sale of reconditioned machinery should be re-examined so that people would only have to pay the service rate of VAT.  The difference is 5 per cent as against 23 per cent which would be very substantial for many of these people who are really struggling.</P>
    <P>The third point is the whole question of the income levies.  We have a combination of levies.  We have the health levy, the youth employment levy and the tax levy.  I welcome the £96 a week exemption. There is a problem for farmers, that is, the difference between their gross and net income.  I have argued this consistently and at times to my cost when I talk to the ICMSA.  The only fair and equitable way to tax farmers is on their ability to pay on their net disposable income. Other farming groups want a land tax or other types of taxation, but I think this is the only fair way.  That is the principle we <Col N="1275" /> have in our farming tax code.  With the abolition of the PLV that is the way the system operates.</P>
    <P>With the levies the problem is that the farmer is taxed on his gross income.  I have been told by the IFA that they will undertake a very positive and constructive campaign to collect the arrears of the levies if there is some movement towards taxing them on their net income.  This is very easy to assess where farmers have accounts and keep them for income tax purposes.  I hope that when the collection moves from the health boards to the Revenue Commissioners this problem can be dealt with.  I would take up the IFA on their offer of a positive campaign for the collection of arrears.  This would mean we could move on and get in money which is most important at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>A widow of 82 years and a single man of 78 years came to my clinic and brought their forms.  Originally they were given red forms to fill up by the South Eastern Health Board in relation to the health levy.  They were told to make an estimate of their income, which they duly did.  It was £2,500 or £3,500 on their 25 or 30 acres.  They were assessed accordingly and sent a bill.  A week later they were told their assessments were being reconsidered because the health board thought they were not quite correct.  These elderly people were then asked to fill in details of their income, how much they got for livestock, how much they spent on fertilisers, how much they got in milk cheques, and so on.  They are bewildered.  If their income was £500 more, we are talking about £5.  These elderly people all say they will pay whatever they owe, but the question is one of accuracy.</P>
    <P>I am not against these people paying but they are being asked to fill up forms about which they have not got a clue. They will not go to an accountant because their acreage is very small.  Some way should be found to simplify this.  They should be told they are under the £96 a week and they should not be sent these forms.  Somebody with a bit of sensitivity in the health board offices should be told to do this and it would be a humane way of dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1276" /> I welcome the extension of the stamp duty exemption for land transfers to young farmers for another year.  This is valuable.  It should be closely monitored. ACOT should be geared to provide as many courses as possible for young people.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn now to personal income tax reform.  Many people have paid lip service to it and talked a lot of hot air about it.  So far we have three basic proposals. The Commission on Taxation suggested that there should be one single rate of tax.  The second proposal is basically what Nigel Lawson has done in the UK, that is, to move towards abolishing all reliefs and have a single rate of tax.  I understand that if we take in £4,500 million in income tax we give back £500 million in relief.  This seems a convoluted way to look after sectional interests.  The third system I have seen proposed is to abolish the allowances altogether and replace them with credits.</P>
    <P>There is general agreement that at present there is an undue amount of confusion for the taxpayer and costly administration for the collector.  The sheer complexity of it is burdensome and irritating to everybody.  There is no doubt that the black economy, which is a cancer in all legitimate workplaces, is undercutting legitimate employment.  Therefore there is a need for reform to deal with that problem.  No matter what way we rejig the system there is no escape from the fundamental fact that the tax burdens are there because of public expenditure and because of our borrowing.  Whatever way we rejig it the burden will be intolerable and very substantial.  Before we talk about reform we have to have a general acceptance of the fact that whatever way we go there will be hardship.  If by tax reform people mean tax relief or paying less tax, tax reform is a misnomer.  The Minister should do all he can to dispel that myth or he will become the prisoner of expectations created about tax reform.</P>
    <P>We must remember the overall balance between direct and indirect taxation.  I understand that in 1983 VAT and excise duties came to 35.3 per cent and income tax came to 26.1 per cent of total tax revenue to the Exchequer.  There has <Col N="1277" /> been a substantial shift in latter years towards indirect taxation.  The correct way to go is to restore personal choice to people.  If you depress people's take-home pay that is not fair, and it does not give them the opportunity they would otherwise have.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a total combination of PRSI and PAYE in the long-term.  If one deduction were made which covered tax and PRSI that would solve a multiplicity of problems on the collection side and on the payment side.  It would also reduce the cost of administration to the employers.  I know we have the lowest PRSI rate in Europe but I also know that a combination of PRSI and PAYE gives us the highest tax on income in Europe. We need reform in this area.  The present perception is that when a man comes in on a Monday morning, PRSI is a tax on taking him on.  The PRSI system is the greatest incentive possible for people who are prepared to do nixers in the evenings rather than taking up regular employment.  If both taxes were combined, the situation would be greatly simplified.</P>
    <P>The other proposal I have is the abolition of all allowances.  The direction in which to move is to provide for a basic rate of tax.  Any such proposal would cause many people to scream but the system would then be so simple as to be almost unbelievable.  It would work on the basis that people would be taxed on their income up to a certain cut-off point, say £3,000 or £4,000.  The rate would start at 10 per cent of total income and then work up to the higher rates.  Such a system would have the advantage of people knowing where they stood before filling up any tax form.  It would not mean necessarily that people would have to pay less tax because tax levels in the economy will be decided regardless of tax reform. The Commission on Taxation in their first report have fallen down on not having costed their proposals.  We do not know if their single band tax and their expenditure tax proposals would add up to the £4,000 million that accrue from income tax.  Therefore, my proposal of a single rate of tax on full income and the <Col N="1278" /> abolition of all allowances, thereby allowing for the maximum disposable income, is the best approach.  Any sectoral interest, whether insurance groups or others, who would strenuously oppose any such change, would soon overcome their grievances.  The same would apply in respect of objections to the abolition of concessions on mortgages.  If people must live their lives in ways that are geared to avoiding tax, there is something wrong.  No system should result in any such interference in people's personal lives.  That is why I submit that the restriction of personal choice and freedom of choice based on consumer spending power is the way to move.  These, then, are my few and inadequate words on the subject of tax reform but it is well that some of the humbug in respect of this issue be explored.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to make some overall points as to the direction in which the Government should be moving.  Our priority must be in terms of macro economics in order to ensure that we are a low-cost production economy, that we have low inflation rates and <i>pro rata</i> interest rates and that we mercilessly tackle our ESB, telecommunications and postal charges.  I support totally everything Deputy O'Malley had to say at the weekend in relation to certain semi-State bodies. In certain areas, we should leave party politics aside, for example, when we are serving the best interests of the economy.  How many times have the jobs in some semi-State bodies been considered more important than the jobs they are servicing?  I have heard from many companies that their electricity charges have wiped out any preferential advantage in coming to Ireland by way of an IDA grant package.  Our overall aim must be to bring about rationalisation in the cost structure of production and to reduce inflation.  I support fully the utilisation of the NPC in the area of restricting pay increases.  There is no doubt but that workers, regardless of the outspoken comments of their leaders, realise that a 16 per cent increase at a time when inflation is at a level of 21 per cent is much worse than a 5 per cent increase when the inflation level is 7 per cent.  By and large <Col N="1279" /> our people realise that no one owes us a living, that we must rely for a living on our exports and on what we can sell competitively.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that those countries which have succeeded in reducing their inflation rates have not solved their unemployment problems.  I am speaking against something I have maintained always when I say that reduced inflation rates do not necessarily mean reduced unemployment rates.  I always believed that competitiveness was the bedrock of our economic policy.  It has been proved that the low inflation economies do not necessarily have the highest employment rates.  That is unfortunate because it defies a number of principles but it does not mean that competitiveness should be disregarded.  While it may not solve the unemployment problem, it solves a lot of other problems.  It restores stability to an economy and can help restore Government finances in the long term.  It can bring about all sorts of benefits in terms of marginal considerations in the area of exports and so on but it will not create 25,000 jobs per year.  Therefore we must be honest and ask how we can move in the direction that will best bring about that situation.</P>
    <P>We must review fundamentally the way in which we assist companies.  I am confident that the Small Businesses Committee of the Oireachtas will have succinct and specific proposals to put forward. Our State agencies must adopt a total business approach.  Companies in receipt of money for fixed assets might need more money for marketing and management aids.  There is a need for a businesslike approach to production.</P>
    <P>On the question of guarantees on loans, interest subsidies and other flexibilities in the grant aid code, I will have another opportunity to put forward my views.</P>
    <P>Even if we get the overall macro economics right, if we restore Government finances, achieve lower inflation rates and so on between now and 1987, we will not solve our biggest social problem which is the problem of unemployment. One of the ways of solving the unemployment <Col N="1280" /> question is to review fundamentally our attitude towards the service sector.  Recently I was speaking to Milton Stewart who is the small business king in the US and who is very much involved with Mr. Jimmy Carter in setting up small businesses.  The Americans have a totally different outlook from ours in so far as the services are concerned.  They say that a job is a job and that is it.  We tend to look to wealth creation and to the productive sector as the barometer for service sector employment.  There is a powerful economic argument for that but the attitude in the US is that there is added value in providing incentives for the service sector, that there is merit in that alone and that such an approach involves huge job potential.</P>
    <P>The various areas that I referred to earlier, the jobs tax credit, the £10 per week corporation tax extension, the PRSI payments and so on, should be the subject of a fundamental review of the service sector in the context of employment. There is not enough strength in so far as the enterprise allowance scheme is concerned.  We should encourage and help the unemployed to utilise their ideas, especially in the sense of the possibility of employment creation.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by addressing a few remarks to the area of our natural resources and their development. As junior spokesman on matters of employment creation when Fine Gael were last in opposition, I put forward a specific proposal in regard to natural resources, that was, that the National Enterprise Agency or the NDC be used as a vehicle for revolving equity in the area of the development of our natural resources.  I hope the sectoral committees, whether they relate to forestry, fisheries or any other area, will show that there are major problems in these sectors.  First, there is the problem of under-capitalisation and, secondly, there are too many cute jokers in the business taking the last halfpenny from their competitors but with no instinct for added value or for employment creation.  In five years the number of small retailers has been reduced from 12,000 to 6,000.  If, however, we talk to <Col N="1281" /> the multinationals and to the Tony O'Reillys and tell them that they may sell the end product, we may then talk to the producer groups, whether they are producing potatoes or are in the area of afforestation or whatever, and try to hammer out some deal in terms of economy of scale and in terms of being able to control production from the farm gate right through to the Quinnsworth shelf.  If you can control that total chain you must be able to create jobs and do it by way of revolving equity to set it up. This is what the NEA or the National Development Corporation should be at. There must be scope in this area.  When one looks at market potential reports for timber sales, fishing or anything else there is a market there, so one starts there and one gets the people in the business who can deliver.  I hope that some form of revolving equity can be utilised.</P>
    <P>I feel that the Government's preoccupation with finances is correct and I feel that their priority to become a low inflation economy is correct.  I hope that some of the very specific and detailed proposals I have made in relation to this Bill can be taken up on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to start by saying that the address by Deputy Ivan Yates is a breath of fresh air.  I want to compliment him on a very positive approach to our problems.  I would not agree with all his comments but the broad drift of his speech and the positive nature of it is badly needed on all sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Governments and politicians must have a vision of the type of society they want to create and one which extends beyond the next election.  It is only by doing that that the policies will have a certain coherence.  I feel that, basically, what is missing in the thrust of Irish economic policy and in political life today, is a vision beyond the next hurdle of the type of society we want to create.  Applying that yardstick to the Bill I find it lacks vision and misses a very good opportunity to chart a new economic direction.  It is devoid of any measures which I believe can realistically be expected to have an impact on the major problems facing the <Col N="1282" /> country.  It will not greatly contribute to a reversal in the inexecrable rise in unempoyment which has been a feature of the last two years.  I believe it will not contribute to a revival in the construction industry in which up to 40 per cent of the labour force are unemployed.  It will not begin to deal effectively with the problems of an inefficient and inequitable tax system which is a major factor in holding back recovery in the country, and, worst of all, it will exacerbate the chronic conditions of the public finances.  The latest Exchequer returns suggest that this is already beginning to happen on quite a significant scale.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill before the House should give legislative effect to measures which will provide impetus for all of us to capitalise on the international economic recovery when it comes.  The Minister said that it should contribute materially to the improvement of our financial problems.  I take him at his word but I want to spell out clearly to the House and to the people the incorrect nature of that particular claim.  This Finance Bill is unbalanced.  A quarter of it deals with schemes which, however laudable &mdash; they are laudable in principle &mdash; will have very little impact this year.  I find the Bill is inconsistent in that a number of the measures represent a direct reversal of provisions which were set out in the Minister's budget earlier this year.  The Government, not for the first time, have been forced to concede that their proposals on day one may have been ill-considered, and badly researched, and they found it necessary to alter them or reverse them. How confident can our job creators be when they see constant changes in policy? If they invest now on foot of a scheme which this Minister or any other Minister introduces how can they be sure that that scheme will still be there in six months' time or a year's time when a number of radical changes have taken place in a few weeks?</P>
    <P>The Bill is inconsistent because a number of the provisions are directly at variance with the Government's Programme for Government, on the basis of which they took power.  The Bill is incoherent. I can find no sense of direction, no sense <Col N="1283" /> of purpose or no unified theme throughout the Bill.  The Minister would be entitled to conclude that this is an Opposition spokesman who cannot see any economic thrust in the Bill, I am not alone in this. The Economist Intelligence Unit of <i>The Economist,</i> who would be regarded by the Minister and myself as an outside, independent commentator on the economies of the world, including our own, stated:</P>
    <P>Another harsh budget had been widely anticipated.  In the event the Government opted for a largely neutral budget which is not expected to have any significant affect on overall economic prospects one way or another.  Instead, Mr. Dukes concentrated more on manipulation of the more detailed provisions, rather than on any distinct economic thrust.  The policy is one of holding things as they are, rather than attempting either a substantial reflationery boost to the economy or a substantial lowering of the deficit in the public finances.</P>
    <P>I felt it would be better to have an independent view of the Minister's budget rather than give him what he might regard as a political view of it.  <i>The Economist</i> says it has no distinct economic thrust and is not expected to have any significant effect on overall economic prospects.  I share that view very deeply.</P>
    <P>What will the provisions of the Bill mean to the average family?  It is quite clear, without going into too much detail, that it will mean a higher proportion of income being siphoned off the individual family.  The figures are quite clear.  It is expected to take over £300 million extra from the income tax sector than was taken in previous years.  If one puts alongside that the fact that the Government are on record as predicting between 25,000 and 30,000 extra people unemployed throughout this period one gets quite a simple picture.  The Government are taking £300 million extra from 30,000 fewer people.  That will increase the burden of taxation on individual families.  I do not know any other way to do that sum.  That is the way it comes out for me every time I do it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1284" /> What will it mean to employers who want to expand output and employment? In my view it will mean little or nothing in the short term, as whatever is there is offset by crippling PRSI and personal taxation.  The reasons for this are simple. I do not see any substantive content in this Finance Bill.  There are provisions on bond washing and section 84 loans which do not begin to go to the heart of the problems which face the country today. Sections 1 to 3 of the Bill relate to the income tax rates and the reliefs.  It is here that the divergence between the commitment of the Government and their performance are more and more evident.</P>
    <P>In the Programme for Government they gave a clear and unambiguous commitment. They said the proportion of tax derived from PAYE on wages and salaries would be reduced.  That appears on page 16 of the Programme for Government. Instead in the 1983 budget the Minister added to the burden of the PAYE sector.  A temporary levy was also introduced and that has been retained again in this year's Bill.  The elimination of the 25 per cent band provided for in section 2 of the Bill has no practical signifance and the Minister should not pretend to the House that it has any significance because those who are eligible for that taxation are immediately subject to a rate of 35 per cent on their taxable income.</P>
    <P>Far from fulfilling their commitment that the proportion of tax derived from PAYE on wages and salaries would fall it has in fact risen in each of the last two budgets and it now accounts for over 62 per cent of the total taxation on incomes. If one includes PRSI one gets over 90 per cent of all taxes still borne by the PAYE sector.  Despite that commitment in the Programme for Government to reduce it, it has been increasing.  When account is taken of inflation and the failure to index allowances accordingly it is quite apparent that the income tax burden increased enormously in real terms on what was already an excessive level of taxation.</P>
    <P>The Government have broken faith with those who voted for that particular programme on the basis of that commitment to reduce the level of taxation borne <Col N="1285" /> by the PAYE sector.  The tax rates implemented in effect by the provisions of this Bill are therefore in my view inequitable and indeed counterproductive.  The Exchequer returns show in March that Government tax revenue so far this year is falling below the figures on which the budget is based.  The short-fall in relation to income tax may be of the order of £800 million.  What will it be tomorrow?  It may be of the order of £800 million less than was targeted.  Responsible commentators hold that the budget deficit, the barometer of the financial rectitude so beloved by the Government, may be off target to the extent of £300 million.  I remember saying to the Minister when we discussed the property tax sometime ago that he would not get £3 million from it and he told me to wait until the end of the year and it would be £10 million.  He will get far less than that.  The budget deficit will be substantially off course by the end of the year and it could be as high as £2 million or £3 million off course.  I put that on the record now and we can have a look at it at the end of the year.  That is a fair prediction.</P>
    <P>The financial strategy of this Government has gone wrong simply because the Government do not seem to have grasped something that is coming from every corner of the country and that is that the tax burden is excessive.  It is inequitable and until such time as it is put right it can only result in undermining any effort the Government may make to secure the financial foundation for a growth in employment.  In that regard the work done by the Commission on Taxation is something on which that body should be complimented and I join the Minister in complimenting them.  Secondly, I think the measures are counter-productive and will lead to tax avoidance and tax evasion. The Government have consistently adopted a high moral tone inside this House and outside it in relation to tax evasion and avoidance.  They should be aware, they must be aware by now, that the impact and the burdens on the scale reflected in the provisions of this Finance Bill can only lead to an increase in avoidance and evasion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1286" /> On the completion of the work of the Commission on Taxation, it was said a fundamental reform of the taxation and the social welfare system would be undertaken with a view to its implementation immediately within the lifetime of the Government.  The Finance Bill has not been used to implement fundamental reforms, as was obviously the wish of the Minister in the commitment made in the Programme for Government put before the people.  The Finance Bill should have been used to implement those fundamental reforms.  The recommendation of the Commission on Taxation have in general been ignored.  The Government have in effect abandoned the commitment to make these fundamental reforms within, as they said themselves, the lifetime of the Government.  If one looks at the Minister's budget speech it is clear that he now sees the implementation of reforms in taxation as conditional on the elimination of the budget deficit in 1987.  But that elimination also seems to have gone out the window.</P>
    <P>I call on the Government now to face up squarely to the question of tax reform or else admit that the reforms they themselves recognised as, to use the Minister's own words &ldquo;badly needed&rdquo; will not be implemented within the lifetime of the Government.  I endorse the view that the Finance Bill should be used to implement fundamental and much-needed reforms. That is the Minister's own view.  I believe this can be done and my view in this regard is backed up by the meticulous research of the Commission on Taxation. They have recently argued that the Government should announce a time-table for taxation reform and stick to it. I now ask the Government again to announce a time-table for taxation reform and this time stick to that time-table.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the deficit. Rather than adopt a political line on that I think we can just put on the record of the House what the Economist Intelligence Unit has had to say on this subject, it being an independent source.</P>
    <P>The budget represents soft pedalling on the Government's declared fiscal <Col N="1287" /> target of phasing out the current deficit and reducing Government borrowing. The current deficit for 1984 is officially projected as £1,089 million, almost identical with last year's outturn of £1,085 million.  This means that the deficit will fall in real terms by the rate of inflation &mdash; that is about 9 per cent. A real fall of 20 per cent per annum is required if the Government target of eliminating the deficit in five years up to 1987 is to be reached.</P>
    <P>That is from No. 1, 1984.  Again on the question of the budget deficit, I put it on record to avoid the need for any political arguing about whether or not there has been soft pedalling.  Clearly, it has been soft pedalled and we are going to get a 9 per cent reduction when, to reach the Government's target, a 20 per cent reduction is needed.  The Minister should tell the House that the Government have changed their mind and that they are not going to eliminate the budget deficit in that period so that businesses and everyone else can do some planning on the basis of that admission.  A political view has been taken in that it seems to be the Minister's intention to leave the current budget deficit floated around £1,000 million, hope that inflation will take care of it, take in and give out X amount every year, which will see the Government all the way to the next election.  That is not the vision which the country needs.  It is unrealistic for the Minister to pretend that they are going to eliminate this deficit over the next five years.</P>

      <P>There is great interest in this document.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle asked me the same question a few moments ago and the title is No. 1, 1984, Economist Intelligence Unit, <i>Quarterly Economic Review of Ireland.</i> If Deputy Skelly does not think it is an authoritative source I have a number of other documents which will back it up.  I did not want the Minister saying this was Fianna Fáil propaganda, it is clearly supported <Col N="1288" /> by a number of reputable commentators.</P>
      <P>Chapter III, sections 11 to 27, deal with tax relief for investment in corporate trades, which is a fabulous phrase.  In the UK it is called the business expansion scheme.  This measure was intended to encourage the provision of long term risk capital up to £25,000 in manufacturing and certain internationally traded services.  I welcome the thinking behind this measure and I compliment the Minister in bringing it forward.  I genuinely wish it well and I hope the Minister will not think me ungenerous if I remind him that I have been calling in a number of articles for precisely this scheme.</P>
      <P>Changes have been introduced, however, compared to those announced in the budget and in general they are positive. I have one or two reservations which are widely shared.  It is disturbing that the Minister has not worked out clearly the <i>rationale</i> of the scheme.  I know it is difficult, but Minister's must tackle difficult jobs.  He did not attempt to quantify the effects of the scheme.  In the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 1 April the Minister said that this scheme was a shot in the dark to the extent that he did not know how many people would take advantage of it, how much would flow through it or how many jobs it would generate.  He said he would leave it to the people who had been agitating for such a scheme to make it work.  This attitude and the wishful thinking behind it are extraordinary when one considers that the measure takes up almost one quarter of the Finance Bill.  The Minister should have quantified its effects and not just have thrown it in as a shot in the dark.</P>

That might have given the Minister some figures to work on.  It would have given a maximum figure because taxpayers who do not have a tax problem are not going to avail of it.

      <P>Under the United Kingdom scheme, which is somewhat similar, a much wider range of services are eligible.

Distribution, retailing and a variety of other activities seem to be excluded.  We must bear in mind that manufacturing already benefits from a plethora of incentives. There is a real need to boost service type industries which can contribute significantly to employment and exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1290" /> It was recently pointed out by the chief executive of CTT that exports of services are likely to grow by one third to £190 million this year.  That is only on the export front; a lot more can be done at home.  The restricted nature of section 16 of the Bill under the heading of qualifying trades militates against the usefulness in regard to promoting services and I hope to see amendments from this side of the House as well as the Minister's side on Committee Stage.  I know from the UK experience that some restrictions are necessary in the Bill but they should relate to the size of the companies and not so much to the nature of the business in which they are engaged.  Larger firms, whether involved in manufacturing or services, usually have access to funds, especially if they are well established.  It is the smaller businesses that need risk capital.  It is they who can make a major and a quicker contribution to employment and exports and, even more important, to the flexibility of the economy. They can chart a new direction for the economic structure in general.  We should ensure that such businesses benefit from this measure by imposing some kind of limit, perhaps a limit on turnover, in regard to eligibility.  If large companies are reasonably successful and wish to expand, usually they have no difficulty in organising funds for themselves&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are large companies that are unquoted: they are not all on the Stock Exchange.  The provisions of this Bill allow maximum management expenses of 1 per cent.  Deputy O'Kennedy dealt with that matter yesterday and I will not dwell on it except to say that it appears restrictive.  The Minister might consider the matter and satisfy himself that he will get the necessary professional investment management that is essential for the success of the scheme.</P>
      <P>However, measures like these can be effective only if there is an equitable, efficient and uncomplicated taxation system. If we had such a system &mdash; and we should have &mdash; there would be no need for such schemes.  It has been said in this House on many occasions that the present tax system is suffocating enterprise and it is difficult to see how a scheme designed to encourage enterprise can be wholly effective in such an environment. However, I acknowledge it will help.  If the scheme is not a success it will not be because of failure of the private sector but it will be merely a reflection of the prevailing climate that is inimical to enterprise.  I welcome the thinking behind the proposal.  The scheme should be simple and should embrace a wider range of services.  It should be geared to a greater extent to smaller firms.  Even then it is difficult to see it fully successful because of the current taxation environment. It is not likely to have any impact this year.</P>
      <P>With regard to tax-based lending, it is apparent the Minister has been obliged to change his mind on the abolition of such lending as announced in the budget. It is a commendable virtue to change one's mind but it is not commendable to make a habit of it to the extent that Irish business and Irish people are not clear as to the direction being followed.  It is clear that under section 84 we are talking of a large sum of money &mdash; some commentators have said upwards of £700 million. However, I know the Minister's views on some commentators; they were expressed very eloquently over the weekend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that tax-based lending allows <Col N="1292" /> industry to benefit from low interest rates and that is important for the economy.  I can understand the Minister's view that proliferation of allowances, some of which were never intended, is an inefficient means of aiding industry and that view was expressed in the recent report of the Commission on Taxation.  It is important to have some light shed on the provision of assistance so that the real costs may be evident to all and the effectiveness of such aids may be monitored.</P>
    <P>If the Minister was aware of the dependence of Irish industry on this form of finance, if he was worried that it was inefficient, why did he not seek to offset the original withdrawal of the provision by direct assistance to industry?  Was the Minister going to drop it altogether and not provide an alternative compensating direct aid to industry that had high interest rates to pay?  Under some pressure the Minister has reversed this decision and has made some modifications.</P>
    <P>There seems to be no appreciation in the Government of the needs of Irish Industry and how they can be met in an economic, efficient manner along the lines indicated by the Commission on Taxation.  It is more the change of heart that is disturbing than the details of the proposal.  Personally, I support the recommendation of the commission in regard to withdrawal of section 84 and its replacement with a direct interest subsidy to those firms in need of it.  Up to now the system has been financing even space invader machines and clearly it was never intended to have that effect.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to deal in detail with the remaining sections but I shall wait for Committee Stage to do that.  It is clear the Finance Bill contains a series of measures that have not been thought out fully. They do not begin to address the central problem facing us, namely, unemployment. The provisions on tax run directly contrary to the Programme for Government and they avoid tackling the reports of the Commission on Taxation.  The measures are leading to a distortion instead of a strengthening of the public finances.  They indicate that the goal of eliminating the current budget deficit by 1987 is not attainable.  What seems to <Col N="1293" /> have happened is the worst of all worlds. We are not getting the public finances under control and we are not reducing the unemployment figures or our taxation levels.  We seem to be falling between three policy objectives.  If any one of them was coming right I would be the first to say to the Minister, &ldquo;well done&rdquo;. However, all of them are off-target and they are going in the wrong direction. That is why the strategy in the Finance Bill has not been thought out clearly enough.  If it had been we would make some progress in some areas.</P>
    <P>In the past few months I have said in a number of places that there is an alternative strategy.  I mentioned a number of proposals today.  This Government have introduced two budgets but I am not clear on their long-term policy objectives beyond the next election.  The responsibility for this seems to have been delegated to a national planning board whose report I await with great interest.  However, in the absence of that report I do not know what are the long-term objectives. It is clear that people in the country are seeking a new direction based on realistic, creative and imaginative policies and I have attempted to respond to that in a number of the points I put forward today and which I have put forward in other places.  Unemployment here is nearly 16 per cent but the Government must be aware that throughout Europe average unemployment is only 10 per cent.  Clearly we have an internal difficulty of leadership and management which has pushed us 6 per cent or 7 per cent above what is acceptable in the rest of Europe.</P>
    <P>The broad strategy of what the Government are trying to do is wrong. We are all agreed that the Government are absorbing far too high a share of national resources, that the total public spending is now amounting to virtually two-thirds of GNP compared to something like 40 per cent in 1970.  Simply and honestly, Government has got too big and continues to get too big.  This is being sustained only by our resort in the past to external borrowing.  Official debt is now something over £6½ billion.  We have <Col N="1294" /> little to show for that in terms of jobs created and the servicing of that debt is now imposing on this generation of people a crippling burden.  Government strategy as announced appears to reduce expenditure and borrowing.  To that extent they are correct if only we could get that done.  The pointing of that as a strategy is correct, and I support it, but the Government are wrong in focussing exclusively on that issue.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the problem of tackling the current budget deficit and creating employment are opposite objectives. They can be tackled concurrently and that must be done.  To tackle the finances on their own is to condemn this generation of people to the dole queues for a length of time which is unacceptable to them.  We must tackle both together. They are mutually reinforcing and in that regard they would lead towards a restoring of the balance in the public finances. We would create a circle of growth rather than a circle of decline as we have at present.</P>
    <P>That is the nub of the economic strategy we should have, concurrent tackling of the employment objective alongside a tackling of the public finances.  That takes leadership imagination, vision and courage. If we had those ingredients we could pursue that path and we would make some progress economically.</P>
    <P>I have made a number of proposals in recent months in this regard and I am pleased to see one of them has been incorporated fully in the Finance Bill. Before I refer to them I should like to deal with the personal taxation levels in the budget.  The Minister must be aware that there is rampant middle-class poverty here.  Any banker will say that personal overdrafts and the level of bank borrowings of the majority of people has increased substantially in the last two years with the result that we have facing us a new breed of poverty, middle-class poverty.  Taxation policy will have to take account of that in future.</P>
    <P>I have suggested to the Minister that there will have to be greater mobility between the public and private sectors. The Government will have to show more imagination and courage in organising <Col N="1295" /> mobility between the private and public sectors.  They cannot allow the economy to be unbalanced with a growing public sector on the one hand and a diminishing private sector on the other.  One way out of that is to adopt a policy to allow those in the public sector go into private business with a mechanism to allow a return to the public sector if they are not successful in the business of job creation. The reason people are staying in the public sector at present is the security of it. The jump is too high and the risk is too big.  They will not take the jump and we are losing a lot of very good people in the public service who would make excellent job creators and innovators if they were given some type of safety net to allow them apply their expertise in the private area for some time.</P>
    <P>I saw a suggestion by Deputy Keating that people in the private sector should be used more and more in the public sector to tackle the problems we have. Why do we have to build two elites here &mdash; a rigid public service where nobody gets a look in and a private sector where nobody gets a look in?  We are building two different structures but I would like to see them interwoven and with greater mobility.  That would help the public service and, certainly, would help the private sector.  It will take courage to tackle that because it is necessary to deal with strong interests but the Minister should have a look at it.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have a look also at the position of PRSI.  At the moment PRSI is a taxation on jobs.  It does not make any sense to me that if I employ one person I pay PRSI at a certain rate and if I employ 100 people I pay 100 times that rate.  If we were to have a sliding scale of PRSI under which an employer with 50 workers would pay less PRSI than an employer with one worker and an employer with 100 workers would not pay any, would the extra employment created not offset the loss to the Exchequer in the relief given?  That suggestion would need to be fleshed out but it represents a pro-employment policy and one which says to job creators that the more jobs they create the more the Government will look after them rather than <Col N="1296" /> saying the more jobs one creates one gets crucified.  That is an important message to get across if we are to create more employment.</P>
    <P>I have also suggested before that we should have a look at the prospect of establishing agricultural enterprise zones here.  If we have industrial estates why is it that we do not have agricultural estates with enterprises based on agriculture in a geographical area getting attractive tax incentives?  It would serve as a great catalyst for growth, particularly in rural areas.  Unemployment is not just an urban problem; is also applies to rural areas.  A lot of the unemployment in cities is caused by migration from rural areas to the cities.  We could capitalise on our basic resources if we had a look at the idea of agriculture enterprise zones and give tax breaks to those who operate within them.</P>
    <P>I suggested before to the Minister that we should have closer supervision of the official external borrowings, including those by semi-State companies.  The importance of this can be seen from the fact that the foreign borrowings of semi-State companies was £940 million in 1980 and rose to £1,607 million in three years. That is horrific and the Minister should have a look not only at the size of the foreign borrowing but at the efficiency of it, the arrangements in regard to foreign exchange and so on.  When I refer to vision I ask the Government and all politicians: &ldquo;Are we happy and content with the present structure of semi-State companies here?  Will we have them in ten or 20 years' time?  Will anybody have a look at the fundamental structure of them? Has anybody thought of privatising a section of them or is that a dangerous word that should not be mentioned?  Has anybody thought about putting some of them on the Stock Exchange?  Has anybody thought about trying to take out some of the huge amount of Government money that is in those companies and replacing it with equity, perhaps under venture capital schemes?&rdquo;  There could be as many people owning these companies if they were thrown open to the public, perhaps under a Stock Exchange scheme, as own them now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1297" /> We have got to start thinking as big as that: we have got to start making courageous decisions in regard to semi-State companies.  We cannot continue to pay lip service to the great machines of the sixties that were part of the solutions in the sixties, without asking ourselves whether they are part of the solutions in the eighties or whether some of them, or parts of some of them, are becoming part of our problem and not part of the solution. That is a fundamental question that some Government will have to tackle.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister take a very close look at the possibility of encouraging reinvestment here of a greater proportion of companies' profits which currently are being repatriated outside the country.  This has come up before in the Dáil and I know the Minister is not unaware of it.  If he cannot lock it in perhaps he can find a sensible way to ensure by suitable incentives that the money will stay here.  I hope the Minister will give it some serious thought because there seems to be a large amount involved.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister given any thought to presenting a three-year budget instead of an annual one?  When most major companies are planning on a four-year, five-year or six-year basis and others on a three to four-year basis, is it practicable for the biggest organisation, the State, to do its planning on a three-year basis?  I wonder would it be a sensible policy.</P>
    <P>I wonder is it sensible to ask companies who earn the same profits to pay the same level of taxation irrespective of their employment content.  Why should a company that earns £1 million profit and has 50 employees pay only the same tax as a company with a £1 million profit and 500 employees?  I will take it to its most extreme: I have read of companies making £1 million or £2 million profit with a handful of employees, four, five or six employees, while other companies employ 1,000 workers to make the same money.  Would it not be a pro-employment taxation policy to say to those companies that we will keep them distinctly different because one has an employment content in it and the other has not?  The feeling abroad is that you would be far <Col N="1298" /> better off organising your business with as few people as possible &mdash; get it down to the bare minimum, with three or four people or even fewer, perhaps getting into the financial services area or some such business where there is no great investment in people needed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that not the point we are at?  Everybody shrugs and asks, &ldquo;Who wants to employ people?&rdquo;  They would be crazy to employ people under the present system.  I put the suggestion to the Minister that companies who employ people should get special tax rates compared with those who do not employ people but who make the same profit.  At the moment the same tax rate applies whether the company make the profit with three people or with 1,000 people.  That is not a pro-employment policy.</P>
      <P>This is an export-led economy.  It will only grow if we get exports, if we have a maximum number of people exporting. That is the only way our economy will grow.  Why not try to put together a kind of John Kennedy peace corps arrangement whereby a number of young Irish graduates can be taken under the wing of the State and placed abroad for a period to try to increase our share of world markets? We have only a tiny portion of world markets, probably less than one quarter per cent.  If we could get that up to one half per cent we would transform the country overnight.  Calling such a group of people a peace corps is a dramatic way of putting it, but this is a dramatic situation.  It would lead a revival here and give badly needed jobs.  I ask the Minister to think about it.  Though it may seem dramatic and gimmicky it would create excitement among our young people who do not think they have got any future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am on record as opposing a policy of <Col N="1299" /> deliberately boosting public service employment.  Recently it was suggested by the ESRI in an important constructive report.  It would reduce the efficiency of the public service and lead to higher expenditure.  We need a more efficient streamlined public service, not necessarily a large one.  We cannot acquiesce in the continuance of unemployment at its present scale.  Along the lines I have laid out there is a better road if we have the vision to follow it.  The policies I have been suggesting will not themselves cure unemployment.  The criticisms I have made of the Bill will not themselves cure unemployment, but they point to a new direction in an atmosphere of imagination, and determination to overcome our problems, particularly the major one of unemployment.</P>
    <P>I am committed to striving for a higher level of employment here and I am convinced that a strategy based on the lines I have indicated, with effective and imaginative leadership, would restore our self-confidence and hold out some real hope for overcoming our economic crisis, but unemployment in particular.  What politicians, but above all the Government, need today is a vision of the kind of country we want to create which will go beyond the next general election so that we will not be making decisions on a day-to-day basis.  I do not see that vision in the Finance Bill, I did not see it in the budget, and if the Government do not acquire that vision soon there is little or no hope for the young people who are screaming out for a vision of the kind of Ireland they want to live in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Brennan started off by complimenting Deputy Yates on some of the positive things he had said. I am delighted to begin my speech by complimenting Deputy Brennan on a number of the points he made, which were positive.  That might lead one to believe that there can be consensus on both sides of the House when we are positive and looking at the national interest. There were no crass comments in any of his statements in relation to what had <Col N="1300" /> been contributed earlier and I would not like to introduce any.</P>
      <P>I do not quite agree with his comments on the black economy, that people are forced into the black economy because of the high taxation rates.  I do not think that is true.  You are not forced into the black economy; you go into it because you want to go into it.  People who run profitable businesses and who have more than a few employees do not run into the black economy.  It is usually reserved to small numbers of people.</P>
      <P>There is a mood prevailing in the country of anti-business, anti-profit, anti-investment, and from reading the Bill I get the impression of a Churchillian approach by some of the civil servants who have been drafting the Bill.  When they are not dealing with the fight against crime they seem to be dealing with a fight against businessmen, against profit, against enterprise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to get this opportunity to support this Fianna Fáil motion.  I could not let the opportunity go but to put on the record the very serious financial position of the Central Fisheries Board and the regional fisheries boards on whom the statutory responsibility rests for the management, development and conservation policies of inland fisheries.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to highlight the disastrous financial position the boards find themselves in due to the failure of the Government to provide adequate financial resources for them to carry out their duties.  The boards are hit by the Government embargo on recruitment which forbids them from hiring the essential staff they need.  Without any exaggeration the effects of the aforementioned under-financing and under-staffing means that the boards are under-equipped and inadequately geared to face up to the serious threats of poaching and pollution.  Some sections of their activities which are vitally important will be cut back by 15 per cent to 16 per cent in real terms in the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The boards were unlucky when they were being restructured in 1980 and 1981 to be caught up almost immediately in the embargo on recruitment and have since been handicapped in their endeavours to meet their statutory obligations. The Minister must acknowledge that if there is to be any prospect of bringing forward a worthwhile development plan <Col N="1302" /> for inland fisheries he must provide the financial and staff resources needed, and he must do this immediately.  Otherwise the whole exercise will be a waste of time.</P>
    <P>There are in the region of 6,000 people employed in this area of fishing and the revenue from visiting anglers is £20 million to £25 million per annum.  All this is being put in jeopardy as is the prospect of further advancement in this area.  The development of inland fisheries from a local as well as a tourist point of view is being severely handicapped and hampered by this short-sighted retrograde step.  I call on the Minister to restore now the necessary finances and to make a special case for the exclusion of these boards from the strict embargo on recruitment in view of what is taking place throughout the country.  At present some fishery boards are resorting to raffles and other methods of fund raising to finance their activities.  The board find themselves in a very difficult position and the Minister must help them.</P>
    <P>In Rossmore, Carrigtwohill, County Cork, there is one of the most successful oyster farms in the world, but it is under constant threat from pollution.  Unless the Government fulfil the promises made in the last three elections to provide a treatment plant for the Midleton sewerage scheme it is fairly certain that this success story will become a tragedy.  I call on the Government not to renege on another of their promises.  If this oyster factory is destroyed by pollution it will be a disaster for the area and for the country.</P>
    <P>In Youghal a successful fishermen's co-operative is operating at present but it depends to a large degree on the goodwill of the Minister in office to extend the salmon season by a couple of weeks. Over the last few weeks one could count on one's hands the number of salmon caught by the fishermen in the Youghal area.  I call on the Minister to tell the House and the fishermen on the south coast what his policy is on the use of monofilament nets being used further up the coastline which prevent salmon travelling to the south coast and I would like the Minister to tell us what he intends to do about the use of those nets.</P>

      <P>When the time comes I would like the Minister to extend the salmon season to facilitate the fishermen in the south who depend for their bread and butter on these extra few weeks.</P>
      <P>In Youghal there are many unused factories which would be ideal for fish processing plants.  At present there is plenty of manpower available in the town of Youghal and the surrounding areas.  The provision of a processing plant would be of enormous benefit to the economy of this black spot and I ask the Minister to look into the possibility of setting up a processing plant there because there is plenty of fish to be caught in the area but the Bulgarian trawlers are catching the fish which could be used to create jobs here if a little foresight were used.</P>
      <P>We must get our marketing right.  A perennial problem in Ireland is the lack of expertise in this industry.  Until we get our marketing right &mdash; not only the export market but the home market too, where consumption has fallen dramatically &mdash; the fishing industry will not reach the stage it should be at.  Again I ask the Minister to ensure that this problem is looked into.</P>
      <P>I fear for the future of this industry, more so since last night when the Minister made as insipid a speech as we have heard in this House.  He did not appear to be interested in what we were discussing.  If this is the attitude of the Minister for Fisheries, it does not augur well for the future of fishing.</P>

      <P>With five job losses per boat, that would be a total of about 145. At a meeting I recently attended with Deputy Denis Gallagher and others we were informed that some of those repossessed boats are resold to Northern Ireland people for a song and they in turn sell them to fishermen in Scotland.  That is a despicable situation.  Not only has the Exchequer lost but we have put people out of work and deprived them of a decent living.</P>
      <P>BIM have paid £722,000 rent for an office in Dún Laoghaire which is not yet occupied and, believe it or not, they are now ready to pay another £750,000 for staff to be transferred to that office.  I have here a report on the inspection carried out in these new offices in Dún Laoghaire on 1 March 1984 by a very reputable architect.  Some of the findings are as follows:</P>
      <P>Structural Matters.</P>
      <P>A large crack is evident in the edge beam over the access door to the balcony of the fifth floor.  This crack, which could not be described as hairline, appears to go right through the beam and extends into the adjacent roof slab.  There is evidence of concrete crumbling in the vicinity of the crack. If the roof slab is a two-way span &mdash; and only original engineer's drawings can confirm this &mdash; then this beam supports the roof, in which case the structural integrity of the building is in question.</P>
      <P>This is the new office on which £1.5 million has already been spent.  No wonder the staff do not want to go there.</P>
      <P>Architectural Matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is evidence of internal roof leaks.  Because of the particular roof <Col N="1305" /> construction with insulation on top, the last layer was impossible to inspect.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to state:</P>
    <P>I understand that an attempt to remedy the roof leaks was carried out by the original builder, Crampton, not by repairing the leaks but by fixing a metal tray to the underside of the roof to bring the water out.</P>
    <P>This gets better and better.  The report continues:</P>
    <P>The windows are very badly fitted in places.  I noticed daylight between the sash and the frame in one instance and I was unable to push the sash closed. These windows will be a source of considerable draughts when the building becomes operational.</P>
    <P>Recommendations.</P>
    <P>I would strongly recommend that a structural engineer's report be got on this building in relation to the items I have listed.  This will require the removal of existing ceilings and plaster finishes.  The roof should be stripped temporarily of its insulation and smooth stones to enable a thorough inspection.</P>

Something is wrong in the board when some person on the staff can hand this report to me.  It has been compiled by a very reputable person.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to get the marketing situation in order because only 3 per cent of the total allocation of £15 million is spent on marketing.  That is a national disgrace.  I am sorry I have not more time to speak because I have an excellent brief prepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity I have not more than five minutes to relate some facts about the fishing industry.  Through the years it has been treated as a cinderella industry.  Much talk but no action seems to have been the policy of successive Governments.  We have over 9,000 fishermen but only 2,000 people are employed in the processing of fish.  This is a sad indictment of years of native Government.  For every one fisherman engaged in the industry in Denmark there are eight engaged in fish processing. Surely it would not be too much to ask that the same conditions should obtain here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Side by side with the development of fisheries must go the development of harbours and landing facilities.  Schull Harbour in south-west Cork is a glaring example of that necessity.  As far back as 1919 while still under British rule plans were afoot for the development of this harbour.  When you, a Cheann Comhairle, were in charge of fisheries you made vital progress in regard to getting the harbour extended and repaired and it is a pity your activities were hampered by a change of Government in 1981.  Conditions <Col N="1307" /> there would not be as they are today had you been Minister for Fisheries. A fishing harbour without a decent pier is like a port without a decent dock. Surely it is not too much to ask the Minister that landing facilities be made available in a harbour facilitating fishing boats valued at between £2.5 million and £3 million.  It is a sad reflection that successive Governments have pumped almost £14 million into the development of Howth Harbour and completely forgotten about the fishermen of south-west Cork, particularly in Schull.</P>
    <P>The sooner the better we realise the serious implications of this neglect in the event of a storm.  In such an event it could cost £5 million to replace lost fishing boats as well as £1 million to construct a pier.  God forbid that this should happen but when the jug goes to the well it can be broken.  I appeal to the Minister to expedite this extension to Schull pier.  I will not stay quiet until the work is under way.</P>
    <P>It is well known that foreign trawlers are marauding our fishing beds.  Instead of trying to hamper the poor unfortunate fisherman trying to fish a few salmon during the summer season, the Minister should send the patrol boats after the Dutch, French and Danish super-trawlers who are ravaging stocks off our south-west coast.  The fishery protection vessels should be apprehending these manufacturing ships, as well as those from Korea and Japan, instead of interfering with the poor unfortunate fisherman trying to eke out a living to support his wife and family in frugal circumstances.</P>
    <P>We have a very sound man at the helm in Deputy O'Toole the Minister for Fisheries. Given the chance he and the junior Minister, Deputy D'Arcy, will benefit the fishing industry and give us support so far as the cost of oil is concerned.  That is another very important subject which I hope will be dealt with by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. D'Arcy) Michael D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. D'Arcy)</NameTxt>
      <P>During the course of this debate a number of points were raised to which I should like to reply. <Col N="1308" /> It will not be possible for me to go into every detail.  Even in 20 minutes it would be impossible for me to cover the different complaints which were made.  I will pick out the ones I think are important and reply to them.  The Minister and I have been seriously concerned about the marketing situation since taking office.  It is evident that any improvement in demand and prices will benefit the fishermen directly.  As the Minister indicated last night, an advisory group comprising representatives of all sectors of the industry and the State agencies involved have been meeting regularly under my chairmanship.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the group are: to examine and identify available means to secure immediate increased sales of fish, both fresh and processed, at home and abroad so as to secure higher returns to the primary producer and the processor.  One of the main functions of the group is to co-ordinate the efforts of the fishermen, processors, exporters and the State agencies involved in fish marketing. In this the group have met with considerable success.  Under the auspices of the group a daily supply and market information service has been set up which, utilising the services of BIM, will provide information on quantities and prices of fish from auction centres around the coast, and provide information in regard to landing places where fish may be or is likely to be in surplus.  This is a very important point.  This type of information was never available before.</P>
      <P>A sub-committee on herring marketing has also been set up to review the overall herring marketing position and to draw up a marketing action programme because of the serious difficulties being experienced in exporting herring.  I am very pleased with the all round co-operation being given by the various interests, and the progress made to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The home market also offers potential for further development.  This is not being overlooked.  Recently I received a report on the domestic fish market from BIM following on a comprehensive survey of consumer attitudes carried out during 1983 together with an assessment of fish distribution.  This report has confirmed <Col N="1309" /> the prospects for the expansion of domestic consumption of fish.  However, such expansion would mainly benefit our white fish and shellfish sales and our bulk landings of pelagic species will still have to be disposed of on the export market.</P>
    <P>This is the first time an attempt has been made to bring the entire industry around the one table.  When this body were being set up the industry was looked at very carefully.  I am glad to say that practically everybody with any interest in the fishing industry is on that board.  We asked the organisations to select their own people.  The organisations are as follows: The exporters, the fishermen, the processors, the co-ops, the retail fish industry, the IFO, my own Department and the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism who have a direct input from CTT.  I am prepared to accept that the fish marketing advisory committee cannot sell every fish.  They are there to co-ordinate the services available.  Some extraordinary things came up before the board and some solutions were found.</P>
    <P>As everybody is aware, we have a very serious problem in the Nigerian market in relation to the sale of mackerel.  This is being followed up by the board, the Minister and the embassy in Nigeria.  We are hoping licences will be made available in the very near future.  The Minister is going on a trip to Japan, as he informed the Dáil last night, to look at fish sales in Japan.  I am not trying to be critical of my predecessor, Deputy Daly, who got the Nigerian market and did a very good job there, but it is very bad for us to have all our eggs in one basket.  Ninety per cent of our mackerel sales are to the Nigerian market.  The Government have collapsed and the army have taken over.  The licences have not been submitted to my Department to allow for the importation of mackerel into Nigeria.  Diversification is very important in the sales market.  We have 100,000 tonnes of mackerel to be sold.  That is a huge amount of fish.  I am hopeful that I will be able to make a trip very shortly to some of the east European countries with a view to selling mackerel and herring.</P>
    <P>Like some of the Deputies I too am <Col N="1310" /> seriously concerned at the high level of arrears on boat loans.  The board are examining ways and means of improving the situation.  Deputies can rest assured that each case will be examined on its merits and it will be only as a last resort that vessels will be re-possessed.  Deputy Walsh referred in particular to skippers in his area who purchased vessels with loans repayable in sterling.  It has always been a condition that the skippers themselves carry the effects of currency changes and it would not be possible to make an exception in these cases.  I must point out, however, that the terms of these loans were very favourable in that the cost of vessels was reasonable and the rate of interest applicable was much more favourable than that obtaining in Ireland at that time.</P>
    <P>The rate of interest ranged from 9 per cent to 11½ per cent.  When other businesses had to carry rates of interest of 18 per cent and 20 per cent in 1981 and 1982 the rate of interest for the purchase of boats remained at 11 per cent.  That was a very favourable rate at that time and it still remains at 11 per cent.</P>
    <P>I understand that Deputy H. Byrne said BIM were interested in bookkeeping at any cost.  That is completely incorrect. Deputy Begley also criticised BIM. There is absolutely no basis for these criticisms.  I have worked with BIM, their officials and the chief executive officer, Dr. Meaney, and I have nothing but the height of praise for them.  They co-operated with me.  There is no use in blaming BIM.  They are a State agency working under the control of the Department. They are a development agency and they are trying to do two or three jobs with inadequate funds.  Down through the years they have not been given adequate funds.  Some of the criticisms of BIM are very unfair.</P>
    <P>In a previous debate I gave an undertaking that, if a genuine fisherman made a genuine effort to repay his loan, his boat would not be repossessed by BIM. That still stands.  I said that if Deputies felt people were being harassed by BIM this would get the personal attention of the Minister and myself.  Since that debate we have not had one complaint <Col N="1311" /> from Deputies in Opposition or Deputies in our own parties.  Surely that is an indication that BIM are making a reasonable attempt to do the job.  As in every other industry, there are cowboys in the fishing industry too, and these are people we are not prepared to support, but we will support, as we have always supported, the genuine fisherman in respect of any problems he may have with his boat repayments. The Minister is of the same mind as myself on this matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne expressed concern for the draft net fishermen on the River Slaney. I assure the Deputy that he need not concern himself further, because the Minister has agreed to allow an extension in the draft net season on the east coast for one week up to 20 August.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is easy to say that one week may not be much use in this context, but the people concerned are very glad of that extension.  We must have regard to the question of conservation.  I had meetings with the Slaney fishermen in particular and they asked me for a one-week extension.  That may come as information to Deputy Browne, but it is the position in relation to the River Slaney. I would point out that this situation applies also to the craft, loop and snap net fishermen.  It takes in the Duncannon area.  If we were to allow an open season, we could forget about conservation, and the conservation of salmon is vital.  If we do not have such conservation, the species will not continue to exist.  The people concerned are very pleased about the extra week.  We found that the draft net men particularly were getting a lesser percentage of the catch of salmon in the past five years.  I would point out also that from 30 March, eel fishermen using fyke nets, under licence, upstream and downstream at the Wexford Bridge area will be allowed to fish during the period April to November.  In 1979 a by-law was introduced whereby they were not allowed fish for eels south of the Wexford Bridge.  After receiving deputations from the eel fishermen concerned, I spoke with <Col N="1312" /> the Minister and he gave favourable consideration to removing the by-law. This will be of much benefit to the fishermen concerned.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne referred also to the Celtic Sea.  I take this opportunity to thank the Celtic Sea Management Committee for the excellent manner in which herring fishing was regulated by them in the Celtic Sea during the past fishing season. Their efforts were a fine example of what can be achieved by co-operation between the various interests in the fishing industry.  It is proposed to have discussions later with these various interests with a view to having the arrangements continued next season.  The 1984 quota remains for the present at the 1983 level. However, this will be subject to review later by the Council of Ministers when more up-to-date scientific advice is received from ICES.  I am confident that arising from this advice it will be possible for the Minister to negotiate a higher level of quota for herring in this fishery later in the year.</P>
      <P>I understand that there was some criticism yesterday of the quotas in the Celtic Sea.  I would remind the House that the quota in this area for 1984 is 8,100 tonnes and that the Irish quota is 7,000 tonnes or 87 per cent of the total catch for the season.  This is a very favourable situation for our fishermen.  It was negotiated by the Minister.  He must be complimented on having done an excellent job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, while Deputy Daly was in office.  I am not saying otherwise, but so far as we were concerned there was the demand for several fishing countries to fish in the Celtic Sea.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>We succeeded in putting an end to that demand, but what is important to us is that the arrangement is very favourable to our fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are continuing to improve the infrastructure that is so vital to the development of the fishing industry. <Col N="1313" /> Despite the present financial constraints, substantial funds are being provided to improve our harbour facilities, to provide ice plants and to re-equip the State's Decca navigation stations.  Sums totalling more than £3 million are being provided for these purposes in the current year.  New telephone exchanges are being provided in Castletownbere and Killybegs.  This is a much needed improvement in communications, which are so vital in terms of the marketing of fish.</P>
    <P>There was mention last evening of the need for improvement of a number of harbours. There was reference, for instance, to Schull.  Deputy Sheehan is very interested in that harbour.  I am fully aware of the situation there, and repairs to the pier are being considered for inclusion in the current year's harbour programme.  I must explain, however, that arising from works in hand already, a considerable part of the £2.7 million provided this year is committed already and that it will not be possible to include the many improvement schemes which we would wish to see commence this year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne referred to Kilmore Harbour.  I inspected the pier there in August last and found that it was in a deplorable condition, that it was in imminent danger of being washed away. Immediately I contacted my Department and in co-operation with Wexford County Council £60,000 has been spent on protection work at the harbour.  I am considering a further grant of £50,000 to complete the work that was started there, work that is absolutely necessary.  If we had not gone ahead with the work I venture to say that the pier would not be there now.  A very big problem at Kilmore Harbour also was the fact that the sea was washing in across the harbour and washing out some of the boats.  Three or four boats were broken up in this way in the past couple of years.  I hope that when the work is completed there will not be a repetition of any such incidents.</P>
    <P>The question of submarine activity off our coast is not a matter that is within the competence of the Department of Fisheries and Forestry.  However, because of <Col N="1314" /> its possible effect on fisheries I have personally taken a deep interest in the problem and I have been in touch with the Minister for Communications on the subject. The Minister made a statement in the House recently and I do not propose to dwell on the matter except to say that my Department have had no approach from the owner of the <i>Sheralga</i> in regard to the delay in payment of compensation by the British government, but if the facts of the case are submitted to me I will do what I can to expedite payment.</P>
    <P>Investment in fish processing is continuing at a reasonably satisfactory level. Last year 11 fish-processing projects were approved for EEC FEOGA aid, amounting to £2.6 million.</P>
    <P>The IDA policy in regard to fish processing is contained in the document, <i>Strategy for Agricultural Processing Industry,</i> which was issued by them in 1983.  The basic approach is to encourage secondary rather than primary processing in the future.  Any worthwhile fish-processing project can expect the full support of my Department.</P>
    <P>The demand on the European markets in particular is not for processed fish.  It is for first processing but not for secondary processing.  This has to be taken into consideration in any expansion of the processing side.  We have considered the figures closely with a view to ascertaining where we could have an input into that area.  The demand is extraordinary in that everyone is looking for raw fish, so to speak, and that position will not change. We must yield to the demand of the consumer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Joe Walsh asked for clarification in regard to the court arbitration award to Baltimore boatyard against BIM.  This decision was only conveyed to BIM on 23 March and its implications are still being examined.  Because of the possibility of further legal proceedings I do not propose to elaborate on the matter at this stage.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proposed research unit at Kinsale, the position is that while the Department located the owner of the property abroad it has not been possible to purchase the selected site.  A suitable <Col N="1315" /> alternative site is not available in the area.</P>
    <P>We accept that not everything is rosy in the fishing industry, but we have taken the marketing in hand and we are waiting for the report of the Central Consultative Committee.  When that report is available its recommendations will be closely assessed and no time will be lost in putting into operation its recommendations. We are giving that guarantee to the House.</P>

      <P>Bá mhaith liom cúpla focal a chur leis an méid a dúradh ón taobh seo den Teach aréir agus a chur in iúl don Dáil agus don Phobal an drochbhail atá ar cheist na hiascaireachta i láthair na huaire.</P>
      <P>I have listened for the past 20 minutes or so to the Minister of State and I am now even more depressed in so far as the whole question of the fishing industry is concerned.  He has not put forward one constructive suggestion or idea relating to what should be happening in the fishing industry at the present time.  The Minister of State seemed to be concerned only with his own little corner in Wexford, what was happening on the Slaney, the eel fisheries and Kilmore Quay.  He did not broaden the scope of the debate to let us know what proposals, if any, are with his Department in relation to the future of the fishing industry.  As we all know the fishing industry is at an all time low.  Stocks of white fish in inshore waters have declined considerably and marketing and prices are no better than they were ten years ago.  Fishermen who devoted their lives to the expansion of an industry which brought an improved standard of living to many ports in the west of Ireland are today, despite their best efforts, faced with the problem of tying up their boats and in many instances having them repossessed because they find it impossible to continue to meet their commitments.  This has been admitted by Deputies on both sides of the House and it speaks for itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Catches and prices are not keeping pace with the many overheads fishermen have to meet.  If something is not done <Col N="1316" /> very quickly this very promising and what was at one time a fairly lucrative source of employment for our fishermen is absolutely doomed.  We have to admit this and, as I said earlier, from what we have heard from the Minister there does not seem to be any hope or any future in relation to what could be done for this industry.  Seeing this happening without any action, without any encouragement and without any glimmer of hope for the future from the Minister for Fisheries or the Government is depressing for all sections of the industry.  We all admit that for a number of years it was not possible to plan for the future of the industry because of the uncertainty in the EEC position.  Now that a common fisheries policy has been decided on it is possible to plan for the industry.  One would have thought that at this stage the Minister and the Department would be putting plans before the House in relation to what should be happening to the future of the industry, but here we have a clear example of the old Irish saying, &ldquo;ag ligean a gcuid maidí le sruth&rdquo;.  Sin atá dá dhéanamh ag an Aire agus ag an Rialtas. Tá siad ag ligean a gcuid maidí le sruth agus tá tionscal na hiascaireachta ag dul go tóin poill.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil believe that the time has come for a new and positive approach to planning for the future and expansion of this industry, which should be second only to agriculture in Ireland.  We suggest that immediate steps be taken to set up a proper research unit, that we have full involvement in exploratory fishing, that immediate steps be taken to set up proper marketing structures.  The Minister referred to this, but I am not satisfied that what he mentioned in the House is what should be done in relation to this matter.  I cannot accept that BIM have been doing what they should in this particular sector.  We get glossy reports from them, as has been said by Deputy Begley and others, but facts and figures are there.  I can go back to my own time as secretary of a fishing co-operative when we tried to establish local markets.  When we asked BIM for help at that particular time in filleting and in helping to set up local markets we got very little assistance. <Col N="1317" /> The manager of that particular co-op can today come along with the same story. That is ten or 12 years later and the position has not improved.  It is a sad reflection on BIM that they have not been doing more in this particular sector.</P>
    <P>We believe that plans should be put in hand to have harbour and processing facilities provided to keep pace with the improved catches and fleet expansion. We suggest that in research funds be made available immediately to determine what our fishing stocks are.  We cannot plan for the industry unless we have proper research facilities, unless we know exactly what stocks there are, how they can be saved, how they can be fished and taken out at any particular time.  A proper research unit will be able to determine the amount of fish which can be taken out and the amount that can be conserved.</P>
    <P>I mentioned this in the House before and I believe it is worth mentioning again &mdash; it is important that all of us take an example from what has been done by the people of Iceland in relation to research. They have seven or eight boats employed full-time.  They have about 200 people involved in this important business of research and they determine the amount of any particular species that can be taken out by their fleet at any particular time. As a result of the research carried out by them they have succeeded in locating other stocks of fish that were not traditional to the Icelandic fishermen and in this way have helped to conserve the traditional type stocks.  At the same time they have managed to provide employment for their fishermen at a time when they would not be involved in their traditional type fishing.</P>
    <P>It is important for us to have boats involved in exploratory fishing.  We have boats tied up at the present time and they are not being used.  I believe BIM and the Department could use many of those boats to go out and explore our coastal area, find out what areas can be used for trawling, what areas can be used for other types of fishing, try to locate new stocks and so on.  There does not seem to be any planning or any thought put into this area.  It is an important one and the one <Col N="1318" /> which will determine the whole future of the industry.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention some of the problems facing fishermen at the moment.  This ties in with what I have been saying already.  I know two fishermen at the moment who are fishing 65 foot boats.  They concentrated entirely on fishing for herring.  They did not find it possible, because of depressed markets and depressed stocks to make a decent living in herring fishing and they found it necessary to engage in trawling.  They have now located bays about 40 miles from Achill where they are fishing with boats from Killybegs, Greencastle, Burtonport and with French and Spanish boats.  They have to use a type of gear they were not accustomed to using, and in some of the grounds they are fishing they have to depend on markings they got from French fishermen.  It is a terrible state of affairs that we have not charted and marked out fishing areas within our own 50 mile region where our fishermen who want to diversify and want to take up this type fishing can go and try to do something worthwhile for themselves.</P>
    <P>The problems facing fishermen who have to diversify and to get into new gear is a serious one.  One of those fishermen told me that getting the necessary gear, trawl boards, new types of net, wharfs and so on cost them in the region of £12,000.  For a man already in serious trouble because of his income from herring this was a very big burden to face. The Department or BIM should have some kind of system where grants could be made available to a fisherman faced with that kind of situation when he has to change from one type of fishing to another, but this does not happen.  As I mentioned already, such a fisherman did not get any assistance in relation to the fishing grounds and the change-over he had to make from herring fishing to trawling. In industry there is in-service training and programmes are made available to people to change their machinery or to new methods in their production lines, it is clear that this does not happen in the case of fishermen.  It shows a lack of imagination and the general apathy which exists in relation to the thinking on <Col N="1319" /> this whole question of the fishing industry. This is not good enough and we cannot accept it any longer.  It has been handled in a haphazard, listless way. Guidelines are not given and it is a hit and miss affair.</P>
    <P>Marketing is a joke.  Fishermen have no control or say in the prices they are getting for fish.  I speak from experience and I can relate this to the co-operative in my constituency.  When they put their fish on a lorry to send to Dublin or Fleetwood, where it is being sent at present, they do not know what price they are going to get.  That cannot be tolerated much longer.  At least when the farmer produces he has some indication of what he will get.</P>
    <P>We must also plan for our inshore fishermen, those who depend on inshore waters.  It is time for the fishermen in larger boats to fish with the foreigners and get away from scratching the rocks as they have been doing.  By protecting the inshore fishermen we can protect our stocks and spawning grounds and in this way help to keep a vital industry going for much longer.  We all accept that fishing is a hard, tough life, but it can be rewarding if properly approached.  The time has come to fund the industry properly, to provide all the back-up facilities already mentioned and to have proper structures to run it efficiently.  BIM should be restructured as a development board and given full responsibility for the expansion of the industry.  There is too much fragmentation at present which leads to delays and apathy.</P>
    <P>The European Regional Fund should be used to fund various operations.  We have a determined and experienced group of fishermen who feel ignored and let down.  Given the encouragement and financial assistance necessary, they can compete with the best.  Let us now make a new start and rekindle the light left in the industry by doing something positive. An acre of sea can produce as much as an acre of land.  Now that we have some semblance of a common fisheries policy, a serious and determined effort on the part of the Government can add greatly to our resources, provide many new jobs <Col N="1320" /> and revitalise our fishing towns and villages. We have not taken this industry as seriously as we should have.  We must have new initiatives, be more forceful and thoughtful in our whole approach to the industry.  Any money spent here by the Government in developing this natural resource will be repaid tenfold and will help to revitalise fishing.  The Minister should be fully aware of what needs to be done in relation to the whole industry. I do not think that the board which the Minister of State mentioned will achieve a great deal.  We still depend on the old methods, we work through BIM and they did not do enough in the marketing end.  I do not want to knock the board, but I am not confident that they will achieve any great degree of success. Local markets can be developed more easily and perhaps the Minister would look at this.  I do not see why we should be sending fish from Achill to Dublin and then find that it is being sold in local towns.  I am grateful for having had this opportunity to speak on this matter and I hope there will be some positive thinking with regard to the future of the industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the short time available I intend to concentrate on the problems experienced by fishermen in my constituency, especially in the premier fishing port of Killybegs.  This port, unfortunately, depends entirely on its income from fishing.  Any crisis which arises within the industry has an adverse effect on the whole Killybegs community. At present we are experiencing all these effects because of the critical situation in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The biggest problem is the repossession of boats because many skippers are unable to meet their commitments to Bord Iascaigh Mhara to whom they are making repayments.  Arrears in repayments of fishermen on 31 December 1983 amounted to about £6.2 million.  It was mentioned that this was caused mainly by people referred to as cowboys.  I do not believe that all the men who are in financial difficulties at present can be classified as cowboys and there are many reasons why they are in this predicament.  Circumstances <Col N="1321" /> make it impossible for them to repay their instalments.  The present loan system will have to be restructured, otherwise these men will be out of business.</P>
    <P>The cost of oil has increased by 114 per cent since 1980 while average fish prices have only gone up by 14 per cent in the same period.  The cost of oil is the highest overhead which boats have and this astronomical increase is having further detrimental effects on their net incomes. There should be subsidisation for fishermen in this respect.</P>
    <P>Many of the boats which were dependent on herring fishing have now become almost obsolete due to poor demand on the Continent.  The general upswing in EEC herring landings and the high level of imports from Sweden and Norway have all contributed to low incomes.  If fishermen are going to survive they have no option but to change over to white fishing.  In order to do that they have to refurbish and restructure their boats at a high cost.  With this high expenditure more grant aid should be made available for this type of conversion.</P>
    <P>There is a great need and urgency to research the potential of the home market with regard to sales of fish.  I understand that something in the region of £20 million worth of fish was imported last year.  It must be patently obvious that we should be in a position here to substitute these imports as the raw material is readily available at home.  More finance should be made available for such promotion.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned trading with Nigeria and he said it was a poor thing to have all our eggs in one basket. However, at present it is our only market and is still our most important outlet for mackerel which is posing great problems for the industry.  Since the military takeover in Nigeria food and fish imports have been given priority status but despite this fish exporters here have been unable to secure import licences.  While the shorebased processors are doing their best and have continued to service other markets, business in Killybegs is slowly grinding to a halt.  But for the fact that east Europeans are prepared to buy our fish at a very <Col N="1322" /> poor price our fishermen would be out of business completely.  I know that efforts are being made to help with this matter but I stress that action must be taken to resolve the problem.</P>
    <P>The money devoted to research of our fishing grounds is small.  We are talking about £350,000 in an industry that earned £78 million last year.  We are doing the industry a disservice and we are hindering its development.  More money should be made available to help in the area of research.  Many boat-owners are in financial difficulties and their boats are tied up.  These people could be involved in this research work.  It would create employment and in time it would generate more income.  The potential is there and it should be tapped.  I ask the Minister to make more money available to assist the industry in these difficult times.</P>
    <P>Last year we had the problem of monofilament netting but this year there is another serious problem that nobody seems to be tackling: I refer to the problem we have with seals.  Some conservationists may be anti-culling but, at the same time, the seals have devastated salmon stocks.  This matter will have to be considered realistically.  In Donegal Bay there are 200 or 300 seals.  I hope the news is true that there will be a draft net extension nationwide, not just in County Wexford.  That would be welcome but I think a few more weeks would have been accepted more graciously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to say a few brief words in relation to the fishing industry.  Coming from a county noted for its fishing exploits, both sea and inland, I am very concerned about the continued lack of progress in the fishing industry.  The attitude of the Government to the fishing industry is nothing short of disgraceful. Despite the best efforts of the fishermen and other interested bodies, they have allowed the industry to run into a state of decline.  I believe that fishing, like agriculture, is one of our great natural resources.  It should be taken by the scruff of the neck, overhauled and developed to ensure that its full potential is realised <Col N="1323" /> in the interests of the people of this country.</P>
      <P>With the proper development of the fishing industry an extra 4,000 to 5,000 jobs could be created.  The potential for job creation through the various spin-off industries that could be developed is enormous.  In relation to sea fishing, one could say that the fleet has become more modernised and that fishermen are given a sound basic training through the help of BIM.  However, we find that today many of the fleet owners are in serious financial difficulties and are unable to meet repayments on their loans.  The Minister must consider this matter seriously. I contend it is not acceptable to encourage fishermen to purchase a more modern fleet and then find that the markets are not there.  As a result, the fishermen, particularly because of high interest rates and high energy costs, find that their investment has become a millstone around their necks.</P>
      <P>In conjunction with fleet development, the Minister must look to the development of a proper marketing strategy, with more research and more emphasis on creating a better home market and also broadening our export markets.  There must be more emphasis on the non-traditional species of fish.  Fish processing has tremendous scope for development and job creation.  The Minister must ensure that this area is given the proper back-up support in relation to investment and grant-aid to companies already involved in the processing industry and also to other companies that may wish to set up fish processing plants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lett and Company in Wexford are employing 95 people and they have become a major success story in the development of the mussel industry. They hope to increase their share of the market this year and, in turn, this will mean more jobs.  However, this industry in Wexford is now under a serious threat due to lack of landing facilities at Wexford harbour.  Not one penny has been spent on landing facilities in the harbour in the past 30 years.  At present the whole quay is in danger of collapse.  In fact, half of the quay is unusable and the local <Col N="1324" /> fishermen are concerned that unless immediate temporary repairs are carried out they will have no landing facilities next year.  Are the Government going to allow Lett and Company to go to the wall because of their failure to make funds available for the development of Wexford harbour?  It seems that CIE were the body originally responsible for the maintenance of the quay but they have failed to honour their commitments.  I suggest to the Minister that he take action against CIE or else ask the Department to take over responsibility of carrying out major repairs to Wexford harbour.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, referred to Kilmore Quay.  Some development work has been carried out since he became Minister of State but we are asking that dredging work be carried out. There has been development work during the years on this quay by Fianna Fáil Governments.  I ask the Minister of State and the Minister to arrange to have this dredging work carried out.</P>
    <P>The whole area of salmon fishing and salmon conservation measures have become controversial in recent years. Illegal salmon fishing has become a very contentious issue and there is a widely held viewpoint that such type of fishing is acceptable in some parts of the country. The introduction of monofilament netting, particularly along the west coast, is causing havoc with salmon stocks in the eastern region.  The use of these nets for salmon fishing is illegal and yet they are being used extensively on a 24-hour basis by fishermen in certain areas and the Minister continues to ignore it.  At a recent meeting on conservation the Minister was informed by some of the fishermen that they were using illegal nets and he admitted that the present laws were not being enforced due to inadequate staff.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has said the draft net fishermen are happy with the present situation.  In the past two weeks these fishermen in Wexford have sent a letter to the Minister asking for a fair crack of the whip.  They stated that, because it takes the salmon longer to reach the east coast, they considered the season there should start six weeks later and end six <Col N="1325" /> weeks later, namely, 15 September, as was the tradition.  It is quite obvious that the draft net fishermen in Wexford are not happy with the situation.</P>
    <P>The finance made available to the Eastern Fisheries Board for the coming year is totally inadequate and it has caused grave concern to board members.  Last year, for example, in the non-pay allocation area an amount of £65,000 was spent in providing transport for fishery officers carrying out their patrolling and protection duties.  This year only £35,000 was allocated which means that officers will be on a three-day week.  There has been no allocation of money for pollution officers and we now have the farcical situation of having pollution officers and laboratories but no equipment.  This situation could only happen in Ireland.  It shows that Government have no interest in the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>The main function of the fishery officers is to combat poaching and pollution but, due to a lack of funds, the Eastern Fisheries Board will be unable to carry out their role as the protector of our rivers.  The embargo on staff has also played havoc with the board's operations. Five years ago in Wexford we had six fishery officers, today we have three. Recently the inspector retired and, due to the one in three embargo, he cannot be replaced.  The present position regarding Wicklow-Wexford is that we have three officers on half time without supervision covering the River Slaney.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that so many Members where anxious to make a contribution to this debate is an indication of the importance of the industry to the economy.  Almost 12,500 people are engaged in the industry.  In fact, a higher percentage of our labour force are involved in the fishing industry here than in any other country in the EEC with the exception of Denmark.  Our fishing industry has grown and developed in the last ten years and total fish exports in 1982 were in excess of £73 million.  The fish industry here contributes about 1 per cent of GNP, an indication of its importance. Nevertheless, we should not fool <Col N="1326" /> ourselves into thinking that everything is in order.  We are all aware that fleets have difficulties in meeting their expenses and costs.  One of the major difficulties is the price of fuel, a matter that was referred to by previous speakers.  I understand that the price of fuel to fishing vessels increased by 300 per cent between 1975 and 1982 and that during the same period the price fishermen got for their fish has only kept up with the increase in the CPI. I understand that it takes 50 per cent of the income of some of the owners of the boats to meet their fuel costs.</P>
      <P>I am amazed that a golden opportunity was allowed slip some weeks ago to do something about this.  At that time the oil companies decided to reduce the price of petrol to retailers and consumers but they ignored the fishermen.  The companies were blinkered into looking into the matter from their own narrow point of view without considering the lot of our fishermen. Had our fishermen been granted a reduction of 4p or 5p per gallon on diesel it would have meant between £500,000 and £750,000 to the fishing industry, an indirect investment in that industry.  I am not blaming the Government for that. The blame lies with the oil companies. One of them was trying to get ahead of the other.  Esso were followed by Shell and they all forgot about the fishermen. If the price of petrol or oil is reduced again I hope the companies concerned will not forget the fishermen.  At petrol stations between Donegal and Dublin customers are offered a glass, a knife or a goblet for £10 or £20 worth of petrol.  If the companies can afford to give such items to customers why is it that they do not make concessions to fishermen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The price of fuel and other incidental costs are only symptoms of the difficulties fishermen face.  If we are serious about the industry and anxious to see it developed the time has come when the fishermen, the processors, the buyers, sellers and exporters will have to get together to work out a plan for the next four or five years putting forward definite targets that can be reached.  This is an opportune time to prepare such a plan because we have negotiated successfully a Common Fisheries Policy.  We have a definite framework <Col N="1327" /> in which to work.  Emphasis should be placed on the processing end of the industry because 90 per cent of our processing is primary processing.  If we want to increase the number of people employed in that area we must go in for more advanced processing.  We should also consider marketing.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Sheehan's eloquent plea on behalf of Schull pier and I should like to make a plea in connection with some of the landing facilities in Donegal south west, from Bun an Inbhear to Killybegs. I was disappointed with the wording in the motion before the House.  It is negative and sets out to condemn the Government.  We must be positive about the fishing industry and co-operate.  I was pleased to hear Deputy Daly's positive contribution last night.</P>

I was disappointed that the Minister of State was in the House for a few minutes prior to his contribution and left the House when he had concluded.  I was of the opinion that the Minister for Fisheries would be responsible for affairs in Europe and that his Minister of State would be responsible for the industry at home.  It is not hard to understand why the industry is in its present state when the Minister of State will not wait in the House for the debate.  He is interested only in his small pocket in Wexford, catching eels and repairing some small harbours.  He has forgotten that as Minister of State he is responsible for the entire country and not that constituency only.</P>

I do not make any apology for adding my name to the motion before the House and those who suggest that the wording is not positive are not speaking on behalf of the fishermen.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the industry, which includes producers, processors and others, was never in a more critical situation than it is today.  However, the Government, the Minister and his Minister of State, have ignored this most serious problem and hope it will resolve itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Government assumed office 15 months ago they have ignored the industry although they were made well aware of the problems facing it by Opposition Deputies and the organisations involved in the industry. This most important industry employs 12,000 people and is based on a renewable resource.  It is of vital importance to the economy.  Its contribution to our GNP is the second highest of any maritime country in the EEC but, unfortunately, it ranks lowest in the priorities of the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary to refer to a period when too much emphasis was laid on increasing the total landings of fish.  At that time the idea was to ensure maximum landings prior to agreement on a Common Fisheries Policy.  The thinking at that time was that if there was an increase in the landings it was necessary to increase investment in the fleet and double the catch recommended under The Hague Agreement.  The investment in fleets, particularly in vessels in the 60 foot to 85 foot region, contributed largely to the difficulties the industry is now in. The numerous 60 foot to 85 foot boats are not in a position to fish viably or profitably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1329" /> It appears to me that at a late stage of the negotiations for a Common Fisheries Policy BIM and the Department of Fisheries felt it was necessary to reduce investment in fishing boats.  Therefore, we have had a reduction in the number of new boats in the past two or three years.  When there was proper investment in new boats there were greater landings of fish.  Unfortunately, fuel prices increased, accompanied by a fall in fish prices.  This has affected the fleet's net income.  It resulted in a reduction in loan repayments to BIM, and this was not the fault of the fishermen, or the &ldquo;cowboys&rdquo; as the Minister of State referred to them. The Minister should apologise to the House and to the fishermen whom he referred to as cowboys.  If the remark had been heard at the time I believe the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would have asked the Minister to withdraw it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I never interrupt them or anyone else.  As I was saying, these difficulties resulted in a reduction in loan repayments, and now 80 per cent of the boats in the 40 foot to 85 foot range are in arrears of payments to BIM.  Oil prices have been increased dramatically in the past ten years, from about £23 per tonne to the present £270 per tonne.  In the same period prices of fish in real terms fell by about 15 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the industry finds itself in this critical situation the Government continue to ignore the problems.  I will suggest what action should be taken, because <Col N="1330" /> it is absolutely necessary.  An example is the action taken by Fianna Fáil in 1981 when they provided £1.6 million to enable BIM to freeze all arrears for two years.  It did not cure all of the ills but it prevented the total collapse which would have occurred otherwise.  The Minister should take some corrective action, but on a much greater scale.  It is scandalous that when petrol prices were reduced by 9p neither the Minister for Fisheries nor the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism made any plea on behalf of the fishermen to the oil companies. It is not too late, and I ask the Minister to make representations to the oil companies.</P>

      <P>He was before he joined the party.  Short-term fire brigade action should be taken.  Later, long-term solutions can be provided through the FEOGA fund.  There is money available there for exploratory fishing development and the refurbishing of our fleet, including the scrapping of obsolete boats. We must try to get maximum benefits from these funds.  As the Minister knows, our fishermen have special problems, and there is provision in the Treaty of Rome and The Hague Agreement to take cognisance of our special problem.  We could restructure all loans to viable boats which are in arrears.  These loans could be renegotiated so that there would not be a need to repossess vessels.  We could then start afresh without the continuous threat of legal proceedings hanging over fishermen's heads.  They could then concentrate fully on fishing, which could then become profitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even obsolete boats could qualify under the scheme for scrapping them. They could be used for research, to identify new fishing grounds, plankton content of waters, temperature and other information which would be particularly useful if fed into a central station.  We must strive for a better deal for mackerel and herring quotas and species of white fish.  We must ensure that our quotas of horse mackerel and blue whiting will be realistic, because when these species <Col N="1331" /> come on-stream they will be of great benefit to the fishing industry.  Quotas have not been set so far, but figures have become available to us which indicate that the Dutch have been given a quota for horse mackerel of 42,000 tonnes as against 100 tonnes for Ireland.</P>

      <P>I hope this is not indicative of the quotas we will be given when quotas are agreed on.  The Minister must ensure that there will be research to identify the areas in which horse mackerel and blue whiting are available. Beforehand, an extensive programme of market research must be embarked on to ensure that when these fish come on-stream they will not be used for fishmeal. It was unfortunate to hear the Minister of State say tonight that it is difficult to sell finished products in Europe, that we have to go further afield to try to find markets.  Fish worth £20 million, in their finished state, are being imported here. Therefore, we do not have to leave our shores to find a market.  The Minister last night said that a marketing advisory committee are considering the position.  I suggest that BIM should avail of the offices of CTT throughout the world.  I do not cast aspersions on BIM but at the moment they have only one office, in Paris, outside their Dublin headquarters. I hope the advisory body will consider this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industry is in difficulty at the moment because of problems in Nigeria. There has been a delay in the issue of licences to importers there.  This is causing great concern here.  It has resulted in a drop in the intake of mackerel by processors for lack of holding space.  The <Col N="1332" /> Minister should be concentrating on this instead of going off to Japan while the Minister of State has been talking about going to the eastern bloc.

      <P>We will have a debate next week and I will refer to salmon.  Contrast this with the approach and the contribution from the Government side of the House.  Any impartial observer would have to agree that Fianna Fáil have shown the way forward, that we are the only alternative Government and that we would look after the interests of the fishermen.  I challenge the Minister to debate with me in this House or in any other forum the problems of the salmon fishermen.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Knocklyon (Dublin) New Community School.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>On 10 February 1984 the greatest turnabout by the Department of Education in many years was perpetrated on the people of Knocklyon and Ballyboden.  There was anger and frustration at the news given to the people of Knocklyon on 10 February that the community school would not now be in existence until 1988.  It came as a shock and a tremendous surprise to the people of that area.  There is a long litany going back to 1977 of pledges from Ministers for Education.  Successive Ministers have said that Knocklyon would have this community school and then, out of the blue, comes this notice that it is being put off until 1988.  It is not good enough.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister for Education has not come into the House to answer this.  That is no disrespect to the Minister of State, but the Minister should be here to deal with this important issue.  Thousands of people are depending on this school and it is not good enough that the Minister for Education herself has not come in to answer this.  It is the greatest turnabout perpetrated on the people in any area in many a long year.  I do not want to take up all the time.  My colleague, Deputy Andrews and, I am sure, Deputies from the other side of the House want to get in, and we have got only a few minutes.</P>
      <P>I will not go through all the details.  In 1981 Deputy Boland said he would have the school opened in 1983 if he had a site. A couple of weeks later he had a site and there was still no sign of a schools opening. On the contrary, it was postponed, and now we are told it will not be open till 1988.  Will this go into the 1985 Estimates? Clearly it is not in the 1984 Estimates. Will the Minister change the 1984 Estimates and see that it is put in there? What are we to say to the people of Knocklyon and Ballyboden and that area?  Where are they to send their families to school in the coming years while they are waiting for this school?</P>
      <P>What is the Minister's answer to that question?  Does he know this is one of the fastest growing areas in Dublin with little or no public services, bad lighting and poor roads?  It has had a population explosion.  The Department of Education have cheek to say to this huge population in a cavalier letter that the school will not open in 1986 after all, and that it will be 1988 before it opens.  That is not good enough.  The people of Knocklyon are not accepting that.  As the public representatives for that area we are not accepting it either.</P>
      <P>I am trying to convey to the Minister the anger and frustration felt by the people of Knocklyon and by their public representatives.  Can the people of Ireland be blamed if they are cynical about politicians?  Year after year a specific promise was given about the opening of the school and then lo and behold, the Estimates are revised and there is no school.  What does the word of the Department of Education mean?  What does the word of a politician mean if a decision can be changed by the stroke of a ministerial pen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am trying to convey to the Minister the anger felt by these people.  There is a litany of broken promises in the Department of Education in regard to this school.  We are not taking no for an answer.  We have reached a crisis.  I am asking the Minister to tell us that he will put this into the 1985 Estimate, if not the 1984 Estimate, and that he will commit his Government here this evening to a firm opening date for this school for which a site has been bought for many years.  Have the Government and the Department got the guts to give all politicians the credibility which they deserve by living up to the promise they made to <Col N="1337" /> the people of Knocklyon?  Give us our community school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I am sure you will forgive the people of Knocklyon for expressing some emotion in view of the seriousness of the situation which has arisen.  This school has been promised by successive Ministers, and some were Fianna Fáil Ministers. Deputy Brennan referred to the Department of Education.  The officials of the Department are merely the servants of the Minister.  I lay the blame directly on the Minister's doorstep.  The case has been made by the community for a community school as an extension of the very successful primary school development there, and the very successful development of the community as a whole.</P>
      <P>Even if the school is to be approved in 1988, judging by the Minister's attitude it is very unlikely that if she is in office she will approve of it at that time.  Judging by the correspondence read at a meeting in Knocklyon yesterday it appears to me that the Minister has no intention whatsoever of opening the school in Knocklyon or Ballyboden.  All these things have been put aside.  This is regrettable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The roads in the area are rural roads and they are being used by very heavy traffic.  There is no possibility of young children getting up on a bicycle and travelling on dark winter mornings to the neighbouring schools which the Department suggest are available.  It has also been suggested by the Department that the fee-paying schools in the catchment area, as they call it, might provide extra places.  Some years ago I recall dealing with a similar situation in the Balally school in Dundrum.  I am glad to say the <Col N="1338" /> parish priest in Knocklyon is the same man&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The parish priest who is now helping in the campaign in Knocklyon is the same man who succeeded in getting the Minister of that day to change his mind and build the school in Balally. We have the support of the community. I deeply regret that we cannot call a vote on this issue tonight and call the bluff of the Government Deputies who are telling the people they will fight for them in their parties and do this and that.  Let them fight in their parties and let them come in here and vote with their feet for the school in Knocklyon.  The community are angry.  Deputies on this side of the House will not stand back from this issue.  We want a school in Knocklyon and we will get it.</P>

I share the anger and distress clearly expressed last night by the vast majority of the parents who live in Knocklyon.</P>

I ask the Minister and her Department to reconsider the decision made and to reinstate September 1986 as the opening date for the school.  I ask the Minister and the Department to reiterate the commitment previously given to provide the school in September 1986.</P>

      <P>I want to apologise for the absence of the Minister.  I am sure Deputies who made their case here tonight will be making representations to the Minister. I should like to be given a few minutes to put the case before the House and to reply to some of the points made.</P>
      <P>I have listened carefully to the contributions by the speakers to this debate.  I am aware, of course, of what has happened in recent years and of the request of the parents that the new community school at Knocklyon be opened as early as possible and not later than September 1985.  I am also aware, and I want to make the point clearly, that during the former Government's tenure of office, there was no specific commitment as to when building of the new school would be commenced or what year it would be opened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to a Dáil question on 15 July 1982 by Deputy Shatter the then Minister for Education stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A decision will be taken shortly on the opening date and pupil capacity of the new community school at Scholarstown Road which will cater for pupils from Knocklyon.  The architectural planning will then be initiated.  It is not possible to say at this early stage of <Col N="1340" /> planning when building will commence.</P>
    <P>At that stage, the then Minister appeared to have a problem in being specific, presumably because of the growing availability of post-primary places in the general area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>My promise is on the record of the House and I delivered on that promise.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>In drawing attention to this, I do so not to score a debating point but to emphasise that the question of when this new school would be provided has been under constant review for the past few years in the light of the declining enrolments in the area generally.  It has been so reviewed some time ago and the conclusion was that it would not be needed before 1988.  In this, Knocklyon is not the only developing area where because of the existence of schools in neighbouring areas and in the light of the most recent enrolments the provision of a post-primary school was deferred.</P>
      <P>The output of the primary schools in Knocklyon and Ballyboden is expected to increase from 106 to 161 between 1984 and 1987.  The two secondary schools in Ballyroan, Coláiste Eanna CBS and Sancta Maria Convent, and Firhouse Community College, will have a combined intake capacity of around 500 pupils per year and will have a substantial number of surplus intake places each year over the next three or four years.  In addition, Templeogue College is expected to have places each year which would be available to pupils leaving primary school in Knocklyon.  This would be apart from places which undeniably will also be available in well established schools slightly further away at Willington, De La Salle, Churchtown and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case of Knocklyon is an excellent example of what the Minister for Education is trying to achieve in the context of getting the best value from the available financial resources.  Everyone in this <Col N="1341" /> House is well aware of the financial problems not alone in financing the demand for extended educational services but in financing the overall requirements of the State.</P>
    <P>The House will also be aware from the recent debate initiated on the Minister's Programme for Action of the need to determine priorities in education and to make the system more cost-efficient and cost-effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

      <P>Now it seems to me we either &ldquo;grasp the nettle&rdquo; in particular cases or we abandon all thoughts of making the system more cost-effective and more cost-effecient.</P>
      <P>What the present Minister and her predecessors have guaranteed is that any child from the Knocklyon area seeking post-primary education will be accommodated. That guarantee stands.  Every pupil leaving primary school in Knocklyon will get a place in a neighbouring post-primary school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned earlier that the issue was under continuous review. In other words, I want to say on my own behalf and on behalf of the Minister for <Col N="1342" /> Education that the door to an earlier opening of the school is not closed.  The case will be reviewed in September next in the light of the then projected primary school leavers and the enrolments in neighbouring post-primary schools.</P>
      <P>I might add for the information of the House that the architectural planning of the new school is progressing.  The working drawings were received in my Department this very day.  When cleared, the consultants will be authorised to prepare a bill of quantities &mdash; the final stage of the planning process preparatory to the invitation of tenders.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to have a review of the needs in this area before expending over £2 million of the taxpayers' money.  As a result of the Programme for Action in Education every area is being subjected to a review.  This is necessary if we are serious about cost efficiency and cost effectiveness.</P>
