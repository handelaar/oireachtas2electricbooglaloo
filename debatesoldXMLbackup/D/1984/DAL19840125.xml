      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 5, 10, 11 and 4.  Business will be interrupted at 3.30 p.m. today to take item No. 4 and the Order will not be resumed thereafter.  By agreement the Dáil will sit later than 9 p.m. today and not later than 12 midnight to enable the Financial Resolutions, with the exception of the General Financial Resolution, to be concluded.  It is proposed that, following the budget statement of the Minister for Finance and the statements of the spokesmen of the parties in Opposition, the sitting will be suspended for 30 minutes.</P>

    <Title>National Social Service Board Bill, 1983: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The need for the Bill arises out of the Government's commitment to re-establish the National Social Service Board on a statutory basis, to repeal the National Community Development Agency Act, 1982, and to establish a combat poverty organisation under the aegis of the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, the National Social Service Board, in one form or another, has been in existence since 1971.  The National Social Service Council, as it was until 1981, was set up by the Minister for Health as an informal body to be responsible for the support and development of community information centres and to be a national resource centre to help health boards and voluntary organisations in the development of voluntary social services.  The council was reconstituted as the National Social Service Board in 1981 and had its rather unwieldy membership of 29 reduced to 11.  It retained the same functions and also became responsible for servicing the National Council for the Aged which was also established in 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board was still a non-statutory body at that time but with the establishment of the National Community Development Agency in 1982 the staff functions and responsibilities of the board were subsumed into the agency and at <Col N="691" /> last the board and its staff achieved the status and security of a statutory body.</P>
    <P>As far as the National Community Development Agency is concerned, I had considerable doubts about the viability and potential for effectiveness of this body from the time it was first mooted. I felt at the time, and still do, that the agency was hastily conceived and had no clear and workable mandate particularly in the area of poverty.  Even the very title of the agency is imprecise and vague and this uncertainty is reflected in the functions which leave much to be desired in the minds of those who wish to see established a body whose sole function would be to determine the causes and extent of poverty in our society and then to facilitate actions to alleviate the problem itself.</P>
    <P>As the name suggests, the primary function of the agency was community development.  The agency was intended to promote the concepts of self help and community development; to foster and assist projects of community involvement and activity; and to facilitate the mobilisation of self help in deprived communities. The agency's function in relation to poverty was not explicit &mdash; it was shrouded in the concept of community development and had little chance of ever becoming an effective force in the fight against poverty.</P>
    <P>The agency's possibilities of anti-poverty activities were further curtailed by its statutory obligation to take on all the existing functions and responsibilities of the National Social Service Board, then an unincorporated, informally established body.  Poverty is an issue that cannot be lumped together with a set of functions and responsibilities that have only a nodding acquaintance with it.  It must be singled out for special and positive attention.  The Government's commitment to combat poverty is being and will be pursued in the context of a single-minded approach to the issue by an organisation, unencumbered by other responsibilities or functions.</P>
    <P>The realities of poverty and social deprivation are, however, so inextricably linked into the structures and effects of <Col N="692" /> the social welfare system and its interaction with policies in areas such as taxation, health, education and housing that I considered it appropriate to seek the advice of the Commission on Social Welfare before formally establishing a combat poverty organisation.  The commission was established in September last to review and report on the social welfare system and related social services and to make recommendations for their development having regard to the needs of modern Irish society.  When I addressed the inaugural meeting of the commission, I told the members that I considered their most important and most urgent task was to advise me on the implementation of an anti-poverty plan, the establishment of an organisation to combat poverty and the introduction of a new and comprehensive EEC poverty programme.  I also asked the commission to report to me on this matter as a first priority.  The commission have now done so and I have advised the Government of these views. The Government's decision on the proposed new structure will be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>The Government are committed to drawing up and implementing an anti-poverty plan within the context of national economic and social planning, to re-establishing the structure of the Combat Poverty Organisation with local involvement and to developing constructive community action against poverty as recommended in the 1980 Combat Poverty Report.  There is no doubt that redistribution of resources will be necessary. We can no longer depend exclusively on growth in national income and on increasing foreign borrowing to deal with the problem.  We must now face poverty head-on by redistributing existing resources.  At a time of a plateau in growth generally, this is probably the most difficult of all the tasks facing the Government.  I look forward to the reactivation of an anti-poverty programme by this Government.</P>
    <P>Regarding the two separate bodies, I have already stated in my views what I regard as the inadvisability of combining the functions of the former board with those of the agency.  I firmly believe that <Col N="693" /> the State's obligation to work towards the elimination of poverty and its obligation of developing the voluntary social service sector &mdash; while not mutually exclusive &mdash; do require the commitment of two separate organisations.</P>
    <P>I am of the firm opinion that if this board are to make a major impact on the development and expansion of our voluntary social service sector, they must be re-established on a statutory basis, with all the powers and authority that implies, to enable them to discharge their tasks in an effective manner.  The board's role &mdash; indeed their credibility &mdash; may well have suffered damage because of the changes they have gone through since June 1981 but I am confident that their re-establishment under legislation will greatly enhance their role in the development of the voluntary social service sector and especially in their promotion and development of statutory/voluntary co-operation.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, also vitally important to preserve for the staff of the board the security of employment, of superannuation benefits that they possess at present as employees of the National Community Development Agency.</P>
    <P>While I am on the subject of the staff of the board, I would like to take the opportunity to pay tribute to the chief officer and his staff who have over the last two-and-a-half years continued to provide the steady and relaible service that we have come to expect from them. This is quite an achievement in view of the constant disruptions they have suffered, that have been brought about by changes, not only of Governments and Ministers, but of their own status and security.  I sincerely hope that the enactment of this Bill will bring to an end for them the insecurity of the transition period.  I would like in particular to record my thanks and that of successive Ministers to John Curry who, in addition to his role as Chief Officer of the National Community Development Agency, agreed to take on the onerous role of Chairman of the Commission on Social Welfare.  I was very glad to obtain the services of such an able expert in the <Col N="694" /> social service field to head the commission.</P>
    <P>Before I return to the subject in hand, I would like to express my thanks also to the Chairman, Joe McGough, and the members of the National Community Development Agency who must be commended for the tolerance and forebearance they have displayed over the last year.  For their sakes as well as for the sake of the staff, I look forward to the early resolution of the future of the National Social Service Board.</P>
    <P>I hope there will be unanimity in the House on the need to give a statutory format to the National Social Service Board.  It is generally accepted that it should have been done years ago.  If that had happened much of the to-ing and fro-ing would not have developed.  I hope the fundamental question regarding a statutory format for the board will get general acceptance in the House.  That would be the wish of the many people who were associated with the board before it became the agency.</P>
    <P>In drawing up this Bill, I have taken the opportunity to broaden and extend the board's functions to give them as wide a scope as possible.  In addition to their original responsibility for the support and development of community information centres and their mandate to act as a national resource centre for the development of voluntary social services, they will also be responsible for, first, positive interventions at local community level in the area of development of voluntary social services and schemes and, secondly, for a promotion and developmental role in relation to statutory agencies and voluntary organisations in their social service activities.</P>
    <P>Hitherto, the National Social Service Board, in both of their past lives, had a somewhat restrained role.  They stood in the wings to a certain extent, supporting, stimulating and encouraging the development of social service councils, providing a training service for volunteer information officers and generally acting in a back-up capacity and repository of information on the health and social services.  I would suggest that, vital though their functions were, they had <Col N="695" /> neither the status for financial resources to act vigourously and to the fullest extent of their potential.  When one considers the value of the contribution that the board have managed to make to the development of voluntary social services over the years, with very limited resources and relatively low status, the inescapable conclusion is that, with sufficient resources and authority, there is still a vast well of potential to be exploited for the benefit of the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>I have made specific provision in the Bill to enable the National Social Service Board &ldquo;to promote, develop, encourage and assist&rdquo; co-operation between statutory bodies and voluntary organisations. There are literally hundreds of voluntary welfare organisations, large and small, at work in this small country of ours.  I am not suggesting that any of them is unnecessary.  What I do suggest is that a greater degree of integration and co-operation between them and with the statutory authorities, particularly the health boards and the Department of Social Welfare, must be facilitated.  As a people, we simply cannot afford the potential waste of resources in having a plethora of concerned groups working away on an individual basis in a given area.  Therefore, we must look to the National Social Service Board to continue the efforts they have already made to bring about a cohesive voluntary/statutory partnership.</P>
    <P>I have also considered it desirable to build into the Bill a provision to enable the board to engage consultants or advisers to assist them in the performance of their duties.  The Bill also provides for the board to establish committees, including non-board members, to assist and advise them.  I believe that these provisions will be of immense value in enabling the board to make the optimum use of resources and expertise available to them.</P>
    <P>The voluntary sector is and will continue to be a vital component of our health and social services.  It has the strong merits of availability, dedication and deep community ties.  Every possible <Col N="696" /> effort must be made to link the statutory and voluntary sectors in supplementary and complementary relationship to one another.  I believe that the enactment of this Bill will lead to the further strengthening and integration of the two sectors through the guidance and assistance of the National Social Service Board.</P>
    <P>It is in this spirit that I commend the Bill to the House.  I hope we will have Second Stage resolved this morning, if at all possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first line of the Minister's statement he said the need for the Bill arises out of the Government's commitment to re-establish the National Social Service Board on a statutory basis, to repeal the National Community Development Agency Act, 1982, and to establish a combat poverty organisation under the aegis of the Minister for Social Welfare.  Since I became a Member of this House this is the first Bill before the House for which there is absolutely no need because everything in the Bill was in the legislation passed by this House less than two years ago in regard to the National Community Development Agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that the National Community Development Agency Act was not major legislation to combat poverty, but there is nothing at all in this Bill about combating poverty except promises that some time in the future the Minister intends to introduce comprehensive legislation to deal with the problem.  I suggest that the only reason for this Bill now being before the House has to do with some peculiar ideology in the Labour Party, of which the Minister is now a part.  It is unfair to those less well off in our society that since this Government came into power the National Community Development Agency have not been allowed to function. The Minister is entitled to his view, and perhaps he was not happy with the agency, but surely there was no reason for preventing its functioning until such time as he introduced this new Bill and whatever programme to combat poverty he has in mind.  If Labour policy is so committed to combating poverty as a matter <Col N="697" /> of urgency, it is surprising that legislation to combat poverty has not come before the House today.  As the Minister said, the National Social Service Board were doing their work quite effectively and this legislation is merely giving statutory effect to that work, but he commented that he had doubts about the agency's ability to function in the area of poverty.</P>
    <P>One of the functions of the National Community Development Agency was to draw on and evaluate research on self-help, poverty and social deprivation by third level educational and other bodies and to promote such research from time to time on specific projects.  Surely that is an indication that there was in that legislation a facility under which poverty could be researched and pilot projects set up.  It is fair to say at this stage that it is not more research that is wanted.  We have enough information.  What is wanted now is an administration sensitive to the needs of the deprived and those who suffer from poverty and that will do something for them.  We shall probably see later on this afternoon, as we saw last year, very little regard had in the budget to those less well off in our community.</P>
    <P>The National Community Development Agency was set up by Deputy Dr. Michael Woods, predecessor of the present Minister.  For the first time it has been given statutory effect to develop a national policy on community development in a structured way, of support, assistance and encouragement for voluntary efforts in all its aspects.  It would give freedom and flexibility to the voluntary agencies to respond to the evolving social circumstances and community needs.</P>
    <P>There is, as we know, a very high level of voluntary activity here and it is interesting that over the years as the State became more and more involved in providing social services the number of voluntary organisations increased rather than decreased.  We have excellent voluntary organisations, well worthy of support, such as the social service councils, community councils, youth organisations, various sports groups, women's groups such as the Irish Countrywomen's <Col N="698" /> Association and the Saint Vincent de Paul conferences.  One could continue about the various voluntary groups entitled to the support of the State.  The National Community Development Agency had the facility to identify the necessary areas of research towards combating poverty and there was no need for new legislation at this stage.  Voluntary groups, whether in the inner cities, suburban areas, or among rural communities, should be supported.  One of the anxieties about any statutory board is the danger of their becoming a superstructure in Dublin, and that the benefits might not extend to the rural communities.</P>
    <P>The Minister said about the agency that it was shrouded in the concept of community development and had little chance of ever becoming an effective force in the fight against poverty.  Why did he not allow it to function over the last year to see if that concept was correct? I believe that he is wrong and that the excellent people who were on the board of that agency would have made a very valuable contribution to society and would have dealt with poverty and social deprivation, had they been given the chance to do so.  For any Minister for Health and Social Welfare to prevent that body from functioning for a full year cannot be accepted and is certainly not in the interests of those less well off in our community.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, the National Social Service Council was set up in 1971 by the late Mr. Erskine Childers, when Minister for Health.  It was then re-constituted as the National Social Service Board by Dr. Woods in 1981, being set up to encourage the formation of social service councils, to co-ordinate the work of various voluntary groups and to arrange training for those who would be working in the community information centres.  It is significant that Fíanna Fáil Ministers were responsible for setting up the National Social Service Council and the National Social Service Board.  It was also Deputy Woods who was responsible for bringing in the legislation for the National Community Development Agency.  Whatever commitment to combating <Col N="699" /> poverty was contained in that agency's programme, the Minister in the legislation laid before us this morning has taken that element out and given no indication of when he intends to introduce such legislation.  He said that he had asked the Commission on Social Welfare to report to him but my understanding is that at the end of the year that commission had met on four occasions.  We are aware of many commissions which have met over a long period of years before they reported.  If this is an indication of the Minister's commitment to what is very high on the list of Labour Party ideologies, we must question the reason he is introducing this Bill at this time.  It is not necessary to introduce a Bill of this type for a combat poverty programme; we are all aware of the many problems obtaining in our society.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that over the last year the number of people suffering from poverty has increased, I regret to say, mainly as a result of the policies of the present Government, particularly the budget of this time last year, and we hope the same will not be repeated this afternoon.  There are problems such as the elderly living alone, particularly those living alone in cities.  We know they are there, we know their problems, the problem of loneliness, that of inadequate income, and inadequate income is not the sole cause of poverty.  Some elderly might have sufficient income to survive but are unable to manage their affairs.  For example, they may be unable to get out to the shops to purchase essential needs, or they may have their essential needs but not be in a position to use them correctly.  They may be unable to cook their food through physical handicap, or for some other reason, or they may not have the necessary facilities in their homes.  We are aware of that.  We do not need a new combat poverty organisation to tell us that.</P>
    <P>Then we have the long-term unemployed and we must accept that unemployment will be a feature of our society for years to come.  No serious effort has been made to cater for the needs of those who have been unemployed for any <Col N="700" /> length of time, those people who have worked for a long number of years, who paid their insurance contributions and who find, after one year and three months, they are no longer entitled to benefit and have to apply for unemployment assistance.  These may well be people with large families who find there is very little support given them, particularly from the present Government. This year, under the national free fuel scheme, for the first time since its introduction, the Minister excluded the unemployed from benefit.  The health boards are taking a rigid interpretation of that exclusion.  This means that those who are long-term unemployed, or anybody who may be unemployed or in receipt of any other short-term social benefit &mdash; irrespective of the hardship and poverty entailed &mdash; will not receive free fuel vouchers this year as they did in previous years.  Not only that but they will not even get a little supplementary allowance with it or, if they do, they will still be excluded because specifically in the letter issued by the Minister to the health boards those on short-term benefit and assistance were to be excluded, the first time that had happened.  Therefore we do not need a programme to combat poverty to tell us about that situation or how to deal with it.  Those are just a few examples of the sort of problems obtaining in our society.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he was not happy with the title of the National Community Development Agency.  One might well argue that many people are not happy with the title of the National Social Service Board, that there is a stigma attached to it in some way.  I do not think the title matters very much.  Rather it is important that these boards do their work effectively and efficiently in the interests of those for whom they are supposed to cater.  The National Community Development Agency was established at the end of 1982.  Last year it was allocated £2,250,000 to help voluntary organisations throughout the country and to give help in whatever research was necessary into poverty.  However, the Government did not spend that amount, another indication of their commitment to those <Col N="701" /> less-well-off in our society.  £500,000 was spent out of that £2,250,000 allocated for that specific purpose last year.  At present I understand there are 75 community information centres registerd with the National Social Service Board who train volunteers, provide files for each community information centre and up-date those files.  They also give grants towards the running costs of those centres and make submissions to the Government. We do not know whether such submissions are accepted by the Government.</P>
    <P>One question I should like to pose to the Minister is the place of the National Council for the Aged under this Bill.  The report on the care of the aged pointed out that there were 156 voluntary bodies at national and local level providing community care for the elderly.  The National Community Development Agency had no legal responsibility to service the National Council for the Aged.  I understand that function was to be assumed by the Department of Health but that that did not happen.  Perhaps the Minister would say something about that when replying.  What is particularly important is that the National Council for the Aged, established during 1981 to advise the Minister for Health on all aspects of the welfare of the aged, would continue to function and that the board would in no way cause any diminution of their function. In rural areas particularly it is fair to contend that the bulk of the work carried out by voluntary organisations is for the care of the aged, particularly by the social services councils at present looking after their needs.  It is important that, irrespective of whatever new board is brought into being, the needs of the aged be looked after.</P>
    <P>In the budget last year we were told that £1.8 million saved through the winding up of the National Community Development Agency would be earmarked for the Social Welfare Vote, pending the establishment of an anti-poverty agency, for financial provision for the new agency and possibly for other voluntary bodies to be determined.  That was £1.8 million supposed to be spent on anti-poverty last year that was not spent, again an indication of the Government's commitment in <Col N="702" /> this area.  It is particularly important at this time that there be statutory provision for the National Social Service Board.  It is important that the initiative in catering for the needs of communities should emanate from those communities themselves. We are living in a high-powered technological age when it is particularly important that people identify with their communities, taking an active interest in them.  Many people are willing to take an active interest in voluntary work in their own communities and that should be fully supported by the State.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask the Minister about the financing of the National Social Service Board.  Will it be financed direct from the Department, who will finance the voluntary organisations, or will the voluntary organisations be financed by the provisions of section 65 of the 1947 Health Act, as has happened heretofore? We must carefully guard against the danger of overlap or conflict between the social service board, their subsidiaries and the health boards.  The health boards have statutory responsibilities and discharge them well, but voluntary organisations can do many things which statutory bodies cannot.  They are flexible organisations: for example, the Samaritans are available for 24 hours every day, and it would be hard to provide that sort of service on a statutory basis.  The health boards have the expertise and, I hope, the finance to play their part but are not flexible enough.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested that there should be a greater degree of integration and co-operation between the National Social Service Board, the voluntary organisations and the statutory authorities, and of course I agree with that.  He also said that the National Social Service Board will be responsible for a promotional and developmental role in relation to statutory agencies and voluntary organisations in their social service activities. I should like him to develop that because that is the sort of area where there might be some overlap or conflict between the health boards and the voluntary organisations.  The same applies to engaging consultants and advisers to the National Social Service Board.  Perhaps <Col N="703" /> he could expand on what their role might be.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that when the National Community Development Agency Bill was before this House, it had fair support on all sides.  There were complaints that it did not include the type of combat poverty organisation that we had in the seventies.  Nevertheless, it was welcomed here and in the Seanad.  We also had a Private Members' motion regarding the combat poverty organisation. Deputy Eileen Desmond, the then spokesman on health for the Labour Party said in column 947 of the Official Report of 30 March 1982:</P>
    <P>When we came into office in June 1981 our programme announced that an anti-poverty plan would be drawn up and implemented immediately. This was a vital issue so far as the Labour Party were concerned.</P>
    <P>That is the stated policy of the Labour Party at that time and, while they wanted to implement a policy immediately, we have now allowed a board with an excellent membership to exist for a full year without giving them any function although money was allocated to them.</P>
    <P>There are two types of voluntary organisations, volunteers who give their time and energy without being paid and who do excellent work and the independent organisations that may have voluntary or State funds and paid personnel.  It is important that these organisations should get the full backing of the State and we should be very thankful to them, especially in a recession when money is not as plentiful as one would like for the needs of the community.  The British Seebohm Report stated that voluntary organisations pioneered social reform in the past and they saw them as playing a major role in developing citizen participation, in revealing new needs and in exposing shortcomings in the service. That is an interesting recognition once again that, in spite of all the social services that are provided by the State, there is still a need for voluntary organisations to make their contribution and to identify further needs.  New organisations <Col N="704" /> are appearing all the time to cater for the needs of the community.  For example, we have had organisations like AIM, Cherish and FLAC, although the free legal aid organisation did not see themselves as a voluntary organisation; they expected the State to take over that work from them eventually.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, we are aware of the poverty that exists and we do not need a major organisation to identify it.  It is interesting to note that the combat poverty organisation which was in existence from 1974 to 1980 spent £2.7 million, of which about one-third came from the EEC.  A sum of £2¼ million was allocated by the previous Government for the National Community Development Agency which was almost as much as was allocated altogether over the six years that the combat poverty organisation was in existence.</P>
    <P>The real problems are obvious to anyone who wants to see them.  Members of this House who have campaigned in various parts of the country over the last twelve months have seen that the problems are the same all over the country. We were in Donegal West and in Dublin Central and people are worried about jobs and high unemployment.  They consider that high taxation is creating a new kind of poverty because people who were able to manage heretofore on their incomes now find it impossible to manage. One can see that from the difficulties people who raised local authority loans to build their houses have in making repayments.  It was almost most unusual for anyone to come to politicians' clinics to tell them they were unable to pay their local authority loan.  Now that is commonplace because of low disposable income and high taxation.</P>
    <P>Low incomes is another problem people are facing.  Such things as the use of the medical card to determine who should be on the school bus has also caused its own problems.  Children's allowances helped families to make ends meet.  Over the last year there has not been an increase in those allowances, but hopefully we will see an increase today. There were no dependants' allowances for children going back to school in September <Col N="705" /> or for those on short-term benefits at Christmas, as has been the case in previous years.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement would have alleviated a certain amount of poverty for a small number of people.  This supplement was promised by the Taoiseach on numerous occasions and great political play was made of it by the Coalition partners before they came into Government.  In last year's budget £5 million was allocated for this purpose, and a certain amount of propaganda was made out of this last budget day and in the following debate.  The Government met at Barrettstown in July and reduced that figure to £1 million.  They stated that the family income supplement would be implemented in December and that that would help to alleviate poverty for 20,000 people &mdash; about £4.85 per family per week.  We never saw the family income supplement.  Today another budget is being introduced and I do not know if it will even be mentioned or, if it is, we do not know if it will be implemented this year.</P>
    <P>The construction industry has been allowed run down, creating further unemployment and loss of jobs in peripheral industries.  All these matters are causing poverty.  We do not need research into what is causing poverty, but action to deal with poverty.  The special scheme to bring the homes of the elderly up to liveable standards has been of great benefit.  That scheme, introduced through the health boards by Fianna Fáil, has been particularly successful.  Today we hope further funds will be provided to ensure that that scheme continues.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister for the Environment how many local authority houses did not have water and sewerage and I was surprised when I was told that the information was not available.  We know there are such homes and it is in this area the Government should be spending money, not on research to find out more about poverty when we already know enough.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House because one could spend all morning saying where this Government have fallen down on their commitment to alleviate <Col N="706" /> the hardship of those in need.  There has been a withdrawal of medical cards from students and contributory old age pensioners and there had been a 370 per cent increase in the cost of private hospital accommodation over the last few years. Drugs are costing people who are continuously on medication £7 per week and the health boards are more rigid in the administration of the general medical service guidelines since this Government came into office.  This means that people who are £1 or £2 above the limit have more difficulty getting medical cards.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, we see no need for this Bill at this time.  Everything in this Bill was in the National Community Development Agency Act and that legislation should have been given an opportunity to work over the last year.  If the Minister came here a year or two later and said he did not like how the Act was working and that there might be a need for a change in the legislation that would be understandable, but for him to allow that body to be defunct for the last 12 months and come here today with a Bill the only effect of which is to remove the one element which would deal with research into poverty is, in my view, a waste of the time of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Donnellan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this Bill.  The time has come for us to ensure for the National Social Service Board the security to tenure which they so richly deserve after the recent years of disruption and uncertainty through which they have emerged.</P>
      <P>I think it is worth highlighting that throughout these last two-and-a-half years, which so far have heralded two major re-organisations for the board and their long-suffering staff, the service that the voluntary social service sector had come to expect, indeed demand, of them has never wavered.  In this regard I would like to add my voice to the Minister's to say how grateful we are to the director and his colleagues for managing so well a traumatic period for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hasty establishment of the National Community Development Agency in the dying days of the last <Col N="707" /> Government brought in its wake a situation which was in effect doomed to fail from the very beginning.  It was a pipedream to imagine that this agency, encumbered as they were with a multiplicity of disparate functions, could ever have hoped to be a viable force.  What was needed then &mdash; and what is needed now more than ever &mdash; was an organisation to examine the causes and extent of poverty in our society and to act to combat it.  The concepts of self-help and community development that were to come to fruition through the activities of the agency are certainly useful weapons in the fight against poverty, but to use them without first clearly identifying the underlying causes and extent of their target is to do battle, blindfolded, against a well-entrenched enemy.  The National Community Development Agency were put in such a position.  They were not given the foremost responsibility that an anti-poverty organisation need, the responsibility of laying bare the root causes of poverty. What it was given was a mass of functions subsidiary to the primary need together with the equally important but quite different functions of the former National Social Service Board.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt in my mind that the marriage of these important issues for our time should never have taken place. In short, there is a need for two separate organisations to pursue the different, though inter-linked goals of poverty elimination and development of the voluntary social service sector.  We are here and now concerned with the establishment of one of these organisations &mdash; the National Social Service Board and, as the Minister has said, the other will follow in a short while.</P>
    <P>I fully subscribe to the reasons described by the Minister for establishing the board on a statutory basis and I am also glad to note that their functions have been broadened to give them a wider scope than heretofore.  In particular, I am pleased to note that the board will have a promotional and developmental role in relation to co-operation and liaison between statutory agencies and voluntary organisations in their social service activities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="708" /> We have a proud tradition in this country of community social service based on the principles of good neighbourliness and extending the hand of help and comfort to less fortunate fellows.  We can count ourselves lucky that our voluntary service ethic has led to the development of a network of essential services that the State out of its own resources could never have hoped to provide.  I am referring particularly to the network of services for mentally and physically handicapped people.  In these areas the voluntary sector has reached a high degree of organisation, efficiency and co-operation with the statutory authorities.</P>
    <P>In the social service field I feel that the organisational and administrative structures are still at an embryonic stage of development.  The scope for service provision is very wide.  The needy client groups are equally diverse and the voluntary organisations involved are, typically, locally based and relatively small in comparison with their nationally based colleagues.  This is understandable and, indeed, desirable as the very essence of local community social service calls for the personal touch with a flexibility of approach and of decision making in response to obvious local needs.  Local voluntary organisations want to have freedom to act and react as they see fit, given the familiarity of the volunteers with local community life.</P>
    <P>To foster and encourage the voluntary movement &mdash; as this Government are pledged to do &mdash; is to recognise this fact. It is also to recognise that effective volunteers are not born; they are made. They are made through a building process of sure and steady formation of structures and organisational links.  In other words, to be an effective and an efficient force in the community voluntary service must extend beyond the basic good neighbour service.</P>
    <P>In many areas where social service councils or centres are established a well-structured, well-organised and integrated voluntary service exists providing a wide range of community welfare services.  In such areas, there is already a high level of co-operation between the voluntary and statutory caring services at <Col N="709" /> local level.  This is the ideal that we must now strive to promote on a larger scale through the National Social Service Board.</P>
    <P>The combination of the State agency and the voluntary body narrows the gap between social need and public provision. Within this scenario the voluntary body is the voice for the underprivileged who cannot make their own case.  As such, we need and expect the voluntary body to exert pressures, to criticise the <i>status quo</i> and to defend the interests of its clients much as a trade union would do.  The State agency, on the other hand, is the more cautious, conservative partner tempering its concern with the mundane but very real issues that it must consider, like the administrative and financial implications of its actions.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, the will for partnership exists between the State and voluntary agencies, but there remains a need for the guidance and assistance towards real integration that the expertise of the National Social Service Board can bring about.  I see the board playing a leading role in this very desirable development. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few points in relation to the agency.  It is not correct to say that the agency was not allowed to function during the past year.  It functioned to the extent that it continued to carry out the functions of the National Social Service Board.  The service is given to the voluntary sector and it continued uninterrupted despite the musical chairs of changes of Government, changes of Ministers and changes of policy.  It is important that that degree of continuity should be recorded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the poverty aspects which were raised, as I explained I did not consider it advisable immediately after taking office to jump in and establish a combat poverty organisation.  There are a number of very useful documents and reports on the outturn of the former structures which make valuable and extremely interesting reading.  The urgent priority was to establish the Commission <Col N="710" /> on Social Welfare before going ahead with the work of setting up the organisation.  The commission have given me their views and I am now in the process of advising the Government on the structures for the organisation.  It may well be that we should establish an interim board as a matter of urgency.  As soon as possible we will set up a new combat poverty organisation.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the prospect of having yet another Dublin superstructure. In a small country with a population of 3,500,000 people, the political parties are becoming paranoid about the fact that organisations and Government Departments tend to have their head offices and administrative structures based in the capital city.  Coming from one of the provinces and from one of the cities outside of Dublin, I feel that there is an appalling amount of provincialism about the setting up of organisations to work in the national interest.</P>
    <P>The National Social Service Board will be based in Dublin and work out of Dublin.  That is a normal part of the work of any national organisation.  This does not take from the fact that the vast bulk of the work of any voluntary social service group is done at local level.  At no time was the previous social service board regarded by anybody as a super structure based in Dublin.  The old board was a supportive board, encouraging, stimulating, advising, giving assistance to voluntary bodies at local level.  The body facilitated co-ordination, co-operation and liaison within the voluntary sector and to a certain extent with the statutory authorities. I would suggest that the National Social Service Board was an essential element in providing training and advice to the voluntary social services sector throughout the country.  I have had a lot of personal contact, especially during the past decade, going around the country and seeing the network of community advice centres and meeting social services bodies.  I pay tribute to the work done in that regard by the National Social Service Board.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon raised the matter of the National Council for the Aged.  I assure him that the council will continue <Col N="711" /> to be serviced by the board.  A suitable person was recently appointed to act as secretary to the council and that person will act while Mr. John Curry is engaged as Chairman of the Commission on Social Welfare.  I have been very satisfied with the manner in which the business of the council has been carried out by the staff of the NSSB.  The board does not have a very large staff and the council itself is staffed by the board.  They have produced several reports during the past two-and-a-half years and I think the association with the NSSB has been extremely beneficial. While the Bill does not provide specifically for the board to take the National Council for the Aged under its wing on a formal basis, it does enable me to confer on the board functions in relation to social services other than those specified, where I think this is necessary. There is extremely wide scope for voluntary social service and I would hope to be able to make use of the provision in the Bill from time to time to request the board to carry out specific tasks or to give me advice on specific projects and issues.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon was anxious to know whether voluntary bodies would continue to be financed by the health boards or whether it was intended to channel funds through the NSSB.  I assure him that there will not be any change in the present position.  Voluntary bodies will continue to deal directly with their own health boards.  The NSSB will not be involved in financing the day-to-day activities of the voluntary bodies but could in certain circumstances provide aid, material or financial, to bodies operating in the social services field.</P>
    <P>I would hope for unanimity on this Bill. There is a strong feeling among the staff of the board that this matter should be resolved and they would like to have the House formalise their position once and for all.  This is a major advance.  Leaving aside all the combat poverty issues and the views of former Ministers such as Deputy Haughey, Deputy Woods and Deputy Eileen Desmond, I have always held the view since the foundation of this structure in 1971 that we should have conferred statutory authority on the <Col N="712" /> NSSB.  It would have taken them away from a lot of the nonsense which went on subsequently between various political parties who tried to have a purer soul in relation to voluntary bodies and the issue of poverty than others.  It deteriorated into a situation where there was some political point scoring.  A particular problem was that Deputy Haughey and Deputy woods did not understand and had no feeling for organisations such as the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty.  They saw no purpose in them and just could not understand the concept.  As a consequence they set up their own sideways structures.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the National Social Service Board would be given the freedom of being formally established on a statutory basis and this would be to the benefit of everybody, particularly the staff who undertake this work in the national interest.  I would hope for unanimity in the House on this question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to bring about certain changes in the law that are made necessary by a judgment of the Supreme Court given in November 1980. The case involved was <i>Gilsenan V. Foundry House Investments Limited</i> and <i>Rathmines Properties Limited</i> and so far it has not been reported.  Deputies may have heard the judgment referred to as the &ldquo;Gilsenan&rdquo; judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The judgment bears on the determination of the rent that is payable under a &ldquo;reversionary&rdquo; lease, that is to say a renewal of a ground rent lease.  The court found in effect that the existing statutory <Col N="713" /> provisions for determining such a rent are unworkable.  It will, I think, be helpful if I outline the background.</P>
    <P>Ground rent tenants have, in general, the right either to buy out the ground landlord and acquire the fee simple, or to renew their leases for 99-year terms. Where the lease is renewed the rent payable remains a ground rent.  However, it is related to the current open-market rent of the property in question and is usually very different from the rent payable under the previous lease, granted perhaps a century ago or even longer.  The legislation provides a formula which relates the new rent to the rent which, in the opinion of the court, a willing lessee not already in occupation would give and a willing lessor would take for the land comprised in the reversionary lease.  The new lease is, as I have said, for a 99-year term.  The Supreme court, in arriving at the judgment I have mentioned, had had evidence that freely-negotiated leases of that kind are no longer entered into, that is to say, that a lessor would not now willingly grant a lease for a term as long as 99 years at a fixed rent.  Without provision for rent reviews, no such willing lessor is to be found nor can any such rent be determined and on that basis the court found that the formula was inoperable.</P>
    <P>There are two main consequences of that judgment.  The first and obvious one is that &mdash; following &ldquo;Gilsenan&rdquo;&mdash; the courts are unable to determine the terms of the renewed or &ldquo;reversionary&rdquo; lease.  Of course, the parties themselves can agree these terms but in a case where that agreement is not forthcoming, the tenant cannot exercise his statutory right to obtain the &ldquo;reversionary&rdquo; lease.</P>
    <P>The other consequence is that &mdash; again in the absence of agreement between the parties &mdash; a ground rent tenant who wants to buy out the fee simple rather than get a &ldquo;reversionary&rdquo; lease cannot implement his right of purchase unless his lease has more than 15 years to run.  The reason for this is that, where the lease has less than 15 years to run or where it has already expired, one of the considerations &mdash; perhaps the most important <Col N="714" /> consideration &mdash; that bears on determination of the purchase price is the rent that would be reserved under a &ldquo;reversionary&rdquo; lease.  Since as matters now stand that rent cannot be determined except by agreement between the parties, the purchase price of the fee simple likewise cannot be determined except by agreement in the cases I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from what I have just said that the essential weakness in the system which was struck down by the Supreme Court was its lack of relevance to current market conditions.  The obvious change that is necessary in order to permit the rent under a &ldquo;reversionary&rdquo; lease to be related to current market conditions is, of course, to introduce provision for reviews of the rent payable under such a lease.  Consultation has established that there is fairly general agreement among those professionally concerned with the matter that the review period should be five years, that is to say, that the rent payable under a reversionary lease should be open to review, at the instance of either lessor or lessee, at intervals of not less than five years.  Section 3 of the Bill proposes a change of this kind for future reversionary leases.  The review of five years is the same as the review period that already applies to the rent payable under a renewed occupational tenancy.</P>
    <P>The House will note that section 5 of the Bill proposes a similar change in respect of any sporting leases that are granted in the future.  The law as it stands &mdash; in section 5 of the Landlord and Tennant (Amendment) Act, 1971 &mdash; already contains limited provision for reviews of the rent payable under sporting leases which, like reversionary leases, run for terms of 99 years.  Where the terms of a sporting lease are fixed by the court the rent is subject to review, at the option of the lessor, after 24 years and thereafter at intervals of not less than 25 years and the rent itself is a &ldquo;fair rent&rdquo; that is determined in the light of a number of considerations.</P>
    <P>The judgment of the Supreme Court with which we are concerned was not directly concerned with determination of rents under sporting leases.  However, it <Col N="715" /> is a possible inference from that judgment that no rent could be fair that could not be altered over such a lengthy period. Indeed, since a sporting lease may in certain circumstances be obtained up to 15 years before it commences to run, the rent initially fixed might stand for as long as 39 years from the time it was determined and the possibility arises that the rent-fixing provisions of the legislation could be held to be inoperable in relation to sporting leases also.  Accordingly section 5 of the Bill provides for rent review periods of five years, at the instance of either lessor or lessee, in any future sporting leases whose rents fall to be fixed by the court.  Existing sporting leases do not come within the scope of these proposals. It is reasonable to take the view that interference with existing leases is not warranted in the absence of a definite indication that the terms of such leases cannot be operated.</P>
    <P>It may well be asked &mdash; indeed it has been asked &mdash; if determination of the rent under a reversionary lease has to become so cumbersome an affair, why the right to a reversionary lease should not simply be abolished.  Why not leave ground rent tenants with the single remedy, that is to buy out the fee simple which, of course, they would have to do if the right to a renewed lease was abolished? The landlord and tenant code would be simplified; a step would be taken towards simplifying titles to land, and the persons concerned would be saved the worry and expense of frequent rent reviews.</P>
    <P>This question has been considered carefully and full weight has been given to representations that have been made for that abolition.  The conclusion that I have reached and that has been accepted by the Government is that, on balance, the right to a reversionary lease should be preserved.  This is a right which certain tenants may find preferable to purchase of the fee simple and such a freedom of choice must be given some value.</P>
    <P>Provision for the grant of reversionary leases would in any event continue to be necessary in special cases for example, ground rent leases made by harbour <Col N="716" /> authorities where the right of purchase does not apply.  However, the most important reason for preserving the right to a reversionary lease is the objection in principle that arises to the abolition of an existing legal right, with the consequence that the alternative right to buy out would become less a right than a matter of practical necessity.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the bearing that the relevant judgment of the Supreme Court has on determination of the price of the fee simple where ground rent lessees are buying out and where their leases are expiring or have already expired.  On this account, it was necessary to settle completely new provisions in the law.  As I have said, the rent that would be reserved in a reversionary lease has hitherto been the most important consideration in determining purchase price in such cases. The introduction of five-year rent reviews under future reversionary leases raises an immediate problem as to how purchase price can be related to the rents in any objective manner.  In fact this was quite impossible and a practical alternative had to be found.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might give an example as to how this difficulty would arise.  Take a case where a tenant exercises his right to get a reversionary lease before termination of his present lease and where that lease would not commence to run for more than five years, that is, where the ground rent purchaser's existing lease has more than five years to run.  In such a case no one can say what the commencing rent would be under that reversionary lease.  A further difficulty, amounting almost to impossibility, is that of providing an objective basis for determining the present capital value, for the purpose of purchase, of a rent that is subject to unknowable variations every five years.</P>
    <P>Because of these difficulties it was necessary to find some new basis for determining purchase price in these cases.  The solution that is proposed is set out in section 7 of the Bill, specifically in subsection (4).  This proposes that, where the purchaser's lease has expired or where a rent review is already due, the purchase price will normally be one-eighth of the current fee simple market value of the <Col N="717" /> property in question, subject to the making of adjustments and allowances of the same kind as are made in determining the rent to be reserved in a reversionary lease.  This closely parallels the existing law under which reversionary rents fall to be determined by the courts on the basis that they be one-eight of the open market rent of the property.  In other words the proposed new formula provides, in terms of a purchase price, the same division of the property as between landlord and tenant as the old formula provides in terms of a rent.</P>
    <P>At present the actual rent payable under a reversionary lease excludes any rental element arising from the value of the lessee's goodwill or from the lessee's own improvements.  Similar exclusions are provided in the new formula in relation to purchase price.  Furthermore, the rent under a reversionary lease is based on the rent of the property in its present use and with its existing buildings.  In other words, that rent excludes any element attributable to development value and this is again reflected in the formula. One or two other technical provisions are also being included which we can explore, as appropriate, on Committee Stage and which are likewise designed faithfully to reflect, in terms of purchase price, the provisions of the law as it stands that bear on the matter.</P>
    <P>I noted earlier that, under the law as it stands, the rent that would be reserved in a reversionary lease is the most important consideration that bears on purchase price where a ground rent lessee is buying out and where his lease is expiring, or has already expired.  However, it is not the only consideration: there is quite a list of matters to which regard has to be had in determining price and these matters are again being listed in the Bill.  However, as a drafting matter it was simpler to provide for the repeal and the re-enactment with amendments of the existing price provisions as contained in section 17 of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978, than to seek to amend section 17 and that is what the Bill proposes.</P>
    <P>Certain other changes in section 17 are proposed, some of which I should mention <Col N="718" /> now.  It is proposed that the purchase price of the fee simple should in all cases be determined by reference to circumstances obtaining at the date the purchase application is made rather than being left to depend &mdash; at least in some cases &mdash; on the date of a final judicial determination where price is in dispute.</P>
    <P>The new price formula that I have described is being applied not only to cases where the relevant lease is expiring or has expired but also to cases where a rent review is due within the 15 years. The reason is, of course, that where a rent review is due the price of the fee simple is influenced in the same way as if the lease were expiring.  Finally, it is proposed that in the determination of purchase price in cases where the new formula will apply but where there is yet some time to run to the expiration of the relevant lease or to the rent review, as the case may be, that length of time should specifically be taken into account. This provision is in subsection (9) of section 7.</P>
    <P>Deputies who are not altogether familiar with the landlord and tenant code may have some difficulty in relating the proposal I have just mentioned &mdash; in subsection (9) &mdash; to the sliding scale that is provided in the preceding subsection &mdash; subsection (8) &mdash; and a word of explanation may be in order.  Subsection (8) represents mainly the re-enactment of provisions in section.  17 of the 1978 No. 2 Act, the provisions that provide for the determination of price according to a sliding scale.  That price depends on the length of time to run under the lease at the existing rent and the scale goes from the lowest point &mdash; where the lease has more than 15 years to run and where the provisions for the formula maximum price apply &mdash; to the highest point, where the lease has run out or, as may be the case from now on, where a rent review is due.  Subsection (9) on the other hand, while it also concerns cases where there is yet some time to run to expiration of the lease or to a rent review, yet concerns cases of a different kind, that is cases&mdash; business properties, for example&mdash; where the formula maximum price in subsection <Col N="719" /> (5) does not apply.  In such cases, therefore, we still have the high point of the scale, the point where a lease has run out or the time for a rent review has arrived, but we have no low point.  In other words, no matter how many years there are to run on the lease of a business property, there is no formula for purchase price at the lower end of the scale. Accordingly, subsection (9) simply provides that where the lease has run to within 15 years of expiration or of a rent review the length of time still to run is to be taken into account in determining purchase price.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the Bill that I have so far discussed are essentially contained in sections 3, 5 and 7.  These sections comprise what I may call the heart of the Bill, that is, the proposals for rent reviews in reversionary leases and the proposals for a new price formula in certain cases of purchase of the fee simple.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes, in sections 4, 8 and 13, a number of provisions ancillary to those proposals of which the most important &mdash; in sections 4 and 13&mdash; are designed to cater for cases where leasehold renewal or purchase of the fee simple has been held up in consequence of the Supreme Court judgment on foot of which the legislation arises.  In some such cases at least it is possible that rights of renewal or of purchase could have been carried away by the passage of time alone and without default on the part of the party concerned.  The Bill provides a further period of 12 months within which such rights may still be exercised following the coming into operation of the legislation and the removal of the difficulties that have imposed the delays.</P>
    <P>In particular, section 13 of the Bill caters for any cases where a ground rent lessee, who would have preferred to buy out the fee simple, may have felt himself constrained to apply instead for a reversionary lease rather than see his lease run out and with it, perhaps, his right of purchase.  Where such proceedings have not actually been concluded the lessee is being given the option of buying out instead, subject to recoupment of the <Col N="720" /> other parties' costs.  A 12-month limit is again being proposed in respect of this relief.</P>
    <P>The Bill affords an opportunity to propose a number of miscellaneous improvements in the landlord and tenant code that have come to notice.  Most of these are of a rather minor nature and since they would arise for discussion more appropriately at Committee Stage I think I need not go into them now.  However, there are three such proposals of sufficient importance to warrant mention at this stage and perhaps I should refer to them at least briefly before I close.  One &mdash; in section 9 &mdash; amounts to the recognition of a new class of ground rent tenant, or perhaps a better name would be a new sub-class, for the change that is proposed is not a great one.  What section 9 proposes in effect is that where a yearly tenant can prove that the building on his property were erected by himself or his predecessors, and where otherwise he satisfies the necessary conditions, he will be recognised as a ground rent tenant, a recognition that carries with it the right to buy out the fee simple even though his yearly rent is not less than the rateable valuation of the property.</P>
    <P>The second change is in section 14 which proposes an amendment of section 4 of the 1980 Landlord and Tenant Act. Section 4 of the 1980 Act while declaring the State to be exempt from the legislation nevertheless extends limited rights under the Act to persons to whom rights had already accrued before the State authority concerned became landlord. Such persons retain their right to a renewed tenancy, on one occasion only, and their right to compensation for any improvements already carried out.</P>
    <P>It has come to notice that an anomaly could arise in applying the provisions of section 4 of the 1980 Act in a case where one State authority took over as landlord from another State authority.  In such a case a tenant who had rights previously could acquire them, contrary to the intentions of section 4 of the 1980 Act.  Section 14 of the Bill proposes, accordingly, that the rights I have mentioned will be preserved only in a case where a State <Col N="721" /> authority becomes landlord of a tenanted property in which no State authority had any previous interest as landlord.</P>
    <P>The last change is in section 15.  It is proposed that section 15 will replace section 24 of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1980.  Section 24 of the 1980 Act provides for rent reviews under renewed occupational tenancies and the new proposals mean that following such a rent review the reviewed rent will run, not from the date the reviewed rent is fixed but from the date the rent review proceedings are commenced, provided the previous rent has run for the necessary minimum of five years.  The change is being introduced in the interest of fairness.  It could happen, for example, if protracted negotiations for a rent review were followed by protracted litigation, that a considerable time could elapse between the initiation of a rent review and the final determination of that rent of review.</P>
    <P>As the law stands in section 24 of the Act of 1980, the reviewed rent could in such a case commence to run only from the date of the determination, even though that date is outside the control of either party to the tenancy.  Under the proposals in section 15 of the Bill five years will continue to be the minimum period for which a rent will run before any alternation upon review.  Likewise, if there is delay in initiating a review, the operation of the reviewed rent may be delayed for that reason as under the present law.  However, that operation will no longer be subject to delay because of procedural delays.  In principle the reviewed rent will run from the date of the review notice rather than from the date the rent is finally determined and the time for service of the review notice is being regulated accordingly.  These amended provisions are also being provided in relation to the proposed rent reviews under future reversionary leases and sporting leases that I have described.</P>
    <P>One thing that I ought, perhaps, to make clear is that, while certain amendments of the landlord and tenant code are being proposed over and above the changes that are made necessary by the judgement in the Gilsenan case, the Bill <Col N="722" /> does not deal with ground rent purchase in any general way.  In particular, the abolition of ground rents in any sense approaching that of confiscating the property of ground landlords is a matter that is outside the scope of this Bill.</P>
    <P>This concludes my account of the main proposals in the Bill and I ask that it be given a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the Bill and we will facilitate the Minister by agreeing to a speedy passage of it through the House.  The Bill deals with anomalies which have arisen in practice since the introduction of the amending Landlord and Tenant Bill in 1980.  They are generally of a technical and minor nature. One of the problems that has arisen is in relation to ascertaining what the gross rent should be, and though the Act includes the definition of &ldquo;gross rent&rdquo; as the rent which in the opinion of the court a willing lessee not already in occupation would give and a willing lessor would take, in practice it become virtually impossible to ascertain what the gross rent should be, especially on the basis of a rent for 99 years, during which inflation could be running at any level.  Therefore, the prediction would be particularly difficult.</P>
      <P>Consequently, it makes good sense to introduce this Bill and in it a provision for a five-year rent review of reversionary leasehold rents.  The Bill will make it straightforward for the courts to fix reversionary leases.  That was one of the major difficulties that arose in practice and we welcome the ironing out of that difficulty because I understand that that provision had become virtually unworkable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sporting leases are referred to.  It should be said clearly that, having regard to the nature of reversionary leases and the need for clarification, in the case of sporting leases it was necessary to amend the law to provide for a five-year rent review.  It is important to note that the proposed changes in this respect will apply only to the future fixing by the courts of the rents attached to sporting leases.  Therefore, it should not prejudice clubs who have their rents fixed already. <Col N="723" /> In case any of the sporting clubs would be worried, it is desirable to make it clear that the Bill will not affect leases already set until the rents come to be reviewed.</P>
    <P>In relation to the purchase of the fee simple, the Bill does not effect any major changes in the existing legal position and therefore there is no reason why we should not accept this simply as a clarification of and improvement on existing law.  However, it is important to say in relation to fee simple that a great deal of progress has been made and we have come to the time when we should bring to an end ground rents on domestic dwellings. New ground rents may not be created on new dwellings since May 1978 and evictions have been outlawed for non-payment of ground rents since 1 August 1978.  It was established recently that the Statute of Limitations, after six years, applies to ground rents.  Nevertheless, there are still serious problems in this matter.  Most people agree that the system was fedual and consequently all of us here would like to see it brought to an end.</P>
    <P>At the end of his speech the Minister referred to the undesirability of participating in confiscations, but as we go on in time we find changes taking place which are bringing about a position that the people in general want to see.  Still, it is not an acceptable situation.  Five thousand people have appeared in court in relation to ground rents and this demonstrates massive concern and resistance. There are millions of pounds of ground rent arrears, and more than 70 people have been sentenced to prison for non-payment of ground rents.  There is still a serious problem to be overcome and I should like to see the Minister bringing forward soon proposals to end totally ground rents on domestic dwellings.  The Minister should also examine the matter of a termination date.</P>
    <P>Many of these houses are in local authority areas and I cannot see any reason why we cannot have a termination date in respect of such houses.  It is merely a question of the Government taking a decision to do so.  I am referring to private houses built on land supplied by local <Col N="724" /> authorities, like large housing areas in Tallaght, Donaghmede and various others throughout the country.  The Minister should bring forward urgently measures to provide a termination date in relation to such houses.  It would not involve any question of upsetting the Constitution &mdash; it is merely a question of a decision by Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister should work urgently to introduce a termination date for other ground rents.  We on this side are anxious to see an end to all ground rents, within the terms of the Constitution.  Examining and analysing the Constitution is being done now in greater detail than heretofore in relation to the achieving of our objectives in this regard.  This is a very technical Bill, but necessary and worthwhile. We will support it at this stage and generally.  We are anxious, however, that the Minister will proceed urgently with the preparation of measures to bring about the termination of all ground rents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill and hope that it will remove a number of anomalies the resolution of which heretofore has ended up in the courts.  I do not propose to go on for long but I have knowledge of a couple of cases in regard to non-residential property where leases were entered into and where dramatic changes occurred in the market over the years with consequent considerable difficulties in relation to setting fair rents. Ultimately, such cases appeared in the courts for resolution.</P>
      <P>Indeed, this Bill is before us as a result of a court decision.  In the sixties leases were agreed on the basis of fairly nominal rents in comparison with those obtaining in the late seventies and at the moment. I have one experience of long discussions which were resolved, fortunately, without going to court.  There were obvious anomalies from the point of view of both the lessor and the lessee.  I hope this Bill will remove any difficulties such as those.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke about fluctuations in the market that can have a bearing on either the lessor or the lessee.  The market could have a considerable bearing on what the lessor or the leasee might be willing to get by way of rent or pay by way of rent. <Col N="725" /> The Bill could also have some implications for local authorities, particularly when they enter into 99-year leases. Quite a number of local authorities are doing that now.  Some of them have had great difficulty in arriving at what would be considered an equitable system from the point of view of guaranteeing the rights of the local authority or the lessor and also the rights of the particular sporting group who propose to lease the ground or premises.  I hope the effect of this particular Bill will be to iron out the matters of contention that have arisen over the last few years in that area, that it will be beneficial to the sporting groups and recreational groups involved and at the same time will ensure that the rights of the local authorities are kept to the fore.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to ground rents generally.  The type of ground rent which immediately comes to mind is the residential property ground rent.  I was interested in hearing what the Opposition spokesman, Deputy Woods, had to say in relation to ground rents owned by local authorities.  It is well to refer to the more general ground rents because there has been considerable discussion over the last few years in relation to private property and private development and the great amount of trauma which has been caused by that.  I am aware of the constitutional difficulties that can arise if there is abolition of ground rents and I accept that. I also accept that no future ground rents can be created along those lines.  From time to time we see various lobbies coming forward with pleas to abolish ground rents.  This is a laudable proposal but how practical would that proposal be having regard to the constitutional requirements? I feel that sometimes politicians err slightly in that area as they perhaps mislead the public into believing that in all cases it is possible for them to abolish ground rents overnight.  This is not so easily done.  If it is ever found that under the Constitution we are capable of completely removing ground rents from residential property we would all be in favour of it.  I would like to have it clarified well in advance if it is possible to do this under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="726" /> The Bill is an extremely technical one and arose like a lot of our legislation because of a decision by the courts.  I would like to see not only in relation to this Bill but in relation to many other Bills, a speeding up of the introduction of legislation to a far greater extent so that we would not have to respond so readily to decisions being taken by the courts.  This applies to many Bills besides this one.  We often see quotations in relation to the various Acts dating back to the last century and earlier where we are now operating legislation which in many cases is a few hundred years out of date.  I believe a very good case can be made for spearheading a drive to up-date the greater bulk of our legislation particularly in relation to matters like this Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Bill and in relation to all elements of legislation where the public are affected in their everyday life by Acts which in many cases are 200 years and more old.  We should make a special effort this year to do something about that.  I would regard, from my experience of dealing with constituents' problems, the five-year rent reviews as very useful.  I hope this will eliminate a lot of ground for the acrimony which has arisen in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few brief comments which I would like to make on this very technical Bill.  While any amendments to anything to do with landlords and tenants which up-dates, as the last speaker said, very ancient legislation are of benefit, there are some submissions which came into our party and some points of a technical nature which we have undertaken to make on Second Stage so that they will be of benefit to the Minister when we take the Committee Stage next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like my colleague, the spokesman on Justice, I believe the Minister is examining the Landlord and Tenant Acts in relation to domestic ground rents.  I believe there is a change in attitude and emphasis to what there was when we debated those matters in 1979 and 1980. Perhaps what we thought then was unconstitutional is not so impossible now.  I hope that in a short period we can <Col N="727" /> have amendments to the 1980 Act or even a new Bill to allow the end to what is a very out-dated penal system of paying ground rents on domestic premises.  I never believed it was unconstitutional but is was something we accepted three years ago because we were getting 80 per cent of what a lot of people had fought for. People should now go back and perhaps look for the other 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil welcome the provision for five-year rent reviews in both reversionary and sporting leases as well as the rationalisation of the provision of rent reviews.  The last speaker has made the point about the anomalies in the legislation and the difficulties this causes.  I am sure this will help the legal people who deal with these matters.  Some of the submissions we have got put forward some objections to the principle of the arbitrary percentage being used to establish the rental value of the site element of a property.  The arguments put forward to us are in relation to the terms of subsection 4 (d) of section 7 of the Bill which provides that any addition to the value deriving from the computation of substantial rebuilding of the scheme or development shall be disregarded.  They state that it appears that where a person is acquiring the fee simple of a substantial area of land and where the lease is expired or the rent is due for review, it would not be possible to assess the true open market value of the property, as any potential rebuilding or development value is not to be taken into consideration.  They claim that the provision is inequitable and denies the owner his property right.  Furthermore, they say it is unreasonable that a landlord should not receive the true value of his interest in the property.  They feel that this subsection should at least be amended.  We will be very glad to hear the Minister's comments on Committee Stage.  I would not be in favour of protecting landlords but since I spent so much time criticising them on the Rent Restrictions Act it is only fair that I make the point when it is put to me.</P>
    <P>We got this from two or three sources. They contend that there is a substantial anomaly between the contents of subsections <Col N="728" /> (5) and (7) of section 7 of the Bill. Subsection (5) provides that where the land is not used for business and is held under a contract of yearly tenancy or under yearly tenancy arising by operation of law and does not exceed one acre in area, the purchase price should be calculated on the basis of the statutory multiplier and the rent payable during the year immediately preceding the date of application, whereas section 7(7) of the Bill states that the above calculation shall not apply to a case where, whether under the lease or by virtue of the operation of a statute, an increased rent is or may become payable within 15 years after the date of application.  The rent of a yearly tenancy must always be subject to the landlord serving notice to quit.  Therefore, the rent would be reassessed within a matter of months.  Thus it would not appear appropriate that a yearly tenancy or statutory tenancy should be retained under section 7(5).  It would appear that this should be included under section 7 (4) in conjunction with expired leases or situations where the rent is due for review.</P>
    <P>We have got this from at least three sources of legal background.  They are documented and I will be glad to give the notes to the Minister.  We seem to have an argument when we say that rather than rationalising many of the anomalies, perhaps we are only creating others.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Bill appears to be an enlargement of the Act of 1980.  It seems unreasonable that the State should have statutory rights in its capacity as a tenant and that it shall not be bound by the relevant Acts when it is a landlord.  All the problems we have had under the Rent Restrictions Acts regarding discrimination should be avoided.  These people are of the opinion that the provision is inconsistent and inequitable and that it discriminates against the tenants, particularly when the Rent Restrictions Acts come into effect.  I do not claim to be an expert on a technical Bill such as this, but I ask the Minister to look at these sections in an effort to rationalise some of the anomalies in the Landlord and Tenant Acts.</P>
    <P>Landlord and tenant legislation comes <Col N="729" /> up continually in court cases concerning private evictions and in cases dealing with very old leases and old deeds concerning houses where the tenants are being subjected to massive increases.  Any anomalies and ambiguities in the Acts in relation to that should be looked at before we finalise Committee Stage.  I ask the Minister to examine those and if necessary to bring in some amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that the problems we have faced in the ground rents area be tackled.  As the Minister said, it is quite anomalous that settlements in these cases referred to contracts willingly entered into when such contracts are no longer being entered into. It is good that we have tackled this.</P>
      <P>A problem must arise in the case of people seeking to buy out ground rents on leases which have under 15 years to run.  At that stage people become very worried about ground rent because of the posibility of high prices.  The Minister is more or less proposing that the settlement terms be based on one-eighth of the current value of the property.  I am not very well informed on the subject, but it seems that this is pushing the price very high, and that is worrying for people whose leases have only 15 years to run, because of ignorance or difficulty in identifying where ownership rights lie.  In my constituency I have had experience of the problem of pyramid ownership of ground rent.  In one case one would think that one had reached the end of the line when a set of property institutions were identified; then it was discovered that they referred to three others whose consent had to be sought and on identification of those three it was found that matters went further back up the line.  This problem is arising in the whole ground rents area. Although the Act of 1978 offered a cheap remedy in that one could go to the Land Registry and pay their fee, it did not resolve this problem of finding where the right of ownership of ground rent lay.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied of that, but the same problem is likely to arise in the area of reversionary leases.  Presumably you would have to identify where exactly ownership lay in order to resolve this, and the re-letting of the lease will create problems.  I draw the Minister's attention to it.  It may have wider implications in the ground rent area, but it seems that some solution is needed other than the relatively expensive one of going to arbitration.</P>
      <P>On the question of trying to find an alternative to market value, the lead given under the ground rent legislation of referring to Government stock could have been considered in this context rather than considering the market value of the property.  It would seem to give a more equitable settlement.</P>
      <P>The Minister refers to the possibility of reversionary leases as being an alternative. That strikes me as being a more sensible approach.  The Minister draws our attention to an objection in principle that we are abolishing an existing legal right.  However, as I understand it, the tenant in this case has the option of accepting the reversionary lease or buying out the fee simple.  We have already abolished the legal right because the tenant has the option, and by narrowing the tenant's option to just a single remedy we have simplified the whole procedure.  I question that decision.  It may be that I do not understand fully the legal niceties of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to hear the Minister elaborate further on why the one-eighth value of the current market value was chosen and what implications it will have for <Col N="731" /> tenants.  It seems to be pushing up the price.</P>
    <P>We welcome the moves in the sporting area.  I thank the Minister for bringing in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is extremely necessary in view of the anomaly which has been shown up through the actions of the Supreme Court.  This Bill highlights the whole area of taking over a law which was enacted here when we were under British rule.  It emphasises once again the need to get rid of our ground rents system. I realise that we cannot go into the area of ground rents, but as long as the system exists these anomalies will continue, although I imagine they are being eliminated.  In 1978 the Minister at the time brought in the Bill allowing tenants to buy out their ground rents in an effort to do away with one of these anomalies and ensure that people would not find themselves being evicted from properties which 99 years ago their families took over as residential properties.  It was because the 1978 Bill did not provide for everyone that this Bill is before us today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is easy to be wise after the event but I suppose that back in 1883 when our grandparents or great grandparents were signing leases, the word `inflation' had not been heard of with the result that there was no provision for rent reviews. It would be wrong of us to expect a landlord who is living totally on income from ground rents not to try, as the end of a 99 year lease was approaching, to increase the value of the lease.  One can say that the whole system is inequitable but there are people who are depending totally on incomes from ground rents and they are entitled to enjoy ground rents at today's terms.  People could not possibly have foreseen 99 years ago that the price of property and land would have increased to such an extent.  In the case of a business, the situation is covered because a business can obtain a 35-year lease with a five-year review of rent.  Therefore, the anomaly will not arise in so far as the renting of business properties is concerned but in the light of discussions that have taken place in the past few days <Col N="732" /> concerning the amount of office space that is available, perhaps this is an area that we could look at at some time in the future.</P>
    <P>This legislation is another instance to some extent of the Supreme Court leading the Legislature.  I appeal to the Minister to carry out a review of the entire area of landlord-tenant legislation so that we do not appear always to be seen to be reacting to what is happening in the courts.  Another example of that situation was one in which I was involved to the extent of being on the special committee set up to deal with a Bill concerning rent reviews and there have been other instances in which the Supreme Court have forced us into bringing in legislation rather speedily.  That is not a good way to run our business.  It would be preferable that we considered anomalies at times when there was not pressure being brought to bear on us, because if we wait until there is such pressure we are being forced into a situation of helping people who are in difficulty.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Bruton was speaking I thought of a situation in my constituency where there is a whole area that cannot be developed because of the absence of legal title, deeds and so on.  I refer to the village of Portmarnock.  Because the relevant documentation is not available that area cannot be developed.  The identity of the landlords is not known.  They have probably long since left the country.  Portmarnock is an area that is badly in need of developing.  In cases in which we cannot proceed to develop land because of the absence of a landlord there should be provision in some legislation to allow a local authority to take over that land and develop it properly.  It is because we do not have such provision that the village of Portmarnock is without proper facilities and is a village with derelict sites all along the main street.  That is the sort of anomaly that must be sorted out.</P>
    <P>It is against the whole principle of leasing in the sense that families are enabled to provide homes for themselves and for their heirs that when leases expire the property can revert back to a landlord who will not have spent any money in maintaining the property apart from the <Col N="733" /> cost involved in having a solicitor act on his behalf to send out demands yearly for ground rents.  In many cases these landlords prefer to remain anonymous.  The people who own the properties are the ones who spend money maintaining them, so it is very wrong that after 99 years property should revert to a landlord. There are clauses in most legislation in this area that prevent people from doing certain things with their properties. In other words, a landlord exercises a veto despite the fact that that veto carries no obligations so far as he is concerned. Once an estate, for instance, is taken over by a local authority they assume responsibility for it thereby relieving the ground landlord of his responsibility. This is an inequitable situation but I am glad the Minister is stopping that gap which in many cases prevented elderly people from being thrown out of their homes.</P>
    <P>Obviously the ideal situation would be that people with only a short amount of the time of the lease remaining would be able to buy out the fee simple.  That would prevent problems arising in the future.  However, I am disappointed that so few people have sought to avail of the extension of the 1978 Act to buy out their ground rents.  Perhaps this Bill will highlight the situation and will encourage more people to avail of the extension in this regard.  One would hope that there will come about an abolition of ground rents in which event there will not be a need in the future for legislation of the kind we are dealing with today.  People who buy out their ground rents are in a much better situation in terms of their property than they would be if they did not take this course of action.  Of course, ground rents cannot be abolished without making good any losses that would accrue to landlords.  I expect that it is partly through ignorance and partly because people tend to take the view that 99 or 150 years is such a long time away that they do not bother to buy out their ground rents.  There must have been many people in the twenties and thirties who thought that way too and whose children or grandchildren are now faced with the reality of the situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="734" /> It is obvious that the area the Minister is trying to deal with is only one of many that is causing problems in our whole landlord and tenant legislation.  Up to now we tended to think of landlords as being a hangover from the days of the British here.  In other words, we thought of landlords as being from places other than our own country but for the past number of years many landlords have been Irish.</P>

      <P>I will do so also.  Obviously there is an anomaly in cases where the lease has only 15 years to run.  If a landlord holds enough power over a person who is seeking, by agreement, to have the terms changed, obviously that person could be forced into meeting the terms of the landlord.  This could affect elderly people in particular who may not wish to move from the premises in question.  I am glad that the Bill provides that agreement has to be reached, whether in respect of a reversionary lease or in regard to fixing the price for the buying out of a tenancy. I hope the necessary guarantees are built into the legislation so that there will be no need for long drawn-out cases to secure agreement.  Arbitration is a necessary element in the Bill so that satisfactory agreement may be reached. Obviously a landlord who is seeking to call in a lease will be anxious to get the best deal possible and I hope every precaution has been taken to ensure that the tenant is safeguarded.  I am sure this has been taken into account in drafting the Bill.</P>

    <P>With regard to the lease of sporting <Col N="735" /> premises, I welcome what the Bill proposes. This could cause considerable problems in a community on the expiry of a lease and with the premises or land reverting back to the landlord.

I urge the Minister to do everything possible to ensure that there are no anomalies in this area and that next time we will be ahead of the Supreme Court.</P>

However, we are just tinkering around with the whole question of ground rents.  I regard them as a totally immoral charge and eventually the Dáil will have to grasp the nettle and do something about the matter.  There is a question of compensation involved but that compensation should be limited.  In the west of Ireland we have the famous Lord Lucan who has ground rents in the town of Castlebar.

      <P>Deputy Owen was in <Col N="736" /> favour of the abolition of ground rents and I am sure this view is shared by the majority of speakers.  This Bill is merely a measure to alleviate a problem as a result of a High Court action.  Ground rents have been a fundamental problem since the foundation of the State.  We made headway in our Act which alleviated the situation and which prohibited the creation of new ground rents which were being created by Irish builders and property developers.  Fianna Fáil ensured that further ground rents would not be created.  However, the abolition of the old system of ground rents should be contemplated by this Government and I appeal to the Minister to bring before this House a measure that will allow for the buying out of ground rents.</P>

There is also the situation that we do not own the ground rent of the GPO in Dublin.  This is an immoral situation after so many years of freedom. An effort was made to buy out the ground rent but it has not succeeded to date.  It is now a matter for An Post to resolve and I hope something will be done about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the measure before the House and the Minister's initiative in bringing it forward considering that to date a case has not been reported. Members will be pleased that the Minister is giving attention to major legislation such as the Criminal Justice Bill and other Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been an anomaly in the law in regard to reversionary leases.  Many of these leases were fixed in a different age when the problem of inflation did not exist.  I am sure the people who originally <Col N="737" /> entered into the leases did not envisage the situation that exists in the 1980s with its high inflation rates and the other changes that have taken place.  It is time that this matter was given attention.</P>
    <P>We can be grateful to the courts for grappling with the problem.  It is very difficult to adjudicate on a matter that was decided many years ago, to translate that into the 1980s and, at the same time, to be fair both to the lessor and the lessee. In former years when many of the leases were being fixed, the Houses of Parliament here, in Britain and on the Continent were influenced strongly by people with property interests.  In the days before universal franchise it was in the interest of property owners that this type of legislation be brought forward.  We have seen advances in recent decades in that area and the law is becoming more equitable, but land and property law particularly have needed to be looked at for some time.</P>
    <P>With his enormous burden of very important legislation affecting the whole country, I am delighted that the Minister found time to study this area and that the legislation has come so early in the term of this Government.  It gives us confidence that the Minister will be enabled in the future to undertake a complete review of land law for the purpose of bringing it up to date.  He has outlined many of the contradictions and difficulties in coming to terms with this problem. There already have been attempts to bring up the subject of ground rents, which is very tempting.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle has already made a ruling on that and if I do mention the subject it will be only a passing reference, which I hope will be allowed.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1983, the court found that the existing statutory provisions for determining such a rent were not workable.  We might ask ourselves why.  It was mainly because of the current open market rent of the property in question usually being the determining factor in deciding the result of the review.  It is fair and reasonable to reiterate that ground rent tenants have two rights under this law: firstly, to buy out the ground landlord and acquire the <Col N="738" /> fee simple, and, secondly, to renew their leases for 99 year terms.  That is the crux of the problem.  We know that when the lease is renewable the rent payable remains a ground rent.  The question is: can one get a lessor to renew a ground rent for a 99 year term at a fixed rent?  I have been amazed at the kind of agreements entered into in former days.  The young particularly are amazed at how in property dealings enormously expensive properties by today's standards were entered into many years ago without the contracting parties visualising that some time in the future the terms agreed would be overtaken by increases in cost of living and in the then unknown item, inflation, which has affected property and the fortunes of people in a fantastic way.</P>
    <P>A tremendous amount of property here is affected, which will come up for renewal in the remaining part of this century and in the next; so it is time for a review of this legislation.  The 99 year term was one of the main stumbling blocks to which the court addressed its mind in trying to evaluate the case of <i>Gilsenan versus Foundary House Investments Limited and Rathmines Properties Limited.</i> They decided that it was unworkable.  The new legislation provides a formula which relates the new rent to that which a lessee not already in occupation would give and a willing lessor would take for the land comprising the reversionary lease.  Except in the case of agreement between lessor and lessee, it will be impossible to find a lessor willing, given those circumstances and prevailing conditions, to enter for a fixed term into a new arrangement, knowing that inflation is here to stay, even if we can control it, because of the tremendous economic activity and the emancipation of the general populace throughout the western world and the operation of democracy, in future that is not likely to change and we will not see a reversal of the situation to that which prevailed in former times.</P>
    <P>One of the other consequences of the case is that a ground rent tenant who wants to buy out the fee simple rather than get a reversionary lease cannot implement his right to purchase unless <Col N="739" /> his lease has more than 15 years to run. The Minister explained the reason for that, saying that the most important consideration bearing on the determination of the purchase price is the rent which would be reserved under the reversionary lease.  Therefore a lessee would have to have a minimum of 15 years to run on his lease before he could opt to buy out.  I might make a passing reference now to ground rents because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There was a recent debate here in which The Workers' Party introduced a motion under which they sought to abolish ground rents.  I think the Minister present, in his reply, pointed out to them that to abolish ground rents would cost approximately £40 million and that a large proportion of the people who would have to pay that £40 million would be people who were in, say, local authority houses who were not property owners. Therefore, a Socialist party purporting to advocate that ground rents be abolished should remember that the people who will bear that burden are actually not property owners.  This Bill and this approach is careful, considered, goes through the courts, is not rushed, takes a balanced view and constitutes a deliberate attempt at being fair to all parties concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and look forward to Committee Stage when we can examine the different sections more carefully.  It was clearly demonstrated in the Minister's <Col N="740" /> introductory remarks that the law needed revision.  There can be no accusatory statements by people that the Government have been slow to tackle this problem.  It is fair to point out also that it is an example of something brought forward without public demand or outcry, something we do not often get credit for and which does happen quite a lot.  We shall see more of this kind of thing during the remainder of the term of office of this Government.  Because the Bill is technical its meat will be tackled on Committee Stage.  Therefore I have made the general remarks it is permissible to make, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, because of the rulings you have made on it to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> This Bill will restore the right to certain property owners to renew the lease of their properties or to purchase the fee simple of those properties. The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1967, first gave ground rent tenants the right to abolish their ground rent by purchase.  Under the scheme provided by that Act the purchase was a matter for the parties themselves to arrange although any dispute or difficulty might be referred for arbitration to the county registrar whose award might be appealed to the Circuit Court.  Therefore, the courts always had a role to play in this.  The purchaser was liable for the ground landlord's costs of the transaction although that liability was limited to such costs as are necessary and reasonable.  It was recognised that the costs burden on the purchaser could be relatively heavy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1978, in effect prevented the creation of new ground rents on dwellinghouses. In the same year the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act extended the classes of persons who had the right to buy out as ground rent tenants.  It provided a special purchase scheme with a life of five years for that particular scheme and deprived a ground landlord of the right to repossess a dwellinghouse for the non-payment of a ground rent, leaving him simply with the right to sue for any arrears as a civil debt. <Col N="741" /> Also the Landlord and Tenant (Ground) Rent) Act, 1978, included a special scheme under which for a period of five years ground rent tenants of dwelling-houses were given the right to acquire by purchase the fee simple without having to pay more than nominal fee in respect of the legal work involved.  In the last session the Ground Rents (Amendment) Act, 1983, increased the fees but maintained the right for a further 12 months.</P>
    <P>The net issue of the Bill before us, which is very technical, concerns people who had a house or property with a lease of less than 15 years to run which because of the provisions in previous Acts was related to a price which a willing vendor and a willing purchaser could agree on. People whose leases had less than 15 years to run were unable to exercise their rights to renew a lease, or to purchase the fee simple of a lease, simply because a situation developed in which there were no willing vendors who were prepared to give leases for 99 years even though there might have been willing purchasers.  The Gilsenan case in effect said that the court could not decide what would be the appropriate rental on the renewal of a lease simply because the prerequisite, a willing vendor and a willing purchaser operating freely, did not exist.  So the right to renew a reversionary lease could not be put into operation.  Because of the fact that the right to purchase was related to the new rent which might be fixed on the renewal of a lease a tenant with a lease that had less than 15 years to run could not exercise the right to purchase either.  Therefore, rights given previously, or thought to have been given, were found to be inoperable.  That left us with a lacuna in the law, leaving people with properties with leases of less than 15 years to run in a situation in which they could neither exercise their rights nor could the courts decide on the basis on which they would renew or on the basis on which they would purchase.</P>
    <P>I have also taken this opportunity to introduce a whole lot of other technical changes in this Bill.  I thank the various Deputies who contributed to the debate. It is a Bill which can be discussed more <Col N="742" /> appropriately at length on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The question of ground rents in general has been referred to in passing.  Deputy Woods in particular referred to this matter in some detail.  I do not propose to dwell on it in any detail.  The net issue which arises is that, because the Constitution gives the right to private property; it would not be possible to abolish ground rents without compensation.  The compensation, of necessity, in some way would have to relate to the value of what was being confiscated.  That places one in a situation in which in recent ground rents situations people who are in possession of property own the property even though they have not the title to the fee simple.  If we go for the abolition of ground rents in the wider sense the difficulty that arises is that we would have to compensate, and we can only compensate out of taxation.  Therefore we would be transferring enormous sums of money from the taxpayer in general to the benefit of people who own their own houses already and who would be freed from the payment of ground rent.</P>
    <P>I should like to wind up now and reserve further comment for Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that it is difficult to understand why, in reply to a previous parliamentary question from me, he stated that the information requested was not available in the Department?  If the Minister at that stage had information for the first three quarters of the year, it would be normal practice to give whatever information was available and to state that the figures for the final quarter were not in yet.  Could the Minister now state what the figures are for the period for which returns have been made to his Department, that is for the first three quarters which he mentioned?

The Minister has now informed the House that, in fact, information has been supplied to his Department on a quarterly basis by each local authority and the Minister did not give the information which was available to him on that occasion.  I know the Minister may not have that information with him but could he make it available to me?</P>

      <P>There has been no undue delay in bringing the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1983, into operation.  On 6 October 1983, an order was made bringing certain provisions of the Act, including those provisions aimed at speeding up the appeals process, into operation.

    <P>A request was also made to a special <Col N="750" /> selection committee on 14 October 1983 to select three suitable candidates or fewer if the committee considered there were not three such candidates suitable, for appointment as chairman.  The post of chairman was advertised by the committee on 28 October and 11 November 1983.  The selection committee interviewed a number of candidates following which the committee informed me on 9 January 1984 of the names of the candidates selected.  In accordance with the provisions of section 5 of the Act the Government are considering the names submitted and will shortly announce the name of the person whom it is proposed to appoint as chairman.

The Minister has informed the House that he is refusing to confirm or deny that cases are pending before the courts, and yet you refused a question from me on the grounds that the matter was <i>sub judice.</i> If the matter is <i>sub judice</i> surely there must be a case before the courts.  Surely it is not too much to expect the Minister to confirm or deny that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the reason for the delay in dealing with planning appeals; and if he has consulted with An Bord Pleanála in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of factors which will always give rise to delays in dealing with planning appeals. These include delays by appellants in submitting grounds of appeal, requests that appeals be held in abeyance, delays in receipt of essential documents, the inadequate plans submitted with some applications, the need to circulate documents to all parties, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there was a significant increase in the number of appeals on hands in the second half of 1982 and in the early months of 1983 and an exceptionally high number of appeals, 3,502, was on hands at the end of March 1983. During that month correspondence was initiated with the board regarding the build up of appeals.  With the board's agreement my Department carried out a survey in May 1983 aimed at streamlining the administrative procedures within the organisation and most of the recommendations were accepted by the board. Moreover, additional administrative staff were made available temporarily from the Department to deal with a particular bottleneck.  Some overtime working was authorised, departmental inspectors were assigned on a part-time basis to <Col N="757" /> appeals work and the board were authorised to recruit four additional inspectors, as well as an increased number of part-time professional staff.</P>
    <P>The number of appeals on hands peaked at 3,595 at the end of May 1983 but had been reduced to 2,452 at the end of December 1983.  With the fall in the intake of appeals further reductions in the numbers on hands may be anticipated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that over 400 planning appeals have been with the board for periods longer than 12 months?  Why should this be so?  Is it not because there is an inadequate number of inspectors to deal with the number of appeals before the board?  Is it not true that the four additional inspectors who are authorised, but who have not yet been appointed, are not being appointed because of a dispute between the board, the inspectorate and the Department, none of which information the Minister seems to be prepared to give to the House?</P>

      <P>If I had said that I would not wait for the report of the Joint Committee of which Deputy Molloy is chairman, I am sure he would not have been satisfied either.  There has been a comprehensive review of compulsory purchase law initiated in the Department since July 1981 with a view to identifying measures which would streamline and speed up the process.  Compulsory purchase law is complex and is scattered throughout enactments dating from 1845. The provisions of the Constitution in regard to property rights and the requirements of natural justice place restrictions on the measures which may be adopted to reform the CPO law.  Tentative proposals for reform were worked out in the Department in 1981, taking account of the legal and constitutional constraints. The advice of the Attorney General on these proposals was requested before deciding how best to proceed.  The advice of the Attorney General was requested on 20 October 1981 and numerous reminders have been issued by various Ministers for the Environment.  The advice has not yet been received.</P>

      <P>Demountable dwellings are temporary and designed to meet special kinds of housing needs &mdash; in particular the accommodation of elderly persons living in areas where a continuing need for the dwellings is not anticipated. In view of the damage caused by recent storms, I am asking local authorities to carry out an urgent review of the present condition of any such dwellings provided by them.  I should also say that a special examination of the standards and specifications for demountable dwellings currently in use by local authorities was intitiated by my Department some time ago.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will give consideration to changes in the payment of the £3,000 house subsidy under the Housing Finance Agency; if he will consider paying this subsidy direct to the applicant as in the SDA system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Payments under the mortgage subsidy scheme are structured to provide maximum benefit to recipients. In the case of SDA borrowers whose repayments cover the full loan charges, the subsidy is paid to the borrower to reduce the impact of these changes in the early years of a loan.  HFA borrowers, whose payments are income <Col N="764" /> related, do not meet the full loan charges with the result that the amount of the principal outstanding increases in the early years of the loan.  The subsidy is, therefore, paid to the Housing Finance Agency on behalf of the borrower to reduce the amount of the loan outstanding and to shorten the repayment period. This arrangement, which is a condition of the loan, is made known to all prospective HFA borrowers and it is not proposed to alter it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The report has been brought to my notice.  I understand that while the local authority has an option to purchase the site in question, it has not yet done so.  My involvement as Minister would arise only in the event of the local authority seeking approval to raise a loan to meet the acquisition costs.  I understand, however, that Sligo County Council has, in fact, been setting funds aside over a period of ten years for the purchase of a suitable waste disposal facility and will not be requiring any loan for the acquisition.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the site in question would meet the county's waste disposal requirements for an estimated 30 years and the reported acquisition cost might be considered in this context and in the light of the difficulty of acquiring suitable sites for such purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to debate the matter with the Minister of State but in view of the fact that he or the Minister provide the greater bulk of the money at the disposal of county councils, would he not pursue with them the question of whether this site might have been acquired for far less money if they had acted a little earlier?  It is an extraordinary situation that a site which changed hands for a few thousand pounds a few years ago will now cost £100,000 of which this House will have to vote the greater part.  Will the Minister not require Sligo County Council to give him a full account of why apparent opportunities were missed in the past?  It will now cost the people we represent and not just those in Sligo an extra £95,000.</P>

      <P>Acquiring sites for waste disposal is a major problem all over the country particularly in big urban areas.  Sligo County Council have been endeavouring to acquire a site for some time.  They looked at a number of sites but did not find any suitable apart from this one.  It is not a question of them dragging their heels.  The economics of it is a matter for the county council.  They have set aside money out of their account over the years for this.  They discussed this and agreed it is a proposition they should go ahead with.  That is the decision of the democratically elected council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister write to the council and put it to them delicately that if they had been looking for a site for a long time they might have bought this one as recently as 1978 for a tiny fraction of what we now have to pay for it?  That is what I would like the Minister to probe. If we probed these things instead of talking in large terms about macro this and macro that we would save a lot more money.</P>

      <P>There is no problem about delicately approaching the council. We have spoken about local government reform and now when something occurs we want to poke our nose in.  Of course I can take the matter up with them.  This is the money being sought for the site. There is a major problem about where they can dispose of waste.  It poses a serious problem all over the country.  In Dublin there is hardly any site on which we can dispose of industrial waste which is causing serious concern to industry. We have to allow county councils to look after their affairs.  I can ask the council why they did not look at this site three or four years ago.  They have not yet purchased the site.  The option is open to them until the end of March.  My information is that they do not have much of an option because it is the only site available to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The economy is now poised in a delicate balance. The severe measures that had to be taken in last year's budget are beginning to bear fruit, but have not yet produced their full results.  There have, however, been substantial developments on the economic front and significant improvements in the public finances.  Industrial exports grew by about 14 per cent in volume in 1983; agricultural exports increased in volume by some 3 per cent. Reflecting the buoyancy of exports, the volume of manufacturing output expanded by 6 per cent.  Inflation was reduced to 10½ per cent from the previous year's 17 per cent.  These were significant achievements in view of the difficult economic climate.</P>
      <P>On the public finances front, borrowing, especially foreign borrowing, has been reduced and the growth in public expenditure, which has been the core of our fiscal problems for a decade, has been curbed.</P>
      <P>There is a long way to go before we can claim that we have solved the problems in the public finances, or fully set the economy on the path of growth in employment and output which we all wish to see.  But we have made a resolute beginning and within the space of a year the results are already starting to appear.</P>
      <P>The steps taken to rectify the public finances during the past year contrasted sharply with the unsustainable excesses of previous years.  We are now picking up the bills which our predecessors tried to push off into the future.  We cannot avoid this problem.  If we do not face it today, it will become more intractable tomorrow. There can therefore be no doubt but that the rectification of our financial imbalance must be a continuing priority in Government policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Progress so far on the financial front would suggest that another significant step should be taken this year in the reduction of Exchequer borrowing and <Col N="802" /> the elimination of the current budget deficit. Pursuit of these goals must, however, be tempered with caution.</P>
    <P>Inevitably, the overdue change in direction comes as a shock to the economy.  While inflation has come down significantly and the balance of payments problem has been greatly alleviated, consumption has declined, investment has fallen, unemployment has risen and growth has been stifled.  But there are now clear, if delicate, signs of an economic recovery in Europe and the United States.  I want to develop our ability to participate in that recovery, both now and in future years.</P>
    <P>We must continue with our programme of greater discipline in public expenditure; we must continue in our determination to reduce borrowing, especially foreign borrowing, and we must continue on the path towards elimination of the current budget deficit.  It is for this reason that the Estimates for expenditure, already published, have been so tightly drawn.  But 1984 is not a year in which it would be either prudent or constructive to produce a budget which had a major deflationary impact on the economy.  On the other hand, a premature and artificial fiscal stimulus would simply mortgage further our future growth.  We must use to the maximum the extremely limited room for manoeuvre created by the policies we have pursued for the past twelve months, in order to enable the economy to benefit to the greatest possible extent from the emerging international recovery.</P>
    <P>Today's budget therefore includes proposals for some tax concessions and for increased expenditure allocations in certain areas.  To finance these changes while achieving the Budget targets means that there must also be increases in certain taxes.</P>
    <P>A second high priority for the Government is to achieve a fairer distribution of taxation and to help those on low incomes.  Last year's budget and Finance Act represented notable steps in this direction and the changes I will announce in today's budget will secure further progress. Taxation levels generally are now high.  The scope for easing the burden <Col N="803" /> rapidly is, however, severely restricted by the state of the public finances, which leaves no room for overall reductions in taxation.  Neverthless, it is possible to make some useful progress within the existing constraints.</P>
    <P>Until we bring about a considerable improvement in the public finances, we can make litle progress towards a stronger economy and better employment opportunities.  Action on this front must be supported by other policies in order to make the best use of the opportunities open to us.  Moderation in pay demands remains a critical factor and further job opportunities will be lost if pay awards are made that the country cannot afford.</P>
    <P>Financial difficulties notwithstanding, we must ensure that those on low incomes are protected: the measures in today's budget will do that.</P>
    <P Just="Center">REVIEW OF BUDGET 1983 OUTTURN</P>
    <P>BUDGET OUTTURN</P>
    <P>The outturn on the 1983 Budget is particularly encouraging.  Current expenditure was on target, while revenue fell short of expectations by less than 1 per cent.  The current budget deficit for 1983 was £960 million, or about 7¼ per cent of GNP, compared with £988 million or 8½ per cent of GNP in 1982.  Capital expenditure was £141 million below the budget estimate but this was mainly on the non-Exchequer side.  Exchequer borrowing for capital purposes was £29 million below the Budget estimate.</P>
    <P>The total expenditure of central Government and of local authorities on current and capital services represented a lower proportion of GNP than in 1982. This was a striking reversal of one of the most persistent long-run trends in the Irish economy.  It has been achieved at a time when the upward pressure on public expenditure and consequently on taxation from a growing population and rising unemployment is greater than ever.</P>
    <P>The overall Exchequer borrowing <Col N="804" /> requirement for 1983 was £1,756 million, or 13¼ per cent of GNP.  This is a reduction of more than three percentage points of GNP compared with the 1982 figure of £1,945 million, and the overall level of borrowing as a percentage of GNP has now been brought back below the 1979 level.</P>
    <P>These achievements are significant by any standards.  They result from the application of objective budgetary procedures, the exercise of strict controls on expenditure at all levels and quick and decisive action in mid-year when the risk of a major overrun became evident.  This performance has restored credibility to the whole budget process.  Its fundamental importance can be expressed quite simply by saying that, in 1983, we reduced the rate at which we were adding to the burden to be carried by taxpayers in future years.</P>
    <P>BASIS FOR COMPARISON WITH 1984 FIGURES</P>
    <P>The pre-budget estimates of receipts and expenditure for 1984 reflect the transfer of responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the postal and telecommunications services to An Post and Bord Telecom Eireann.  This change, as I have already pointed out on a number of occasions, has a major impact on the budgetary aggregates.  While a straightforward comparison can be made between the 1982 outturn and that for 1983, it is necessary, in order to compare the 1984 figures with the 1983 outturn, to adjust the latter to show what the position would have been had the permanent arrangements now in operation been in effect from the beginning of 1983.  The 1983 current budget deficit, adjusted on that basis, is £1,085 million or 8¼ per cent of GNP.  The corresponding overall Exchequer borrowing requirement is £1,853 million, or 14 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that these adjustments are simply for illustrative purposes and do nothing to alter the actual amount of funds the Exchequer had to raise in 1983 to finance its borrowing requirement. Nor does the change affect the position of the public sector as a whole.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="805" /> The adjustment do, however, provide a basis for assessing developments in the public finances in 1984.</P>
    <P>EXCHEQUER FINANCING</P>
    <P>In 1975, 26p in every £, or just over a quarter of tax revenue, was used in the service of Exchequer debt.  Last year we had to put aside nearly 37p of every £, or well over one third of an enormously increased volume of tax receipts for this purpose; total debt service costs were £1,713 million.  There is no need to spell out the restrictions that growing debt service costs impose on our budgetary strategy.  They are, however, the inevitable and painful results of previous years' borrowings, often for projects of dubious value and for needlessly high deficits.</P>
    <P>Because we have to borrow to meet our maturing debt obligations, as well as to secure new funds for the Exchequer each year, we are, in effect, paying off no net debt.  Instead, we are continuing to add massive amounts to our outstanding debt each year.  The only way we can effectively moderate the rapid growth in debt service costs is to reduce our appetite for new funds each year by controlling the Exchequer borrowing requirement.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Domestic Borrowing</i>
    </P>
    <P>Net sales of Government securities amounted to £839 million in 1983.  Of this, £579 million was bought by the domestic non-bank sector, an increase of 15 per cent on 1982.  Taking small savings into account, the total raised from the non-bank sector showed an increase of 23 per cent, substantially ahead of the increase in nominal GNP.  This was, of course, partly due to the continuing slackness of demand among alternative investment outlets.</P>
    <P>Receipts from the commercial banks were £225 million, compared with £250 million in 1982.  The sale of £185 million in Agricultural Commodities Intervention Bills to finance the purchase of agricultural produce into intervention was <Col N="806" /> mainly responsible for the fall-off in Exchequer funding from this sector. Investment in gilts from outside the State in 1983 came to £35 million, mainly reflecting the need of foreign institutions to cover Irish pound liabilities.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Foreign Borrowing</i>
    </P>
    <P>One gratifying aspect of the financing of the 1983 borrowing requirement was the fact that we were able to reduce our net foreign borrowing.  New funds raised abroad totalled £793 million, significantly below the 1982 figure of £1,148 million, which itself was down on the previous year's figure.  As a percentage of gross national product, the reduction in net foreign borrowing has been dramatic, down from some 12½ per cent of GNP in 1981 to about 6 per cent in 1983.   Net foreign borrowing as a percentage of GNP has thus been more than halved in over two years.</P>
    <P>We must maintain that downward trend.  The economy cannot afford the continuing drain of resources abroad to service ever-mounting foreign debt when those resources are so badly needed at home for future development.  Moreover, while the immediate crisis of confidence in the international banking system appears to have passed and our ability to borrow abroad is, of course, unquestioned, we still face considerable uncertainties in relation to movements in international interest and exchange rates, over which we have no control.</P>
    <P>There is another reason why we must continue to reduce our need for new foreign borrowing.  Every year, in addition to raising new money abroad to finance the Exchequer borrowing requirement, we must borrow to repay maturing foreign loans which were raised in earlier years.  This year, some £660 million must be raised for that purpose, compared to £374 million in 1983.  Apart from a drop in 1985, we are facing an even heavier annual burden of maturing foreign debt for the remainder of this decade.  Matters would be worse but for the considerable skill that has been exercised in spreading loan maturities.  Nonetheless, the sheer <Col N="807" /> volume of foreign borrowing undertaken in the past is now beginning to take its toll.  We can best cope with that increasing burden of repayments by curtailing our demand for new foreign borrowing each year and by continuing the progress made in that direction over the past two years.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SMALL SAVINGS</P>
    <P>These considerations support a policy of raising as much finance as possible in 1984 from domestic sources, provided this can be done on acceptable terms.  In 1983 there was a welcome increase in savings through the Post Office system and the Trustee Savings Banks, which assisted the domestic financing of the Exchequer's requirements.  Receipts were, however, still only a small fraction of the total amount needed.</P>
    <P>In order at least to maintain the 1983 level of receipts from small savings, and indeed to improve on it, I have decided that a number of changes are justified in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am abolishing the present age limit of 55 years for Index-Linked Savings Bonds and increasing the maximum holding from £10,000 to £15,000.  In future they can be bought by anyone from seven years of age upwards, as is the case with Savings Certificates.  For the sake of consistency, a similar change in the age restriction is being made in the case of Index-Linked National Instalment Savings.</P>
    <P>I have decided that the tax exemption limit of £120 for an individual and £240 for a married couple which at present applies to the Trustee Savings Banks' Ordinary Account deposits will in future apply also to their Investment Accounts.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation and thanks to the members of the National Savings Committee who give freely of their services for the promotion of savings in the community.  I have recently restructured the committee and given it specific terms of reference, and have every confidence <Col N="808" /> that the members will continue their excellent work to encourage the habit of thrift.</P>
    <P Just="Center">THE ECONOMIC SITUATION</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the economy is now responding favourably to the corrective measures taken last year and to the stimulus provided by the international recovery.  The average rate of inflation dropped by over six percentage points in 1983 and the expectation is for further moderation in the underlying rate.  Industrial exports and manufacturing output expanded significantly.  I am confident that this industrial recovery will continue to gain momentum.  The unemployment trend has already improved and I expect that the rate of job loss will continue to moderate with the revival of economic activity.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(Interruptions.)</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The international recovery, combined with growing domestic business confidence, should reverse the decline in private sector investment which has been experienced in recent years.  Confidence has been considerably boosted by the reduction achieved in the Exchequer borrowing requirement and by the improvement in the balance of payments in 1983.  The balance of payments deficit was reduced from over 8½ per cent of GNP in 1982 to about 2½ per cent in 1983.</P>
      <P Just="Center">GENERAL BUDGET STRATEGY 1984</P>
      <P>GENERAL BUDGET POLICY</P>
      <P>I have already outlined the general policy considerations that lie behind this year's Budget.  It is clear that the overall level of borrowing remains excessive. The consequential high level of debt servicing puts an appalling restraint on our ability to create employment and must therefore be reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The critical policy issue is the appropriate <Col N="809" /> degree of adjustment to be aimed at in 1984.  I have indicated that overall policy requires a slower pace of contraction in the borrowing requirement than would result from a purely arithmetical approach to the elimination of the current budget deficit by 1987.  I must make it clear, however, that this policy stance necessarily involves some element of risk.  It may, as events unfold, prove necessary to adopt more restrictive policies in 1985 and later years.  I want to avert this possibility, and it is precisely for that reason that tight budgetary management will again be of crucial importance this year.</P>
    <P>OPENING POSITION</P>
    <P>The published opening current deficit is £1,120 million, taking account of a contribution of £50 million to non-tax revenue by Bord Telecom Éireann which arises this year for the first time.  Deducting an estimated £25 million which Departments have in balances from 1983, the actual opening deficit is £1,095 million, compared with a 1983 adjusted outturn of £1,085 million.  This represents an actual reduction in real terms, reflecting the substantial curtailment of expenditure already achieved in the decisions on the published Estimates.</P>
    <P>The overall opening Exchequer borrowing requirement, taking account of Departmental balances, comes to £1,865 million.  This is down by about 1¼ percentage points of GNP compared with the corresponding 1983 outturn.</P>
    <P>BUDGET TARGETS</P>
    <P>The Government have decided that today's Budget changes will be broadly neutral in terms of their impact on the opening Exchequer borrowing requirement. The balance between the current budget deficit and borrowing for capital purposes is, however, being altered marginally in favour of the capital side.  I am also providing for social welfare improvements and other expenditure concessions as well as for some income tax concessions. This is made possible, however, <Col N="810" /> only by some further increases in taxes but on a scale far below those of recent years.  Before dealing with the details of the expenditure and tax proposals, I would like to refer to policy on public service pay and incomes policy generally which are critical to the achievement of the Government's fiscal and economic objectives in 1984.</P>
    <P Just="Center">PUBLIC SERVICE PAY AND INCOMES POLICY</P>
    <P>PUBLIC SERVICE PAY AND PENSIONS</P>
    <P>Public service pay and pension costs will account for about 37 per cent of gross Exchequer expenditure on the non-capital supply services in 1984.  Taking account of a pensions concession which I will announce later, the provision for public service pay and pensions in the 1984 Estimates is £2,376 million, 8.9 per cent more than the provisional 1983 outturn.</P>
    <P>No Government can bring the cost of public services more into line with the capacity and willingness of taxpayers to finance them unless it contains the growth of the public service pay bill.  In the Government's view, it is not unreasonable to ask public servants, who generally enjoy greater protection from risks of unemployment than private sector workers, to have particular regard to the difficulty of the Exchequer finances, on which their very security of employment is based.  We are therefore making no provision for any increases under a new pay round in 1984.</P>
    <P>GENERAL INCOMES POLICY</P>
    <P>Pay settlements in the economy generally in 1983 were more moderate than in 1982.  Nevertheless, they were well in excess of the guideline set out in the Government's statement of 10 March last.  This guideline was framed to improve the capacity and performance of the economy and, in particular, to protect existing jobs and provide new jobs.  The inadequate response by pay negotiators <Col N="811" /> undoubtedly contributed to high redundancies in 1983.</P>
    <P>The challenge this year is as great as that posed in 1983.  Our trading partners, particularly in Europe, are continuing to reduce the rate of increase in earnings and there is every expectation that their increases this year will generally be in low single digits.  If we do not follow suit, our competitiveness will suffer.  When there are over 200,000 people out of work, the labour force is increasing rapidly and there is growing competition on international markets for new investment, competitiveness must be a prime concern.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, the Government feel that it is vital for pay negotiations this year to have far greater regard than in 1983 to the effects of wage and salary increases on the survival of enterprises and on their long-term growth prospects. Management and unions, both at a general level and in individual firms, must seriously consider whether there is scope for any increase in pay on the expiry of current agreements.  As far as the public service is concerned, the Government, as I have indicated, have decided to make no further provision for increases in public service pay rates in 1984.</P>
    <P>In the coming weeks, the Government hope to have further meetings with the social partners to explore ways of solving our current economic and social difficulties and particularly our unemployment problem.   The resolution of these problems will require joint and co-ordinated efforts by all who are involved in shaping the course of our economic development.</P>
    <P Just="Center">CURRENT EXPENDITURE</P>
    <P>CENTRAL FUND SERVICES</P>
    <P>The estimate for expenditure on Central Fund Services this year, at £1,940 million, is £237 million or 14 per cent higher than the corresponding outturn for 1983.  The cost of servicing the public debt accounts for £208 million of this increase while the balance is accounted for mainly by an increased contribution <Col N="812" /> to the EEC budget.  As I have already emphasised, the only way we can moderate the growth in debt service costs is to reduce the Exchequer borrowing requirement and at the same time ensure that the funds which are borrowed are used to maximum effect in opening up sustainable job opportunities.</P>
    <P>CURRENT SUPPLY SERVICES</P>
    <P>The published 1984 Estimates for the non-capital supply services amount to £5,061 million.  Later on, I will announce adjustments to the provisions in the published Estimates, the effect of which will be to add about £84 million to current expenditure.  Allowing for this, and for the deduction of £25 million Departmental balances, the post-budget provision for the non-capital supply services is £5,120 million, an increase of over 10 per cent on the corresponding 1983 figure. This is a smaller increase than occurred between 1982 and 1983.  There are particularly powerful forces which act to increase current expenditure, notably the continuing rise in unemployment and the continuing growth in population, which put pressure on the social services.   In the face of this pressure, the cut in the rate of growth of current spending, and consequently in the requirement for further taxation, is a major achievement.</P>
    <P>Taking account of the budget adjustments, there will be a reduction in real terms in the resources consumed by the Government in providing public services, while the resources transferred from one section of the population to another by Government action will actually increase, as is appropriate in a recession.</P>
    <P>PUBLIC SERVICE NUMBERS</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to promote, as a matter of priority, measures designed to give a more cost-effective public service and one reduced to a size which will be more in keeping with what the country can afford.  The numbers serving in most areas of the public service have been falling in the period since 1981 when we introduced restrictions on the <Col N="813" /> filling of vacancies.  As a result, there has been a significant overall reduction in the numbers now employed, despite the fact that for compelling reasons there have been increases in the numbers employed in the Garda Síochána and in teaching areas.</P>
    <P>The 1984 Estimates have been prepared on the basis that restrictions on public service numbers will continue throughout 1984.  This means that the arrangements whereby two-thirds of all vacancies occurring in the civil service and non-commercial semi-State bodies are held open will continue in force. Measures at least equivalent in effect in terms of the number of posts which must remain unfilled and their cost will be applied in the local authority areas and to non-teaching staff in the education area.  In the health agencies, measures of equivalent effect in terms of payroll costs will be applied.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the policy of reducing the size of the public service, the existing arrangements for the staffing of new or expanded services will continue in operation &mdash; that is to say, the provision of any additional posts for such services in 1984 will be on the basis that existing schemes and programmes will be eliminated or curtailed to the extent necessary to yield at least equivalent savings both in terms of the number of posts and their annual cost.</P>
    <P>PUBLIC SERVICE PENSIONS</P>
    <P>Current practice is to increase public service pensions on 1 July each year by reference to changes in the pay rates of serving officers within the previous twelve months.  There has been pressure for many years now for full parity, that is, for pension adjustments to take effect from the same date as the pay increases. Last year, as an exceptional measure the Minister for the Public Service agreed in the course of the pay negotiations that the first phase of the public service pay agreement would, in general, apply with effect from 1 September 1983 to pensions in course of payment on that date.  The Government have now decided that in <Col N="814" /> the case of general pay increases such as the second phase of the public service pay agreement, full parity will be implemented from 1 February 1984 onwards at an estimated cost of £2 million.  So far as grade or special increases are concerned, parity will be dealt with in the context of negotiations for the next pay round and the new arrangements will be implemented in 1985.  Negotiators will, of course, have to take these commitments into account in costing future pay claims.</P>
    <P>SOCIAL WELFARE</P>
    <P>The Government came to office with a commitment to keep short-term social welfare benefits in line with increases in the take-home pay of workers and to maintain the living standards of other weekly welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>We have more than met this commitment. While the living standards of those at work fell, short-term weekly rates of benefit were increased last June by 10 per cent, and other weekly benefits by 12 per cent.  The long-term unemployed benefited from a further 5 per cent increase in October and pensioners received a double week's payment at Christmas.   These improvements alone will compensate all welfare beneficiaries for price inflation well into 1984.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Long-term Benefits and Allowances</i></P>
    <P>The Government have decided that all long-term weekly welfare rates will be increased by 7 per cent with effect from 5 July.  Weekly health allowances will be increased similarly.</P>
    <P>The proposed increases will mean an extra £3.15 a week for a contributory old age pensioner who is under 80, bringing the pension to £48.25 a week.  A non-contributory pensioner under 80 will get an increase of £2.70 a week, bringing his or her maximum pension to £41.30 a week.  Where a married couple are both of pension age and under 80, the new rates of contributory pension will mean an increase of £5.50 a week, so that their total pension will be £84.25 a week.  The contributory pension of a widow under 66 years with two children will be <Col N="815" /> increased by £4.45 a week, and her non-contributory counterpart will benefit by £4.10.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Short-term Benefits and Allowances</i></P>
    <P>The Government have also decided that short-term weekly rates of benefit will be increased generally by 7 per cent. These increases will be implemented during the first week of July.  This will mean, for example, that flat-rate unemployment benefit and disability benefit of a married couple with two dependent children will increase by £5.30 a week giving them a total of £80.15 a week.  This may, of course, be topped up by pay-related benefits.</P>
    <P>The Government would not wish to see an imbalance between disposable earnings when at work and income obtainable when not at work, namely, flat-rate and pay-related benefits, combined where appropriate with income tax rebates.  During the course of the Adjournment Debate last month, the Minister for Social Welfare announced to the House some modest changes that will help maintain a sensible balance.  These changes are already allowed for in the published Estimates.</P>
    <P>The Government are extremely concerned at the increase during the present economic recession in long-duration unemployment and at the hardship this imposes on the people involved.  I have already referred to the special 5 per cent increase given last October in the rate of unemployment assistance to persons unemployed for at least 15 months.  The Government have decided that this group merits some special recognition this year also.  Their unemployment assistance rates will be increased by 8 per cent, as compared with 7 per cent for other unemployment payments.  This increase, too, will be implemented from the first week in July.</P>
    <P>For a single person on long-duration unemployment assistance in an urban area, this will mean an increase of £2.45 per week, bringing the weekly payment to £32.80.  Most of those people will enjoy the fact that the rate of inflation has come <Col N="816" /> down substantially below what the Opposition achieved during their period of office.  Those in rural areas will receive an increase of £2.35 per week, bringing the weekly payment to £31.75.  A married couple with two children resident in an urban area will receive an increase of £5.50 per week, while a similar family in a rural area will receive an increase of £5.35 per week.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Children's Allowances</i></P>
    <P>The Government have decided to increase monthly children's allowances by 7 per cent from August.  The allowance for each of the first five children will rise from £11.25 to £12.05 a month, and for the sixth and subsequent children from £17.50 to £18.75 a month.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Family Income Supplement</i></P>
    <P>I have already referred to the Government's concern about the relationship between disposable earnings from work and short-term benefits.  Last year I allocated £5 million to help families with low take-home earnings from work, subject to determining the details of a scheme. This process proved more difficult than anticipated at the time.  I am glad, however, to be able to tell the House that the Family Income Supplement Scheme, with an annual cost of £13 million, will come into operation in November.  The Minister for Social Welfare will announce full details of the scheme in due course.</P>

    </P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme will deal with a problem which was totally unrecognised by the present Opposition Party and that, no doubt, is why they find it amusing.  The unknown is always amusing to those who are ignorant of the facts.</P>
      <P>&mdash;<i>Equal Treatment</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EEC Directive on equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security is due to be implemented before the end of this year.  The matters outstanding, which affect mainly the social <Col N="817" /> welfare entitlements of married women, will entail complex legislation, which will be introduced later this year.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Free Travel</i></P>
    <P>Under an exception to the general rule which restricts free travel to off-peak periods, certain categories of disabled people attending full-time, long-term rehabilitation courses may travel free during peak hours.  As some anomalies have come to light, I propose extending unrestricted free travel for the purposes of attending full-time, long-term rehabilitation courses to all blind persons, social welfare invalidity pensioners and recipients of British or Northern Ireland invalidity pension or benefit.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Free Telephone Rentals</i></P>
    <P>The free telephone rental scheme is available to certain categories of welfare recipients living alone.  The presence of even a young child in the household automatically disqualifies a claimant. This disqualification will be abolished in respect of children under 15 years.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Voluntary Organisations</i></P>
    <P>In my last budget I provided £0.5 million towards the work of suitable voluntary bodies in the social services area, preferably for &ldquo;once-off&rdquo; projects.  The Government consider that this was money well spent.  We have therefore decided to allocate a further £0.5 million this year for the same purpose, additional to any grants already decided by the health boards for the bodies involved in 1984.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Medical Card Eligibility of the Elderly</i></P>
    <P>In conjunction with today's changes in the social welfare rates for the elderly, the Minister for Health, through the health boards, will provide a special allowance for the elderly in the medical card income guidelines from 1 July:</P>
    <P>£5 for a single person aged 66 or over and £8 if over 80; for a married couple, the special allowance will be £10 for those aged 66 or over and £16 if over 80.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="818" /> The net extra cost of the social welfare changes I have announced is £70.3 million in 1984 and £152 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Pay-Related Social Insurance</i></P>
    <P>For the second year in succession, the social insurance fund contribution rate will remain unchanged, notwithstanding the continuing growth in benefit levels and in numbers of claimants.  There will be no change either in the earnings ceiling to which this rate applies.  As provided for in the published Estimates, however, the ceiling for the 1 per cent health contribution will be increased from £11,000 to £12,000 next April.</P>
    <P>Benefit costs of the redundancy fund and occupational injuries fund are funded solely by employers.  The contribution rates to these funds, which were reduced on a temporary basis in recent years in the light of accumulated reserves, must now be increased, broadly to their pre-1981 levels, in order to maintain the funds' solvency.  The increase will be 0.49 of a percentage point in the employer's standard contribution rate, effective from next April.</P>
    <P>ENTERPRISE ALLOWANCE SCHEME</P>
    <P>Towards the end of 1983 the Government introduced an enterprise allowance scheme on a pilot basis.  This imaginative innovation, which recognises the initiative and self-enterprise of so many among the unemployed, has already generated a significant response.  The Minister for Labour has responsibility for administering the scheme, which is designed to encourage people unemployed for at least 13 weeks to set up their own enterprises. Instead of the social welfare benefits, they are paid a weekly allowance of £50 or £30, depending on marital status, for a period of up to one year.  With its introduction on a pilot basis in December 1983 500 places were made available, about 300 for persons over 25 and 200 for younger applicants.  Demand has already been very high, particularly from those over twenty-five.  In the light of present experience, which is to be evaluated at <Col N="819" /> the end of the pilot phase, the Minister for Labour will consider the desirability of expanding the scheme to ensure the maximum possible contribution to the job-creation process.</P>
    <P>AGRICULTURE</P>
    <P>Family farm incomes increased by over 11 per cent in nominal terms and by 1 per cent in real terms in 1983.  Allowing for the decline in the farm labour force, farm incomes per head increased in real terms by some 3.5 per cent last year.  The prospects for the coming year will depend largely on the outcome of the current negotiations on changes in the Common Agricultural Policy and on agricultural prices.  The Government are firmly resolved to achieve a satisfactory outcome to the super-levy issue.</P>
    <P>In this budget I am providing an extra £5.7 million for the extension of the AI and ground limestone subsidy schemes. These EEC schemes are due to expire on 30 April next and their extension is being sought because of their importance in raising agricultural productivity.</P>
    <P>I am also providing £100,000 for the proposed potato co-operative which will aim to improve potato marketing.  This assistance is being provided on the basis that the industry will contribute to the cost on a increasing scale from 1985 and will quickly assume full financial responsibility.</P>
    <P>OTHER EXPENDITURE</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Grant to An Post</i></P>
    <P>I have already referred to the fact that the postal and telecommunications services are now part of the commercial State sector.  Even though the finances of the postal service have improved in recent years &mdash; the service broke even in 1982 and 1983 &mdash; the Government have decided to set aside up to £5 million for the service in 1984.  It is intended that the level of payment will be related to the company's financial performance and to their development plan, which is expected to be ready shortly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="820" />&mdash;<i>Bord Fáilte and Córas Tráchtála</i></P>
    <P>An extra £300,000 is being allocated to Bord Fáilte's promotions budget to enable them to take advantage of the present opportunities in the North American market to attract visitors to Ireland.  An extra £200,000 is being provided for Córas Tráchtála which will enable them to spend, overall, £400,000 on their employment support scheme, under which they provide financial assistance to firms to recruit full-time export marketing personnel.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Passports</i></P>
    <P>At present all passports are issued for a fee of £30 and are valid for a maximum of ten years.  The Government are aware of the special financial difficulties faced by our young people and our older citizens, and of the particular problems faced by young Irish people living in other countries, many of whom see the choice of travel document as involving an important symbol of national and cultural identity. The Government have, accordingly, decided that persons under 18 years of age, or over 65 years of age, may be issued passports for a fee of £3 for each year for which a passport is required. These revised arrangements, which will take effect from 15 March next, will cost about £500,000.  Provision for this has already been made in the pre-budget figures.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Irish Welfare Centres in Britain</i></P>
    <P>The Government also wish to respond more fully to the needs of the Irish community in Britain and have accordingly decided to increase the allocation for the Irish welfare centres from £38,000 to £68,000.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Additional Allocation for Sport</i></P>
    <P>We all recognise that 1984 is a very significant year for sport in Ireland.  Two major events will dominate the sporting scene: the Gaelic Athletic Association's celebration of the centenary of their foundation, and Ireland's representation in the Olympic Games.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="821" /> To mark the GAA's centenary, the Government have decided to contribute £100,000 for specific projects connected with the occasion, to be decided in consultation between the association and the Minister of State at the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>I have also decided to make £140,000 available to the Olympic Council of Ireland to assist in the preparation of the Irish team for the Olympic Games.  A further £10,000 will be made available to assist in preparing and sending a team to the Olympics for the Disabled.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have decided to allocate a further £50,000 to sporting organisations. Of this amount, £35,000 is for five major organisations, including the National Community Games, to enable them to take full advantage of the very high level of interest in sport that will be generated among young people by the 1984 Olympic Games.  The remainder of the money will be allocated to three other sporting organisations to help them participate in major international competitions in 1984.  The details are set out in the <i>Principal Features of the Budget.</i></P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Youth Affairs</i></P>
    <P>I am allocating an additional £100,000 to the youth affairs activities sponsored by the Department of Labour.  This money will be devoted to further development of the programme initiated last year designed to help young people in various deprived urban areas around the country.</P>
    <P Just="Center">CAPITAL BUDGET</P>
    <P>PUBLIC CAPITAL PROGRAMME</P>
    <P>The published 1984 Public Capital Programme provides for expenditure of £1,780 million, about 2 per cent higher than the provisional outturn for 1983. The Government have decided that it is possible to accommodate a limited increase in this provision within the overall budgetary targets.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="822" />&mdash;<i>Roads</i></P>
    <P>An additional Exchequer allocation of £8 million has been made for improvements on national and major urban roads, bringing the total for road improvements in 1984 to £98 million.  A review of the road development plan is now practically completed and will be considered over the next few months in the context of the Government's medium-term strategy.  The review will help to determine investment priorities and to achieve greater progress on the more urgent road projects.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Deepwater Berth at Ringaskiddy</i></P>
    <P>The Government have decided to provide financial assistance to the Cork Harbour Commissioners for the construction of a deepwater berth at Ringaskiddy.  A provision of £2 million is being made in 1984 and work on the project will commence in the near future.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Galway Airport</i></P>
    <P>Provision for the development of Carnmore Airport, Galway, has been strongly recommended by the IDA as a means of underpinning the substantial industrial development in the area in recent years and of facilitating further expansion.  In view of these factors and in view of the strong financial support of local industrial and commercial interests, the Government have decided to allocate £300,000 this year for this project and to hold further detailed consultations with the promoters.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Loan Finance for House Purchase</i></P>
    <P>An extra £6 million is being provided for loan finance for house purchase &mdash; £3 million from the Exchequer for SDA loans and an increase of £3 million in the amount which the Housing Finance Agency will have available.  The total Public Capital Programme provision for house purchase loans in 1984 now becomes £141 million out of a total housing allocation of £377 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="823" />&mdash;<i>Primary School Building</i></P>
    <P>An additional Exchequer allocation of £2 million has been made for primary school building.  It will be spent on updating substandard primary school accommodation and replacing prefabricated and other temporary accommodation by permanent classrooms.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Air/Sea Rescue</i></P>
    <P>Contracts have already been placed for five new helicopters which will enable us to provide a more modern search and rescue and air ambulance service, especially at night and in conditions of reduced visibility.  In addition, the Government are making a capital provision of £100,000 available for harbour improvements which will enhance the response capability of the marine rescue services.</P>
    <P>MEDIUM-TERM CAPITAL PROGRAMME</P>
    <P>A major review of public sector investment requirements and resources in the medium-term is now under way.  During the year the Government will adopt a medium-term public capital programme. We have also called for five-year corporate plans from all of the commercial State bodies.  These will be two important elements in the preparation of our medium-term strategy for economic development.</P>
    <P>EXCHEQUER BORROWING REQUIREMENT FOR CAPITAL PURPOSES</P>
    <P>Taking account of non-programme outlays, for which an Exchequer provision of £100 million has been made, total Exchequer-financed capital expenditure in 1984 is estimated at £1,066 million. Capital resources at the disposal of the Exchequer will be about £281 million, leaving an Exchequer borrowing requirement for capital purposes of £785 million.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="824" /> POST-BUDGET EXPENDITURE POSITION</P>
    <P>After taking account of the adjustments I have announced to the Estimates and Public Capital Programme as published, the proportion of GNP represented by public expenditure, including debt service, will be about the same in 1984 as in 1983.  To contain public expenditure in this way at a time of economic difficulty is not easy; the Government are, however, determined that action on expenditure will play its proper part in bringing balance to the public finances.  We are also committed to adhering to the budget's overall expenditure provisions.  The Government have already adopted, on my proposal, a system for monitoring and controlling expenditure on a monthly basis, and we are ready to take prompt corrective action should potential excesses emerge.</P>
    <P Just="Center">CURRENT REVENUE</P>
    <P>Tax revenue, before taking account of today's adjustments, is estimated at £5,254 million, or almost 12¼ per cent above the 1983 outturn.  The estimate for non-tax revenue, which no longer includes Post Office revenue, is £627 million. This figure includes the contribution which I have already mentioned of £50 million by way of a special pre-payment of interest by Bord Telecom Eireann. Further returns will accrue in future years in respect of the massive State investment in telecommunications.  No provision is made at this point for any receipts in 1984 from EMS subsidies, which in 1983 yielded some £44 million.  The possibility of obtaining some revenue from a continuation of these subsidies in 1984 is being pursued.</P>
    <P>Last year, some commentators considered that the budget revenue forecasts were unduly conservative.  In the event, however, revenue was marginally down on target.  There is, as always, some uncertainty about the revenue forecast, which should be seen as a mid-point <Col N="825" /> within a significant range and is heavily dependent on how the economy performs. I am hopeful, however, that this year, as in 1983, revenue will be reasonably close to the budget forecast.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, the achievement of the budget targets which the Government have set requires that there be some net increase in taxation. The increase proposed today is, in fact, the lowest for many years.  This change in trend is a first step towards ultimately reducing the tax burden.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TAXATION</P>
    <P>MEDIUM-TERM TAXATION POLICY</P>
    <P>Before I deal with individual aspects of taxation, I want to summarise the Government's policy on taxation in the medium-term.</P>
    <P>The Government hope to receive a draft medium-term plan covering the years to 1987 from the National Planning Board by next April.  Taxation must be an important element in any Government economic planning and I understand that the board will deal with this topic in some detail.  The Government have already received the First Report of the Commission on Taxation and this, together with the National Planning Board's views, will provide a most useful input into Government thinking on the subject.</P>
    <P>It would be premature for me to anticipate what will be in the Government's medium-term plan on the subject of taxation but it would be desirable, I think, for me to sketch the path along which I feel tax reform should go.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Taxation have listed three main criteria for a tax system, namely, simplicity, equity and efficiency. Our present tax arrangements can be faulted under all three headings and it must be the Government's priority in the years ahead to take progressive steps, as circumstances permit, to make the system simpler, more equitable and more efficient.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to achieve and maintain simplicity in taxation.  Since Government <Col N="826" /> policy has multiple objectives and the tax system is a vehicle of Government policy, the system invariably becomes very complicated as allowances, deductions and exemptions of various kinds are grafted on &mdash; often, it must be said, for very good reasons.  In our case, the result has been an erosion of the tax base which has in turn required steeply progressive income tax rates to raise the necessary revenue. In practice, because many taxpayers in the higher-income groups can reduce their tax liability by making full use of the deductions and reliefs, the degree of progressivity is less than the nominal rates would suggest.  It would be desirable in the coming years to set ourselves the objective of restoring the tax base by progressively reducing or abolishing allowances, reliefs and deductions.  It would also be desirable to extend the base by bringing within it certain receipts, accuring in money or in kind, which are now excluded.  This approach, which would permit progress towards a reduction of tax rates, is generally in line with that taken by the Commission on Taxation. I understand that the thinking of the National Planning Board is on similar lines.</P>
    <P>Progress has been made in recent years towards making the tax system more equitable.  It will continue to be the Government's objective to ensure that tax is levied fairly and equitably on all taxpayers.  An important point to remember is that tax is only one element, although a very important one, in redistributing income.  At least equally important is the redistributive effect of public expenditure.  In examining the equity or inequity of policies, the tax system should not be judged in isolation from the composition of Government expenditure.  It is easy to be critical of specific tax measures and to point to anomalies.  We should be equally critical in making assessments of expenditure programmes.</P>
    <P>The tax system should also encourage the most efficient use of the economic resources of the community.  It should strengthen the incentive to work, to save and to take risks.</P>
    <P>There are undoubted conflicts between the three criteria of simplicity, equity and <Col N="827" /> efficiency and these have to be reconciled at any given time.  Care has also to be taken that changes do not cause individual hardship or that new anomalies do not emerge as a result.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day the most important element is the total burden of taxation. Withdrawal of existing concessions for particular individuals or groups is much easier if the general level of taxation is being brought down.  However desirable it might be to reduce taxation, this cannot be done on a significant scale, if at all, until current expenditure is reduced and the current budget deficit eliminated.</P>
    <P>This consideration also applies to the proposal for a single rate of tax made by the Commission on Taxation.  I said last year that this was not a practical proposition at the time because the rate needed to sustain the direct tax yield would have to be at too high a level.  A high single rate of tax would be unfair to less well-off taxpayers.  I do not see a prospect of implementing this recommendation until it becomes possible to reduce the burden of taxation to a marked degree.</P>
    <P>INCOME TAX</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Tax Credits</i></P>
    <P>I said last year that the introduction of income tax credits was being considered by the Government as a longer-term option.  A changeover to credits is not, however, a practical option in the short term because the resources required to cope with the administrative task involved are not available.  Besides, the introduction of credits would be inequitable when income tax rates are high.  The argument for credits is that they equalise the benefit of allowances and reliefs. However, many middle-income earners are now being taxed at high marginal rates and the introduction of tax credits would penalise these people at a time when their tax burden is already severe. I propose, therefore, to retain the existing income tax structure but I will keep the question of credits under review in the light of changing tax levels.</P>

      <P>Despite the budget constraints, I believe it is desirable to provide now for some reductions in income tax.  These must inevitably be modest because of the necessity to sustain tax revenue.</P>
      <P>The number of people paying tax at a marginal rate of 25 per cent has been decreasing as a result of the effectiveness of the exemption limits in catering for the lower paid.  I have therefore decided to eliminate the 25 per cent band and substantially widen the 35 per cent band to £4,000 for a single person and £8,000 for a married couple.</P>
      <P>To ensure that taxpayers at all levels are more than compensated for these changes, I am increasing the personal allowance by £350 for a single person and £700 for a married couple.  In addition, the widowed person's allowance and the one-parent family allowance will each be increased by £350.  A widowed person with children will, therefore, be entitled to the same personal allowance as a married couple.</P>
      <P>I am also improving the exemption limits for those on low incomes.  The general exemption limit for single and widowed persons will be increased from £2,400 to £2,500 and from £4,800 to £5,000 for married couples.  This is the second year in a row in which these exemption rates have been increased.  The age exemption limits are being increased from £2,500 to £2,800 for persons aged 65 years or over and from £3,000 to £3,300 for persons aged 75 years or over.  These limits will be doubled for married couples.  Marginal relief will continue for those whose income does not greatly exceed these amounts.  These changes will remove about 15,000 low-income taxpayers from liability.</P>
      <P>The changes in rate bands, allowances and exemption limits will cost £40 million in 1984 and £67 million in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="829" /> Given the relatively small amount of money available, I have ensured that the benefit in percentage terms is distributed as fairly as possible while ensuring that the amount of tax paid by all taxpayers is reduced.</P>
    <P>A special income tax allowance of £700 is available where a person is employed to take care of an incapacitated taxpayer or his spouse.  This allowance is being increased to £2,000 at a cost of £150,000 in 1984 and £250,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Renewal of PRSI Tax Allowance and I per cent Levy on Income</i></P>
    <P>The special PRSI tax allowance and the temporary levy of 1 per cent on income are to be renewed for a further year.  The estimated cost of renewing the PRSI tax allowance is £51 million in 1984, whereas the renewal of the temporary 1 per cent levy, on the existing basis, would yield £45 million this year.</P>
    <P>The Government recognise, however, that the payment of the income levy is severe on those who are on low incomes, especially as the charge is based on gross income.  The Government have therefore decided that from April onwards low-income persons will be exempted from payment of this levy.  In the case of employees, the levy will not be payable in any week where income is less than £96.  In the case of the self-employed, exemption will apply where income for the year is less than £5,000.  The cost of this concession is estimated at £5 million in 1984 and £9 million in a full year. Approximately 350,000 persons will benefit.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Profit-Sharing</i></P>
    <P>In the 1982 Finance Act, a scheme was introduced to provide income tax exemption for shares given by companies to their employees under approved profit-sharing arrangements.  This was intended to promote a greater involvement by workers in their employer companies and to aid industrial relations.  To date the scheme has made only a small impact.  This may be due to the restriction, of 20 per cent of profits, on the <Col N="830" /> amount of expenditure under the scheme which companies may deduct in computing their profits for tax purposes and the ceiling of £1,000 on the value of shares allocated to an employee in any one year.</P>
    <P>I will provide in the Finance Bill that the restriction on profits under the scheme will be removed and that the ceiling per employee be raised to £5,000.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Rent in respect of Private Tenancies</i></P>
    <P>In 1982 a scheme was introduced to provide income tax relief for rent paid in respect of private tenancies up to a maximum of £500 for single and £1,000 for married persons aged 65 years or over. With effect from the tax year 1984-85, the age threshold will be reduced to 60 years.  This improvement will cost £600,000 in 1984 and £1 million in a full tax year.  It is estimated that some 4,000 taxpayers will benefit.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Benefits-in-Kind</i></P>
    <P>I am concerned at the implications for tax yield of the growth of benefits-in-kind as a means of remuneration.  Traditionally, such benefits were confined to cars and preferential loans.  There is now a much wider and growing range of benefits and these are being introduced, in many instances, as an alternative to remuneration, simply as a means of avoiding taxation.  The present legislation on benefits-in-kind needs revision and it also needs to be extended to cover benefits which are not subject to tax at present. This is a complex issue because of the variety of benefits and I am having it examined in detail with a view to considering appropriate taxation provisions next year.</P>
    <P>TAXATION OF THE SELF-EMPLOYED</P>
    <P>I said in the course of the budget statement last year that I hoped to incorporate the necessary provisions in the 1984 Finance Bill with a view to having a current year basis of assessment of the self-employed in operation for the tax year 1984-85.  I made it clear at the time that there could be no concessions involving <Col N="831" /> a net loss of revenue as part of a change-over package.</P>
    <P>On further examination of the problems associated with the introduction of a current assessment arrangement, I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that it is preferable to retain the existing system for the time being.  In the first place, the change would not produce additional revenue, in the short term at least, even if no concessions were granted.  Furthermore, administrative work both for taxpayers and the Revenue would be significantly increased and assessments would obviously be less reliable and more open to challenge if they were based on necessarily tentative estimates of income in respect of a year which was not yet completed.  I believe that a more effective return from the self-employed can be obtained by improving the present arrangements rather than introducing a new system which would be unreliable and would create further administrative complications for all concerned.  The specified amount of tax payable by self-employed taxpayers who appeal an assessment is, therefore, being increased from 80 per cent to 85 per cent of the final amount due: this measure will relate to assessments made for the year 1984-85 and subsequent years.  This is estimated to yield an extra £7 million in tax revenue this year.</P>
    <P>CAPITAL TAXATION</P>
    <P>The general perception is that the yield from capital taxation in this country is low.  In reality, if we take the internationally-accepted definition of capital taxes, which includes stamp duties and property taxes, the yield in 1983 was £193 million or about 4 per cent of total taxation.  This is a substantial amount by any reasonable standard.</P>
    <P>The yield in 1983 from capital acquisitions tax, capital gains tax and residential property tax was more than £24 million. The corresponding pre-budget estimate for this year is £23 million.  This decline in yield does not reflect any reduction in the rates of capital taxation.  Indeed, on <Col N="832" /> the basis of the changes made in recent years, a substantially higher yield would in the normal course have been expected this year.  The main explanation for the decline is the impact of the recession which has severely affected the number of capital transactions and eroded the capital tax base.  Significant buoyancy cannot be expected under this heading until property and other markets recover from the recession.  The recession has particularly affected the capital gains tax. I am, however, proposing a number of changes which will close some loopholes and increase the yield.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Capital Gains Tax</i></P>
    <P>Up to now, capital gains tax has not been chargeable on receipts from the sale of a principal private residence.  This exemption is reasonable, especially as the receipts are usually required for the purchase of another house.  Where, however, a residence is sold for a significantly inflated price because of its development potential, it is appropriate that there should be a charge to tax.  Capital gains tax will, therefore, apply in future to such receipts to the extent that they are deemed to exceed the current-use value of the property.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Capital Acquisitions Tax</i></P>
    <P>The capital acquisitions tax provisions are very fragmented and there is need for a reorganisation.  I propose to provide in the Finance Bill for a common table of tax rates ranging from 20 to 55 per cent and for aggregation of all gifts and inheritances. There will continue to be differing thresholds for different degrees of relationship.  This rationalisation of the tax will yield £1 million this year and £4 million in a full year.  The full details of the revised structure will be published in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Discretionary Trusts</i></P>
    <P>Last year I said that I was examining what tax measures might be required to ensure that discretionary trusts are not used as a vehicle for abuse.  Having examined this matter I am proposing that, in <Col N="833" /> respect of existing and new trusts, there will be a once-off charge of 3 per cent where the settlor is deceased and no beneficiary is under 25 years of age.  This tax is directed at those trusts which are set up essentially to avoid tax or delay indefinitely the payment of capital acquisitions tax.  However, there will be exemption in the case of trusts which provide for incapacitated persons or for public or charitable purposes.  I estimate that the new tax will yield £1½ million in revenue this year.</P>
    <P>TAXATION OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Building Societies</i></P>
    <P>I propose to alter the timing for payment by building societies of tax on interest and dividends paid by them to their investors.  Instead of the tax on interest and dividends payable to investors in 1984 being due for payment in January 1985, one half of that tax will be payable on 1 October 1984 and the other half on 1 April 1985, the normal grace period to apply in the case of both new dates.  This will provide an estimated extra yield of £20 million this year.  The composite rate for 1984-85 for all societies will remain at 75 per cent of the standard rate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I said last year that the bank levy would be phased out over the next few years.  I also indicated that I would consider whether, in order to reduce the amount of tax lost to the Exchequer, tax-based financing might be restricted by limiting its scope in accordance with official industrial promotion policy.  The levy will remain at £25 million for 1984.  It will, however, be reviewed in future years in line with the increase in corporation tax payments from banks which will arise from the imposition of the following restrictions on tax-based financing.  With effect from today, new &ldquo;section 84&rdquo; lending and artificial preference <Col N="834" /> share financing will not confer a tax advantage.  In addition, accelerated capital allowances, that is, free depreciation and initial allowances, will not be allowed in respect of assets leased from today to customers by financial institutions, except where such new leasing forms part of a grant-aided incentive package by the State industrial promotion agencies.  The overall amount of leasing will be maintained at about the present level sponsored by these agencies. The Finance Bill will contain provisions to ensure that these measures are not circumvented by the transfer of tax-based leasing to the non-financial sector or by the undue continuation of existing &ldquo;section 84&rdquo; loan arrangements.  The first significant impact on the tax yield from banks will not arise until 1985.  There will be a smaller increase of about £7 million in the yield this year.</P>
      <P>&mdash;<i>Insurance Levy</i></P>
      <P>The insurance levy will be retained this year but, in response to proposals from the industry, a variation in the method of charge in the case of life business will be provided for in the Finance Bill.  The revised scheme will be the equivalent of the present scheme in terms of revenue yield.</P>
      <P>STAMP DUTIES</P>
      <P>&mdash;<i>Cheques and Credit Cards</i></P>
      <P>As regards stamp duties I am proposing that the duty on cheques be increased from 5p to 7p and that the duty on credit cards be increased from £5 to £10.  These changes, which will take effect shortly, are estimated to yield an extra £2.7 million in 1984 and an extra £3.5 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>&mdash;<i>Exemption for Young Trained Farmers</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The stamp duty exemption for transfer of land to young trained farmers is due to be terminated in July.  In recent months there has been a substantial interest in this concession and the indications are that it is proving worthwhile as an <Col N="835" /> encouragement to early transfer of land. I am proposing therefore that the exemption be extended for one year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Government strategies for industrial development will be outlined in the White Paper on Industrial Policy which is due for publication shortly. Meanwhile, I believe that specific tax encouragements are desirable in certain areas and especially in relation to long-term risk capital.  Such investment is urgently needed, particularly to support an expansion of activity in small manufacturing concerns, which have proved to be a valuable source of new employment. I propose to allow income tax relief up to a specific ceiling each year for individuals who provide long-term risk capital for new manufacturing enterprises.  The relief will be subject to suitable conditions as to the nature and minimum duration of the investment so as to ensure that it has the intended effect.  The details will be incorporated in the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>&mdash;<i>Capital and Other Allowances</i></P>
      <P>The deduction against profits for corporation tax purposes of £10 per week per additional employee will be renewed for a further year to end-June 1985.  I will carry out an assessment of this incentive in the course of this year.</P>
      <P>The 100 per cent initial allowance for plant and machinery and the 50 per cent initial and 4 per cent annual allowances for industrial buildings, due to expire at end-March 1984, will also be renewed for another year to end-March 1985.  Laboratories used for analysis work connected with mining and oil exploration will qualify for the industrial buildings allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Finance Act, 1981 introduced certain <Col N="836" /> allowances to encourage the investment of private sector funds in the construction of toll roads, including bridges, under agreements with local authorities, and multi-storey car parks for public use. In order to provide continued encouragement for construction activities, these allowances, which are due to expire on 31 March 1984, will be continued for a further three-year period.  The renewal of these various allowances will give rise to no cost in 1984.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Stock Relief</i></P>
    <P>The existing stock relief system was introduced in 1975 and is now in need of revision.  The clawback provisions, in particular, have recently given rise to difficulties for traders suffering the effects of recession.  Last year, I deferred for one year clawback which would have arisen for accounting periods ending in the year to 5 April 1983, because of the potential adverse effect which payment would have had on firms.  I propose to introduce from this year a new system under which relief will apply by reference to price increases only, no account being taken of volume changes.  Thus, relief will be granted on the basis of the opening stock shown in the accounts.  As regards relief given under the existing system, clawback deferred last year and any liability to clawback for later accounting periods will be waived, subject to safeguards against abuse of this concession which will be included in the Finance Bill.  The relief will continue to apply to the same categories of traders as heretofore.  In order to control cost, the amount of relief will be restricted to one-third of the price increase in the basis period.  The cost to the Exchequer of the new system and the waiver of clawback will be of the order of £3 million in 1984.</P>
    <P>ADVANCE CORPORATION TAX</P>
    <P>In the course of the Dáil debates on the provisions for advance corporation tax in the Finance Bill, 1983, I indicated that I would consider representations regarding this tax in the context of this year's budget.  Representations have <Col N="837" /> been made to me by various affected interests seeking modification and even abolition of the tax.  Having weighed carefully the factors involved, including the points made regarding the possible disincentive effects, I have concluded that the reasons underlying the incorporation of this measure in our tax regime remain decisive.  Accordingly, advance corporation tax will remain.  In order, however, to ease further the implementation of the tax, I am extending the transitional period, within which ACT will be payable at 50 per cent of the full rate, to distributions made up to end-1984. After this the tax will be implemented in full.  This relief will not entail a significant Exchequer cost in 1984 but will cost about £5 million in 1985.</P>
    <P>TAXATION OF PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT OPERATIONS</P>
    <P>Before I leave the subject of direct taxation, I should like to make a brief reference to taxation of petroleum development operations, the provisions for which were drawn up almost ten years ago.  While this is not relevant in the context of today's budget, it is of interest in the light of recent offshore activity. The provisions to apply to the taxation of profits from petroleum production are being reviewed and I hope to be in a position soon to make a statement on this.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Our indirect taxes have increased in recent years in line with the increase in overall tax revenue.  Much of the increase has been concentrated on VAT, which has grown from 18 per cent of total tax revenue in 1980 to 25 per cent <Col N="838" /> in 1983.  While the main VAT rates are now rather high, it must be said that nearly half of the VAT base is zero-rated or liable at the 5 per cent rate.  If VAT were applied equally to all goods and services, the main rates could come down quite dramatically.  We cannot maintain a zero or low rate on such a wide range of items without having to impose relatively high rates on other items.</P>
      <P>For the longer term, I will be looking at the possibility of a fundamental reorganisation of the VAT structure, with the aim of narrowing the disparity in the rates charged on the bulk of goods and services.  I expect that the Commission on Taxation Report on Indirect Taxes, which should be completed soon, will be useful in this review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of our budgetary difficulties, we obviously cannot envisage a reduction in overall VAT revenue at this time.  I propose to make the following changes in VAT, involving both increases and reductions.</P>
      <P>VAT at 8 per cent will be applied to clothing from 1 May 1984.  However, clothing for children up to the age of approximately ten years will be excluded and will continue to be zero-rated.  This measure will widen the tax base and help towards a more rational distribution of the burden of VAT.  It will yield £16½ million in 1984 and £29 million in a full year.  I have excluded all footwear from the increase.</P>

      <P>I propose to reduce the rate of VAT on the short-term hire of cars, caravans and boats to 18 per cent from 1 March 1984.  This brings the VAT on these services, which are predominantly tourist-oriented, into line with that on hotel accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a further measure to boost tourism, <Col N="839" /> I propose to introduce a scheme to allow the refund of VAT on goods bought here at retail level by visitors and exported in their personal baggage.  Details of the scheme will be announced at a later date. It will operate from 1 March 1984.</P>
    <P>VAT on concrete will be reduced to 5 per cent from 1 March 1984.  This reduction will not apply to concrete products.</P>
    <P>These VAT concessions will cost £3.6 million in 1984 and £4.5 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>EXCISE DUTIES</P>
    <P>Traditionally, excise duty increases have been a significant source of additional tax revenue in the budget.  On this occasion the scope for increases is severely limited.  The evidence suggests that we may be near the point of diminishing returns in some areas.  This is due partly to price discrepancies on some excisable goods between here and Northern Ireland, which encourage smuggling and legitimate imports by travellers. It is wrong, however, to identify the high level of tax as the sole reason for the drop in consumption.  While the level of tax is a contributory factor, the main problem is the continuing recession.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied neverthless that some modest increases can still be applied. These are necessary to bring in extra tax revenue.  The changes are generally below the rate of inflation and consequently it is reasonable to expect that they will have little effect on consumption or domestic purchases.  In fact, since the excise duties are largely specific rather than <i>ad valorem,</i> the real level of excise duty will generally be less in 1984 than in 1983.</P>

    <P>The excise duty increases will take effect from midnight tonight, but increases in retail prices must await new maximum price orders where appropriate. These will be made by the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, who will determine the appropriate implementation date.

    <P>These excise duty concessions will reduce revenue by about £1.3 million in 1984 and £1.5 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the excise duties, there <Col N="842" /> are a few other points I should like to mention.</P>
    <P>From 1 January 1985, the restrictions we have been allowed to maintain on importations of motor vehicles since our entry into the EEC will no longer apply. This does not mean that there will be any reduction in the level of excise duty on motor vehicles.  While I am having the taxation regime for motor vehicles examined at present to see whether any changes would be desirable to meet the new circumstances, the intention will be to maintain the existing overall level of taxation in this area.</P>
    <P>As regards smuggling, and evasion of indirect taxes generally, I am examining proposals with a view to achieving better enforcement of existing legislative provisions and I am looking at proposals which may require changes in legislation. The penalties for evasion have been increased significantly in recent years, but I am reviewing these also.</P>
    <P>ROAD TAX</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to indirect taxes, I am proposing that the annual rates of road tax on private cars be increased by £1 per unit of horsepower with effect from 1 March.  This will yield additional revenue of £6.5 million in 1984.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TAXEVASION AND AVOIDANCE</P>
    <P>Last year I announced a series of new measures to deal with tax evasion.  Those that required statutory authority were subsequently incorporated in the Finance Act and the other measures were given effect through administrative change.  It is too early to make an assessment of results because, of their nature, some of the changes will not have a substantial effect for some time ahead.  The widespread public reaction, however, is an indication of the potential impact of these measures in countering evasion.  I can assure the House that they will be implemented vigorously.  I intend to pay special attention in the coming year to making improvements in collection procedures <Col N="843" /> which should help considerably in catching up with tax evaders.</P>
    <P>I mentioned in the 1983 budget statement that I was reviewing the reporting arrangements for payments to individuals and companies by Government Departments and public authorities to ensure that relevant details would be made available to the Revenue Commissioners. One result of this review is that details of public sector contracts are now being provided to the Commissioners, and I am examining the feasibility of requiring the production by firms of a tax clearance certificate as a condition of obtaining such contracts.</P>
    <P>BOND-WASHING</P>
    <P>Provision will be made in the Finance Bill to counter the practice known as bond-washing whereby securities change hands in a manner designed to ensure that the interest accrues to the holder as a tax-exempt capital gain rather than as income.  In respect of sales or transfers of securities made after today, that part of the gain on securities which is attributable to the value of the interest to be paid will be treated as part of the seller's income for the purposes of the taxes Acts.</P>
    <P>NON INTEREST-BEARING SHORT-DATED SECURITIES</P>
    <P>Provision will also be made in the Finance Bill to withdraw the tax exemption provided in existing law in relation to gains made on Exchequer Bills or other similar non interest-bearing securities. The new provisions will apply to issues of such securities made after today.</P>
    <P Just="Center">POST-BUDGET CURRENT REVENUE</P>
    <P>The tax proposals which I have set out are estimated to raise a total of almost £75 million this year, including £14 million from the continuation this year of certain temporary tax measures.  This is considerably less than the amounts raised <Col N="844" /> in the budgets of recent years, particularly since 1980.  Taking account of the nature and timing of the tax and expenditure measures announced today, I am also adding £15 million to the revenue forecast by way of increased tax revenue buoyancy, giving a revenue total of £5,971 million, or more than 13½ per cent up on the 1983 outturn.  The tax changes in today's budget will raise the consumer price index by less than 1 percentage point.</P>
    <P Just="Center">DEFICIT AND BORROWING REQUIREMENT</P>
    <P>The estimated current deficit for 1984 emerges at £1,089 million, or 7½ per cent of GNP.  This compares with the adjusted 1983 outturn of £1,085 million, or 8¼ per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>Taking the current deficit of £1,089 million together with borrowing for capital purposes of £785 million, the estimate of total Exchequer borrowing for 1984 is £1,874 million, or about 12¾ per cent of GNP.  This compares with the adjusted outturn of £1,853 million, or 14 per cent of GNP, last year.  It shows a reduction of about 4 percentage points of GNP, or almost one quarter, on the peak point of actual borrowing incurred in 1981. Indeed, it brings borrowing as a percentage of GNP back in line with the 1978 level.</P>
    <P>The Government consider that the overall level of borrowing now planned is the maximum feasible in current circumstances. There can, therefore, be no question of accepting any significant overrun on this figure.  Developments will be monitored very closely throughout the year and the Government will act quickly to deal with any emerging problems.  Success in achieving this year's budget targets and, in particular, in ensuring that expenditure does not exceed the budgeted allocations is critical to the achievement of the Government's medium-term fiscal objectives.  Equally, it is critical to the whole process of preventing further escalation of the total tax burden and of making leeway for rationalisation of our tax system.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="845" /> MEDIUM-TERM PLANNING</P>
    <P>The broad development of the economy needs to be planned over the medium term.  The Government have taken a number of steps in this regard.</P>
    <P>We have established new planning structures, as promised in the <i>Programme for Government,</i> to provide better economic and social planning.  The Government Task Force on Employment was set up early in 1983 to formulate policies to ease unemployment.  The National Planning Board was established and is preparing a draft medium-term plan which it intends to submit to the Government by April 1984.  This draft plan will provide an important input into the Government's planning for the medium term.  A further part of this process will consist of medium-term planning focusing on the Public Capital Programme and on the current expenditure consequences of capital projects in a number of areas.  As I have already mentioned, a White Paper on Industrial Policy will also be published.</P>
    <P>The system of sectoral consultative committees has also been expanded. Members of these committees are drawn from Government, employers and trade unions, and they are already making an important contribution to the identification of development opportunities in various sectors of the economy.</P>
    <P Just="Center">CONCLUSION</P>
    <P>This budget will keep us on course towards improving the public finances and strengthening the economy.  We are still in a difficult situation.  There are no quick solutions but there is much that we <Col N="846" /> can do ourselves, irrespective of developments internationally, to improve our circumstances.  We can create more self-sustaining and productive jobs if we keep income expectations to a realistic level. We can make room for more employment by adopting a prudent and balanced approach to public expenditure, matching our demands to our resources on a realistic basis.</P>
    <P>There is a common belief that preaching empty confidence will bring about better times and that, conversely, an attitude of caution will discourage initiative. The truth is somewhere in the middle. It does not lie in an approach which identifies all of the negative aspects of our situation and focuses exclusively on them.  That approach produces a level of pessimism totally unjustified by reality and totally out of line with the undoubted progress which we made on many fronts during 1983.  Let us be optimistic by all means but let this optimism be founded on realism and on a balanced appreciation of the difficulties and opportunities before us.  Of course a positive approach is necessary, now more than ever before, but we must get our priorities right.  Some would have us attempt to spend our way recklessly out of recession.  This option, even as a temporary expedient, is no longer available if only for the simple reason that our borrowing capacity would not support it.  In any case, the consequences of such an approach for taxation in future years would be unacceptable.</P>
    <P>There is another way, which is a disciplined approach to public financing coupled with modest pay increases and modest tax improvements.  This is the approach being adopted in today's budget.</P>

    <P> (1)In previous years' tables, debt service costs paid from the supply services were included under this heading.  As part of the revised functional classification of expenditure, these costs, (e.g. Exchequer subsidy on service costs of loans for local authority housing) are now included under the appropriate functional categories.  The total debt service costs in the Central Fund and Supply Services in 1983 was £1,713 million of which £1,554 million related to interest and £159 million to sinking funds. </P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a growing tendency in this country, of which all of us are aware, to question the relevance of the politician.  There has been a growing feeling that those of us engaged in Parliament are unaware of the real issues, problems and the crises facing our people whose interests we are here to represent.  Unfortunately this budget will underline that alienation.  The 210,000 unemployed and their families may be listening to us now &mdash; we saw a tragic example of unemployment on a television programme from Cork last night &mdash; many of them because they are trying to find something to do with the day, trying to while away the time, to give the impression of activity, trying somehow to believe that their life is not a waste, when otherwise they would be actively engaged in work.  There will be an additional 30,000 listening and hoping in vain for some sign of hope but that sign has not emerged in this budget.  They must have wondered if the Minister is aware that to them unemployment is a cancer.  Is he aware that there is a recurrence of the feeling that existed in the 1950s, that our sense of direction and purpose has gone?  Now we are pre-occupied with tinkering with and adjusting the system when our obligation is to create conditions in which investment, employment and the work ethic can be encouraged and the great potential of this nation realised.</P>
      <P>Today those of us with any experience in this House have witnessed the greatest non-event of a budget for many years.  At least last year's budget put forward four objectives.  I wonder if anyone remembers them?  I do, but I do not expect many others to remember them because not one of the objectives was realised.  This budget did not set one single general economic objective apart from adjustments to the deficit and the borrowing requirement, both matters with which I shall deal in a moment.  This is evidence that the Government have dropped their stated fiscal targets.  There is no general directive in the budget this year.  Last year there were four and they bear repeating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first was to reduce the Exchequer <Col N="872" /> borrowing requirement.  Twelve months later we find that for this year the Exchequer borrowing requirement will be £1,874 million by comparison with an outturn of £1,853 million.  Here we are 12 months later and the Minister can proclaim to the House that the Exchequer borrowing requirement will be over £20 million more than the outturn.  Surely that signals the abandonment of the first objective in last year's budget's strategy.</P>
    <P>The second objective has also been thrown by the wayside.  That objective, which was not put in percentage terms but was put in absolute terms, was the reduction of the current budget deficit. They did not say it was as a percentage of GNP.  We now find that the current budget deficit which the Minister is now adopting is £1,088, by comparison with an outturn of £960 million.  So much for the reduction of the current budget deficit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Even then, it must be acknowledged that at least today the Minister is honest enough, as will be appreciated on making his statement, to give the first definite statement that the elimination of the budget deficit for 1987 is now a forgotten dream and will not be part of the Government's programme at all.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>At least we now know what it is that we are not trying to achieve.  What the people really want to know is what we are trying to achieve. What are this Government doing to create conditions in which we can help ourselves, whether in industry, in the work-place, in agriculture or at school?  What <Col N="873" /> signs are they giving to this nation at this time to demonstrate that not only can we succeed but that we shall and must succeed?</P>
      <P>There were two other primary objectives last year, by contrast with the lack of objectives this year.  I wonder if anyone can recall what they were?  The first was to ensure that the adjustments of budget policy would protect the interests and incomes of the low income groups.  They were given such a guarantee.  I do not wish to engage in arguments on this.  I just leave it to those who are low paid, to those outside who may be listening to us now and to the public at large to answer the question &mdash; have their incomes been protected, having regard to the increase in inflation last year, with more to follow this year as a consequence of the budget policies of this Government?  They have the answer and know quite well, as do all the Government members, that those who feel every day that they are bearing the brunt of the so-called necessary fiscal adjustments are the lowly paid who, frankly, have and always will have first claim on us in our activities as public representatives.  If we cannot create conditions in society under which those who can achieve will achieve and protect and provide for those who cannot &mdash; namely the old, the sick and the unemployed &mdash; we have no right to be here.  Clearly, the third objective of last year has been abandoned and not even referred to in the Budget Statement of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, as the fourth objective of last year, they were going to maintain or improve our competitiveness.  Having regard to the indirect tax levels, highest of all in this country, and the indirect tax levels as a result of today's budget, which will aggravate the situation beyond any comparable level in Europe, we have succeeded in undermining whatever competitiveness we had up to last year.  The extra impositions of VAT and excise duties will drive us way above the average of our competitors and customers in Europe and elsewhere.  Before this budget, indirect tax as a percentage of total current receipts was 18 per cent.  We are already 4 per cent over the average <Col N="874" /> of the European Economic Community. Our inflation rate, which was increased last year by a very significant 4 per cent, will be increased further this year by the extra VAT and excise duties now being imposed.  And we are told that we are going to maintain our competitiveness. The reality is proved in a simple way. Our competitiveness has been undermined by the fact that we have lost so many jobs.  I shall not go through the dreary list or litany now, but we have all seen factory closures, business liquidations, insolvencies.  How can any Minister today imply that competitiveness is still there?</P>
    <P>Last year there were at least stated objectives, even if conditions finally meant that those objectives were not realised.  The first priority of this year's budget should have been to undo the damage of last year's, to create the conditions in which employment would be generated again in this community, above all else, to create the conditions as a means to generate employment and hopeful investment in this economy. These should have been the twin targets of today's Budget Statement &mdash; investment and employment, hope and enterprise, encouragement and activity. Instead, we have a dreary apologia in the old sense of a defence &mdash; and a weak one at that &mdash; always of the progress towards the necessary adjustment.  That is the kind of euphemistic economic jargon which may mean something to the Minister but means nothing to those who await a signal that this country is going to be on the move again.</P>
    <P>It gives me no pleasure to say that whatever objectives it may have &mdash; and I cannot trace any in terms of economic management or the fundamental role of Government, which is not just fiscal adjustment &mdash; this budget has already failed, for two or three obvious reasons. A budget should be but an instrument of overall policy, but we do not have an overall policy.  The Central Bank, NESC and the OECD have all called for a policy from this Government.  They started with no policy, they still have no policy and we are now being told, towards the end of the budget speech, that perhaps by <Col N="875" /> April of this year some of the plethora of various committees, of planning boards, of sectoral committees, will have something to report to this Government on a strategy for industrial development, for manufacturing industry, or whatever industry it may be about which the Government are concerned.  Nowhere is there now, 18 months after this Government came into office, a general comprehensive plan for development of our resources and how to manage them, as a signal for people that they can now respond to what the Government are doing.  If one is running a sweet shop, a small contractor's business, a small industry, a farm or any enterprise &mdash; and some Members opposite must have some experience of this themselves &mdash; one will at least have some idea of what one wants to achieve this year, next year and the following year.  One sets it out in terms of a plan, and if that is true of sweet shops it certainly should be true of Governments. Still we wait for any signal as to where we go and how we should help to achieve it.</P>
    <P>It is surprising, then, that the Government can actually indicate that in the absence of such a plan we will have an addition to, unfortunately, the only growth area we have at the moment apart from the black economy, which is the spiralling number of unemployed.  The Government are making provision already, and perhaps not enough, for increased benefits at a rate costing each taxpayer at least £5 million for increased benefits &mdash; unemployment benefits and unemployment assistance &mdash; for the extra numbers, 30,000 or 40,000, of our citizens who by this time next year will be added to the list of the unemployed.</P>
    <P>Since this Government came into power 38,000 of those who were gainfully employed in dignified work have become unemployed.  The current figure, even giving them the benefit of all doubts, is 208,000.  They now provide for a figure, by their Estimates, of an average over the year of 225,000.  It was acknowledged that it would be at least 240,000 by year end.</P>
    <P>We are awaiting some signal as to how <Col N="876" /> we shall create the opportunities for improving our economic conditions. Today there has been no meaningful reference to employment or unemployment. There has been no reference to what this Government plan to do to face the greatest single cancer in our society. Certainly there is no signpost to anybody with any spirit of enterprise, be he farmer, businessman or worker, as to how this Government propose to create the conditions to enable him make a contribution to the development of the well-being of this nation.</P>
    <P>The present position is that the level of investment in this country now is 22 per cent of GNP only, the lowest it has been for 16 years as a consequence of this Government's policies.  This budget will mean a further drop.  The tax adjustments the Minister has introduced today in direct taxation, in income tax, will mean that, when one takes account of the maintenance of the 1 per cent levy, the maintenance of the 65 per cent tax band and the inflation which will occur over the year of up to 10 per cent, income tax will actually take in a bigger percentage of total tax revenue at the end of this year than has been done in any previous year.</P>
    <P>For the first time we heard the Minister mention today the lowest figure that any of us on these benches can recall of those who will escape the tax net as a consequence of his budgetary provisions today. He says that 15,000 will escape the tax net as a consequence of this relief of tax liability.  The Minister must know that in any previous year, because of the adjustments necessary to take account of the inflation impact on direct PAYE income tax payers, at least 25,000 and many more each year are exempted from tax liability. We find this year that the lowly paid, about whom the Minister is so concerned &mdash; the 15,000 of them &mdash; will be exempt from income tax as of now.  But by the end of the year most of those who may have escaped the net at the beginning of the year, at that end of the tax scale, will be dragged back in halfway through the year.  Even that what seems to be a marginal relief will prove as illusory as any other hope mentioned in this budget.</P>
    <P>On tax generally might I mention also <Col N="877" /> a matter of very considerable concern, that is, that clearly now the Commission on Taxation, which I established as Minister for Finance over three years ago and their recommendations, are being totally ignored and cast aside.  The Minister indicated today that he will now refer the issues on tax reform to the National Planning Board because, as the Minister indicated, tax is an integral part of economic development and the National Planning Board are concerned with economic development plans.  Surely he would acknowledge that the whole system of taxation, by everyone's recognition, has been so complex, so overloaded as to be an active disincentive.  Surely the Minister will acknowledge that only the recommendations of the commission, who have been sitting and dealing with this matter for three years and who have made very positive, far-seeing recommendations, should be taken into account.  But nothing they have done has been in any way heeded by the Minister. We have the clear sign today that their recommendations will be considered now is the context of the National Planning Board, whenever they arrive at any conclusions as to what will be their role or function.</P>
    <P>If the National Planning Board do report in 1984 will they make recommendations in respect of tax and the overall tax levels or do we wait for another 12 months or perhaps two years?  Is the Minister not aware that one of the most constant anxieties is this disincentive level of taxation in our economy?  Is the Minister not aware that the Central Bank and many others have pointed out that the disincentive level of the tax impositions in last year's budget, being increased in today's, constitute a very dampening influence on the whole prospect of our economic development.  The reality is that the Minister is so aware because he made one other honest admission today at the very beginning of his Budget Statement. If I opened with these lines one might wonder was I actually overstating the case.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>... consumption has declined, investment <Col N="878" /> has fallen, unemployment has risen and growth has been stifled.</P>
    <P>That is the Minister for Finance in his own Budget Statement acknowledging publicly what every other independent authority has acknowledged already: that this country has been pushed into a deep recession by policies that have not in any way gone near achieving their stated targets. Incidentally, this has occurred at a time when no Minister over the last number of years has had such a favourable international climate to assist him and this country in regenerating our econimic activity.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be aware that for the first time in a number of years the projections for the international economy are for a 3½ per cent to 4 per cent growth in the OECD countries in the coming year.  The Minister also must be aware of the buoyancy in marketing opportunities for our exports.  Incidentally, he has claimed some credit in relation to export buoyancy which is solely attributable to the industries established by Fianna Fáil in Government, the high technology industries, now proving to be the base of the export buoyancy for which the Minister has claimed credit during the year.  The fact of the matter is that at a time when we do see a very clear recovery in the international economy this Government have no plan to avail of the opportunities in that buoyant international economy in order to create conditions to underpin employment here.</P>
    <P>There has been an 18 per cent decline in total investment since 1980.  This has been commented on as being a matter of very serious concern by independent commentators such as the National Economic and Social Council.  There is the most passing and ineffective references in today's budget to the capital programme &mdash; an extra £5 million for roads, an extra few millions for housing.  Is that the Minister's idea of an enhanced capital programme, which has already been scaled down by him and his Government at a figure below what was being provided by the Fianna Fáil Government two years ago?  If an extra £5 million for housing and £x million extra for roads is his idea <Col N="879" /> of a Government contribution to enhancing our investment climate, the reality seems to be that we live in different worlds.  As a consequence of this budget and the nugatory provisions in the capital programme the level of total investment in this economy will fall further this year at a time when there is buoyancy in the international economy, at a time when we have the opportunity for renewal and redevelopment.</P>
    <P>Let us examine some areas where this might be done and what the Minister had to say about them today.  Take our base activity, agriculture &mdash; and the Minister has had some association with that area as an economic adviser.  At a time when we become even more conscious of reliance on our own resources, the very resource that can, if developed, supported and maintained make a major contribution not just to employment but to our balance of payments and every aspect of well-being here, in no way figures in any provisions of this budget today.</P>
    <P>We are going to maintain the ground limestone subsidy and the AI programme. But it seems there is no need for farm modernisation.  Apparently, in the Minister's eyes, we are too modern. There is no need for farm development programmes or increasing the national herd.  He ignores the potential that agriculture represents, not just for the farmers but for all who rely on the downstream industries, the dairy and meat processing industries and the people in towns.  There is no signal or proposal from this Government for agriculture. There is no plan for economic development in any event.  We are all expected to listen to and to be satisfied with adjustments which tinker at the edges.  What does all this jargon mean when there are no jobs and the existing opportunities are not being exploited?  The management which is necessary for every enterprise, especially for Government, does not exist.  There is no hope and no direction.</P>
    <P>I wonder what the construction industry will say about this budget.  Like agriculture, almost all of the component elements in that industry are native, there is <Col N="880" /> little or no raw material imported.  The marginal gesture which the Minister has given to the construction industry will not even maintain the present position where half of the labour force in that industry are unemployed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLoughlin Mr. McLoughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLoughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>That figure is incorrect, there are only a quarter in the industry unemployed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is terribly frustrating to be in Opposition when one sees all that can and should be done.  We are confined to pointing out what might be done and are forced to watch nothing being done.  There are an extra 15,000 unemployed in the manufacturing industry this year and the Minister makes a token gesture to that industry, which will probably cost the Exchequer something in the order of £1 million or £2 million in a full year, towards the promotion of investment in the manufacturing industry. When the Minister was doing that he should have considered changing his mind on the nonsensical decison last year to abolish the very small tax allowance for shareholders in publicly quoted Irish companies which had been in existence since 1930.  When he abolished that, those shareholders were getting less for their commitment to Irish companies than they would have got by putting their money into safe investments like pension funds, building societies or other groups that would have given a better return. The Minister did not see fit to reintroduce it this year but, more significantly, he confined that token incentive to the manufacturing industry.  If we are concerned with unemployment, the manufacturing industry, important though it is, can make only a limited contribution to generating employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister might be aware that in <Col N="881" /> the United States the number employed in the manufacturing industry now is the same as it was in the late forties whereas the numbers employed generally in the service industries and business generally have increased at a rate of 2 per cent each year over the last 20 years.  Is the Minister so blind that he cannot see that wherever permanent sustainable jobs can be created, the function of Government is to create the incentive for investing in those jobs?  Does he not know that the IDA are relying on a ratio of &mdash; some say &mdash; 15 to one?  That figure is extraordinarily high; let us bring the ratio down to five to one, five jobs in the service and downstream industries for every job in the manufacturing industry.  The Minister must know that the manufacturing industry has a very limited capacity in generating and maintaining employment.  How can he justify not making some contribution to investment in any Irish enterprise to assist people who are prepared to put their money in a venture capital support effort?  That is obviously a consequence of the Government lack of planning.</P>
    <P>I note, incidentally, that the plan when it comes may be confined to industry.  If so, the Minister might as well recognise that sustainable employment, which is a feature of the most advanced economies like Japan, the United States, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland is and has been for some time focused on the new era of technology, on the service industries and the downstream activities and not just on the manufacturing industry. I wish the Minister had shown some awareness of that and given an incentive in that direction.</P>
    <P>Prior to today, income tax represented 38 per cent of total tax.  Has the Minister listened to anybody?  He must realise the impact that taxation is having on the incentive to work.  Has he not heard people saying they are better off unemployed in terms of money if not in terms of satisfaction?  Last year he brought the level of taxation to an unprecedented level and it is increasing.  Those levels are killing the most important thing this country has to offer &mdash; the incentive to work and the work ethic.  Does he not care?  I would not accuse the Minister of <Col N="882" /> deliberately trying to undermine incentive and work ethic but I have to say that I would fail in my duty if I did not charge him with deliberately introducing policies which can only have the inevitable consequences of growing unemployment, less investment and undermining the work ethic which we have witnessed last year and of which we will see more this year.</P>
    <P>A Government's role is to create opportunity and employment, incentive and investment, but it must also be demonstrated in our attitude to those who cannot help themselves.  If that is the obligation of Government, this Government and this Minister do not know or care about their obligations to those who depend on our efforts to provide some benefit for them in their sickness, unemployment or old age.</P>
    <P>Achievements of the Minister's predecessors will live in the memory of the Irish people &mdash; such as a shilling off the old age pension.  I thought we had long since passed that kind of approach where those who need most will pay most, but we have come back to that today.  I thought we had all reached the stage where we recognised that one of the main reasons for our being here was to create conditions where those who cannot help themselves will be looked after.  What do we get from this Minister today?  We get 7 per cent increases from July, August and November &mdash; an income maintenance supplement from Santa Claus in November.  The Minister might as well have waited until next year's budget.</P>
    <P>Three short years ago a Government with a social conscience provided 25 per cent increases for old age and long-term social welfare recipients.  Some might say that was a little high, but if we are to err let it be in the area of providing comfort and security for those who cannot provide for themselves.  They will suffer on with inflation running at 10 per cent for the rest of the year.  Last year the Government were boasting that they were giving increases of 10 per cent to these categories but this year they are giving only 7 per cent.  I will not mention the figures because they are an offence when one <Col N="883" /> considers our obligation to the old, the sick and the unemployed.  People are surving longer but unfortunately many more people are becoming unemployed. All this is happening although one party in Government used to parade a social conscience.  How can these Deputies face the old people?</P>

If there are a few foreign investors &mdash; and they are getting fewer every day &mdash; they are matched by the number of our business people who are investing abroad.  There are more Irish people investing abroad than there are foreigners investing here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="884" /> If the Minister is not aware of that trend, he should go to Shannon Airport where he will see very buoyant activity in the lounge.  Small Irish businessmen are going to America to pick up the profits that are available in their buoyant economy.  President Reagan said the American economy has been experiencing an economic miracle for the last few years.  The only hope for our people in this time of economic miracle is to invest abroad.</P>
    <P>Some people might say the Minister is a man of some resolution, that he is cool, calm and will not be flustered.  Perhaps he differs from most of us because it is hard to be cool or calm in face of the tragedy we are witnessing here, it is particularly hard in the light of the fantastic potential there is in this country.  If the Minister had no other suggestion to make except that in support for the manufacturing industry, then there is little hope for us.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister not know that the pension funds, building societies and gilts are flowing with funds from people who want to invest but who will not and cannot take the risk of investing in productive activity because of our present high taxes?  Can he not see there is scope for encouraging people to move out of that safe haven investment which is not giving a return in terms of sustainable employment?</P>

      <P>This 8 per cent VAT on clothing will be a mortal blow to an industry which already is on its knees. The Minister must have met a deputation from the Confederation of Irish Industry about the same time that I did.  They told us that they spoke with &ldquo;the authority of knowledge&rdquo;, the knowledge that indigenous manufacturing industry in Ireland was beaten to the ground, that the buoyancy in manufacturing activity was attributed almost solely to high technology and <Col N="885" /> pharmaceutical industries which this party introduced in the sixties and seventies. This has resulted in a falling off in employment of 20,000 people.  What does the Minister do?  He imposes an extra tax on the clothing industry which is already under great pressure from abroad because of a lack of competitiveness.</P>
      <P>One regrets having to point to all this, but the fact of the matter is that in the climate in which we live the budget has a function as an instrument of policy. Fiscal adjustments are necessary.  It is an instrument of policy on one day only to create and encourage the conditions which can be implemented throughout the year by a Government with a policy. This Government have not got that policy. They are preoccupied with what are seen to be budget adjustments.  They are so preoccupied that it is guaranteed that this year like last year the targets they hope to achieve are defeated before they start.</P>
      <P>There is one other place where there is a preoccupation with a budget, and the Government are well aware of that. Another Government have forced the European Community to be preoccupied with a budget and budget adjustments. That Government have forced the European Community so much in that direction that they have killed the very spirit and direction of the Community.  The Government preoccupied with a budget here are our own Government and they are killing the spirit and enterprise of this nation.  For those outside who wait for a hope, or a sign, or a signal, this budget contains no signal other than the fact that the Government do not know their problems and have no way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One thing that is very clear from this budget is who is in charge of the Government.  Fine Gael call the tune and the Labour Party must dance to it.  There is no concession whatever to the Labour Party in this budget.  The income levy stays.  PRSI is as it was.  The allowance is the same as it was.  There is no <Col N="886" /> family income supplement until November. The VAT rate on clothes is 8 per cent and they are calling for a wage freeze in the middle of all this in the public sector and in the private sector.  In last year's budget the Minister seemed to have some new ideas with regard to tax credits and other initiatives, but they were all killed off in this budget.  Last year he said he would do something else in the next budget, but in this budget he has done nothing.  There is no initiative in it, no idea.  Any civil servant could have written it and probably did.</P>
      <P>There is a lack of any change in capital taxes.  There is a total lack of reference to the Commission on Taxation.  After three years of marches all that was conceded to the PAYE workers was the Commission on Taxation.  They reported a year and a half ago.  I would not agree with their report or accept their recommendations, but I would have thought the Minister would have seen the quiet protests by the taxpayers.  They have not yet revolted but they are about to.  The report of the Commission on Taxation should have shown him that there is a need for a drastic change in the whole system.  Even Brendan Dowling, who is generally regarded as a pro-Coalition economist, has said clearly that the tax system is antiquated, out of date, inefficient, inequitable, unjust and in need of drastic and radical change.  Some such changes were expected in this budget but none has been forthcoming.  Those projected last year were shot down this year.</P>
      <P>Despite juggling with the figures for income tax, the burden still remains on the shoulders of the PAYE workers.  The total personal income taken in this budget will be over £400 million more than last year.  The total PAYE take will be at least £300 million up on last year's take despite juggling with changing allowances, tax bands, rates, and so on. The same people will carry the burden under this budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no reference to the removal of water rates in this budget.  That is one area where the urban workers have revolted.  They are specifically saying that they are refusing to pay these charges and this tax.  They have been calling for the <Col N="887" /> abolition of these charges in this budget. There is no reference to any land tax or any taxation for farmers.  There is no reference whatever in the whole budget speech to farmer taxation.  Last year farmers paid less taxation than ever before because of the abolition of rates. Through their own work they got them abolished by the Supreme Court.  There is no point in the Minister hiding behind the Supreme Court or the Constitution and saying it is not his fault rates were abolished.</P>
    <P>There are many other ways in which taxes could be raised from farmers other than on the valuation system.  There has been no attempt to recoup from them the equivalent sum to what would have been gathered under the rates system had it been still in force.  Everybody, including the Labour Party I am sure, expected the Minister to produce something in that regard to ensure that in 1984 the urban workers would not still be paying for the farmers.  That is precisely why water taxes and other local authority charges were imposed.  Local authorities were not getting rates from farmers and that had to be made up by the Exchequer, in other words by the taxpayer, in other words by the PAYE workers.</P>
    <P>At the moment inflation is about 10 per cent.  Putting off a social welfare increase of 7 per cent until the month of July, and August in the case of children's allowances, is a despicable insult to people on social welfare benefits.  In the meantime, how are they to make up for the increases in prices due to inflation, and the lowering of their standard of living?  There is a shortage of food on their tables and clothes on their backs, but the VAT on clothes will come in immediately.  The increase in welfare benefits will not come in until July or August and then will be only 7 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister says he must get his priorities right.  His priority is said to be the rectification of our finances.  This is a clear indication of how much a Fine Gael budget it is.  It is a books versus people budget.  No attempt was made by the Minister to get his priorities right.  The priorities are the people of this nation. <Col N="888" /> They are the people who put us here and who expect us to fight their battles for them, who expect the Minister to produce a caring and equitable budget which will benefit them and improve our economy and improve the efficiency in the running of the nation at the same time.  There are no plans in this budget for a recovery in the economy.</P>
    <P>All the budget says is that the Minister, the Taoiseach and the Government are hoping to gain some benefit from the recovery they think is coming in the United States and in Europe.  In the old phrase, they hope that that rising tide will lift all boats.  I am afraid this one has sunk so low that no tide from abroad will lift it unless the Government come up with specific plans for the economy to lift it. While the concession to PAYE workers in regard to personal allowances will benefit a small group of lower paid workers in some areas, a higher amount of tax is being taken from them in indirect taxes than they are gaining.</P>
    <P>In regard to capital taxation the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>The general perception is that the yield from capital taxation in this country is low.  In reality, if we take the internationally-accepted definition of capital taxes, which includes stamp duties and property taxes, the yield in 1983 was £193 million or about 4 per cent of total taxation.  This is a substantial amount by any reasonable standard.</P>
    <P>That is an extraordinary statement when the yield from capital taxes has been falling year by year since 1974 when 11.2 per cent of the tax taken was in capital taxation. It fell to 9.6 per cent in 1975 to 8.8 per cent in 1976, 8 per cent in 1977, 6.1 per cent in 1978, 6 per cent in 1979, 5.2 per cent in 1980, 4.7 per cent in 1981 and now it is 4 per cent.  It has fallen continuously and is now about one-third of the percentage taken in 1974.</P>
    <P>The OECD recently issued a report which appeared in the newspapers on 14 January.  They state that we have the lowest capital taxes in the OECD area and that Ireland's tax base is very narrow <Col N="889" /> by international standards.  They point out that corporate taxes in Ireland were only 4.7 per cent in 1982, while in the United Kingdom they amounted to twice that amount at 9.7 per cent.  In the United States corporate taxes were 8.6 per cent and in Canada 9.3 per cent.  Except for Sweden our corporate taxes were the lowest in the OECD area.</P>
    <P>In property taxes we were also the lowest at 3.5 per cent of the take.  In 1965 the figure was 15.1 per cent, while in 1970 it was 12.2 per cent, coming down to 3.5 per cent in 1982.  It is nearly four times that amount in the United Kingdom at 12.8 per cent, while it is 9.6 per cent in the United States and 8.6 per cent in Canada.  It cannot be said that any of these is a socialist country.  They are the most highly capitalist countries in the world.  We have the lowest property taxes, the lowest corporate taxes and the lowest capital taxes of any of the capitalist countries in western Europe or the OECD.  That is the answer to the Minister's extraordinary statement that our capital taxes are high by international standards.  They are, in fact very low by international standards and there is a need to increase capital taxation if we are to have any equity in our taxation system. There must be a move from personal income tax to the general area of capital taxes as well as property and corporate taxes.</P>
    <P>Why could the Minister not have introduced a wealth tax?  Fine Gael do not like it and do not want it, but surely that is the way to raise revenue.  When the wealth tax was in operation it brought in about £10 million and in today's terms would probably raise about £20 million. That would be the return from a relatively low rate of wealth tax.  Would the Minister see people die for lack of hospital care or health treatment or lack of food on the table rather than tax the wealthy friends of the Government and of Fine Gael?  Could he not have considered removing the indexation for capital gains?  Had he done so he could have increased the take from £11 million to about £36 million, thus gaining an extra £25 million.  That would not hurt anybody or take the food from the table or prevent <Col N="890" /> anyone from receiving decent hospital treatment under the Health Acts.  He could have lowered the threshold for capital acquisitions tax which can be up to £150,000 or even double that for agricultural land.  He could have doubled the take from £13 million to £26 million.  He could have made certain adjustments to the property tax and raised the take from the projected £3 million to at least £10 million, thus gaining another £7 million.</P>
    <P>Everybody, including the farming organisations, expected that he would impose a land tax on farmers to replace the rates and annuities which have nearly expired now.  Such a tax would not have to be at a very high rate to bring in an amount between £80 million and £100 million.  The whole country was expecting that the Minister would at least replace the rates system and bring in the equivalent of what the farmers were paying in rates, particularly when the 90,000 farmers who are supposed to be in the tax net are not paying tax.  Apparently the Revenue Commissioners are not geared to collecting tax from them.  Certainly they are not doing so.  In those circumstances, when neither income tax nor rates is being collected from the farmers, surely the Minister could have set his mind to deciding what would be the best form of taxation on land which would give the greatest incentives to those who are prepared to work the land and at the same time bring in an income to the Exchequer, avoiding the situation whereby urban dwellers are still having to pay to local authorities the amount which is not now coming from farmers' rates.</P>
    <P>Very little attention was paid by the Minister in his budget speech to the question of tax evasion, to the fact that the health and youth levies are not being collected from the self-employed, farmers and so on and the fact that the general taxation system is behind in its collection by hundreds of millions each year.  This means that more money must be collected each year in income tax in order to cover the services which are falling behind as a result of evasion, avoidance and the deliberate refusal to pay taxes which are properly assessed and levied on people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="891" /> We are well aware that the law, the courts and the Constitution protect landlords, farmers and property owners from paying tax.  All they have to do is go before the courts and claim that a certain kind of tax is unconstitutional.  The courts tell the landlords that they are right, that they have a right to their property and should not be taxed on it in that fashion or should be allowed to charge whatever rent they like.  The farmers claim that it is unconstitutional to have to pay rates on land and the courts agree with them. This is a fault in our law and Constitution. It upholds the rights of property above those of the people.  If the Minister has any difficulty in imposing taxes because of a fear that the courts will declare it unconstitutional, then he should do something about changing the Constitution. It is not a great difficulty as he will have noticed from last year.  The Constitution can be changed or amended and if the Minister has any difficulty he should look at the possibility of introducing a constitutional amendment which will ensure that the Minister for Finance has the freedom to impose tax in order to provide the services that people need and to ensure that certain people do not get away with making big money and paying no tax because of a certain constitutional provision.</P>
    <P>The budget deficit a year or so ago was one of the sacred aims of the Coalition. I suppose they have &mdash; they do not admit it &mdash; made a U-turn.  I said on the Adjournment Debate in December that it would be good if the Minister did a U-turn.  The Government attacked Deputy Haughey for doing a U-turn on <i>The Way Forward</i> and changing his mind.  There is nothing wrong with making a U-turn when one is going in the wrong direction.  Over the past few months the Minister seemed to be tentatively beginning a turn.  He has continued this on in the budget and it would be as well if he completed the turn and made the definite decision that the budget deficit is not the be-all and end-all of running the country, improving the economy and raising money.</P>
    <P>There was an excellent booklet produced <Col N="892" /> by the Department in the past few weeks called &ldquo;Economic Background to the Budget 1984&rdquo;.  The opening line in that document states that &ldquo;led by a strong recovery in the United States, economic activity in the OECD area gathered momentum during 1983.&rdquo;  Paragraph 3 states that &ldquo;with the notable exception of the US, fiscal policy in most of the major economies remained restrictive with continued emphasis being placed on reducing public sector deficits.&rdquo;  All of them except the US were doing this but the only one showing strong recovery was the US.  Within the OECD there was a particularly marked deterioration in the US deficit at the very same time as there was a strong recovery in the United States. Surely the Minister should learn something from that.  The only one that was not worrying about the budget deficit was doing best of all.</P>
    <P>These facts expose the bogus nature of the claim that the reduction of the current budget deficit will cure the economic ills of this State.  In reality it is the balance of payments deficit which is the real constraint on economic policy not the budget deficit.  In the past year that constraint has eased to the extent that it has almost disappeared.  The document points out that the balance of payments deficit showed a substantial improvement, falling from £1,041 million or 8½ per cent of GDP to around £350 million or 2½ per cent of GDP in 1983.  That is excellent.  It shows economic recovery.  We would argue that for economic development, even at the expense of a small short-term rise in the balance of payments, if money is spent wisely on investment, expansion and the creation of jobs no great harm is done to the economy.</P>
    <P>The spending cuts the Minister persists in pursuing are indicated primarily in the capital programme which I will deal with later.  It is spread right across the State services including health and education as shown in the Book of Estimates.  By imposing a cash limit approach in the Department of Health, to be administered by the health boards, they are pursuing a course where our services are being cut indiscriminately while the waste which constitutes the real scandal <Col N="893" /> is allowed to fester on causing continual losses of taxpayers' money.  The Minister for Health has opted out of his responsibilities and left it to each health board to decide where to cut back.  Naturally they will cut back their services to the sick and elderly but will not cut back on the waste of money to doctors, consultants, pharmacists, drug companies, special treatment and facilities for special private patients.  No, that is not where the cuts will be made.  People will die in 1984 for lack of health care because the Minister is shirking his responsibility by not cutting expenditure where the waste is and just telling the health boards they will get £3 million or £5 million less and to do the best they can on it.  Why does the Minister for Finance not insist on the self-employed and farmers paying health contributions to avoid the Minister for Health having to make these cuts in hospital treatments and health care?  This goes back some years.  There is no mention in the budget that any extra effort was being made to bring in money from farmers or ensure that health contributions are paid so that proper hospital services and health care is given in the coming year.</P>
    <P>I referred to the Public Capital Programme because this is the area which deals with jobs, job creation and employment. The allocation for this programme of £1,780 million is down by 6 per cent in real terms compared with 1983.  That is the total allocation.  According to the Minister's figures the amount provided this year in the Public Capital Programme will be 20 per cent less than in 1982 in real terms.  This reduction of one-fifth in State investment is taking place at a time when there is a crying need for economic development and a need to pursue the aim of job creation.  When referring to the size of the Public Capital Programme I am not saying that we should be spending money indiscriminately or anything of that nature.  Quite a lot of money has been squandered and wasted in various handouts to different people and millions of pounds continue to be squandered.  I do not hold any brief for waste of public money but I am attacking the overall cutback of one-fifth in investment at a <Col N="894" /> time when we have 200,000 people unemployed.</P>
    <P>In our policy document, issued in November 1982, we set out a solution to the jobs crisis in the form of a plan to improve efficiency and output in order to create wealth.  For that investment is a necessity.  The cut in the Public Capital Programme is a measure of how far the Coalition Government stand apart from us in this area.  Table 3 of the Public Capital Programme indicates the expenditure section affecting the building industry. The position in regard to that sector is even worse.  In 1983 10 per cent less money was provided than in 1982.  Taking inflation into account that meant a 22 per cent drop in real terms between 1982 and 1983 in public capital expenditure for the building industry.  There will be a further cut for 1984 of 2 per cent for that industry. Taking inflation at 10 per cent this will mean a 12 per cent cut in real terms. Within two years there has been a drop of more than one-third in the public capital allocation to the construction industry. It is interesting to note that since 1982 more than one-third of all building workers lost their jobs.  Deputy McLoughlin told us that only one-third of building workers were out of work but more than 40 per cent of them are out of work.  In Cork the figure is more than 50 per cent.  Unemployment is worse in that city than anywhere else and more than 50 per cent of building workers are unemployed.</P>
    <P>The figures I have quoted indicate the immediate impact investment has on job creation in the construction industry.  It is clearly related to investment.  If money is invested jobs will be provided and output and wealth increased.  If one does not invest jobs are lost.  That is what has happened in the last two years.  One-fifth of all those who are unemployed belong to the building industry.  If the Minister examines the budget he will see that one-fifth of the budget deficit, £200 million, is spent to keep those building workers on the dole.  It is interesting to note that the budget deficit figure of £960 million is almost the equivalent of the amount that will have to be paid out to unemployed workers.  That does not <Col N="895" /> prove very much but it indicates that one of the best ways of reducing the budget deficit is to increase employment.  If more jobs are created the budget deficit will be reduced and greater wealth created.</P>
    <P>The final point I should like to make is in regard to the Minister's statement on the need for pay restraint.  He did not use the term &ldquo;pay freez&rdquo; but he did not make any money available for an increase in pay in the public sector.  He expressed the view that there should not be any further increases in the private sector. One of the great features of the past year has been that manufacturing output increased by 6 per cent and there has been a strong growth in exports.  The volume of exports grew by 10 per cent and industrial exports were up by 14 per cent.  Export prices were up by more than 8 per cent while industrial export prices increased by 9 per cent.  According to &ldquo;The Economic Background to the Budget&rdquo;, produced by the Minister for Finance, total non agricultural wages and salaries were up by 7.5 per cent in 1983 as against 13½ per cent in 1982.  The Minister said he was unhappy with this, that it was too much, but I should like to draw the attention of the House to a statement in &ldquo;The Economic Background to the Budget&rdquo;, under the heading, &ldquo;Competitiveness&rdquo;. It states that the effect on competitiveness of the relatively high increase in earnings was more than offset by a more rapid increase in output per head.  The workers worked harder because of the state of the economy last year.  They worked so hard that they more than offset any increase in pay they got.  I did not see that headlined in any papers.  The statement continues, &ldquo;as a consequence of that productivity increase, unit wage costs here fell by about 1 per cent in 1983 as compared to our major trading partners where there was an increase of 3½ per cent in unit wage costs&rdquo;.  In the United Kingdom there was an increase of 1½ per cent in unit wage costs.</P>
    <P>That is the most significant piece of information contained in that booklet and an account has not been taken of that by the Minister in his speech.  With the <Col N="896" /> increase in exports, and export prices, and the lowering of unit wage costs by 1 per cent, workers in 1983 have produced high profits for their companies on the export markets.  Today the Minister suggested to the House that those workers should not get any increase, not even an increase sufficient to cover inflation.  The 1983 performance by workers proved that they were the backbone of the economy last year and the people on whom we must depend for recovery.  We should give those people an incentive and allow them an increase to cover the cost of inflation because they will produce the goods and increase productivity.  They did so last year but they did not get any thanks.  They got abuse from the FUE, the CII, the organisation representing the self-employed and the farmers.  They have been told that they are dossers, lay-abouts who do not do any work but the document produced by the Minister proves that they were the people who led the recovery in the export markets last year against all the odds.  The Minister should take account of that.  He should give them some credit for that performance and withdraw his call for a wage freeze in the budget.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  That, subject to paragraph 5 of the Imposition of Duties (No. 267) (Beer) (No. 2) Order, 1983 (S.I. No. 398 of 1983), the drawback on beer provided for in paragraph 7 (3) of the Order of 1975 shall, as respects beer on which it is shown, to the satisfaction <Col N="898" /> of the Revenue Commissioners, that duty at the rate specified in paragraph (2) of this Resolution has been paid, be calculated, according to the original specific gravity of the beer, at the rate of £146.047 on every 36 gallons of beer of which the original specific gravity was 1.055 degrees.</P>
    <P>(4)  That where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that beer in respect of which the duty of excise imposed by paragraph 7 (1) of the Order of 1975 has been paid has been used, on or after the 1st day of March, 1984, by any person as an ingredient in the production or manufacture of a beverage (other than beer) containing not more than 1.2% of alcohol by volume, they may, subject to compliance with such conditions as they may think fit to impose, repay to that person the duty of excise paid on the quantity of beer so used.</P>
    <P>(5)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927). </P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposing this Resolution and I will give our reasons as briefly as possible.  If we had before us a budget which set out to achieve any particular economic or social objective, if we had a budget which set out to improve the position of the lower income section of the community, particularly social welfare recipients, we would be prepared to vote for an increase in excise duty, or VAT, or whatever, on beer and spirits. We have done so in the past; we did not oppose increases on beer and spirits when it was shown clearly that the proceeds of the increased tax would go for some worthwhile social purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have often argued here that the man or woman who likes his or her pint is reluctantly prepared to go along with increases in the price of the pint if he or she thinks that old age pensioners will benefit thereby.  If the increase proposed in this Resolution could be seen clearly to be directed to some worth-while social <Col N="899" /> purpose of that sort we would not oppose it.  On the other hand, if in this budget there was a general structure which could be seen clearly to be a strategy to improve economic performance, particularly in regard to employment, we would not oppose the increased tax.  If the budget provided some important incentives for increasing employment or reducing unemployment we would support such a strategy, and if that involved expenditure from the Exchequer we would be inclined to vote for the necessary taxes to finance such expenditure.  That would be our position normally.</P>
    <P>However, no such circumstances apply here in regard to this Resolution.  There is no strategy, no economic strategy of any sort, and particularly there is no attempt in this budget to do anything to improve the situation in regard to employment &mdash; there is no proposed expenditure for employment, no incentives, no strategy of any kind.</P>
    <P>Under that heading there is no justification for this increase in tax on a particular section of the community, nor is there any improvement proposed for lower income families and social welfare recipients.  What is proposed is minimal to the point of being derisory.</P>
    <P>On many occasions as a member of a Government in different capacities I brought forward, or participated in the framing of budgets which did more or less improve the lot of the lower income sections, but I would be ashamed today to bring in a budget which provides an increase of 7 per cent for old age pensioners, the unemployed and all those categories who rely on the State to maintain their already very low standard of living.  The percentages proposed are contemptible particularly when there is talk of understanding and sympathising with the plight of those who are unemployed for long periods and then proceeding to increase their allowance from 7 per cent to 8 per cent.  It is inconceivable that any Government would do something as minimal and contemptible as that.</P>
    <P>We find, on the social side, nothing important enough to justify voting for <Col N="900" /> any tax to support this.  The amount given to the social welfare recipients in the budget could be given without raising any tax.  It is so minimal that it could well have been done within the compass of the budget arithmetic without any taxation. Another reason why we will not vote for this increase in the duty on beer is because spirits are not being touched. It has traditionally been the argument at budget time about beer on the one hand and spirits on the other that the pint is the most popular drink with employees and the lower income section of the community. It is almost certainly true that spirits are by and large the drink of the wealthier section of the community.  Ministers of Finance down the years have always been careful, if at all possible, to favour the beer sector when it came to taxation or at least to keep a balance.  On this occasion the person who drinks beer is being asked to bear the entire level of taxation and the drink which is most favoured by the better-off section of the community is not being touched.  That is another reason why we do not feel we should vote for this excise duty on beer.</P>
    <P>I know that some argument will be advanced about employment in the distilling industry but I do not believe that will stand up.  Employment in the brewing industry is just as important as employment in the distilling industry. This discrimination should not be introduced. I am subject to correction but I believe it is the first time it has been introduced.  At budget time we always endeavoured to maintain a balance or if possible to favour the section of the community who, because of their economic circumstances, drink beer instead of spirits. If there was some justifiable purpose involved in raising tax on beer we would not very strenuously object to it but on this occasion we see no reason whatever for voting for this increase and we will vote against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>If 2p was the extent of the proposal today one would not worry too much about it but, taken in conjunction with the fact that on 3 January 1983 2p was put on, 6p was put on in last year's budget, a further 2p was <Col N="901" /> put on last July, 2p in November and now another 2p is put on, this makes a total of 14p on the pint in a 12-month period. That is a disproportionate increase on any commodity and is quite a serious imposition which discriminates particularly against the lower paid in the community.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Taxation said that narrowly based indirect taxes on goods and services rank very badly in terms of equity.  They are not too keen about selecting commodities like this for treatment in this way.  This industry has little import content.  It is probably the industry with the lowest rate of import content. It works out at approximately 7 per cent import content and is a major contributor to the balance of payments.  Any Minister has to be very careful about tinkering with the price in the way this has happened in the past 12 months.  There are approximately 35,000 people employed in this industry.  That does not take into account those in the hotel industry.  The experts estimate that about one-third of expenditure in hotels is on drink.  This industry is a major employer in the State.</P>
      <P>This industry has a very high content of young people involved in it.  There is probably the greatest number of young people employed in this industry when we take all industries into account.  When you add up all the increases in the past 12 months culminating with the 2p increase today this makes a major assault on the price of the pint in the past 12 months.  This is a direct threat to the jobs of all those young people.  The 2p put on today is the end of the thin wedge which was inserted 12 months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the other EEC countries get about 1 per cent of their total revenue from excise duty on beer and spirits and we get about 9 per cent.  This industry is being disproportionately attacked.  It is very damaging to the great number of young people in the industry and those hoping to get work in it in the year ahead. The various associations involved in the drink industry estimate that the volume of drink sold has reduced by 30 per cent in the two-year period.  This shows that the more that is put on the greater the reduction in the volume consumed.  As <Col N="902" /> the 14p is piled on the pint the volume goes down, so less money is brought in than if it was left the way it was in the first place.  The figures appear to bear that out when one looks at the decrease in the volume of beer and spirits in the past 12 months.  About 11 per cent of the tourist revenue comes from the drink industry.  I submit that the 2p increase today is the end of a 12-month period where a total of 14p has been put on the pint.</P>
    <P>The various associations also estimate that the State is losing between £40 million and £50 million through the smuggling of spirits particularly.  This is having a damaging effect on many of the towns and the area around the Border and it is very damaging to the industry generally. They reckon they are losing about £40 million to £50 million per annum.  It would be more appropriate for the Government to try to save some of this £40 million to £50 million by looking at the Dickensian legislation that exists. There is a 1924 Act which permits the State to look at the licensing arrangement of a public house which might happen to be dealing with smuggled spirits, but that Act is just lying there and nobody has looked at it for a long time.  If the Government could make a hole in that £40 million by looking at the legislation, they would save a great deal more than they will by piling on this 2p every couple of months on an industry which employs 35,000 people, most of them young.  An amount of 14p on the pint in 12 months is the record in this House, not this harmless-looking 2p of today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other speakers, I oppose this taxation imposition for many reasons.  The 2p on the pint of stout, beer or ale is an attack by this Government once again on an area of industry, to a large extent native industry, where jobs are being put at risk.  My own city and region are suffering to an extent never before experienced.  Many in this House may say, &ldquo;Not Cork again&rdquo;, but it is Cork again.  We will have just one traditional industry left in that city after Fords close, and that is the brewing industry.  We have the only two independent <Col N="903" /> breweries left in this country, one employing 362 people and the other approximately 260.</P>
      <P>In this budget and its overall approach the ordinary wage packet is again being reduced.  For example, there is to be a pay freeze in the public sector, according to today's budget.  The 1 per cent levy is being continued, according to the Financial Resolutions before us.  I suggest that that 1 per cent is a further 1 per cent taken off this year's earnings from everybody, because one could reasonably have expected this Government to discontinue this 1 per cent levy which was put on, we understood, for just one year.  As well as that, we have the other tax impositions, including that on clothing which we will come to later tonight, all affecting the wage packet of the worker going home. At the end of the day he in many cases will be spending his residual on such items as beer.  Because of the attack on his wage packet he will have less residual to spend on beer.  His beer will cost him more because in the last 12 months very substantial increases have occurred.</P>
      <P>In today's budget speech the Minister said:</P>
      <P>The excise duty increases will take effect from midnight tonight but increases in retail prices must await a new maximum prices order where appropriate.</P>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach tell us what the total price increase will be, taking the 2p increase together with what the maximum retail price allowed might be and whatever VAT imposition there is over and above the 2p?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employment content here is very important and significant.  The development of the beer market from March 1983 to March 1984 is estimated in bulk barrels to have dropped by about 3.5 per cent.  If that trend continues it will have an impact on employment.  As in all their other approaches here, this Government have done absolutely nothing in this budget for employment and efforts and impositions such as this can only create further job losses.  As I have said, I speak for an area where the last traditional <Col N="904" /> industry, the last traditional big employer, left to us is the brewing industry. Perhaps successive Governments have gone too far, but this 2p on the ordinary man's pint of beer or stout is again an attack by the Government.  We will be opposing this measure and I appeal to Members of this House to support our opposition.  There are Labour Members from the Cork area who should be expressing some concern about the unemployment situation there.  Here they can make an effort by giving the message to the Government that we will not tolerate any further attacks on jobs in that area.  This 2p increase together with what has happened in the last 12 months and the additional increases will all tend to the loss of further jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have just one minute.  I want to emphasise the danger to employment in this increase in the excise duty on beer.  Let us not forget what Deputy Fitzgerald said about the breweries themselves where employment is going down.  Let us not forget also that in the retail outlets the numbers of workers are dropping drastically.  If the Minister for Finance would come out of purdah for a few minutes and deal with the real world and look at the auctioneers' books in Dublin city he will see that there are more bars on their books that they cannot sell than ever in the history of this city.  Let us not forget also the impact on tourists, or on farming because the farmers contract to supply malting barley.  I emphasise strongly the difficulties of my area along the Border. This has been referred to already.  We are in a parlous economic position there <i>vis-à-vis</i> the large imposts on not merely beer <Col N="905" />&mdash; that is what we are dealing with at the moment &mdash; but in other areas also.  The Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Bord Fáilte last year had a very appealing and strong promotion from Mourne through the Erne Valley to Carrick-on-Shannon. It did not get the publicity it deserved.  It did not get the publicity that shooting gets, but this kind of impost is impacting on that also.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition suggested that this budget does nothing for lower income groups or for employment and therefore he is not willing to vote even 2p on beer.  I would point out to him that, exclusive of the social welfare increases, this budget applies, as I estimate, at least £15 million to lower income groups, £5 million to the family income supplement scheme, £5 million to the remission of the temporary levy on people's incomes under £96 a week, £4.3 million on the increased exemption limits which exempt 15,000 people at the bottom of the income levels from income tax, £.5 million for voluntary organisation helping the less well off, not counting provisions such as extension of the free telephone rental scheme and the additional allowance for elderly people in respect of medical cards.  Leaving aside altogether the social welfare increases, the amounts provided for people on low incomes whether they are social welfare or in employment is £15 million or 50 per cent more than the amount raised by the tax on beer.</P>
      <P>With regard to the increase in social welfare the Deputy will be aware that, exclusive of taxation, the cost of living increase in the past 12 months has been 6.5 per cent.  This budget adds less than 1 per cent to the cost of living.  Therefore, including the budget the annualised rate of inflation now stands at 7.5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="906" /> On that basis the increases of 7 to 8 per cent for social welfare are designed to maintain living standards.</P>
    <P>Secondly, he said that it did not do anything for employment.  I refer him to the extension of the enterprises allowance scheme, the taxation provisions in relation to profit sharing, the £8 million put into roads, the deep-water berth at Ringaskiddy, Galway airport, house purchases through the SDA loans and the Housing Finance Agency and primary school building.</P>
    <P>I would refer him to the provision being made for tax relief in respect of long-term risk capital in new firms, to the provision in respect of capital and other allowances and to stock relief provisions. Also, there is a reduction of about one quarter in the tax on residual fuel oil for industry.  All of these measures are designed to help industry.  In money terms they add up to a total of almost £25 million.  Therefore, in respect of the two matters the Deputy mentioned as not being dealt with, there is a provision of £40 million in the budget, of which £10 million is being provided by way of an increase in the tax on beer.</P>
    <P>Regarding the points made in respect of consumption, I would point out that the increase in the pint of beer is 2p, including the VAT increase.  That is a 1¾ per cent increase in the price of beer or one-quarter of what an indexed-based increase would be.  It is one-quarter of what the increase would be if we were to maintain an increase in the price of beer relative to the cost-of-living increase of 7½ per cent.</P>
    <P>The official advice in respect of this 1¾ per cent increase in the price of beer indicates that there will be no consequent impact on the level of consumption.  On the question of a comparison between spirits and beer, I would point out that the last time the party opposite introduced a budget, that was in March 1982, they increased the tax on spirits by 3p per half glass while the tax on the pint of beer went up by 4p.  They did not seem so inhibited then by the relationships between spirits and beer.</P>
    <P>There has been a reduction of 35 per cent in the consumption of spirits since <Col N="907" /> 1978 while in the same period the reduction in the consumption of beer has been 2 per cent.  The rationale of not increasing the price of spirits by way of taxation at this stage is evident from that.  It is believed that there would be a fall in the <Col N="908" /> consumption of spirits if we increased the tax on spirits.  I think I have answered the various points made and I do not consider that any case can be made for voting against the 2p increase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In these two resolutions we have a unique example of budgetary mismanagement in that there is a double imposition on one particular category, namely, the motorist.  I do not mean the person who motors purely for pleasure but I am talking about the person who requires his car for essential purposes in getting to and from work.  There has been an increase of six pence per gallon on petrol and hydrocarbons and side-by-side with that there is the increase in road tax. It is proposed to impose an additional charge of £1 per unit of horse-power with effect from 1 March.  Two revenue sources are being used to get at the same taxpayer and I can think of very few budgets in which this has happened.  It is an incorrect budgetary principle to load taxation on a particular category.  In this case it is being imposed on the motorist who requires a car for essential purposes and it will affect in a practical way the cost of living of many people.  It will cause much social discontent and undoubtedly will trigger off wage and salary demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other aspect is that which was referred to on the previous resolution by Deputy Haughey, namely, that this charge is being imposed without any indication of a broad strategy to deal with jobs and employment.  It is quite incredible that in a Budget Statement of 64 pages there is not a single sentence <Col N="917" /> devoted to the creation of jobs and to the essential social and economic need to generate employment.  Today we had an economic and financial treatise of an academic nature, with book-keeping measures to raise moneys at the expense of some sectors but there was no overall economic and financial plan designed to deal with the social and economic problems of the community.</P>
    <P>Traditionally the budget has been regarded as an instrument for social and economic progress.  The whole purpose of an annual budget, of raising taxes and proposing expenditure, is to ensure that it fits into an economic strategy that is designed to deal with fundamental social and economic requirements.  In our time the paramount requirement &mdash; otherwise there will be no people here to pay taxes &mdash; is to ensure that we have the necessary investment and growth in our society and that as a result of that investment we have the required development of employment and an increasing number of jobs. There is nothing in this budget which will bring about any reduction in the numbers out of work.  This Budget Statement is a recipe for further unemployment, right up to the 300,000 mark eventually, if the financial thinking behind it continues.</P>
    <P>I accuse the Government of approaching this whole matter in an entirely piecemeal fashion.  This approach is evidenced in an obvious effort to achieve an accountancy balance for the time being, to get out of immediate trouble by satisfying this section or that within the Government &mdash; in other words, to reconcile the two parties forming the Government who have opposing ideologies. They must have a certain temporary reconciliation, or at least a reconciliation which would get them over the budget divisions tonight but which will have its day of reckoning when the Labour Party have their conference in April next.  We will then see that the real social evils of unemployment will be borne in on the members at that conference and delegates will see, on the ground, the inability of the present Government to cope with unemployment and devise a strategy to deal with it.</P>
    <P>This budget is supposed to be the <Col N="918" /> annual instrument by which the Government will raise the taxes and devise the expenditures to ensure the economic development to overcome the basic social and economic ills of our community. These come down to two matters.  One is the growing level of unemployment.  That is not referred to in the 64 pages read out by the Minister for Finance here today. The other ancillary aspect is the problem of stimulating further investment so as to create more employment.  That problem is not dealt with here today by the Minister for Finance.  In the major economic instrument of the whole 12 months in any community, which is designed to direct and control economic progress and development in the direction required by the necessities of the community, we get <i>ad hoc</i> thinking designed solely to raise taxes for book-keeping purposes, which leads the Government astray.  There is no essential principle or strategy running through the whole Budget Statement. The basic necessary reforms, which the Minister for Finance mentioned as being reviewed and considered, are not however adopted &mdash; reforms such as the tax credits.  These have been reviewed and recommended by Fine Gael for the past two general elections and by the Government for several budgets.  They are again paraded here like a filly or a colt in the ring and allowed to disappear back into the pasture.  We have three pages of rhetoric devoted to the tax credits and at the end of the day we find that they are not yet feasible.</P>
    <P>We had the same situation today with regard to the report of the Commission on Taxation.  The Minister for Finance called it an excellent report last year and this year and Deputy Bruton, when Minister for Finance, referred to it also as an excellent report.  This report was reviewed and commended and its recommendations paraded as being excellent; but again it is not feasible to do anything about it.  Instead of dealing with the question of jobs, of investment, of real tax reforms in the way of bringing in the recommendations contained in the report of the Commission on Taxation, or the Government's own ideas with regard to income tax credits, we find a <Col N="919" /> final step down and degeneracy into the old <i>ad hoc</i> way of piecing bits and pieces together, of the old ways of raising taxes. In the last case it was the few pence on the pint of beer, in this made doubly bad by affecting one sector not just once but twice, via a tax on petrol and an increase in road tax.</P>
    <P>The Government have made no attempt to plan the economy through a budget in which attention is paid to the basic requirements of our economy, We find this Government just patching things up, engaging in empty rhetoric in the course of a Budget Statement and putting together a patchwork quilt that would be sufficient to get them past their votes tonight, recalling two years ago when they failed even to do that and could not get past even the first vote.  Tonight they will get past the first vote but they will not get past the vote of the people when that occasion arises.  The Labour Party, who have been conspicuously absent here for most of the day and who are conspicuously absent here this evening, will get their answer when they appear before their delegates to justify this situation in which they, as Government Ministers, represent a party sold down the river by the Fine Gael rump within this Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose Resolution No. 5.  I agree with everything Deputy Lenihan said.  The cost of motoring constitutes a major imposition on many people.  Where there may not be public transport many people are dependent on motoring to get to their work.  They do not get any tax allowance and it constitutes a serious imposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly concerned that the Minister and the Government have learned nothing over the past year, since this time last year when the Government increased the price of petrol by 35p.  This caused many people to cross the Border, firstly, to buy their petrol and then while across, to buy their ordinary day to day goods, which is having a very serious effect on our Exchequer.  The situation got so bad that there were busloads of <Col N="920" /> people going from this city; there were 150 buses in one town in the Six Counties one day before Christmas.  That was a direct result of the Minister's action this time last year in increasing, in three different phases, the price of petrol by 35p.</P>
    <P>I believe it is the first time in the history of the State there is not a Minister representing a Border constituency at the Cabinet table.  Perhaps that is the reason the Government have failed once again to take note of the fact that so many people are crossing the Border.  The effect of this latest increase will be that more and more people will cross the Border to buy petrol for their cars and, while there, other goods as well.  It is estimated by traders along the Border from Louth to Donegal that £150 million were lost to this State in 1983.  I have no doubt but that the result of this action by the Government is encouraging people to cross the Border.  As a result of this experience, indeed as a result of the statement made by the Six Counties Tourist Board last week to the effect that they made over £80 million as a result of day trippers from this State, we would have expected that the price of petrol would have come down.  That would have been an asset to the State in terms of revenue and also to the numerous people who depend on motoring for their livelihood.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Taoiseach a few questions for the information of the House?  In the 6p a gallon increase under Resolution No. 5, in each of the areas &mdash; petrol, auto diesel and auto LPG &mdash; exactly what is the breakdown of the actual increase and VAT?  The Minister said in his remarks that the figures included VAT.  Could he say whether it is perhaps 5p and 1p or perhaps 5½p and a halfpenny and perhaps he would give the yield in each individual case &mdash; petrol, auto diesel and auto LPG?  Also could he confirm or deny speculation abroad that there is a further application from the petrol companies for a further increase in those oil prices?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will reply to the question now and come back to the more general points at the end of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="921" /> In the case of petrol and auto diesel the increase is composed of 4.9p excise duty and 1.1p VAT at 23 per cent.  In the case of auto LPG it is 5.7p excise duty and 0.3p VAT at 5 per cent.  As to yields, the yield this year: for petrol £12.1 million, auto diesel £3.8 million and auto LPG £0.4 million and, for good measure &mdash; as I have it in front of me &mdash; the CPI effect of the petrol increase is less than 0.1 per cent, it is .091 per cent, less than one-tenth of a percentage point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I will try to do it now if I may.  According to my calculations it will put approximately £1 a week more on the average motorist, that is, a person doing approximately 30,000 miles a year and getting 30 miles to the gallon.  One would require to be earning perhaps an extra £1.50 or £2 per week to cover the cost of the increase in the petrol.  I would suggest it is £1 per week per motorist additional</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Deputy where he gets the figure of 30,000 miles. I had always thought the average was about 8,000 miles and about 6,000 for a family motorist.  Where does the 30,000 miles come from?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking of the national average.  I have always understood <Col N="922" /> it to be around 8,000, and that is confirmed to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking of a mileage between 20,000 and 30,000 per year which a lot of motorists have to do, particularly commercial travellers and people who have to travel to earn their living, the people who run taxis and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will cost these people an extra £1 per week.  Therefore, their employers will have to give them an increase of an extra £2 per week.</P>
      <P>The second point I want to make &mdash; and the Taoiseach might like to comment on it; it may be a question depending on how he wants to look at it &mdash; the price of oil internationally in dollar terms has been coming down for the past 12 months at the rate of about $5 a barrel.  That was not passed on to the Irish consumer.  That is reasonable enough considering that the dollar has appreciated considerably.  But, just to be crystal clear about it, this 6p today has nothing to do with the dollar appreciation; it is straight, honest-to-God, Government taxation.  We should be crystal clear about that because there is an impression around that somehow this is not the Government's fault, that this is the great big bad Yanks who, having such a strong dollar, are costing us all this money on the exchange rate and pushing up the price of oil for us.  I must reiterate that this 6p has nothing to do with the dollar appreciation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite right.  I confirm that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Taoiseach is confirming it, but there is an atmosphere in the country which suggests that increases like these on petrol are occasioned by the exchange rate on the dollar. One hears taxi men in queues and ordinary people say: &ldquo;Ah well, it is the dollar, you know.&rdquo;  It is not &ldquo;the dollar you know&rdquo; here; it is a deliberate taxation decision taken by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="923" /> It will hit the £700 million tourist industry already on its knees.  We have the second or third highest petrol price now in all of Europe.  It will damage that industry already on its knees and trying to fight back as fast as it can.</P>
    <P>Most of all, the theme behind the Minister's speech today was to restore competitiveness to Irish industry.  What a way to restore competitiveness to Irish industry, by directly putting up the cost to Irish industry.  Manufacturing companies the length and breadth of the country will incur increased costs tomorrow morning as a result of these taxation decisions taken here this evening.  At a time when we are endeavouring to produce more jobs in the country why add to the costs of Irish industry, crippling them, throwing people out of jobs, causing that whole spiral, when the State must pick up the tab for people on the dole, putting us in a situation in which more tax is needed to fund more social welfare and so on? In this way we get back into that circle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I might request a few more figures from the Taoiseach which might be helpful.  Exactly what is the average cost of one gallon of premium petrol today?  Would the Taoiseach give us a breakdown of the margins as against VAT, excise duty, retailers' profit and the amount payable to the oil companies on one gallon of petrol?  I should like him to give us the total gallonage sold by the retail outlets here in 1983 and to let us know if there was a substantial reduction on the amount sold in 1982.  Is he looking for 6p now to make up for the diminishing returns because of the impact of increases over the last 12 months?  I should also like the Taoiseach to give us the number and the amount of increases that have taken place since the Coalition Government took office.  Would he agree that motoring costs in Ireland are the dearest in Europe?  They are, on average, 28 per cent more than in Great Britain.  How can he suggest that he will make £300,000 available to market tourism and to attract tourists here and, at the same time, penalise them by this kind of shock treatment? The motorist was our biggest <Col N="924" /> spending tourist in years gone by.  Would he also indicate the impact that this increase in the cost of diesel and petrol will have on the unit cost of production, particularly in so far as transport costs are concerned?</P>
      <P>The whole budget strategy is a joke and is being viewed outside as simply a &ldquo;cop out&rdquo; to keep the Labour Party in two for their voting power.  Would the Taoiseach agree that while motoring is no longer a luxury, the total cost of running a medium-sized car is now in excess of £4,000 per annum?  How can he expect the working man on an average take home pay of £117 per week to be able to meet this cost and survive in 1984?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do my best to answer the Deputy's questions although I have forgotten some of them already. The average cost of a gallon of petrol will be £2.88½p following this increase, of which £1.62p is the tax content.  I have not got a breakdown of refining costs and retailers' margins&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got them in front of me as they are not directly relevant to the budget.  However, I will give the relevant figures.  The total consumption in 1983 was 270 million gallons.  The increase in the cost to industry, to which auto-diesel fuel is more relevant, is 2.4 per cent.  Of course, depending on the industry, the reduction in the cost of oil for production purposes as a result of the budget is a compensating factor.  For many industries it would be a much bigger compensating factor than the increase in the price of auto-diesel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>During the term of office of Fianna Fáil the price of petrol went up by 48p per gallon in 1981 and 1982 as a result of their budget and other changes and the increase since then, including the cost of petrol and taxation, is 53p.  The two Governments have increased the cost of petrol by precisely the same amount in real terms.  I am sure the Deputy did not want to hear that.  It is evident from the way he approached the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the figure he gave of the reduction of 20 million gallons of petrol between 1982 and 1983 at least indicates that there is a diminishing return in so far as revenue is concerned and that he is responsible for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is diminishing consumption although the major factor here is probably the recession.  The tax <Col N="926" /> increases obviously have an effect and there was a reduction in consumption of almost 4 per cent during Fianna Fáil's term in office following their tax increases.  The overall effect has been that over the two years, between the recession and the tax increases imposed by the two Governments and fluctuations in the price of oil at international level, there was a reduction of about 11 per cent That is precisely why we are not increasing the tax by 13.9p that Fianna Fáil put on, or the somewhat higher figure which we put on over the past year, but by 6p per gallon.  It is estimated that that increase is approximately half the amount that indexation would involve. There is a 4 per cent increase in the tax on petrol as against the 8 per cent which indexation would allow.  Because we are increasing it by only half that amount, in real terms it is effectively reducing the tax content and, as a result, no further drop in consumption is expected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can well understand why the Taoiseach is on the defensive with regard to this matter.  However, I should like to ask him if he agrees that motoring costs in Ireland are the most expensive in Europe and that he and his Government have contributed significantly to that position?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume we are dealing with the increase in the price of petrol and motor car taxation.  We are condemning the Government for a double imposition on motoring in today's budget.  One of the very important points about the motor car in rural Ireland is that it has reversed the industrial revolution trend.  In other words, in the last century people left the villages and rural areas and piled into the industrial cities but due to the motor car and the reasonable costs of running it, young people in rural areas could motor short distances of 20 or 30 miles to factories and return in the evenings.  As of now, this kind of budget is putting that out of their reach altogether.  Where the car defeated the old trend of the English industrial revolution and the general industrial revolution all over the world, this Government are aiding the trend that if one wants a job one will have to move into the town because it is impossible to meet motoring charges.  The IDA could locate factories any place and if motoring costs were reasonable the work force could get to them.  If this trend continues that will be totally wiped out because this budget has aimed a savage blow at this section of the community.  The big criticism of this budget is that there is no encouragement for people to invest and therefore the employment situation will worsen.  This is a real problem and this imposition on motoring &mdash; in regard to petrol and motor taxation &mdash; will accelerate that trend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently we were told that for the first time in the history of the State more cars were sold in the Six Counties this year than in the whole of the Twenty-six Counties.  That is a pointer to what is going on.  The Minister for Finance was badly advised when he allowed extra costs to be put on an industry which is in <Col N="928" /> the death throes.  A few years ago many bright young men chose to make their careers as motor mechanics.  Every major garage, and most minor garages, have been letting qualified mechanics go over the last few years and this trend can only accelerate.</P>
    <P>The Border is a very significant factor in the economy of my area.  Where there are twin towns or villages along the border, the petrol stations have closed down on the southern side.  I was in one of our villages recently but I could not buy petrol there.  The garages had closed because they could not compete.  It is all right for the Taoiseach to say that Fianna Fáil increased the price of petrol but he should not forget that we removed a very significant burden when we abolished motor taxation on cars under a certain horse-power and we did that in a period when there was buoyancy for the most part.  But we are not in such a period now.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to use his influence with the Minister for Finance, even at this late stage, to reconsider the position of the motor dealer, the people who make their living out of the motor business, the worker who has to get to his place of employment by car and so on, because serious damage will be done to the economy by this budget.</P>

Deputy Wilson said in Border areas filling stations are closing on the Republic side; we also have filling stations which are called &ldquo;Six County pumps&rdquo; and &ldquo;Free State pumps&rdquo;.  If you pay in sterling you will be charged the Six County prices and if you pay in punts you will be charged the Twenty-six County rate.</P>
      <P>Listening to Fianna Fáil speakers one would conclude that they had never been in Government or that it was this party who caused this price differential between North and South.  The blame rests fairly and squarely at the door of the Fianna Fáil Party.  They steamrolled us into the EMS.  We buy our petrol with petro-dollars.  Had we stayed with sterling petrol would be £1 a gallon less.</P>

      <P>I know Deputy Harte is trying to impress the Taoiseach but he has not impressed the Taoiseach.  He has destroyed his argument.  He has damaged him.  I am disappointed that he should knife that man in the back.</P>
      <P>In relation to the increase in the duty on petrol I want to request the Taoiseach to grant a special tax allowance to the farming community to make up for the increase in the cost of diesel, a special tax allowance to workers who have to use a motor car to travel to work, and a special allowance to industry for the increase in transport costs.  He will have to give those tax concessions to make up for the increase in the price of petrol and diesel. It is a scandal that in this budget the Taoiseach is making it difficult, if not impossible, for the ordinary motorist and the working motorist to travel to work.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach state the amount of money which will be pumped into the roads of Ireland from the increased tax of £61.4 million in petrol and motor taxation? As the Taoiseach is well aware, the roads of Ireland have deteriorated. They are now in a scandalous condition. Motorists are finding it extremely difficult to use the roads, and yet the increased tax revenue is not being pumped back to improve our national, primary, secondary and county roads. Will the Taoiseach state the exact percentage of the increase which he will return to the roads of Ireland to make them passable for the ordinary motorist? The tax the motorist is paying is far too high and, in return, he is getting damn little from the Government in an improvement of the roads.  In my constituency of Roscommon-East Galway the roads have deteriorated to the stage where they are now practically impassable.</P>

      <P>I support what previous speakers have said.  It is extraordinary that the Taoiseach should try to suggest that the Government are nearly as good as ours.  That is an extraordinary admission from the Taoiseach.  It is also extraordinary that one of his backbenchers &mdash; in fact, the only backbencher who came in to try to support him &mdash; should destroy the argument the Taoiseach was making earlier.  Like the Taoiseach, Deputy Harte suggested that Fianna Fáil were the cause of all the problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1983 the national debt increased by £2,900 million when the Government had been one year in office.  If they are lucky enough to last two years in office by the <Col N="933" /> end of 1984 they will have increased the national debt by about 50 per cent.  What have they to show for it: 208.000 on the dole, no confidence anywhere, everything destroyed and, if we took Deputy Kelly's advice, we would all be heading for the emigrant ship.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Taoiseach a few short questions about competitiveness in Irish industry.  This decision adds to the costs of industry, the cost for workers to get to work, and the cost of the distribution of goods.  We will wind up with an increase in the consumer price index.  It is all very well for the Taoiseach to trot out a simple figure and say that the increase in the consumer price index will be .091 per cent.  Will he tell the House and the people of Ireland that there will be no indirect costs, and that there will be no increase in the price of goods, that there will be no increase in industrial costs and no application for wage increases as a result of the provisions in these two resolutions: 6p on petrol, 6p on diesel and 6p on LPG?  Will he guarantee that this is the last increase we will see this year?</P>
    <P>He has established a commission to look into the cause of non-competitiveness in Irish industry.  He does not have to go to that commission.  He is adding to the problems to-night.  He is adding to industrial costs, the cost of energy, and the probability of an application for a wage increase next year to compensate for these increases.  He has done nothing to reduce the hydrocarbon tax on the ESB.  He has another commission looking at that, to find out the cause of escalating prices in the ESB.  It is time he stopped trying to fool the country.  He should give us the facts straight for once.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very happy to do so.  The proposed increase in the price of petrol is the smallest for a very long time.  My chart does not go back far enough to tell me for how long.  Since the eighties started, the increases imposed by Governments on the price of petrol through taxation have been in each case several times greater and in some instances many times greater than today's 6p.  There is no recent precedent for <Col N="934" /> imposing as little as 6p on petrol and other transport fuels.</P>

      <P>As I have said, whereas indexation would involve an increase of 7½ per cent or 8 per cent in the amount of taxation, this involves only a 4 per cent increase.  One of the points made in the debate by several speakers is a very curious one.  It is that it is a heinous offence to have increased even by this minimal amount the tax on petrol and by a minimal amount the road tax at the same time, that it is a double blow, a right and a left to the motorist.  Let us go back to the last time Fianna Fáil introduced a budget in 1982.</P>

      <P>In March 1982, Fianna Fáil increased the petrol duty by 13.9p, 2.3 times what we are doing and, in real terms, over two-and-a-half times as much.  Simultaneously they increased the road tax by £1 on the 8 h.p. car, by an extra £2 per h.p. from 9 h.p. to 20 h.p. and £3 over 20 h.p.  I have worked it out from the number of cars in each category that there was an average £1.8 per h.p. increase by Fianna Fáil then which, in real terms, is double what we are doing.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt Deputies.  There was no attempt on this side of the house to barrack people opposite. I point out that the Government made a significant contribution to the employment of mechanics by the reduction of VAT on repairs, which we understand has had a significant effect on employment, and we do not anticipate that these impositions will have a damaging effect.  They are on a very small scale by comparison with what Fianna Fáil did when they were in office.  Perhaps Deputies would like to know the increases imposed in the budgets of 1980 and 1981, the only ones for which the Leader of the Opposition accepts responsibility, despite having been a member of the Cabinet from 1977 onwards.  In 1980 while he was Taoiseach there was an increase of 20p; in 1981 the increase was 15p and following his return to office in March 1982 the increase was 13.9p.  The motorist may thank God that we are in Government now and not Fianna Fáil. That is the record of their last three budgets. Crocodile tears about the employment of mechanics do not come very well from the other side of the House.</P>

      <P>The total increase in tax over the two-and-a-half years from the end of 1974 to mid-1977 was 27p. Fianna Fáil managed almost as much as that in some individual years.  If Deputy Séamus Brennan were right that the average motorist motored 30,000 miles, <Col N="936" /> then, based on the consumption figures I gave to the House, the average number of miles per gallon would be 80.  I am somewhat puzzled as to where these cars are which are achieving 80 miles per gallon. People should think before producing figures which are so patently nonsense.</P>

Road tax was originally an ear-marked tax related to road maintenance but gradually that was eroded and there is no direct relationship now.  In so far as it is the only tax which had at any stage any relevance to road maintenance, I would point out that the extra receipts from road tax of £6.5 million are being given back in full measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure it will come as no surprise to the House that we are totally opposed to this Resolution which would impose value-added tax on clothing. Some of my colleagues who are more familiar with the industry will give their views on how detrimental this imposition will be from many different aspects.  I will give my view very briefly.</P>
      <P>This is an anti-social measure.  One would have thought that by now the view of the majority of the people in regard to the imposition of VAT on clothing would have been well known and would have been sufficient to deter any administration from proceeding with a proposal of this nature.  The proposal will be directly detrimental to the family budget.  It is not necessary for me to outline the importance of clothing in the make-up of a family budget, particularly as an item in the budget of the lower income sector. The imposition is iniquitous and will cause direct hardship and privation to the weakest section of our community.</P>
      <P>It can be described as anti-democratic to bring the proposal forward again in view of the fact that in a full general election the people rejected the concept of tax on clothing, particularly VAT.  This is bad social policy and bad taxation policy because the way the proposal is framed will result in all sorts of evasions and distortions.  It certainly will not help in so far as the problem of cross-Border trade is concerned.  I will leave my colleagues to deal with the effects it will have on employment.  The Government cannot attempt to argue that it will not have serious adverse effects on employment in this particular industry which is already in a perilous state and certainly does not need this imposition at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to protest very strongly to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and anybody who cares to listen, about this Resolution, which imposes 8 per cent VAT on clothing.  I wish to protest on two grounds, one of <Col N="952" /> which has already been stated by our Leader, the anti-social ground.  This is being imposed particularly on families who have already had savage impositions on them, the school transport costs introduced last year by the Government, the withdrawal of medical cards which will put an added cost on parents, the extra cost of foodstuffs and rent and now the added cost of clothing.  The fact that it is not on clothing for children up to ten years is of no use whatsoever because every mother knows that clothes for children up to ten years are the least expensive. From ten onwards children are moving into the teenager stage when their clothes by size, quality and the rate of growth of the teenagers make the constant replacement of garments a severe headache for mothers.</P>
      <P>I protest very strongly against this imposition particularly for the mothers who have to bear the burden of figuring out where the money will come from to replace Mary's and Johnny's garments when they see their teenagers growing in front of them.  I wish to protest very strongly at the effect this imposition of VAT will have on the employment situation in the clothing industry.  Is the Taoiseach aware that since 1979 employment in the clothing industry has declined dramatically? In the town of Athlone there are two very thriving small clothing factories. I have already had telephone calls from them tonight in which they asked me to point out the effect this imposition will have on employment in their factories. I want to put it on the record that the Government have done this directly not alone to the town of Athlone but to every town in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This daft imposition reminds me of when I was a Senator and when the Coalition Government fell on their ridiculous age structure in a VAT imposition. I hope I will get an answer in relation to this matter.  Will the Taoiseach say who will be the judge of the ten year old? Many mothers and fathers have fine strapping nine year olds who could pass for 14 year olds.  I am speaking here tonight as a woman Deputy and as a person who knows the constant headache women will be facing.  It is bad enough <Col N="953" /> having to replace clothes for their families but they now have to pay this 8 per cent VAT on all those replacements.  This makes nonsense of what the Minister for Finance said today, that 1 per cent would be added on to the rate of inflation by what he introduced today.  When the full implications of VAT on clothing are taken into account I believe the rate of inflation will be far greater.  It is a savage imposition on families, particularly on women.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to reply to the questions asked and to make a few other points.  First of all, with regard to the question of sizes, immediately after the budget the Revenue Commissioners will be in touch with the trade interests concerned with a view to agreeing detailed specifications and descriptions for distribution to traders and importers in good time before the date in question. That is the answer to the particular question asked.  I would like to make a couple of other points.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but they will agree with the trade as to what sizes are appropriate to a differentiation at age ten just as it is operated in the same way in the United Kingdom and no doubt in other countries where this differentiation is made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is not the position.  The Deputy will be aware of that if she reads the Resolution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy reads the Resolution she will find the wording is there and the interpretation will be agreed between the Revenue Commissioners and the trading interests concerned. I would like to point out that the Resolution we are talking about is somewhat broader than the Deputies seek to imply.  If it is suggested they will vote against it let them be clear about what they are voting against.  They will be voting against 8 per cent VAT on adult clothing. They will be voting against a reduction from 35 per cent to 8 per cent on the charge on leather for the manufacture of clothing and yarn for the manufacture of clothing fabrics.  They will be voting against the reduction from 23 per cent to 5 per cent of the rate on ready mix concrete. They will be voting against the reduction from 23 per cent to 5 per cent on the rate of admission to theatres and certain other live performances and they will be voting against the reduction from 23 per cent to 18 per cent in relation to short term hiring of road vehicles, boats, caravans, mobile homes and trailer tents. I thought the Deputies should know what they will be voting on before they decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point I would like to make in clarification of this point is that of the total consumption of adult clothing 70 per cent is now imported so the main brunt will fall on imports.  The Deputies opposite will know our views on this as they decided to introduce VAT at the point of entry, an arrangement which ties up working capital in relation to imports in a way which does not operate in the same degree in relation to home produced goods.  There are many disadvantages in relation to VAT at the point of entry but it has this effect which should be taken account of in relation to the 70 <Col N="955" /> per cent of imports as against the impact on the 30 per cent of home production.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil were the people who introduced VAT on clothing in 1972, when they introduced a rate of 5.26 per cent which we subsequently abolished. Regretfully, at this stage, in view of the economic and financial situation, we have had to revert to a taxation on clothing but, unlike Fianna Fáil at that time, we are exempting footwear and children's clothing, all of which carried 5.26 per cent when Fianna Fáil introduced it 12 years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach was brave in telling us what we would be voting against but I would like to tell him what we will be voting for.  We will be voting to make the remaining 10,800 people currently working in the clothing industry unemployed because over the last three and a half years almost 1,100 people in the clothing industry have been put on the dole queues.  It is putting it mildly to say I was surprised when I heard the Government's intention this evening.  If the Government wanted to introduce a tax of this kind and wanted to discriminate against those over ten years I would have thought they would have chosen another form of discrimination.  Perhaps they should have considered the introduction of a tax on fur coats, silk goods or something of that nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ridiculous to exclude children under ten years, as my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, has pointed out.  No shop assistant or person engaged in the sale of goods in the clothing industry can tell the age of any child and here the Minister is discriminating on the basis of size.  The people, and most of the Deputies in this House, will rightly reject this proposal. I had hoped that in a time of high recession when so many people are on the dole queue this Government would have seen fit to encourage labour-intensive industry such as our clothing industry.  Rather they have chosen to attack further those involved in the production of goods such as clothing and textiles, and that is very sad.  It will have a detrimental effect on employment in the current and future <Col N="956" /> years and on the small number of such firms that exist.  Deputy O'Rourke spoke of some in Athlone.  In my constituency of Tallaght, Glen Abbey, who have served both the constituency and the country well in providing a substantial number of jobs, may be forced to close down as a result of this.  The few clothing firms that exist have been seeking from the Minister rather than imposition of a tax some relief in the PRSI contributions which labour-intensive industries must pay.  In times like this we should encourage firms that employ people rather than encourage automation as we are doing.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach can tell us that imports will be affected to a greater extent than home-produced goods, and that may be the case; but this country should be very suited to the production of textiles and clothing. Since December 1979, 4,000 people have lost their jobs in the clothing industry and that should bring home to us all how serious a step we are taking in imposing this tax.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear the Minister refer on quite a number of occasions in his speech to the importance of our tourist industry.  Our traditional garments of wool and linen have been of great interest to many tourists.  Our woven materials, clothing, linen products, Aran sweaters and so on have been purchased readily by them.  The imposition of this tax will effect that industry.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Doyle wants to say anything he can do so afterwards. This Government should be doing something to encourage the few textile industries remaining in the country to expand production and go into the export market. Rather than do that they have chosen what perhaps in their minds is a simple solution: to close them down and put the remaining 10,800 people involved in the clothing industry on to the dole queue. As Deputy O'Rourke said, this measure will be very unpopular with the mothers and families of Ireland.  It will affect adversely the poorer families, particularly parents of children in the ten to 18 <Col N="957" /> years of age group who are not at work, who are at school and depending on those parents.  Clothing for this section is very expensive.  This tax will add a further burden to families in this category.  It is a detrimental measure and I suggest that the Taoiseach have second thoughts about it.  It will do great damage.</P>

      <P>I would like to put a point to the Taoiseach on his reference in the Seventh Schedule to Financial Resolution No. 8.  It is a bare-faced admission of Government trickery.  It is not devised to catch out Fianna Fáil; it is devised to lock in and out-manoeuvre the Labour Party, who have made it quite clear in political statements for the past 12 months that they would not and could not ever support the re-introduction of VAT on clothing or footwear.  It has been deliberately locked into the Seventh Schedule which attaches it to other things like concrete products and to the reclaim of VAT by tourists at point of exit.  It has been done deliberately to outmanoeuvre Labour and force them through that lobby.  It is Government by stealth, it is irresponsible and it is purely political rigging of this Financial Resolution.  This was the Resolution which was dreaded by the drapery trade.  The drapery trade has been under considerable pressure to maintain its profit margins and employment levels for the past year or so.  This Resolution will hurt particularly the small drapery outlets in rural Ireland, and in urban Ireland also.  How can they hope now to maintain their existing employment levels if they have to compete against this extra VAT impact?</P>
      <P>In recessionary times adults sacrifice themselves and they have been doing precisely that for the past 12 months.  One sacrifice they always make is to cut themselves short on their own garments.  Ask any woman in Ireland today if there is a deterioration in the clothing that people have to wear now and she will tell you that it is so.  It is sure evidence of a recession, and here we are saying that from now on we are condemning our people to being the poorest-clad population in Europe.</P>

Now by stealth it has been brought back by this Government in the most outlandish, unfair and irresponsible manner possible.  I ask the Taoiseach what, according to this Resolution, does &ldquo;ten years and a bit&rdquo; mean?

      <P>I ask the Taoiseach if I can take it from the reference to labelling and his earlier remarks that the Revenue Commissioners will instruct the drapery trade to devise a method of labelling goods for children aged ten and ten and a bit as mentioned in the Schedule.  Is this not the daftest resolution ever brought before this House?  Yet it is said willingly by the Taoiseach that it is coupled to other measures that might seem to give some little relief on a few other products and operations.  That is political trickery and the Taoiseach should be above it.  However, he has condemned himself out of his own mouth and that is how the public will treat him when they get the opportunity.</P>

      <P>With respect to the question of age, as is clear from the wording and from what I have said in explanation of it, the method adopted is for the Revenue Commissioners to discuss with traders in relation to their sizing system what sizes of clothes are appropriate to a child of average size aged ten or higher.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, on the contrary it is quite current &mdash; I find that clothes tend to be sized by age very often.  Whether they are sized by age, as is the practice in some cases, or whether it is done by sizes, the size appropriate to a child of average size of age ten will be determined and clothing below that size will be exempt. The same system operates in Britian and does not create any great difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Machiavellian mind of Deputy Flynn imputes to us more subtlety than perhaps we have or would wish to display on this matter.  In regard to the other point he raised, he should be aware that all VAT Resolutions being brought in are brought in as a single VAT Resolution comprehending any VAT change in a budget.  This is not a practice being introduced in this budget to make matters awkward for the Opposition or to pull the wool over anyone's eyes.  It is normal practice and one that has been followed by other Governments, including Fianna Fáil, down through the years.  If that were not the practice budget discussions would be very difficult and complex.  Deputies opposite must bear in mind that if they <Col N="960" /> vote against this they will be voting against the other elements too.  It is not that we have put the Resolutions together by way of contrivance but merely to follow normal practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take up the point made by the Taoiseach when speaking about the importation of clothing. Most of the tariffs are <i>ad valorem</i> and we seem to be importing more from such places as Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong, but a 300 per cent <i>ad valorem</i> rate does not bring the prices up to anywhere near what it costs to produce garments in this country.  It was that kind of pressure that caused so many manufactures to close down, including two in the recent past in my constituency.  This 8 per cent imposition will break the backs of those who are left.  The 30 per cent mentioned by the Taoiseach are now being put under extra pressure.</P>
      <P>I recall during my time working in Donegal that when tweeds came under threat in the US, which is the most powerful economic unit in the world, the Government there imposed restrictions that endangered the little industry in Donegal.  This was done because of the concern of the US Government for their own manufacturers, whereas we are imposing an 8 per cent VAT on clothing when we know that that imposition will kill whatever is left of our clothing industry. I am talking of the manufacturing end but from that arise the other areas to which Deputy Flynn referred.</P>
      <P>If the Minister for Finance would have regard to the well-produced journals that are sent to places all over the world in an effort to encourage tourism, he would find, as Deputy Harney said, that one of the big catches so far as the tourists are concerned are our knitwear and tweeds, which we are especially good at producing and in respect of which we are doing a very good business.  In a budget in which there is nothing being done to increase employment there should at least be a second thought about the imposition of this 8 per cent on clothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="961" /> Someone referred to the problem of teenagers in this respect.  Today's teenagers are much more fussy about the clothes they wear than was the case in the past.  The percentage of income that teenagers spend on their clothes is much greater than would have been the case of a past generation.  Consequently, the pressure will be very great on parents who are already paying a great deal extra for their children in third level institutions and who are to be deprived in many instances of medical cards for those children. Today's impositions will add to the burden of all those families.</P>
    <P>I cannot see the Labour Party supporting this proposal but, should they support it, we may take it that the whole nature of that party has changed, that they will be abdicating their self-arrogated responsibility for the weaker sections.  However, they are linked in harness with Fine Gael; but Labour must realise that this 8 per cent on clothing may very well be only the thin end of the wedge.  If Labour swallow this one they will probably be swallowing 10 per cent next year if the Government last that long and also VAT on footwear.  Deputy Power has just reminded me of the old saying of not casting a clout until May is out.  Apparently this VAT imposition will be effective from 1 May.  Then, many people will be casting clouts, not for reasons of hygiene or of health but because of this Resolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two situations here.  One is where a tourist is from an EEC country and is entitled to bring into his own country goods to the value of £145 without being liable to VAT.  The position is that VAT rates on clothing in these countries are very much higher than is the case here.  In four cases it is of the order of 18 to 19 per cent.  In another case it is 22 per cent while the lowest rate is 12 per cent.  Therefore even with the 8 per cent tax on clothing there will be an advantage for tourists in buying clothes here and that advantage is significant, about 10 per cent on average.  In respect of tourists from outside the EEC, but particularly from the US, the new provision <Col N="962" /> we are introducing whereby they can reclaim VAT on goods taken out of this country will ensure that they may purchase clothing here free of VAT.  Therefore in both cases there is an advantage to tourists in buying clothing here.</P>

      <P>Regarding the reference to children of the age of ten and a fraction, as at the bottom of page 9, we find on page 10 details of certain areas that are excluded &mdash; articles of clothing which are not described, labelled, marked or marketed on the basis of age or size.  Does this not mean that there will be a sizeable amount of clothing for children under ten that will not be exempt? How is it intended to overcome that problem?</P>

      <P>The misunderstanding is my fault because inadvertently I did not answer the question asked previously. There are certain types of clothing that are not sized regardless of whether they are for children or for adults.  One thinks of scarves, for example.  There are very few items of that kind.  One case, though I cannot see its relevance in this instance, is wigs.  Since very few children wear wigs, we may take it that they are intended for adults but they are not actually sized.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because of such items that the reference is included. Regarding the question of the age of ten and a fraction, I understand that the purpose of this is that the VAT will not apply to clothing of a size worn by children up to but not including those aged 11.  In practice many clothes are sold marked not by size as such but in accordance with the age of the child for which they are suitable.  The intent is that such clothing as would be appropriate to a child of ten or ten and a fraction, that is, a child under 11, will be exempt.  Any clothing which would be appropriate to an average sized child of 11 or over will not be exempt. That is the purpose of the solution.</P>

      <P>The one minor advantage was in respect of clothing because in this State that item had an advantage over clothing in the Six County area so far as the ordinary shopper was concerned. One would think this Government had set out to be deliberately perverse in this.  It was the one area where the ordinary trader in this country had an advantage and it was one way he could still hold on to a certain amount of trade. Obviously the Government set out deliberately to exacerbate the situation where consumer expenditure was going across the Border with a resultant loss of trade to shopkeepers in this part of the country and with a considerable loss of revenue to the Government.  It seems to me the Government have set out deliberately to remove the last small advantage Irish traders had in consumer expenditure or, alternatively they have not even thought <Col N="964" /> out exactly what they are doing in this ludicrous, silly, anti-social proposal.</P>

      <P>It is a small number but one cannot omit them because then it would be impossible to determine whether they should be taxable or not. Like all legislation, this has to be precise so that the items can be clearly defined and people know the situation with regard to tax.  Therefore, even though the number is small and the items unimportant, it is necessary to put it in.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite surprised at what Deputy O'Rourke and other Deputies have said.  Apart from grocery shopping it is the one kind of shopping in which I engage.  From my experience I know one hears shoppers say that they want a coat or a skirt for a child of ten but will add that the child is big for a <Col N="965" /> ten-year old or is small for her age as the case may be.  Then a discussion will ensue as to whether the garment in question would suit.  Shopkeepers work out the size for a given age and that is well known and established.  The process of establishing that with the Revenue Commissioners is quite simple.  It has been done in Britain without difficulty and the fuss the Deputies opposite are making shows how little they know about the subject.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>This would be amusing if it were not so serious.  The Taoiseach would make a very bad draper because he has found it very difficult to explain to Deputies on this side exactly how he would define the clothes that would fit a ten-year old child.  If he had experience of buying clothes he would realise it is impossible to impose this requirement.  At this stage he should tear up this proposal and withdraw the provision because it will not work.  The Taoiseach should have some knowledge of the realities of life.  It reminds me of the women's programme he was on recently when some lady told him he was living on a different planet.  It is obvious now that he is, that he has no real knowledge of ordinary Irish people.  It is impossible for him to tell us how to work out the different sizes of clothes for a ten-year old or an 11-year old child.  I have been in touch with clothing manufacturers this evening and they are worried with regard to retaining their employees.  The point was made to me tonight that in our term of office we allowed £5 per week allowance per employee, to assist the retention of the employees in this particularly labour intensive industry, which is under threat at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This imposition is the death knell to many small clothing factories and many retail outlets are also under major pressure. The point was also made to me that from tomorrow onwards, you, Taoiseach, will be responsible for massive pre-imposition sales up to 1 May 1984 which will ensure very little return for the next 12 months, which is anticipated at £16.4 million for 1984.  It is very unlikely that your Government will receive that <Col N="966" /> amount from this imposition.  The public must respond to avoid this penal taxation on clothing for children over ten years of age.  It is a most crazy and unusual situation. I have been checking with manufacturers and they are unable to define exactly how to regulate sizes to suit a ten year old, an 11 year old or a 15 year old. They cannot devise any scheme which will bring this regulation into operation and you are trying to explain to this House that you, by some method of other, are in a position to devise it.  This is a fraud and you are bringing in penal taxation on the hard-pressed consumers. The parents who are now trying to clothe their children up to 18 years of age will find it extremely difficult to carry this extra burden.</P>
    <P>The concession allegedly being made at this stage is impossible to operate.  You are reaching a stage, Taoiseach, where the position will be made impossible for the draper and the manufacturer.  You will throw many hundreds out of work on the manufacturing and the retail side. You will be responsible for adding to the 208,000 at present unemployed.  This proposal is the greatest disaster ever.  You were beaten on it less than two years ago, defeated in this House.  You went on your bended knees to plead to a man who is no longer here and will not be here again, Jim Kemmy, to support you in relation to this imposition of VAT on footwear and clothing.  I believe that you will be begging the Irish people to put you back again into Government.  You will never again be elected Taoiseach by the will of this House.  This is going to damn you for all time.  Everywhere you go and stand and speak, people will shout you down.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Flynn in his protests at the manner in which concrete ready to pour is mixed with clothes ready to wear.  In this is also included the lowering of VAT on theatre tickets.  That is something which in our submission to the Minister we asked should be zero-rated.  We very much welcome the reduction to 5 per cent.  However, that will not stop me from voting against VAT on clothing.  It is most unfair of the Taoiseach to tell people opposed to VAT on clothing that they are voting to keep VAT at a higher rate on theatre tickets, or that they oppose a reduction on concrete ready to pour.  As I read this it is only clothes ready to wear which are affected by the exemption limit for children under ten and a fraction.  I take it that that includes a child right up to the day before his or her 11th birthday.  I would ask the Taoiseach to consider that VAT will still remain on fabrics, yarn and thread.  What about children who are of abnormal size, or are handicapped or disabled, and who do not get clothes ready to wear?  They have to buy the yarn or fabric or thread and get the clothes made at the tailors.  These are the children who more than any others need the exemption.  Would the Taoiseach please reconsider this and how he can give exemption to these disabled or abnormally sized children who must have clothes made for them?  In the first place, these clothes are much more expensive, so to put another 8 per cent on is an absolute outrage.  Why has this not been considered by the people who drew up this measure?  No consideration whatsoever is given to the difficulties of parents of these children.  Will the Taoiseach consider altering this measure to ensure that they will have at least the same exemption as children who get clothes off the hook?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EileenLemass" hpid="Mrs. Lemass Mrs. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the situation were not so serious it would be very funny.  A lot of people are making jokes this evening, passing remarks, but I should like to say to the Taoiseach that this is the most serious situation ever for the people of this country.  Has the Taoiseach any realisation <Col N="972" /> at all of what the mother and housewife is going through at present? Does he realise that families are experiencing the most difficult period they have done for a long number of years?  Does he realise there are households with unemployed teenagers where the father is unemployed?  The mother is trying to cope with feeding and clothing those children. He talks about VAT free clothes for children under ten.  What about children between the ages of ten and 18 which women are trying to clothe?  They are trying to keep them at school because there is no work for them.  If they allow them to leave school at 16 or 17 they sit at home all day doing nothing.  Therefore, the mother and father, at great pain and expense to themselves, are endeavouring to keep these children in school until they are 18.  They are trying to buy schoolbooks for them, trying to feed them.  On top of all of that, when they are endeavouring to clothe them there will be an 8 per cent VAT imposition on those clothes.</P>
      <P>I have three grandchildren.  I can assure the Taoiseach that even if there is a size shown on clothes in the shops children do not conform to size.  There will be a six-year-old who might need an eight-year-old size, a ten-year-old who will need a teenage size.  How is that kind of problem to be overcome?  There will be a small woman who might be able to fit into a child's jumper or pair of jeans. As the Taoiseach said, when the Government fell here in 1982, he was putting VAT on shoes because he thought women with small feet would be able to buy children's shoes; a woman with a size three shoe could buy a child's shoe.  The same thing will happen now.  There will be women who will be able to fit into children's clothes and children who will need adults clothing.  As Deputy O'Rourke said, the whole situation is daft.  I notice the Taoiseach is not listening to me at present.  I hope he can hear with one ear what I am saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What about items like bed clothing, sheets and material?  Is VAT to be imposed on them as well?  As another Deputy said, will people like dressmakers who make clothes be charged 8 per cent <Col N="973" /> VAT?  Will the tailoring establishments be charged 8 per cent VAT?  The clothing industry has been going through an extremely bad time over the last couple of years because of the importation of clothing from different foreign countries, such as Korea, Taiwan and others.  It is a sad situation for our clothing industry, an old established industry which employed a great number of women who at present cannot get employment while women are finding it more and more difficult to be employed during this recession. Does the Taoiseach further realise that in certain shops in this city one cannot buy an Irish-made garment?  If one goes into one of these shops and asks, &ldquo;Have you got an Irish-made garment in your shop,&rdquo; they will say, &ldquo;No, they are all imported&rdquo;.  Therefore, because of cheap imports in recent years our clothing industry has been going through an extremely difficult time.  More and more small clothing industries have been closing down, more and more tailoring establishments have been closing down.  This will finish them off altogether.</P>
    <P>Even at this late stage I appeal to the Taoiseach to reconsider this VAT on clothes.  The Minister for Finance has given an extra 20 pence per week per child in children's allowances.  He is giving 20p per child per week and putting 8 per cent VAT on their clothing.  One might well ask where is the £9.60 the women were promised in 1981?  They are not even considering that any more.</P>

      <P>There are at present women living in housing estates in this city whose husbands are working and have reasonable jobs who cannot afford <Col N="974" /> heating oil for their homes.  In a certain estate in this city women are clubbing together in the afternoon, three and four of them.  They go to each other's houses so that they can keep warm in the afternoons. One woman turns on the heating in her home one afternoon and another woman the next afternoon.  That is how badly off they are at present.  These are all people with young families, with two, three or four young children.  Then this Government intend to crucify them with this extra VAT on clothes.  They will reach the situation in which they will be unable to buy anything for their children. They are finding it sufficiently difficult at present to feed them and send them to school, never mind this latest imposition.</P>
      <P>Even at this late stage I repeat my appeal to the Taoiseach and his Government to reconsider this stupid, unreasonable, dreadful VAT on clothing for children in excess of ten years and adults.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to give the Taoiseach a little respite from VAT on clothing at the moment.  I might refer him to paragraph (4) of the Seventh Schedule on page 11.  The reference contained in the <i>Principal Features of Budget</i>, the yellow document, is very misleading with regard to the question of VAT on theatres and other live performances being reduced to 5 per cent.  I should like to tease this out somewhat with the Taoiseach. The VAT on certain theatrical and musical performances, including circuses, but excluding other types of things, is being reduced to 5 per cent.  I take it that the exclusion will mean that Irish cabaret shows will not benefit from the reduction.  I take it that live shows, including dinner arrangements, or live shows put on by performers in lounge bars, such as Siamsa, or whatever, will not be excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would draw the particular attention of the Taoiseach to sub-paragraph (b) of <Col N="975" /> paragraph (4) on page 11 where it is stated that certain types of performances will be excluded from this beneficial reduction.  Paragraph (b) says:</P>
    <P>performances in conjunction with which facilities are available for the consumption of food or drink during all or part of the performance by persons attending the performance;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that in most theatres operating with live performances in this city and in other towns facilities are available for lounge bar drinking at intervals during the show, and that the provisions of this section, if applied to the letter of the law, would exclude them from its benefits?  I should like the Taoiseach to clarify that matter and put the thousands of people who get involved in live performances in lounge bars and other places at ease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one area in which the Taoiseach has made a mistake and in respect of which he has an opportunity to rectify it.  I will put a direct question to him now.  Does he intend to have any leeway to means test the children over ten years of age, or is it to be an overall attack on large families?  He knows very well that large families are directly affected by this measure.  Make no mistake about it, the reason it is being introduced is that the Government realise it is a money spinner.  The Taoiseach realises perhaps that a very large number of people can afford to pay increased prices and there is a total disregard for those who cannot.  It is ironic that in the year of Orwell we are going to have ten year olds snooped on by Big Brother.  How does the Taoiseach aim to identify children of this age?  Are the Government embarking on a campaign to photograph children?  It is nonsensical and unworkable. <Col N="976" /> The Taoiseach would be doing the country a favour if he would give an assurance that he will rethink this matter.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach's replies to the Resolutions, particularly this one, have been ridiculous.  The methods by which the Government intend to implement this are just not on and I would have thought the Taoiseach and the Government had learned their lesson from the time they tried to impose a tax on shoes.  However, they did not learn a lesson.  There is a marked absence of Members of the Labour Party tonight. Not even one of them is here for this most important debate which affects the people they claim they represent, the working class people with large families. Is there a special parliamentary meeting taking place or have they gone into hibernation? The public should know that they did not even have the courtesy to listen to the arguments here tonight and I hope the Taoiseach will take that up with his colleagues.  We have been asking people to be more competitive regarding job creation and competitiveness in the workplaces in order to sell more but now the Government are imposing 8 per cent on an industry that is on its knees.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach mentioned what Fianna Fáil did in 1972 when they imposed 5 per cent VAT on clothing and he said we were wrong to do that.  He must make up his mind.  If Fianna Fáil were wrong then he cannot be right now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

All women TDs have been asked to unite on various issues and I am disappointed that none of the women TDs on the Government benches is here tonight to support the women of Ireland.  I was amazed to hear the Taoiseach talking about the sizing of garmets in shops and saying that because there was a size ten label on a garment it is exempt from VAT.  I have two children, one of whom is nine years of age.  Because of his height he takes a size 12 in trousers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Do I take a birth certificate with me to the shop to prove that my child is under ten years of age or do I have to pay VAT on a garment despite the fact that he is under ten years of age?  I should like to address that question not just to the Taoiseach but also to the Minister for Finance and, more importantly, to the faceless men in the Department of Finance who obviously devised the sizing system&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is astonishing ignorance on the part of the Deputies opposite.  I do not know where the Deputies shop; perhaps they go to very upmarket stores.  But in Dunne's Stores, as Deputy Owen pointed out, she bought clothes yesterday for a child aged 13, <Col N="978" /> marked age 13, for £6.99.  Sweaters are sized by age up to the equivalent of about age 12 and other clothes to different ages. Anybody who shops for children will be aware of that practice.  I am not, however, relying on that other than to expose the ignorance of the Opposition Deputies and the fact that they do not shop where everybody else shops.</P>

      <P>I said the ignorance of some of the Deputies opposite.  The absence of knowledge is a quality to be found even among politicians, but most notably on the other side of the House. Another example of the extent to which Deputies opposite are remote from reality is the fact that Deputy Lemass asked was this going to add 8 per cent to the cost of bedclothes, bedlinen and so on. The answer is no because, as she would know if she shopped for them, there is a 23 per cent rate of VAT on them already. She did not know that.  The less said on the far side of the House the better, as they do not seem to know anything about the matters we are discussing.  On the question of exemption for children's clothes, have the Deputies opposite forgotten the amendment they put down to a certain Financial Resolution two years ago?</P>

      <P>As soon as I mention two years ago the shouting starts on the far side; they do not want to hear about it.  They say this cannot be done.  It is done in Britain.  Fianna Fáil were the first to propose it in this House, excluding children's clothes and footwear and going on to define it by the age of children. That was the Fianna Fáil amendment to <Col N="979" /> a Resolution two years ago and now they say it cannot be done.  Not only do they not know anything about the sizing of clothes; they have not even read the Resolution or they would know that the method adopted will be based on the sizes of the average build of children. When they talk about birth certificates they are showing their ignorance even more.  Perhaps the less they say the better. They have exposed their ignorance here for the last hour and a half.</P>

    <P>With regard to theatre performances, this is a reduction of VAT brought in as the instance of people interested in the theatre to deal with theatres, circuses and other similar entertainments.  In such cases there are, of course, refreshments provided in the interval and that will not in any way interfere with the reduction in VAT.  It will not apply to entertainment in public houses and so on in order to prevent abuses in accordance with Dáil budgetary practice.  Some Deputies opposite will recall that there was a well established avoidance practice under a previous entertainments tax relief to have a man playing a piano in an empty cinema for up to three hours before the film commenced in order to establish that the whole show was predominantly a live performance. <Col N="980" /> In making this concession with a view to helping the genuine theatre and circus, it is not intended to provide something through which a coach and horses can be driven in order to exempt from taxation entertainment in public houses and places of entertainment of that kind, desirable though many people may think that to be.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), to delete paragraph (a).</P>
      <P>The purpose of our amendment will be clear to everyone in the House.  Resolution No. 9 as it comes before us is in two parts.  The first part deals with the abolition of the 25 per cent band and its incorporation into the higher bands.  The second part deals with an increase in the personal allowances of the taxpayer.  In announcing these changes today the Minister indicated that, in all cases, the operation of the increase in the personal allowances would more than compensate for any disadvantages brought about by the changes in the bands and the rates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We argue very strongly from this side of the House that the changes which are purported to be made by this Resolution are so minimal in impact as to be hardly worthwhile expecially in so far as the lower paid are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="986" /> Most people agreed with us in the arguments we put forward before the budget was introduced that one of the things needed in this year's budget was some reasonably substantial easing of the burden of direct taxation on the lower paid.  That is a very arguable case on the grounds of equity and on the grounds of the conditions in which the lower paid find themselves today.</P>
    <P>Right through 1983 the lower paid section of our community, and lower income families in particular, were faced with one imposition after another.  Overall their entire position was seriously adversely affected.  It would make very good economic sense to effect a very considerable reduction in the amount of tax paid by the lower income groups because that section of our community, by and large, spend almost their entire income.  They have no alternative.  In order to get by from week to week and from month to month they have to spend almost their entire income, whereas when one moves up the income brackets a certain amount of income is saved or used in another way.  Any reduction in income tax for the lower-paid section would have a direct and immediate effect on consumption and therefore would help to stimulate employment.  From both the equity point of view and the general economic point of view in regard to stimulating employment, a substantial reduction in the amount of tax paid by the lower-paid section should have been an essential and integral part of budget strategy this year.  Unfortunately that has not been the case and instead we have Financial Resolution No. 9 which, as far as the lower paid are concerned, will have only a minimal effect.  Taking a typical case, a married taxpayer with two children earning between £5,000 and £7,000 a year will gain very little from the operation of this Financial Resolution.  The relief will be about £22 or £23 a year which is almost of no value.</P>
    <P>We would have wished to propose an amendment bringing about a considerable change in income tax provisions for the lower paid but the rules of procedure do not permit us to do so.  We have had to confine ourselves to doing the maximum <Col N="987" /> possible in proposing to delete from Financial Resolution No. 9 those provisions which are detrimental to the taxpayer because they abolish the 25 per cent band and move that income of £1,000 into a higher bracket.  The purpose of our amendment would be to remove that change but leave intact the changes in the personal allowances.  The Resolution as framed, because of the operation of the two different parts, will have a minimal relief effect for lower-paid taxpayers. We are trying to leave the better part of the Resolution intact in effecting an increase in personal allowances but at the same time making no change in the existing bands and rates.  We would have liked to do much more but as we interpret the rules of procedure we are not permitted to go any further at this stage.  I recommend the amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment and I wish to ask the Minister some questions.  We were told yesterday by the Minister that 71,000 taxpayers were paying tax in the 25 per cent band.  According to the increase in the exemption limits announced today, 15,000 people will be relieved of liability.  That leaves 56,000 taxpayers of the type described by Deputy Haughey moving from the 25 per cent band to the 35 per cent band.  I would ask the Minister to confirm or deny that.</P>
      <P>Secondly, if no changes were made today in the income tax regime, could the Minister tell us what amount of additional tax would be paid by the PAYE sector under fiscal drag?  I should like to have that figure because it is important, bearing in mind that the total relief for all taxpayers is £40 million.  My concern is for the huge number of people &mdash; 56,000 &mdash; who will be moving into the 35 per cent band.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this measure is that the first tax band into which a person will move is the 35 per cent band. Offsetting that we have the increases in personal allowances which bring up the point at which a person enters that tax band.  I said to the Deputy in reply to a <Col N="988" /> question yesterday that there were 71,000 people now paying tax in the 25 per cent band.  The 15,000 people now relieved of liability will be relieved because of the increase in the exemption limits and the 15,000 people are coming off the bottom group of taxpayers.  The effect of not making the change put forward in the Financial Resolution would be that £40 million more would be paid in income tax during this year than will now be paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is confirming that 56,000 people will be paying tax at 35 per cent who were paying at 25 per cent.  That is the important point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of the 7.5 per cent increase in income, the fiscal drag, that is, the extra amount of tax that would be raised in 1984, would be £85 million. In a full tax year it would be £132 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important for the House and for taxpayers generally to realise what is being done here.  There has been quite a lot of talk in recent days, obviously prompted by leaks from Government sources, about the amount of relief to be given to the PAYE sector. We see now the extent of it.  They will pay all the tax they paid last year plus £45 million, even taking into account the relief announced today.  There is no relief whatsoever for the PAYE sector, except the 15,000 people who are now to be exempt from liability.  Probably even more important is the fact that 56,000 of the lowest income earners will now find themselves paying tax initially at the 35 per cent rate who heretofore paid at 25 per cent.  The Minister has confirmed this and that gives a clear example of the futility of the effort to have it said that something was done for the PAYE sector, while in effect absolutely nothing was done other than lower income earners <Col N="989" /> paying tax at a higher rate and all taxpayers paying increased taxes as compared to 1983.</P>

      <P>It is worth driving home the point which has been made. The Minister made a major mistake this evening.  The 56,000 people are effectively moving into a new rate which is 35 per cent.  I get the feeling from the Minister that he did not intend to do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell the Minister about tax reduction.  Last year he took £4,681 million from the people.  He is proposing to take £5,254 million next year.  If that is tax reduction I would like to know what the Minister considers tax increases.  The Minister will take more tax from the people, many of whom are lower paid, than he did last year.  I do not require a lecture on tax reduction.</P>
      <P>Speaking of tax reduction, about which the Minister is very proud, a married couple with one child earning £10,000 will benefit by the princely sum of 88p a week and that is in the name of tax reduction and tremendous budget strategy. It would not buy a few pints of this dear beer which has now hit us and would not put a gallon of petrol in a car.  It is hardly worth the administration of the scheme to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it worth all the trouble, rearranging and administration to give a reduction of 88p?  It will cost more than 88p to the State to administer that reduction.  It has to be regarded as a purely nominal gesture and to that extent it is welcome.  However, it is only a gesture and not a massive effort at tax reduction.  We must look at the overall burden of taxation.  There is the 1 per cent temporary levy which has now been reimposed.  It will probably be a permanent feature.  There is the youth employment levy and the PRSI levies.  Overall 30,000 people lost their jobs last year so the tax base was reduced by that number. The Minister is predicting that a further 30,000 people will lose their jobs this year.  The tax base will be reduced by 60,000 people over two years.  The Minister is asking fewer and fewer people to pay more and more to carry the services of the State.  Unemployment assistance will be £560 million.  Every working person pays £500 a year or £10 a week to fund the social welfare payment.  If 30,000 people lost their jobs last year, 30,000 lose their jobs this year and 30,000 next year, the Minister will have shoved the working force so low that the level of taxation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interfere with Government negotiations or the survival of the Government.  If that is what is at stake I will not detain the House much longer.  The reduction of 88p is derisory.  The number of people paying taxation above the standard rate is now 40 per cent.  In Canada it is 1 per cent; in Sweden 12 per cent and in Britain, who had a litany of socialist Governments, it is only 5 per cent but it is 40 per cent here.  In the United States it is 11 per cent.  While the 88p is a step in the right direction, it is not a real attempt to push down the enormous figure facing us.  Ten years ago the number of people paying tax above the standard rate was 1 per cent.  Today the figure is 41 per cent.  We are the most highly taxed country in the EEC and 88p is no solution.  With the price of two beers, a gallon of petrol and VAT on clothing that 88p will be well gone.  The average family are worse off tonight as a result of the budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In examining the contention that the Minister is offering relief of the taxation burden which is crushing the workers of the country, can he inform the House what the income tax take from the PAYE sector was in 1983 and the estimated take in 1984?  When listening to the answer I would ask the House to bear in mind, as Deputy Brennan emphasised, the number of people paying PAYE during 1984 will reduce by 30,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have specific figures for PAYE taxpayers.  We have figures for the total number of taxpayers whose taxes are paid through the PAYE system.  This includes a number of people who do not pay what is regarded as PAYE.  The proportion of taxpayers paying tax at the higher rate in 1984-1985 before these budgetary measures would have been 45 per cent of taxpayers.  The effect of the budget and the changes in <Col N="992" /> the allowances that are provided for in this Resolution will bring the proportion of taxpayers in the higher rate down to about 39 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that the figure the Minister circulated in regard to the tax take from income tax for 1984 shows an increase of approximately £300 million over the take in income tax for 1983?  If there are 30,000 fewer people expected to be paying income tax during 1984 surely the budget is increasing substantially the tax burden on the remaining taxpayers rather than, as the Minister claims, offering some relief?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is, of course, playing the numbers game with the averages against the specifics.  I have said clearly that the value to taxpayers of the tax reliefs we are now discussing is £40 million.  I do not think I said at any stage today that this represents a large reduction in the burden of taxation.  I did not say that it represents a reduction in the total take of taxation.  I told the House that for people in the lower income groups, and the groups under the exemption limit in particular, it will represent a substantial improvement in their position.  For the 15,000 people who will come out of the tax net it represents an improvement in their position.  As I said this afternoon, it has been my concern in <Col N="993" /> constructing the measures before the House to spread, as far as that could be done within the confines of the system as it is, the advantage of that £40 million reduction in the total tax take as far as possible in favour of those on lower incomes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the tax revenue forecast for 1984 as compared to 1983.  It is made up of a combination of the effects of the operation of the system as it was when the forecast was drawn up &mdash; it is a pre-budget forecast &mdash; the rates as they applied then and the expectation as to what will happen to incomes and, therefore, the effect on people moving up through the bands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the way tax forecasts are done normally.  With regard to what Deputy MacSharry has said about 56,000 people moving into a different rate band it is, as I said earlier, a fact that with the change we propose in the Resolution the first rate band a taxpayer will move into will be the 35 per cent band. A taxpayer will move into the tax system at a later point than he would have up to today owing to the operation of the increase in the personal allowances.  The net effect of all that for all taxpayers is to reduce the amount of tax compared to what they would otherwise have paid had the system remained the same as it was until today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I can recall what I said in the 1983 Budget Statement, which was to the effect that the tax credit system was not an immediate option in the short term.  I explained at some length this afternoon why I believed that to be the case.  I do not dispute the fact that, other things being equal, a tax credit system is a fairer way of going about taxation but, as I said this afternoon, a move to tax credits without a substantial reduction in the overall burden of the tax system would have particular effects on people in the middle income group about whom we all need to be concerned, apart from our concern for the lower income group. Without a substantial reduction in the overall burden of taxation which Deputies opposite are talking about a move straight away to a tax credit system would create a number of serious problems for people in part of the income bands.</P>

It is our intention, and I have no difficulty in reconfirming this &mdash; from time to time I heard noises from the opposite side of the House which seemed to indicate the same thing &mdash; to take the only kind of action that can bring about a reduction in the total tax burden.  Without that we will be in a position where we will not have people who are even employable under the kind of circumstances that will exist.</P>

      <P>Perhaps if I do the Deputy will strike oil.  We have not much time to dispose of the remaining Resolution. I want to explain to the House that our side will oppose this Resolution. This Resolution was introduced last year as a once off, very special, <i>ad hoc</i> measure. The explanation given at the time was that it was to deal with the special employment situation.  It has been in operation for a year and it has contributed very substantially to the burden of taxation about which this side of the House have been adverting to on so many occasions and which the Minister has also made many references to.  It is very difficult to justify, on any grounds, the continuation of this levy into 1984.  It falls very directly and very specifically on one particular sector of the tax-paying community and, as has always been pointed out, levies by their nature are inequitable.  They make no allowance whatever for the different circumstances of different taxpayers.  They naturally fall much more heavily on the lower paid than on the higher paid section of the work force.</P>
      <P>I believe that whatever justification there would be for the imposition of this very unfair, blunt instrument type of levy in a situation where the Government were setting out to achieve some particular economic or financial objectives in a budget, there can be no possible reason for maintaining it in the type of budget we have before the House today which everyone recognises as being a nonevent, a budget which has no strategy, which makes no contribution to any particular social, economic or financial objectives, which really is a compromise budget representing the lowest common denominator between these two warring factions in the Government.  In the context of that sort of budget there is no justification of any kind for the retention of this unfair, inequitable levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This side of the House on one occasion foolishly agreed not to oppose a levy introduced in the name of youth employment. We were completely misled in that <Col N="1002" /> connection because the money raised from that 1 per cent youth employment levy has been diverted into all types of Exchequer channels.  It is certainly not being used to create youth employment. Neither has the money raised by this particular levy made any contribution to any sort of employment, youth or otherwise. There can be no justification for continuing this levy on economic, financial or social grounds.  It is an unfair imposition and is an inequitable burden on one particular section of the community.  When it was introduced it was stated it would be for one year only for specific purposes and it is a complete deception of the PAYE sector to maintain it again this year.  We are opposing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister a number of questions regarding the income levy he is proposing to reintroduce. I see the Minister is proposing to exempt people earning £96 or less per week.  I take it that this £96 is the gross earnings of a person in a week as opposed to the take-home pay.  Secondly, does that £96 per week represent social welfare income?  If a person has over that amount in some benefits would that be included?  Thirdly, the self-employed exemption will apply where income for the year is less than £5,000.  I take it that that will be on the old accounts system, the Schedule B system, where they will be assessed in the ordinary way and the £5,000 will be made out in their annual accounts and on their annual accounts will be decided how much they were earning. That means in effect that the 1 per cent if it is payable will not be payable in that year but when the accounts are finally settled, which is often a year, 18 months, two years or even longer afterwards and there could be a major postponement in that area.</P>
      <P>How many people are paying this levy and how many will be paying it in the forthcoming year?  How many people will be exempted in this new exemption which the Minister is bringing in now?  In other words, how many people next year will be earning £96 or less per week?  How many will the Minister be taking out of the net?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1003" /> In conclusion, I make the point that the Minister will need an army of administrators to decide very firmly which side of the £96 per week many people fall.  At the end of the day this to an extent accounts to more fiddling around with the system.  It will cost a great deal of money to find precisely who is and who is not on that £96.  It would be far better to get rid of the whole thing and stop bringing in these arbitrary fences on one side of which people are caught and on the other side people are not caught.  The effect is that in cases like this you just push decent people into the old black economy area.  Decent people because of the pressures of trying to live today do not want to be pushed into that.  By setting up these fences of £96 here, ten years old there and so on you are encouraging people to think black economy more and more.  I would not wish that to happen but unfortunately I think it will happen.</P>
    <P>I support and admire the attempt to take low income people out of any taxation system and I see what the Minister is trying to do there, but it will not work. It is an arbitrary figure which will require a large number of people to implement it and it would be far better and cheaper to get rid of the income levy altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that but he is entitled to respond.  The figures given in his budget speech today were that the yield would be £40 million from this levy and that was in the budget arithmetic at the end of the speech, but in the explanatory notes accompanying the budget that figure goes to £74 million.  Could he explain that?  Is it a genuine mistake or does it put out all the calculations on current revenue for 1983 and 1984?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major point I wanted to make is that in the main the PAYE sector will be <Col N="1004" /> paying £328 million more income tax in 1984 than they did in 1983.  More important, the Government themselves are taking into account the fact that there will be an increase of 25,000 on unemployment and today they are exempting 15,000 people from liability for tax. Therefore, now they are expecting 40,000 fewer people to pay £328 million more income tax in 1984 over and above 1983. As the year progresses the burden of income tax will become so severe that, even though many people feel themselves lucky to have a job, they will find before this year is out that they cannot afford to have one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express my opposition to this 1 per cent levy.  It was introduced as a temporary measure last year.  There is no reference in the Minister's speech this year that this is a temporary measure any longer.  He has not promised in his speech to eliminate the levy next year or to reduce it.  We can assume that if he can get away with it and is still in Government this time next year he will attempt to increase it.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to tell me in his reply whether the 1 per cent levy last year was paid by any sector other than the PAYE sector.  We know already that certain sectors do not pay their full share of the health contribution or youth employment levy.  Will the 1 per cent levy which the PAYE sector are trapped into paying and which they cannot avoid be paid by any other section?  What proportion of those who are entitled to pay it, apart from the PAYE sector, have paid it?  What action does the Minister propose to take to ensure that others pay the 1 per cent levy along with the PAYE sector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is useful to refer once again to the <i>Programme for Government</i> under which the Coalition, the Fine Gael and Labour Parties came into power.  It is said that if you miss <i>The Irish Times</i> you miss part of the day.  If you have missed this dogeared issue which I have here you have missed part of what is going on in Government.  It is dated 13 December 1982 and it refers to property tax, heavy capital taxation and PRSI reductions. The result of the two budgets which the <Col N="1005" /> present Coalition Government have brought in to date practically deny everything they put down in black and white in their <i>Programme for Government.</i></P>

      <P>Will the Minister explain to the House what the distinction is between the public service and those not in the public service in regard to the payment of this levy and the numbers in the public service who are exempt from the payment of this levy?  In view of the fact that this revenue generally is coming in to the Government and is being extended to assist those who are unemployed, can the fact that certain members of the public service are not paying this levy continue to be justified?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The levy we are speaking of is one which applies to all incomes with the exception of certain kinds of social welfare payments. I would like to list those areas of social welfare payments that are not included in the definition for the purpose of this levy.  They are: widows' contributory and non-contributory pensions, deserted wife's benefit, deserted wife's allowance, death benefit by way of widow's pension, social assistance allowance or payment equivalent to widow's contributory pension or death benefit by way of widow's pension payable by another EEC member state.  All income apart from those categories of income fall to be considered in the base for this 1 per cent levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question was raised as to what the numbers of people involved in relation to this levy are.  Without the change which I am now proposing to make 1.138 million people would have been paying that levy during 1984-85 tax year.  This change will remove 350,000 people from the scope of application of the levy.  The levy will be removed so far as those who are earning £96 per week or less are concerned. <Col N="1006" /> In the case of employed persons that would be handled simply by the issue of an instruction to employers that the levy is not chargeable for employees who in any given week earn £96 or less.  Therefore, if in a given week an employee earns £95, the employer will not deduct the 1 per cent levy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister talking of £95 gross?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If, in a different given week in the same tax year the employee earns £100 or more, the 1 per cent levy will be deducted.  That is the simplest way to operate this measure.  We will not need the army of people that Deputy Brennan thought might be needed.</P>
      <P>So far as the self-employed are concerned, since we can assess their income only after the year when they have produced their accounts, the system we will use will be to refund the self-employed who show that they have earned less than £5,000 in that year any amount of levy for which they would have been liable and which would have been paid during the course of the year.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan raised the question of whether this will encourage people into the black economy.  The Deputy seemed to be under the impression that that would happen because in some way people would be changing the amount of income they had declared in order to be within or outside the levy.  It is not a question of a fence of that kind.  It is an objective measure of how much, for the majority of people, they would have been paid.  It is a simple question to decide whether in a given week the 1 per cent levy is payable.  I noticed that earlier Deputy Brennan was not making any point about fences when we were talking about tax bands which are just as much fences as is the kind of measure we are talking about.</P>

So far as Deputy MacSharry's <Col N="1007" /> question is concerned, the income levy, were it not to be changed, would have raised £45 million this year.  The change I am bringing about will reduce the total take from it by £5 million, bringing the figure down to £40 million.</P>

I listened to the Minister's statement and I know the difference between the £45 million and the £40 million, but I am asking him what is the difference between the £40 million now and the £74 million as in the table on page 18.</P>

      <P>I must re-confirm the situation in that regard.  So far as the levy is concerned, were we not to make the change, it would produce £45 million in 1984 while £40 million is the altered amount after making the change we propose here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa raised the question as to whether the levy was paid by any sector other than the PAYE sector.  The levy applies to all incomes, and all those who are earning an income from whatever source are liable to pay the levy from the 1984-85 tax year onwards.  The collection of all these levies will be undertaken by the Revenue Commissioners rather than by the health boards as had been the case.  There had been difficulties in relation to the collection of these levies because the health boards did not have access to the kind of information they would need to enable them to implement the levy.  For the first time the collection <Col N="1008" /> of the levy is being centralised with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell raised the question as to whether there was a distinction between employees in the public service and those in other sectors so far as the levy is concerned.  There is no distinction. This levy is payable by public sector employees just as much as it is payable by any other employees To come back to Deputy MacSharry's question relating to the table on page 17 of the explanatory document &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Medical cards are issued to persons with full eligibility for health services.  These persons are defined in section 45 (1) of the Health Act, 1970, as adult persons who are unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants, together with dependants of such persons.  The criterion for issue of a medical card is hardship in paying for general practitioner services.</P>
      <P>Up to 1 January 1984 students and other members of a family who were aged 16 years or over have had their entitlement to medical cards determined on the basis of their own means and without reference to their parents' financial circumstances. In effect, this meant that the great majority of students aged 16 years or over have been eligible for medical cards, even though many of them belonged to families in the middle or upper income groups.</P>
      <P>With effect from 1 January 1984 this situation was changed by regulations to provide that students and other persons between the ages of 16 and 25, who are dependants of their parents and whose parents are not eligible for medical cards, will not retain automatic entitlement to medical cards.  These persons will retain their eligibility for free hospital services, both in-patient and out-patient, including the services of hospital consultants.  The regulations have provided that in the event of hardship arising the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board is empowered to make available the required service without charge.  The regulations do not apply to persons who are in receipt of disabled persons maintenance allowance or to persons who are entitled to health services under EEC regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health boards are arranging to write to all persons aged between 16 years and 25 years who are holders of medical cards <Col N="776" /> informing them of the change and of the arrangements which are being made to give effect to the provisions of the regulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EileenLemass" hpid="Mrs. Lemass Mrs. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the reason an application for aid from the European Social Fund for a pilot project concerning the training of 30 school leavers which was first submitted to the European Social Fund office of his Department in November 1981 and subsequently completed in accordance with all the required criteria of the fund in May 1982, has never been transmitted to the EEC Commission in Brussels, while at the same time this pilot project has been warmly received and approved by the Department of Economic Development in Northern Ireland, the European Social Fund office in London and was indeed forwarded by them to the Commission in Brussels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The application in question was not transmitted to the European Commission because it did not comply with the requirements of the European Social Fund governing application for assistance for pilot training projects.  In particular, the applicant was unable to produce evidence of financial resources or capacity to complete the proposed project, even if Social Fund assistance were forthcoming.  This is an <Col N="800" /> essential pre-requisite before fund assistance can be considered for pilot projects as the fund normally contributes only 50 per cent of the cost.</P>
      <P>The application form which was received by my Department in May 1982 was returned to the applicant with a detailed explanation of what needed to be done in order to bring the application into compliance with fund requirements. Officials of my Department had numerous discussions with the applicant and, in order to assist her further, the Department arranged two special meetings for her in Dublin with officials from the Social Fund Directorate of the Commission who also gave her the fullest advice and assistance.  The applicant indicated that she would submit a fully completed application, including in particular evidence of financial resources, by 1 August 1982, but did not do so.</P>
      <P>I have had inquiries made concerning the question of an approach by the applicant to the Department of Economic Development in Northern Ireland.  I understand that the applicant did make such an approach but that an application on her behalf was not sent to Brussels.</P>
      <P>If the applicant can complete a valid Social Fund application in line with the requirements advised to her by officials of my Department and the Commission, I will be glad to ensure that it is given every consideration.  I should point out, however, that the rules of the Social Fund have recently been revised and that new conditions have now been introduced for pilot training schemes.  I would further point out that since my recent appointment I have personally met the applicant on two occasions, the last one in the Department, where the matters above were explained in detail.  I have undertaken to examine fully the situation and reply directly to her.</P>
