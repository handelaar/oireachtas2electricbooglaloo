      <P>By agreement, and not-withstanding anything in Standing Orders, statements in relation to the revision of the balance of payments figures will be made today subject to: (1) No member, with the exception of the Taoiseach, shall make more than one statement, (2) The statement of each speaker shall not exceed 30 minutes and (3) The concluding speaker, who shall be a member of the Government, shall be called not later than 1.50 p.m. and shall conclude not later than 2.00 p.m. at which time the Dáil shall adjourn.</P>

      <P>The difficulties we have had in trying to organise the business are common knowledge.  The Order of Business as proposed is not agreed in so far as we do not accept we are not entitled to move our no confidence motion.  In the event of our not being allowed move that motion, today's business collapses.  On such an important issue, with so many Members in the House and from the point of view also of the public, it would be ridiculous not to have the matter debated.  We were promised such a debate by the Taoiseach on the Order of Business on Tuesday last.  He said then that a debate would take place today. That is on the official record.  He did not say there would be a series of statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2650" /> As you have ruled several times, it is set out clearly in Standing Orders that there can be no debate on a statement. What is proposed for today is totally against precedent.  In June 1982 and in November of that year also the Taoiseach who was then Leader of the Oppostion raised the question of the confidence motion and quoted from the Constitution and from Standing Orders to illustrate that he was right.  The present Leader of the Opposition who was then Taoiseach agreed to what was proposed on both occasions.  In all other cases, too, the Chair allowed debates to proceed and confidence motions to be taken.  We asked you yesterday to consider this matter but you refused.  Before we embark on a series of statements I would ask you to reconsider the position and to allow our motion of no confidence to be moved and debated.</P>

      <P>As I explained yesterday to the Leader of the Opposition, both in the House and in correspondence, I am satisfied beyond doubt that the Chair has no control over the ordering of business.  There are two Standing Orders dealing with that.  I think it is Standing Order 25 which sets out that the Taoiseach shall, at the beginning of public business, read the Order of Business for the day.  I do not wish to enter into controversy with Deputy Ahern or with any other Deputy about what happened in the past but it is clear that, whatever else the Chair may have done, the Chair did not order business or exercise control as to what would be taken or what would be given precedence except in accordance with Standing Orders.  I am sorry that I cannot help the Members of the House by having something put on the Order Paper for discussion.</P>

You are creating the precedent that, if the Taoiseach of the day decides that a motion of no confidence cannot be debated, that decision stands.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I wish to put one or two points to you about this matter.  As you know, I wrote to you yesterday evening and you very courteously replied to me almost immediately. In my letter to you, Sir, I pointed out that the overwhelming burden of precedent is that motions of no confidence have been given priority in the past.  I want to submit to you that the Opposition, rightly or wrongly &mdash; but I think interpreting the wishes of many people in this country &mdash; wish to voice their censure of the Minister for Finance in this matter.  I want to suggest to you that it is subverting the proceedings of this House that we are not allowed to do that and the process of a series of statements without a vote cannot possibly be an adequate way for the Opposition to express their disapproval and censure of the actions of a Minister.  I want you, please, to consider that point carefully. Also, the long history of precedents of Governments immediately responding and providing Government time for motions of no confidence.  In my view, what is happening here is that this Government, having falsified the national accounts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Order, please. I want to quote Standing Order No. 25 which states:</P>
      <P>Every sitting of the Dáil shall be governed by a printed Order Paper which shall be prepared under the direction of the Ceann Comhairle.  The Taoiseach shall have the right to determine the order in which Government business shall appear on the Order Paper and, by announcement at the commencement of public business, the order in which it shall be taken. </P>
      <P>In regard to precedent, when the Chair quotes precedents he does so only when they relate to the exercise of his powers and functions.  It would not be for the Chair to quote precedents in relation to other matters.  That is clear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one further submission. It is that during the course of the discussions which have arisen on this matter so far, the Taoiseach in the view of all of us on this side of the House gave the very clear and distinct impression that the House was being called today for purposes of debating our motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of what was said would certainly come to that conclusion. <Col N="2653" /> Also, Sir, as I have pointed out, all the journalists present were under the same impression because they faithfully recorded in their respective newspapers that the House would meet today to debate a Fianna Fáil no confidence motion.</P>

      <P>I suggest to you that you have an obligation in this matter to see that the time-honoured procedures of this House are adhered to and that this Government are not allowed to run away from their responsibilities or to subvert and undermine the well-established procedures of this House and are obliged to deal fairly with the Opposition on a matter of primary importance of this kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I must make my position perfectly clear and I must resist the implication in what the Leader of the Opposition has just said.  He implied that I am not dealing fairly with the Opposition. In its nakedness, that is what the Leader of the Opposition has said.  I have no control over the matters raised by the Leader of the Opposition.  I have no control as to when his vote of no confidence in the Minister for Finance may be taken and at the risk of going a little further than I should go, perhaps the Leader of the Opposition is thinking about a form of vote of no confidence other than a vote of no confidence in an individual.  I have no control over the ordering of business of any description and I feel that the Leader of the Opposition should appreciate that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is of any help to you, we should be very happy to interpret our motion as a vote of no confidence in the Government.  I do not think we can go much further in expressing no confidence in a Government than by expressing no confidence in the primary, principal Minister of that Government outside the Taoiseach, namely the Minister for Finance.  I think, Sir, it is, with due respect, somewhat of a quibble to suggest <Col N="2654" /> that we are not seeking a motion of no confidence in the conduct of its business by this Government, which, in fact, we are.</P>
      <P>Our motion of no confidence in the Minister for Finance is on the Order Paper.  I presume that the procedures today will not affect that matter and that that motion could be taken next week in Private Member's Time, if necessary.</P>

      <P>Finally, even though our motion is the equivalent of a motion of no confidence in the Government expressed as no confidence in the Minister for Finance, the Government, flying in the face of all precedents, are refusing to give us priority for such a motion.  Is that the position that this Government are adopting?</P>

    <Title>Balance of Payments: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to explain for this House and for the country the facts of the revisions to the balance of payment figures for the years from 1979 to 1983 <Col N="2656" /> announced by the Central Statistics Office last Monday as they have been given to me by the Central Statistics Office, the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>I do so to put on record that, first, there is no &ldquo;missing&rdquo; £500 million; secondly, a flow of money from this country which was thought in 1981-82 to be capital has now been identified using aggregate exchange control information as (1) repatriated profits and royalties; (2) payments to international consultants; (3) trade with Northern Ireland; and there remains a still unidentified amount, equal to about one quarter of the original unidentified total, a residual which is at a level normal even for countries such as the UK and the USA with much more highly developed statistical sources than Ireland.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear that the practice of estimating the balance of payments did not change, until this week, under any Government and no Government sought to interfere in the CSO carrying out revisions. I want to record in the House that the Government have established an independent statistical council to advise them on how to strengthen and improve the process of compiling accurate statistics. The new information now available does not alter our economic situation and prospects except to the extent that the worrying possibility that capital was being taken abroad has been excluded. Further, the substantial improvement in the balance of payments position since 1981 has been confirmed, thereby showing the balance of budgetary policy was right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have been confirmed in their existing determination to increase the number of firms locating all corporate functions here, especially R &amp; D and marketing, and to improve the supply of Irish goods and services to foreign firms in Ireland.  Finally, the Government wish to underline the success of foreign firms in this country and to emphasise that there will be no departure from the continuity of industrial policy towards such firms, in particular the Government will <Col N="2657" /> not attempt in any way to restrict these companies from repatriating profits.</P>
    <P>Having set out the principal points I want to make, I will return now to state briefly the background to the estimation of the balance of payment statistics. Available data on the different types of current payments between Ireland and the rest of the world &mdash; merchandise trade, tourism and other services, is collected from a variety of sources and aggregated to obtain the best estimate of gross current outflows and gross current inflows.  The difference between these two is the estimated current account deficit. So far as capital flows, such as foreign borrowing and lending, and international banking transactions, are concerned, available data is also collected under various headings.</P>
    <P>The true current account deficit, if there is one, must, of course, equal the true capital account surplus, but exact data for many of the components is never available in any country, so there is always a residual balancing item in any balance of payments statement.  In the Irish balance of payments it has been the practice throughout the decades to incorporate this residual balancing item in the item entitled Other Private Capital.  This is known to everyone familiar with our balance of payments data, and no proposal has ever been made by any Government that it should be treated otherwise.</P>
    <P>What has now happened is quite simply that more accurate information on certain current items, most notably the repatriation of royalties and profits abroad by certain multinational firms here, has become available.  At the same time, some provision has been made for the estimated amount of payments to international consultants and of imports smuggled into the country from Northern Ireland.  This has meant that the unidentified residual item on the capital side has now been reduced.  Moreover, the CSO have taken the decision to show this residual henceforth specifically as a separate item, instead of incorporating it, as was traditionally the case, with other private capital transactions.</P>
    <P>In the last couple of years, as a result of the successful work of the IDA, there <Col N="2658" /> has been a very large increase in the outflow of profits and royalties from this country, possibly because of a combination of an inflow of new high-technology firms which have very high profit margins, and also partly perhaps because, during the period of the recession, foreign firms had less opportunities for profitable investment in this country.</P>
    <P>From several points of view this revision to the figures is encouraging.  The scale of the apparent outflow of capital, that has been suggested by the rapidly growing size of the residual item contained under the heading Other Private Capital in the unrevised balance of payments figures, had been a cause of some concern, as well as puzzlement.  Concern, because an outflow of capital of this magnitude could be represented as indicating some lack of confidence in our economy, puzzlement because especially since this Government took office, there have been no grounds for such a lack of confidence.</P>
    <P>The fact that this figure has now been greatly reduced to a level that will give no cause for concern, and that the scale of profits being achieved by new firms attracted here by the IDA is greater than had been thought, must be seen as encouraging factors, which should help to create an even more favourable climate for the attraction of new industrial investment in this country.  It is indeed with a certain sense of relief that anyone concerned with the economic health of this country will have observed this rectification in the balance of payment figures, involving the substitution of a more realistic and higher profit figure for the level of apparent capital outflow which had previously been included.</P>
    <P>That this should be represented by the Opposition in the kind of adverse light in which they have attempted to portray it, is a measure either of their lack of understanding of these basic realities, or more probably, of their determination to twist any material at their disposal for party political purposes, regardless of any consideration of the national interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Following some years of informal consultation, and an attempt to obtain a clearer picture of the residual item Other Private Capital which, as I have just mentioned, was large and growing, an expert group was set up in September 1982.  This group comprised representatives of the CSO, which by tradition operates free of any political control and influence, the Central Bank and the Department of Finance and was set up to review the data sources, methodology and presentation of the balance of payments statistics.</P>
      <P>This group of officials were concerned with what were at first regarded as relatively technical issues relating to the capital account.  At this stage, there was no indication that extensive revisions to the current account of the balance of payments would be the outcome of the group's study.</P>
      <P>During 1983 CSO and this group considered how the new indicators emerging from the exchange control administration could be used in estimating the balance of payments.  Some information from this source had already been available, but as the data were compiled for control rather than statistical purposes, it was necessary to establish a procedure for cross-checking information from exchange control returns against the traditional CSO data sources.</P>
      <P>This process which took place during 1983 and in the first months of 1984 established the reliability of the exchange control data.  It became clear then that revisions would have to be made to the existing balance of payments figures. Reference to the review and to the likelihood of revisions was made in Economic Background to the Budget 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The necessary revisions were confirmed and agreed by the experts earlier this month.  Essentially these revisions set out for 1983 newly identified items which reduce the residual which on the earlier basis would have emerged for 1983.  The revisions show, for 1983, the following <Col N="2660" /> significant changes as well as other minor offsetting ones:</P>
    <P> (1)  repatriation of royalties and profits of some £700 million by highly profitable multinational firms and not £200 million as previously believed;</P>
    <P>(2)  increased payments abroad for services such as international consultants of some £150 million partly offset by similar increased inflows;</P>
    <P>(3)  imports smuggled from Northern Ireland of some £75 million;</P>
    <P>(4)  a still unidentified residual item of just under £300 million, which at 2 per cent of our total exports and imports is lower than the figures of over 9 per cent reached in the US and over 3 per cent in the UK in the period 1979-83 covered by the revisions published by the CSO this week.  </P>
    <P>It should be added that, contrary to some suggestions that have been made, the publication of these revised figures does not derive from the discovery of undisclosed profits, details of which had been concealed from the Revenue Commissioners.  On the contrary, the whole of the revision in respect of profits, consultants' fees etc. derives from the data available to the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Bank by way of returns made by companies&mdash;data which had not previously been fully utilised for the purpose of making these balance of payments calculations.  The only new figure relating to transactions not disclosed in the normal way is the estimate of £75 million for goods smuggled from Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the House that the revisions which have been announced bring the accuracy and reliability of our balance of payments to a very high order.  The availability of, and the use now being made of, the new source of information in exchange control returns ensures that a repetition of the errors which had crept in is not likely.  In the course of the review of balance of payment statistics which has been carried out several other methodological refinements have also been introduced, apart from the use of exchange control data, <Col N="2661" /> and I believe that we can be satisfied with the resulting information, subject always to the necessarily conjectural character of the magnitude of net effect of cross-Border smuggling which must be subject to further revision if and when additional data comes to hand that could provide a basis for such a revision.</P>
    <P>I have requested that the revisions be carried back in time to the beginning of the seventies so that a correct historical picture of the evolution of the balance of payments will be available to assist in our understanding of the economy, an understanding of which is essential for policy making.  I myself have for over 30 years recognised the fundamental importance of our economic and financial statistics. I have, for some time past been reflecting on the need, as I see it, to provide the CSO with additional backing and assistance in a manner that would not merely ensure, but, if possible, even strengthen their independent role, which is so vital to their task.  I have accordingly decided that it would be timely now to implement the provision of the 1926 Statistics Act for the establishment of a Statistical Council, and the Government have, as announced last night, agreed with my proposal, of which I gave informal notice in advance to the Leader of the Opposition some days ago.</P>
    <P>The members of this council are all persons of academic distinction and particular expertise in the various areas relevent to the work of the CSO.  I will be asking them for advice on how improvement can be achieved in the reliability, timeliness and accessibility of statistical information concerning the economy and society generally.  In particular, I will ask the council for their advice on how best to arrange for the co-ordination of diverse sources of statistical information within the public service and how necessary statistics can be obtained without placing an undue burden on businesses in completing statistical returns.</P>
    <P>To correct any possible understanding about the purpose of the council, I should like to state that it is not, as one paper today suggested, a committee of inquiry into the balance of payments revisions. <Col N="2662" /> This is not and was never intended to be their function.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to some of the policy issues which arise as a result of these major revisions.  The Minister for Finance will elaborate in more detail on these points in his contribution to the debate, but I want to highlight a few key issues right away.</P>
    <P>First, on industrial policy, I think it is clear that the new figures throw light on the changing structure of Irish industry in a way that had not been fully anticipated. We now see how highly profitable the high technology companies and companies producing sophisticated products established in recent years actually are. These companies are in many cases providing job opportunities of a high skill level to Irish workers, and their benefit to the country does not depend on their reinvesting profits earned here.  Of course, as the Telesis Report advised us, it would be even better if we could induce the headquarters operations of such firms and their research and development divisions to locate here, and if we could achieve higher levels of supply from Irish firms to them, and I know that the industrial promotion agencies have that as one of their prime objectives.</P>
    <P>One thing we should be quite clear about is that there is no question of the Government reacting to the increased estimate of profit repatriation by reviewing the tax concessions which have been guaranteed until the years 1990 and 2000, nor is there any question of impeding the repatriation of profits and royalties by these firms, although we will of course remain concerned to ensure that conditions are favourable to the retention of the maximum possible value added within the economy.  We will continue to seek ways of encouraging firms to locate new plants in Ireland, both existing firms and newcomers from abroad.</P>
    <P>We will, moreover, have to treat with particular caution indicators of industrial success such as productivity growth rates and expansion of export sales abroad, disaggregating them to take into account the degree to which movements in these measures are attributable to the profit <Col N="2663" /> component in the case of foreign-owned companies.</P>
    <P>We will continue to have the attraction of foreign firms as a major plank in our industrial policy while stressing the importance of the need to develop strong indigenous companies.</P>
    <P>Certain issues arise also in connection with incomes policy.  Some may feel that in certain sectors and firms where wage costs form a small portion of value added, and large profits are being earned and repatriated, employers can afford a high wage settlement.  But there are two problems here.  First, as the Government have already remarked in their background paper on employment of some weeks ago, such settlements in high profit companies may set headlines for industries where many firms are on the margins of solvency, and would undoubtedly lead to job losses in the weaker sectors.  Furthermore, even if these firms are earning high profits, their choice is often not between earning high profits and earning lower profits but between earning high profits here and earning high profits in some other country.  High wage settlements in such companies may simply cause them to move away, and would certainly seriously reduce the attraction of Ireland for prospective new firms choosing a location.</P>
    <P>Turning finally to the Government's broad economic strategy, I would like to stress that the new figures in no way alter the fact that our policies have been dramatically successful in reducing the balance of payments deficit.</P>

      <P>Unpalatable though it may be to the Leader of the Opposition, the new figures show a current external deficit for 1981 &mdash; the last year of Fianna Fáil's disastrous term of office &mdash; that was £200 million higher than was previously shown.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That means the country was left in even worse shape than we thought at the time.  In order to keep the external reserves at an adequate level, we had to borrow more abroad than would have been expected for that level of current account deficit.  This was then interpreted as being due to an outflow of investment funds by Irish residents.  As it now transpires, an under-recording of royalties and profit repatriation, rather than large capital outflows, was the cause.</P>
      <P>In short, the Fianna Fáil Government's reckless policies had left us with an even larger current account balance of international payments deficit than we knew at the time, namely, 15½ per cent of GNP as we now know rather than 13½ per cent. The need for the restrictive policies which we then initiated was greater even than we then realised.  Since then our corrective policies have been strikingly effective in bringing down this deficit, from 15½ per cent of GNP in 1981 to 11 per cent in 1982 and to 6½ per cent in 1983.</P>
      <P>The success of our policy in reducing the balance of payments deficit is, therefore, confirmed by the new figures.  The Opposition's suggestions to the contrary are malicious, untrue and damaging to the national interest.</P>

Of course, the policies of the Fianna Fáil Government which introduced those budgets are subject to the most fundamental questioning and are now seen by the entire country to have been disastrous&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The best example, I suppose, is our description of the period of the Second World War as the &ldquo;Emergency&rdquo;.  I think, however, that this Government and this Minister for Finance have added a new euphemism to the list when he called the more than doubling of the balance of payments deficit in 1983 &ldquo;revisions.&rdquo; Incidentally, are Deputies opposite not going to stay and take their medicine? Are they all running away as usual?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>These &ldquo;revisions&rdquo; are a disclosure of the greatest single blunder in the management of the finances of this State.  It is not just that a wrong figure was published.  What has happened is that the very basis of the annual budget was false and the consequences arising from this basic mistake are unprecedented.</P>
      <P>The size of the balance of payments deficit is a key element in determining budget strategy.  Very often the entire budget strategy is decided by the size of the balance of payments deficit.  If this key element, as has happened on this occasion, has been miscalculated, then the whole strategy of the budget becomes meaningless.  That is the reality which not just this Government but the country must face.</P>
      <P>The size of the balance of payments deficit also affects the figure for GNP. This Government have taken to using GNP percentages as their measuring rod for economic and financial policy.  If the measurement of GNP has been seriously miscalculated because the wrong figure was entered for the balance of payments deficit, then all their calculations become equally useless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the balance of payments deficit and its importance with regard to budgetary policy, let me remind the House of one famous occasion in 1956.  Because the balance of payments deficit disclosed a particular situation, the then Coalition &mdash; I recall Dr. Whitaker was the new Secretary of the Department of Finance &mdash; brought in special import <Col N="2670" /> levies which caused absolute and total disaster to the economy.  Those special levies were brought in because a certain balance of payments deficit had been disclosed. The Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance or any other person should not try to tell us that the balance of payments deficit is not one of the principal features in the formation of budgetary strategy.</P>
    <P>This Government and this Minister for Finance set financial rectitude and the balancing of the books as the principal objective of their economic and fiscal policy. Everything else was subordinate to that precious objective.  It now appears they cannot even get the sums right.  They have made a blunder in their basic calculations of monumental and disastrous proportions and no amount of waffling by the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance can disguise that fact from the nation.</P>
    <P>This Minister for Finance has caused a great deal of frustration and impatience on all sides of the House by the manner in which he has dealt with the various items of business for which he is responsible in this House.  We have all had to endure the experience of having convincing arguments met by a completely wooden response; a refusal to listen; a boring repetition of the official brief.  He has established for himself a reputation as the complete technocrat, someone on whom the Department of Finance could depend totally never to depart one syllable from their neatly prepared briefs. There were some who were even prepared to see him as a competent technocrat and gave him credit for that.  He has now, however, demonstrated that while technocrat he may be, competent he is not.  He has got the figures wrong to the point of absurdity.  His budget is a nonsense. The whole economic and financial outlook has been thrown into doubt and uncertainty.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach must now dispense with the services of this discredited Minister and arrange that a new Minister for Finance will bring in a recast set of figures which will reflect the reality of the situation. This mistake is too big and too serious for this Minister ever again to put forward any financial measure, least of <Col N="2671" /> all a budget with any semblance of credibility.</P>
    <P>Lest there be any doubt about the claims made by the Minister for Finance in regard to the size of the balance of payments deficit for 1983, let me quote from his 1984 budget statement.</P>
    <P>While inflation has come down significantly and the balance of payments problem has been greatly alleviated, consumption has declined, investment has fallen, unemployment has risen, and growth has been stifled.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on in his description of the economic situation to claim that in 1983.</P>
    <P>the balance of payments deficit was reduced from over 8½ per cent of GNP in 1982 to about 2½ per cent in 1983.</P>
    <P>This was one of the pillars on which the so-called &lsquo;neutral&rsquo; budget strategy was based.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is now claiming credit on the basis of a new set of figures and a new set of percentages.  Has there ever been such audacity in the economic history of the country?  On 2 February 1984 in a speech in Cork the Minister for Finance said:</P>
    <P>It is only by sound management of the nation's finances that the basis for sustainable and adequate growth in the economy can be firmly established. Our policies are clearly working in that direction.  They have succeeded dramatically in reducing the deficit for our balance of payments from 13 per cent of our national output in 1981 to less than 3 per cent in 1983.</P>
    <P>That is the figure the Minister is using to claim a dramatic reduction in the balance of payments.  The Minister for Finance went on to say:</P>
    <P>In this way, we have considerably eased the external constraint on the domestic economy.</P>
    <P>This is all based on the dramatic reduction to 3 per cent which is not there any more.  The Government and the Minister misled the country by bringing in a bogus <Col N="2672" /> budget on the basis of those figures.  Now the very foundation of the Government's budget strategy has collapsed, everybody in the country knows it and they should now admit it.  The achievement claimed has turned out to be non-existent.  The balance of payments is not £340 million or 2½ per cent of GNP, but £863 million and 6½ per cent of GNP.  There was a miscalculation of at least £500 million. Those figures will not go away and they are catastrophic from the point of view of the Government.</P>
    <P>As soon as Dr. Antoin Murphy did his brilliant piece of research we in Fianna Fáil realised the significance of his thesis. I raised the issue in the Dáil in my speech on the budget and Deputy Michael O'Kennedy also raised it.  I said:</P>
    <P>The latest figures published by the Central Bank make it clear that the out-flow of money from this country in 1983 reached alarming proportions. Dr. Antoin Murphy dealt with this phenomenon in a very interesting article in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> last Sunday. In 1983 there were unrecorded outflows of £837 million.  There are two possible explanations for this, both of which are likely to be true in some measure.  The first is that the balance of payments deficit is considerably higher than official figures would suggest. </P>

      <P>It is Volume 347, No. 7, column 1422.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If account is taken of cross-Border smuggling and other unrecorded transactions, then the balance of payments deficit last year is most certainly higher than the official figure, for which the Government like to take credit, and could be of the order of £500 million, £600 million, £700 million or more. The other explanation, if most of the £837 million is on the capital side, is that investors do not have confidence in the way that the economy is being run by this Government.  If they did <Col N="2673" /> not have confidence last year they will have even less confidence after the Minister's budget and &ldquo;bond-washing&rdquo; debacle.  Whether we have a much larger balance of payments deficit than the Government have claimed or whether we have a loss of investor confidence, there is a situation that is a cause for concern and one which the Minister for Finance must deal with when he is replying to this debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance did not pay any attention at that time and I now want to ask why.  Were the Government unaware of the problem?  No Government have had so many economists inside and outside the Cabinet to advise them, yet no Government have got their sums so wrong so often.  It is hardly credible that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance were unaware of the true situation and there must be strong suspicion that they deliberately withheld information from the public to conceal the full extent of their mismanagement of the economy in 1983.  There is, in fact, some evidence pointing clearly in that direction. It should now be recalled that on page 8 of the <i>Economic Background to the Budget,</i> the document published before the budget, it is stated:</P>
    <P>The coverage of the statistics for the international balance of payments is being reviewed and the results, which may be available later this year, could require the Estimates of the current account deficit for recent years to be revised.  However, the revisions are unlikely to alter significantly the improvement in the trend in the period under review.</P>
    <P>In Dr. Murphy's famous black hole article in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> and in subsequent discussion, the question was raised whether the gap was on the current or the capital side.  But the Government knew before the budget that it was on the current side.  If they knew that they must also have had some idea of the extent of the discrepancy when they were bringing in their budget.  There must be a very deep suspicion that they did.  I consider this withholding of vital information and <Col N="2674" /> basing his budget on information he must have known to be incorrect, constitutes valid grounds for demanding the resignation of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>What are we to make of the article in yesterday's <i>Irish Independent</i> by a special adviser to the Taoiseach, Dr. Honohan. He talks about the identifying of the source of the black hole coming as a relief.  He says &ldquo;so there is a lot to be cheerful about in the new figures&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>An economic adviser who welcomes the disclosure that our balance of payments deficit is £500 million worse than they thought it was should be locked safely away somewhere far from Government Buildings.  I wonder did they have a little party in the Department of the Taoiseach when this good news broke and if they called in the handlers, Heneghan, Jennings and Prendergast and did they perhaps open a bottle of champagne when they discovered the good news that the country was £500 million worse off than they thought it was.  It is a strange way of doing Government business.  Having read the article by Dr. Honohan, if his advice is being taken by the Taoiseach on budgetary and financial matters it goes a long way to explain why our economy is in its present mess. Dr. Honohan also dishonestly tried to suggest that the Government were relieved to discover &mdash; and the Taoiseach is coming out with the same claptrap here today&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If these same economists are going to be trotted out on occasions like this they have to take what is coming to them.  In my view this man has dishonestly attempted to suggest that the Government were relieved to discover that the mistake was on the current side and not on the capital side.  But the Government indicated at budget time that they knew that any discrepancy that existed was on the current side.  This incredible blunder &mdash; while the biggest and most clearly identifiable one in the history of the State &mdash; is one only of a chapter of mistakes in the handling of our finances by this Minister.</P>
      <P>At budget time we had the bond washing episode which brought the Stock Exchange to a halt and shook financial confidence at that time.  The effects of that piece of mishandling of a major change can be seen in the latest Central Bank Report.  I should like Deputies to study this carefully.  These figures now published by the Central Bank show an unprecedented level of foreign borrowing in the first three months of 1984. Between January and March of this year the Government borrowed £677 million abroad, or 85 per cent of the total level of foreign borrowing in 1983.  That unprecedented level of foreign borrowing was the direct consequence of the Minister's action and his subsequent inability to raise funds on the domestic market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the principal objectives of his budgetary strategy announced was to reduce foreign borrowing. Yet, by his own action, he forced <Col N="2676" /> himself to do more foreign borrowing than ever before.</P>
      <P>In this year's budget this Minister brought in another of his unfortunate proposals, to remove section 84 relief from agriculture.  When it was quickly proved that the effects on our agricultural co-operatives would be disastrous he backed down and abolished that proposal.</P>
      <P>The Minister has also to his credit one of the most farcical taxes in western Europe.  It was he who introduced the absurd residential property tax which raised a mere £1 million in 1983 and probably at the end of the day results in a net loss to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>This Government's pretence at pursuing policies of financial rectitude has now been finally demolished.  In June 1981, when the Taoiseach sought to frighten the nation over the state of the public finances&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1983 the national debt increased by a record £3 billion.  The target of eliminating the current budget deficit by 1987 has obviously been abandoned. Indeed the deficit has now gone into four figures for the first time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we have the fiasco of the National <Col N="2677" /> Plan.  Last December, in the Adjournment debate, the Taoiseach promised &ldquo;a realistic medium term plan&rdquo; in preparation by the independent National Planning Board &mdash; and I quote again &mdash; which would &ldquo;provide the basis for rallying all groups in the country&rdquo;.  All the board produced was a list of do-gooder proposals. While the Government have a mountain of reports they have no economic policy, no industrial policy.  Eighteen months into office they are still unable to formulate a National Economic Plan, something Fianna Fáil were able to do in six months in 1982.  Despite what the Taoiseach says the Minister for Finance must bear the responsibility, because he is Minister in charge of economic planning. He has not been able to produce any worthwhile economic policy proposals to deal with any of our economic problems.  Nor is he prepared to set himself targets by which his performance could be measured.  As Dr. Murphy said in the <i>Evening Press</i> on 28 May &mdash; Government economic strategy is currently &ldquo;leading nowhere&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The two budgets of the present Minister for Finance have been unmitigated disasters from different points of view.  I was interested to see the comments of the Governor of the Central Bank on the 1984 budget contained in their latest quarterly bulletin.  There he stated: &ldquo;If pressed for a view&rdquo;&mdash; and I do not see why he should not be pressed for a view &mdash;&ldquo;I would have to express dismay regarding the adequacy of its contribution to reducing the imbalance in the public finances and the manner of that contribution&rdquo;.  All the budget did was to increase somewhat the real level of taxation. One direct result of this taxation policy has been to lay waste commercial life along a strip of at least 30 miles wide along the Border.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This Minister has had no regard to the impact of his measures in that area.  He has at various times spoken of the need to cut current Government expenditure.  However, he <Col N="2678" /> has completely failed to do this.  Instead he has increased indirect taxation to the point where it is the highest in Europe and direct taxation to a level which acts as a total disincentive to work and effort. He has also cut investment, which has reduced employment in the construction industry by a third.</P>
      <P>The rapid reduction in inflation promised has not materialised.  Between November 1981 and November 1982 Fianna Fáil reduced inflation by 11 per centage points from 23.3 per cent to 12.3 per cent.  Despite misleading claims by the Taoiseach that he could reduce inflation rapidly in 1983 to single figures it is still above 10 per cent 18 months later.</P>
      <P>The Irish economy is in its worst shape for 30 years.  Unemployment is at the unprecedented level of 213,000 with the trend still upwards and with no prospects of jobs for our young people under present policies.  Investment is at its lowest level for 15 years.  The burden of taxation has never been so heavy and is crushing enterprise.  Living standards have fallen sharply and thousands of families in this State are struggling to make ends meet. The Minister for Finance must bear a heavy share of responsibility for this situation.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael/Labour programme for Government is a long list of blunders and broken promises.  The Labour Party can now be seen to have been bought and sold for a worthless piece of paper.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2679" /> This Minister for Finance has chalked up an alarming number of mistakes and blunders, culminating in this major blunder which has destroyed the credibility of his 1984 budget.  His policies have been disastrous in their impact.  When the country cried out for some positive action to combat unemployment he brought in a neutral budget.  He has not the capacity to handle the most important brief in the Government at this time of difficulty and recession.  We cannot afford to wait for his next devastating blow to the public finances and the economy.  We cannot expect any improvement in the employment situation, any alleviation in the burden of taxation, any relief from the hardship and deprivation being inflicted on social welfare recipients, any restoration in funds for education or health, as long as this Minister remains in office blundering on, as he has been doing.  It is time he went.</P>
    <P>In conclusion may I deal with one matter which the Taoiseach mentioned, that is his proposal to set up a new committee or council to deal with the preparation of statistics?  The Taoiseach wrote to me about that matter but, in his letter, he indicated to me that he would propose to announce this new council at the opening of a statistical seminar which had been organised for Tuesday, 5 June.  This council has now been announced, apparently in advance of what the Taoiseach told me would happen.  However, I am not prepared to make an issue of that.</P>

Up to now, whatever the situation has been, we could always have confidence in the fact that the Central Statistics Office was totally non-political in their operations. In fact I was often frustrated to be told that I could not know one hour in advance what the latest unemployment figures would be emanating from the Central Statistics Office.  They had to be announced in accordance with procedure and with absolute adherence to rectitude by that institution.  I do not think this is a desirable proposal.  There is certainly a suggestion here that the Central Statistics Office is to come under political control.</P>

There is one piece of nonsense which he maintains right through the whole speech.  He is relieved because it has been found that this missing £500 million was not on the capital side.  Is there any great difference between profits which, in the normal course of events, would be used for re-investment, and capital?  Are they <Col N="2682" /> not both the same thing?

It means that our balance of payments deficit, one of the key significant things in our whole economic planning and strategy, is worse than we thought it was.  On one occasion we brought in a whole series of special import levies because of the level of the balance of payments deficit disclosed.  It is a key factor.  If it is £500 million worse than we thought it was, if it is not £300 million but £800 million, surely you cannot in all honesty maintain in this House that the information now available does not alter our economic situation and prospects.

      <P>The Minister should stick to his finance brief.  I want to conclude by saying this is a major blunder, the greatest single blunder ever committed in the financial management of our affairs since the State was founded.  It throws into doubt and uncertainty the entire budgetary process and strategy undertaken by the Minister for Finance. It means that we will have to bring in, if not a new budget, at least re-cast figures so that the country will know exactly where it stands.  The 1984 budget no longer has any credibility.  A Minister for Finance who made such a major mistake in economic and financial planning does <Col N="2683" /> not deserve the confidence of this House and should in all honour resign today.</P>

      <P>The debate so far has been concerned with the question of who is most to blame for not recognising the extent of what has now become known as the black hole.  It is fairly common knowledge that the so-called black hole has existed for some considerable time.  What is astonishing is the extent of the repatriation of profits and the export of capital by various companies and individuals from this State.  The fact that the extent of that export of profits is only now being quantified in any realistic way is a damning indictment not only of this Government but of previous Governments who were in power while this was going on.</P>
      <P>It has to be said also that the profits which are being exported are estimated at £500 million, and I stress that it is still only an estimate.  So far as we can ascertain there is no clear picture yet.  The Taoiseach indicated that there is still something like £300 million which they cannot earmark, or say from where it is coming and to where it is going.  This Government and previous Governments were responsible for allowing the export of that kind of wealth which was created by the efforts of the working class, at a time when we have massive unemployment, when we are told workers must take real cuts in their take-home pay, when education cuts and health cuts are rampant, and when we are told it is not possible to reduce or spread more equitably the tax and PRSI burdens which the PAYE sector carry almost alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This aspect of the debate has to be highlighted.  It is all very fine for the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party to accuse the Government of a massive blunder. There is no doubt that blundering is involved, but he must accept his share of the responsibility for previous administrations. There is also some sleight of hand involved.  This Government and previous Governments embarked on a policy of inviting foreign multi-nationals to come here.  The sales pitch of the IDA in the USA is that multi-nationals establishing here can make up to twice the <Col N="2684" /> profits they could make in any other EEC country and, in some instances, they can make up to three times the profits they could make in some EEC countries.  The sales pitch also includes references to the fact that they can repatriate 100 per cent of the profits made.</P>
    <P>It is not realistic or acceptable for people in this House who have been involved in promoting that kind of policy to throw up their hands in horror when they discover that the multi-nationals are doing precisely what they were told they could do.  It has to be brought home that there is a need not only to establish an adequate system of having correct statistics about what is going on in our economy but that some attempt has to be made to ensure that the wealth created here is invested here.  I find it astonishing that the Taoiseach in his statement this morning said:</P>
    <P>nor is there any question of impeding the repartriation of profits and royalties by these firms, although we will of course remain concerned to ensure that conditions are favourable to the retention of the maximum possible value added within the economy.</P>
    <P>That is quite unsatisfactory given the state of the economy at present, the level of our unemployment and the levels of taxation borne by the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>It is clear that if the Government persist in their present policy &mdash; previous Governments have done so &mdash; of inviting foreign companies here to establish jobs a price has to be paid.  Foreign firms have created in this State in the region of 84,000 jobs but they did that because of the offers by this Government, and previous administrations, of double profits and 100 per cent repatriation of those profits.  They did not do it, as is being suggested in relation to other matters, because they particularly liked us.  They did so because the climate was right for the amassing of very large degrees of wealth.  What we are concerned about is not that they are being offered the opportunity to make this wealth but that they are being allowed to strip the wealth being created here and take it outside to <Col N="2685" /> be invested, presumably, in other economies. The attitude of the Taoiseach in saying that it is not proposed to do anything to stop that process is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>The Telesis Report states that we are paying a higher price than is necessary to induce these companies here.  That report suggested that there should be greater concentration and encouragement of the development of indigenous industries. However, the history of native capital here has shown that they have neither the capacity nor the will to engage in any type of large scale industrial development. The history of industrial development here has shown that the only part of our native industry that has the capacity, the will or the expertise to develop large scale industry is the State sector.  I would argue that the necessity for the Government is to alter their industrial strategy in favour of greater State involvement in the development of the high technology area.  It is clear from the figures being quoted in relation to the repatriation of profits that there is a huge wealth creating potential in that area.  It is a crime that the expertise and capacity within our State companies, and the capacity to establish new State companies, is not being used to harness that wealth creation for the people.  The main point I wish to make is that people outside the House are not so much concerned about whether statistical errors have been made or whether the Taoiseach, or Deputy Haughey, is more to blame for the errors which have been made, but with the steps that will be taken to ensure that the virtual haemorrhage of wealth out of the country is stopped and put to use for the development of industry here, the provision of jobs and the more equitable sharing of the taxation burden.</P>

      <P>I must say that I was a bit surprised and more than a little saddened to see the way the Opposition took the question of these statements today.  What has happened is that the Opposition have indulged in a certain amount of name calling which possibly reflects the frustration <Col N="2686" /> they feel.  I do not accept and have never accepted, that we should follow the type of economic policy line they have put forward.  They have resorted to this old tired tactic which is a very transparent one and one which does not do them any credit at all.  I can assure the House, and the country, that I will not be one little bit affected by having Deputies on the other side of the House call me &ldquo;wooden&rdquo;.  I am surprised that we did not hear the &ldquo;stainless steel&rdquo; bit today. It has no effect whatever on me.</P>

      <P>It does not say anything at all about the policies but it says a lot about the poverty of spirit on the Opposition benches.  We have before us an Opposition which can only be described as bitterly disappointed that a debate which has been coming for a long time &mdash; we knew this review was in progress &mdash; has not produced the result they hoped it would.  We had Deputy O'Kennedy, and some of his colleagues, earlier this year hinting darkly that this review was going to prove that people were moving money out of the country on a large scale because they did not have confidence to invest it here.  That is not the case, and it is very clear from the figures, and the explanations of the changes that have been given by the CSO and the Taoiseach this morning, that that is not the case. We do not have a situation where the Opposition can credibly claim that there is a flight of capital from the country, because that has not been happening.</P>

      <P>The Opposition would do far better to examine what has happened in a realistic light and to draw some lessons from it for the conduct of economic policy here.  The Opposition have been making statements over the last couple of days, again with dark mutterings, about what this actually means in terms of the view these companies which <Col N="2687" /> are repatriating profits take of the economy.  It never stopped the Opposition, particularly in the last couple of months, from claiming to be the people who brought those industries here in the first place.  If they knew what they were doing at the time I am sure that the least we could expect is that they would have some conception, some notion, of what the consequences would be and of what the conditions were under which foreign industries located here.</P>
      <P>We have an Opposition who have been frustrated because the bone they though they were going to gnaw on for the rest of the year has been taken away from them.  That explains most of the edge that has come into the voices of the Opposition this morning.  I am not one bit impressed by the rhetoric that has come from the Opposition today.  The word &ldquo;missing&rdquo; turns up all the time in the statements that have been made.  The plain fact is that nothing is missing. Deputy O'Kennedy should have the wit to recognise that we have a detailed explanation of what had been up to now a large and growing residual item in our balance of payments figures.  We have put a name on it.  We know what has happened to it and we know what the explanation is.  That is the sum total of what has come out of the review.  It has not been the dramatic series of statements which the Opposition hoped to see from this kind of review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a certain amount of confusion about the nature of the revisions to the balance of payments estimates and about their implications for the economy. This is understandable given that the interpretation of statistics is never an easy matter and balance of payments figures are especially complex.  To interpret and appreciate the significance of these revisions, it is necessary to have some understanding of how the statistics are compiled. In the light of these difficulties, the media have done a very competent job in presenting and explaining the revisions. One aspect on which they deserve to be complimented is the way in which they have, with only very limited exceptions, <Col N="2688" /> resisted the obvious temptation to sensationalise the revisions.  Rather they have, in several instances, taken the very responsible course of pointing out what the revisions do not imply, of explaining the disappointment of the Opposition here this morning.  It is a pity that other commentators, and in that I include members of the Opposition, did not take a similar circumspect view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that I may be rubbing it in a little to Deputy O'Kennedy, who has been deprived of the bone he has been eagerly expecting to gnaw for the last few months.  I am afraid he will have to contain his soul in patience because the juice is not in the bone that he thought was there.</P>
      <P>In making statements in the House here today, one of the Government's objectives was by discussing the revisions and their possible implications in the House to bring about an improved public understanding of the issues.  We had hoped that this would have helped to avoid ill-advised responses which would have damaged international confidence in the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The term &ldquo;black hole&rdquo; which has been used to describe the residual item in the previous accounts is unfortunate and misleading. Its implication was that something was missing.  The reality is that nothing has been found to be missing, and I cannot repeat that too often.  The revisions do not change the scale of outflows from the economy.  The bottom line, which is the level of the external reserves, that is our holdings of foreign currencies, has not changed.  The revisions should, therefore, not affect our standing with the international financial community.  They are a re-allocation to the current account of the flows which were previously assigned as unrecorded outflows of private capital, and they arise mainly from a marked revision in the estimates of profits, dividends, royalties and other payments remitted abroad by foreign-controlled manufacturing enterprises. I intend in a few moments to go <Col N="2689" /> into the reasons why those remittances take place.</P>
    <P>Apart from the profit outflow, the overall profit figures have also been looked at by the CSO and this has resulted in an upward revision in gross domestic product.  However, as a consequence of the greater than originally estimated outflow of profits, the estimates of GNP are little changed and GNP growth rates were largely unaffected.  I would like to recall for the Deputy the changes that have been brought about in the estimates of GNP growth rates as a result of these changes in the figures.  For the period 1979-80 the growth rate was reduced by 0.3 per cent.  For the period 1980-81 it was increased by 0.4 per cent and for 1981-82 the revision of the figures makes no change to the estimate in growth of GNP.</P>
    <P>The revisions reflect the strong performance of certain sectors of the economy and should result in greater confidence in the economy.  This is underlined by the very encouraging performance on the merchandise trade account. Moreover, the fact that it has been made clear that the former balancing item did not represent a substantial capital outflow confirms that Government policies have engendered confidence.  The challenge for us is to make the economy sufficiently competitive so that a greater proportion of these profits will be reinvested here and the inflow of investment capital can be increased.</P>
    <P>One commentator in the media has attached some significance to the fact that not all of the previous residual has been attributed to the current account.  In language which was surprising for an academic economist, because of its inexactitude, he stated that the CSO:</P>
    <P>... has been able to trace just over £500m. of the funds gone missing through the &lsquo;Black Hole&rsquo; in the balance of payments in 1983.</P>
    <P>That quotation is from an article by Dr. Antoin Murphy in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of last Tuesday, 29 May.  The first comment I would make on that statement is, of course, that no funds have gone missing. Secondly, if we examine the tables <Col N="2690" /> included in the CSO release it is clear that the net residual item &mdash; to which presumably this commentator was referring &mdash; has varied considerably over the five-year period covered by the revisions both in sign and in magnitude.  It was a credit item in 1980 and 1981 and has been a debit item for the other three years. This is precisely the sort of pattern one would expect from a balancing or residual item.</P>
    <P>There are two other aspects to the item which are reassuring.  Firstly, as the CSO statement explains, it is not out of line with international experience.  Some examples are given in the CSO statement of what the experience in other countries has been.  I would like to elaborate on that a little because this puts our debate in perspective.  In Ireland it has varied from +1 in 1981 to -2.1 in 1983.  In the UK it has varied from -0.3 in 1980 to -3.5 in 1982.  In the US it has varied from +6.1 in 1980 to +9.1 in 1982.  It is clear, and it is in the nature of an item of that kind, that it would vary in different directions from one year to the next.  Secondly, changes in the residual, both in sign and magnitude, can be explained in large part by the impact of changes inthe merchandise trade deficit on the pattern of trade credits.  This aspect is a technical one and I do not propose to dwell on it at this point.</P>
    <P>The Opposition were reported on Tuesday morning as having said and repeated again today that the revision had revealed that the improvement in the balance of payments deficit was non-existent and that this negated the sole achievement for which the Government had previously claimed credit.  I am amazed at the naiveté of that statement. The figures show that the current external deficit has in nominal terms almost been halved from the high point of almost £1.6 billion in 1981 to £863 million at the end of last year.  Deputy Haughey said this morning that a figure of 6.5 per cent of GNP was catastrophic for the end of last year.  What adjective, if any, would he have applied to a figure of 15.3 per cent of GNP at the end of 1981?  In percentage GNP terms the fall in the period I have mentioned, from 1981 to the end of last <Col N="2691" /> year, is nine points.  As a consequence of that we have reduced Exchequer foreign borrowing from £1,255 million in 1981 to £828 million in 1983.  The deficit at the end of 1983 was, even in nominal terms before allowance was made for inflation, the lowest recorded over the five-year period covered by the revisions.  The assertion that the revisions put a question mark over the Government's policy stance is groundless.  The contrary is the case.  The upward revisions to the current external deficit underline the justification for the fiscal policies which have been pursued by this Government.  The very significant improvement in the deficit from the high levels of the 1979 to 1981 period demonstrate that the Government's policies have been effective and fully justified.</P>
    <P>The budgetary strategy being pursued by the Government in 1984 is not in any way invalidated by the balance of payments figures.  The policies implemented in 1983 brought a substantial improvement in both the budgetary position and the balance of payments position.  Those improvements gave us room for manoeuvre this year and allowed us to seek a further modest reduction in Government borrowing as a percentage of GNP while avoiding action which would have had a major deflationary impact on the economy, action which would have impaired our economy's ability to benefit from the slowly developing upturn in world economic activity.</P>
    <P>The revisions to the balance of payments and national accounts figures have no significant implications for the 1984 budgetary figures.  To pretend otherwise is totally nonsensical and can be done only out of ignorance or a frustrated desire to find something in these figures on which to capitalise.  They do not affect Government expenditure and could have only a marginal effect, if any, on the forecast of Government revenue.  The changes in the national accounts aggregates, particularly on personal consumer expenditure and profits, are being examined to see whether they imply any alteration in tax elasticities and relationships.</P>
    <P>Remittances abroad by industrial <Col N="2692" /> enterprises located here have made the main contribution to the upward revision of the current external deficit.  Understandably, this had lead to a great deal of comment.  There have been calls for a review of industrial policy.  There have been assertions that this disclosure puts a question mark over the industrial policies pursued in this country for the past 25 years or so.</P>
    <P>The more extravagant statements can be ascribed to the need for instant comment to which newspaper editorial writers and Opposition politicians are both victims.  I would hope today's statements will result in a more sober and informed assessment of the implications of the new data.</P>
    <P>The first point is that industrial policy is already being reviewed.  The Government are about to publish a White Paper on Industrial Policy.  One of the main objectives of this review will be to increase the value added in Irish industry. The new data do not affect this policy thrust in any fundamental way.</P>
    <P>I cannot emphasise too highly that the data are not bringing to light any unexpected change in the behaviour patterns of foreign companies located here.  We have known for some time that these companies located here have generally been profitable.  This is something which we should applaud.  It enhances the appeal of Ireland as an attractive location for industrial investment.</P>
    <P>The IDA for some years past, under this and previous Governments, have laid considerable emphasis on this fact in their promotional activities.  Data produced by the US Department of Commerce on the profitability of American investment in this country has been freely available. Factors which lead overseas companies to locate in Ireland include the taxation and incentive package which enables them to earn high surpluses and the fact that these surpluses could be repatriated easily.</P>
    <P>I have used the word &ldquo;surplus&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;profit&rdquo; deliberately.  The remittances involve not just repatriation of profits but also in some cases royalty and interest payments arising from external borrowings by overseas companies and <Col N="2693" /> purchases of technology and know-how. Even the profit element in the funds remitted abroad does not consist solely of profits in the sense that the term that is normally understood &mdash; that is, the margin that is left to the individual and the company when all the costs incurred have been met.</P>
    <P>Most of the companies which have located here in recent years have been in the high technology sectors, mainly electronics and chemicals.  This is illustrated by the phenomenal average annual growth rate of over 38 per cent in our electronics and chemicals exports over the past five years and the fact that these sectors are now estimated to account for approximately one fifth of Irish industrial output as opposed to only 12 per cent in 1979.  The substantial research and development and marketing costs which are a feature of these industries for the main part have not been incurred in this country. The parent companies need the surplus from the production phase to remunerate these costs.  Therefore, part of the remittances are nothing more than the cost of securing the technology and access to markets which was necessary in order to achieve the massive growth in exports and out put of recent years.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of how we choose to pursue our industrialisation programme we have to purchase foreign technology and gain access to foreign markets.  Both are expensive.  International interdependence has reached the stage when no country, even the US and Japan, is technological self-sufficient.  As a small country our indigenous technological capacity is naturally limited.  We need foreign technology and we must pay for it.</P>
    <P>If the assertion that the level of remittances signifies a policy failure were true it would mean that the industrial strategy has failed to yield significant benefits to the country.  This is patently untrue as just a few facts will illustrate:</P>
    <P>The industrial strategy has yielded a massive increase in industrial exports over the past five years.  The contribution made by the manufacturing sector has lead to a major improvement in our merchandise trade balance.  This <Col N="2694" /> was in deficit to the sum of £1,698 million in 1981.  It has steadily improved and indeed for last month showed a surplus.</P>
    <P>Eighty thousand people are employed in foreign-owned manufacturing companies.  Their wages and salaries amount to at least £800 million annually.</P>
    <P>The IDA estimate that the value of domestic purchases of raw materials and services made by these companies is of the order of £1,000 million per annum.</P>
    <P>Industrial development strategy does not remain static.  Policy has evolved gradually over the years in response to the needs of the domestic economy, changing technologies and the dynamics of the international market-place.  It should be a source of considerable gratification to us that overseas companies attracted here during an earlier phase in the industrialisation process should have succeeded as well as they have.  Many of these companies have undertaken or are contemplating further projects involving a deepening of their commitment to and involvement with the Irish economy.  The IDA have engaged in active dialogue with these companies to encourage re-investment. Indeed, the Authority's best estimate is that as much as 45 per cent of the profits generated by overseas manufacturing companies are reinvested in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Recognising the enormous potential gains to this country from capturing as much as possible of the value added now being created by overseas companies, the Government are at present in the process of finalising an industrial policy for the eighties which will set out strategies targeted at the creation of a high domestic added-value manufacturing sector. These will be detailed in the White Paper on Industrial Policy which will be published in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>Any suggestions that we should prevent remittances being made by foreign firms located here can be regarded as irresponsible.  As I have explained, these remittances are a normal part of the operations of international companies. <Col N="2695" /> Such companies have set up here on the understanding that they could remit their profits freely and that they would be in a position to pay royalties and to make contributions to the investment costs of their parent firms once their manufacturing operations had got off the ground here.  Suggestions that we should interfere with that process should not lightly be made.  They could have a very damaging effect on the rest of the benefits from those companies which I have illustrated &mdash; total wage and salary bills in the region of £800 million a year and total purchases of goods and services in this economy of more than £1,000 million a year.</P>
    <P>There are two main policy lessons we can draw from the new statistics.  The first is that they underline the need to deepen the involvement of overseas companies in our industrial sector.  This means increasing their purchases of Irish goods and services and the range of functions that they carry out here &mdash; particularly the high added value &ldquo;headquarters&rdquo; functions of R &amp; D, and marketing.  The other priority is to upgrade the capacity of the indigenous industrial sector.  Industrial policy is already directed towards these objectives; the forthcoming Industrial Policy White Paper will address them in detail.</P>
    <P>It is evident, without going into details about policies and programmes that an essential requirement, both for the short and medium term, will be to improve the competitiveness of Irish industry.  The current external deficit for 1983 was of the order of 6.5 per cent of GNP compared to 15.5 per cent of GDP in 1981. Even though we have made a very substantial improvement in the level, it is clear we cannot indefinitely finance a deficit of that level.  In order to bring it down to a sustainable level we will have to increase output, particularly exports, and increase the inflow of inward investment including reinvested profits in Irish industry. This means creating and maintaining a favourable climate for investment.  To achieve this the Irish economy will need to become more competitive both in regard to costs and the other aspects of <Col N="2696" /> competitiveness.  This requirement applies both in the short and medium term.  These revisions of the balance of payments statistics from that point of view constitute an additional justification for the stance taken by the Government this year in relation to pay policy.</P>
    <P>The changes in the estimates for the outflow of remittances and the upward adjustment of corporate profits do not justify any departure from the Government's pay guidelines since only by adhering to the guidelines will industry improve its competitiveness and secure the resultant benefits in terms of output and employment.</P>
    <P>The changes in the structure of Irish industry and exports indicate that the upward revision in the profits figure relates to a limited number of firms in a rather special position, that is, foreign firms in high-technology industries.  The revisions do not, therefore, mean that there exists in industry generally a vastly higher level of profits which would justify claims for higher wages and salaries.  The profitability of firms in particular sectors should not lead to high pay settlements which would set headlines for industries where many firms are in a weak financial position.  Apart from putting existing jobs in vulnerable areas at risk, high wage settlements even in the high technology sectors would seriously impair our ability to attract new overseas investment and to expand employment.  The objective should be to get firms in the stronger sectors to reinvest their resources to help create more jobs.  A responsible approach to pay demands and determined efforts to improve the competitive base of the economy generally would help considerably in promoting this objective.</P>
    <P>The revisions to the balance of payments statistics have necessitated consequential changes in the national accounts estimates for recent years.  For the most part the alterations in the national accounts data have been confined mainly to the nominal levels of some of the individual aggregates, notably profits.  They have not materially affected the estimates for growth in domestic output.  Indeed, the revised national accounts show that, <Col N="2697" /> while real GDP grew marginally slower in 1980 than was previously thought, it grew at a faster rate in both 1981 and 1982.  Estimates for growth in real GNP, which measured the resources available to the community after, for example, profits are paid abroad, show hardly any change at all in these years.</P>
    <P>For 1983 we have not yet got the preliminary estimates of the national accounts from the Central Statistics Office.  These will be published as usual in my Department's <i>Economic Review and Outlook</i> later in the year.  However, at this stage I see no necessity to alter our view that real GDP showed little or no change last year.</P>
    <P>For 1984 the prospect of some revival in economic activity, with real GDP growing by about 2 per cent, is not affected.  The information we have on growth in manufacturing output and in exports so far this year is very encouraging in this regard.  Growth in the output and exports of the high technology industrial sectors is still likely to dominate the outlook.  As a result, we have no reason to expect a cessation of those profit outflows in 1984.</P>
    <P>The broad policy conclusion deriving from our assessment of the revisions is that they underline the need for the priority which the Government have attached to restoring balance to the public finances and thus reducing over-spending in the economy and to the need for improving the competitiveness of the economy.</P>
    <P>During the course of his remarks earlier Deputy Haughey referred to a passage in the Economic Background to the Budget which pointed out that coverage of statistics for the international balance of payments was being reviewed and that the results, which may be available later this year, could require the estimates of the current account deficit in recent years to be revised.  He made quite a meal of that.  He suggested that the Government and I were deliberately withholding information from the House and the public. I reject that.  I signalled in that publication, as I have since in debates in the House, that the allegations made by the Opposition that this infamous &ldquo;black hole&rdquo; means that large amounts of capital <Col N="2698" /> were flowing out of the country were simply not true.</P>
    <P>I pointed out to Deputy O'Kennedy on a number of occasions &mdash; he did not take up the invitation, more is the pity &mdash; that there were a great many other possible explanations for the variation in this residual item.  It has all been there in front of him for quite a long time.  To suggest that means we withheld information from the House or the public is nothing short of contemptible.  I will not publish information of any kind until I am sure of the figures.  I may know in advance what the explanation is likely to be.  Anyone with half a head on his shoulders who knew what was going on in the review since 1982 would have seen that coming.  Since I did not have the figures I would not publish them.  I will not speculate nor will I accept any accusation of having withheld information from the House when Deputies opposite know it is not true.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Our approach to this has been that the Government and the Minister, because of the collective responsibility of Government, have chosen to ignore what was evident at the time the budget was presented.  There is a common assumption now that suddenly what is being called an outflow, &ldquo;black hole&rdquo; or whatever has been revealed within the last week with the publication of the CSO bulletin and that the Government have suddenly had to examine something that was not there to be examined before last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me put two things on the record. This information has been available to anyone prepared to acknowledge it for at least five months and particularly to the Government, the Minister for Finance and his advisers.  Secondly, it is of a much bigger dimension than it was assumed to be.  Even on the basis of the bulletin on the balance of payments revision by the CSO, it is much closer to £900 million. What has been identified within that as to the £500 million plus is the repatriation of profits by foreign companies located here.  Let us acknowledge that nothing <Col N="2700" /> has been discovered for the first time but that what is happening is that the Government and the Minister for Finance have, for the first time, had to acknowledge that they have chosen to ignore and not only ignore but misrepresent and to attribute to others who brought it up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I insist on being allowed to make my speech.  I listened to the Minister.  The Government are being forced to acknowledge what they wished to conceal.  I raised this issue in the House on 7 February 1984 with the Minister at Question Time.  It would have been raised more often since at Question Time if the Minister had been here but we have not had an opportunity of seeing him back here since then.  I raised it publicly many times since.  The Minister said I had been invited by him to do so on many occasions since but I do not recall any such invitation.  On 7 February I asked the Minister if his attention had been drawn to an article in the media, of which I gave details, indicating an unrecorded outflow of £800 million in 1983 and if he would make a statement on the matter. In the course of a long reply he said, and I wish to put this on the record&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed on that occasion also to the composition of that outflow and to the reasons for it.  I said, as reported at column 1818 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>....the unrecorded trade with Northern Ireland, which everyone is very much aware of, the repatriation of profits by multinationals because of the bad investment climate here....</P>
      <P>There followed an interjection by the Ceann Comhairle and I continued:</P>
      <P>and money being transferred illegally out of the country because of the hopeless investment climate.</P>
      <P>These are the three very elements that are being recognised now but the Minister's reply, as reported at column 1819 was:</P>
      <P>I do not accept that the level of this residual indicates uniquely or unambiguously any of the things to which the Deputy has referred.</P>
      <P>It has been proved now that what the Minister and the Government should have known then since the information was available to anyone who wished to examine it in detail&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I was right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might hold his peace for a little while.  The Minister says nothing has changed.  However, when the Minister did not wish to recognise reality he resorted to what perhaps is the oldest trick in the trade.  He made the serious accusation that I, by highlighting the situation, had done more <Col N="2702" /> damage to business confidence in the country than anyone else had done for years.  When I pointed out the facts I was accused of damaging business confidence. We all know now who has undermined confidence and who has damaged the investment climate.  Are we to be accused again of undermining confidence by our bringing up the matter at this time or is debate to be stifled?  It was in these circumstances that we tabled a motion of no confidence in the Minister bearing in mind that, as Deputy Haughey has said, he has a key role in terms of the collective responsibility of the Government.</P>
      <P>In his Budget Statement the Minister, in referring to the budgetary aggregates, including the balance of payments improvement, gave a figure which has been proved now to be £513 million out of line.  He said that this performance had restored credibility to the whole budget process.  That statement concerned a budget process which was neutral on the basis of certain understandings such as a balance of payments position that was claimed to have been £500 million better than it is.  On that basis the whole neutral budget strategy was undermined.</P>
      <P>To refer to another aspect where the Minister contradicted himself within a week of his Budget Statement, he said in the statement that on the public finances front, borrowing, especially foreign borrowing, had been reduced and that the growth in public expenditure which had been the core of our fiscal problems for a decade had been curbed.  That was on 25 January 1984 but in this House on 7 February the Minister gave figures which indicated that by the end of 1983 the State foreign indebtedness had increased from £6,959 million at the end of 1982 to £8,960 million at the end of 1983.  It was clear then that foreign borrowing had increased by £2,300 million in the year question.  In these circumstances any statement or assertion on the part of the Minister can hardly be expected to merit the confidence either of this side of the House or of the Government benches.</P>

      <P>I was conservative in my estimate of £800 million and there remains the matter of the net residual which should disclose some further interesting data when fully explained.  However, the Government are trying to turn all these revelations into a success.  I shall leave that to the charity of silence except to say that their efforts to attribute the blame to the Central Statistics Office are similar to condemning a doctor and dismissing him because he had confirmed the condition of the patient as if the doctor should be blamed.  It is clear that reputable representatives of the media were told yesterday evening that the establishment of the council was meant to be seen as a sharp rebuke by the Government of the CSO.  I was not present whsn that feed-out was given to the media but it is obvious that the Government are trying to blame the CSO for the consequences of the Government's disastrous policies.  For the first time there are to be appointed a council to supervise the operations of a body who have long been regarded as independent and who produce statistics on the basis of research and analysis that we have always accepted.  The handlers are to handle that also, but I will leave it at that.</P>

      <P>The attempt made by way of the economists associated with the Government was dealt with this morning. People who read such matters assume that economists attached to the Department of the Taoiseach are to be taken as representing the views of the Taoiseach. One hears nonsense of the kind that we have heard from Dr. Honohan, &ldquo;a lot to be cheerful about in these new figures&rdquo; and, worse still, &ldquo;as an economist, I am cheered by the fact that they (meaning the policies) are not working better than expected&rdquo;.  What in the name of Heavens is meant by that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, as the Central Statistics Office bulletin brings out, it has always been not just the practice but necessary about mid-year after the end of the preceding year to bring out revised estimates for balance of payments and other statistical data, based on the availability of data that were not available up to that point.  I have acknowledged that, not just today but previously.  It is clear that in each of the years referred to, 1979, 1980, 1981 and subsequently, there were revised estimates.  I want to put these on the record.  The difference between the revised estimate and the previous estimate in any of these cases was of little or no consequence by comparison with what we find now.  For instance, in 1980 the Minister questioned me in the course of a discussion on this issue in the House when I was Minister for Finance, concerning the figure for 1980.  The actual estimate was £882 million and the revised figure was £1,038 million, just about a £150 million difference, not a very precise figure but, nonetheless, tolerable having regard to the patterns over the years. Similarly, the 1981 figure was revised from £1,389 million to £1,595 million.  We have never at any time found a revision <Col N="2705" /> of this present order which is a result of the distortion caused by Government policies.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer back to the debate of 7 February 1984.  On that occasion when I, at column 1819, referred particularly to the fact that it was not the revision which was new but the extent of the revision which was causing the problem, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Did the Deputy give any consideration to the reason why the residual here, for example, doubled between 1979 and 1980? </P>
    <P>Let us see if it did, in fact, double?  It did not.  The actual revised estimate for 1979 was £1,026 million and 1981 £1,038 million, meaning an addition of £12 million. If that is doubling, I am not surprised that the Minister got his figures wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We were speaking before the revision then.  You were making my point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister actually asked could I explain why it had doubled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is making my point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  I am making the point that the Minister distorts at every chance he gets.  Whatever way one looked at the figures then, it did not do that.  The Minister asked had I any brilliant observations to offer at that time. Because I did not have the figures with me then but because of my recollection of what those figures were, I simply asked if the Minister would give the figures. The Minister did not give the figures.  I asked a second time and he did not.  The reason is that the precise figures would have proved exactly what I was saying and shown up his attempt to distort what I was saying for what it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Revisions have been necessary each year, and I acknowledge that, but it is precisely its extent and the reasons for it which make it of major concern.  We have not as yet seen the end of it.  In the bulletin of the revisions for the balance <Col N="2706" /> of international payments we now find a net residual of £293 million on the debit side whereas, in relation to the years under question, in 1979 it was £76.4 million on the debit side but &mdash; listen to the other figures &mdash; in 1980, about which the Minister questioned me, it was £58.70 million on the credit side and in 1981 £116.8 million on the credit side.  This year, even now, we have a net residual of £293 million on the debit side.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister, right now in the House, when we are going to get the details of what is involved in that debit?  Will we find some further coverups which the Government do not want to disclose and some more jargon being introduced by their economists or the Taoiseach or the Minister?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from revisions to the balance of payments, other revisions will of course follow.  The order of magnitude of this miscalculation is so enormous that it affects all our projections, not just for GNP growth for 1983 which will have to be revised downwards and very clearly will, but also the projections for GNP growth in 1984.  The Minister, or Taoiseach, or both, may have said this morning that the estimates of GNP growth for 1984 are now little changed.  If they knew exactly what estimates they are talking about they would know that the ESRI and the Central Bank are mostly talking about 2¼ to 2¾ per cent.  I wonder what exact estimate of figure the Government are fixing in terms <Col N="2707" /> of GNP growth for this year?  If one does not fix on the figure, one can say that the estimates are little changed as a consequence of this major outflow which must have a major impact on that growth.</P>
      <P>One thing is clear.  The gap between the gross domestic product, which one could summarise as being the income arising from domestic output, and the GNP &mdash; the gross national product &mdash; which is the income actually accruing to domestic residents, is widening all the time.  Of course, GDP will grow with exports from the industries introduced here, but with GDP growing we are not seeing anything like a corresponding growth, in fact, we are seeing a drop, in GNP.  For that reason on this notion of growth, even if it were to be 2 per cent this year, the people out there who live and work in this economy cannot see the impact of that growth.  Those are the people who can see before the Government want to see and they know that there is no real growth for them because the actual income accruing, namely GNP in the real sense of the word, is not increasing.  If gross domestic product increases that is because of the output in exports, a considerable proportion of which is not immediately accruing to the immediate advantage of the citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For 1984, I ask the Minister what kind of deficit will we talk about?  May we have a look at that when the budget comes? Can we accept, if the Minister says £400 million, that there is a tolerance level up to £1,000 million?  Is that the kind of tolerance level we shall be asked to accept next year, as has happened this year?  Will the Minister's statement of figures mean anything?  They have, in fact, been proved to be totally and utterly discounted last year.  In relation to those industries, we pinpointed more than once to the Government in the course of the Finance Bill debate &mdash; and the Minister can hardly forget it &mdash; that because of the hostile tax climate here we are seeing a fall in consumption which is giving an impetus to the outflow through cross-Border trade.  We gave all kinds of details from various trades to underline this, and <Col N="2708" /> it is no wonder that the Taoiseach is concerned about it.</P>
    <P>That is the first point, the level of indirect taxation by a Government who in 1982 introduced penal levels of taxation and then stayed neutral in 1983.  We also pointed out to the Government in the course of those debates that the other factor responsible for the low level of investment is the hostile climate in the direct tax area.  Who will be attracted to promote technological expertise or to engage technological personnel, to reside, to work and to be taxed in this country at rates which are penal and intolerable by the standards of any other country?  We have pointed out many times that our surtax level is far in excess of the tax in the countries of any of our competitors or partners.  It is not surprising that companies who came here, when there was an encouraging and attractive tax climate, are not reinvesting their profits now because of the hostile tax climate and the low level of activity and investment here.</P>
    <P>The Minister acknowledged on a previous occasion that the level of investment in the economy this year is the lowest it has been for many years at about 2 per cent of GNP.  Still they wonder why these foreign firms are repatriating their profits, why people are transferring funds across the Border and why there is the illegal transfer of money in suitcases or any other way out of this jurisdiction. The answer is over there with the Minister for Finance and along the benches beside him by a Government who can only see, as the Minister said, their priority to regulate and control tax revenue. That is the priority of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can produce many witnesses and the Minister knows it.  I heard him in a debate with me in the RTC, Carlow, saying that his priority was the regulation and control of tax revenue. It is no wonder that all he can do is meekly shake his head because I could <Col N="2709" /> bring the 80 people who were there to acknowledge this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no wonder we have the consequence of a lack of management policies and a disincentive investment climate of the kind which is driving profits out of the country which would otherwise be reinvested here. There was an investment climate when these companies came to invest here. That is why the Government can claim from time to time some credit for the buoyancy in exports.  They should ask the local indigenous industries what is happening. Their contribution is almost exclusively the increase in the export buoyancy attributable to those industries, the technology industries and the pharmaceutical industries which we attracted in here.  The Government are ensuring by their restrictive policies that we will not even get the benefit now of what was achieved in those times.</P>
      <P>That is why I say the whole direction of Government policy and of the Minister who is responsible is wrong.  The liasion between the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and the CSO at least, in working on the same basis, seems to be inadequate.  A few days before this latest bulletin came out we had the Central Bank forecast on 25 May.  It did not base its forecast on what it should have known were the revised balance of payments estimate figures which would actually come out from the CSO a few days later.</P>

      <P>I would remind you that the Minister overstayed his time.  He has interrupted me so much that I insist that I finish in the few minutes I have without interruption and without breaching the rules of order and agreement as he did this morning.  It is known that the Committee on Public Expenditure were concerned about these trends to such an extent that this committee, of which I am vice-chairman, wanted to examine those trends.  At the request of the Department of Finance they decided they would not examine them.  It was not Members from this side of the House who brought this up in that committee; it was honourable Members from the other side of the House who did.  They are the people who said that if those trends were confirmed they would want to know the reason why. The Department of Finance and the Minister did not want to see it discussed then because, apparently, it might undermine confidence.  Every time we point out basic facts it is undermining confidence.  The Government renegotiated the terms of loans over the last six months.  Will those with whom they negotiated the loans come back and say: &ldquo;wait a minute, the basis on which&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I hope the Government will go quickly to those people and establish the bona fides of the country and say that they now want to make them aware of what they did not make them aware of four months ago in relation to the revised balance of payments deficit.</P>

      <P>The enormity of what we are discussing here this morning is such as not only to undermine confidence in the Minister for Finance but also, <Col N="2711" /> potentially, to create instability in our exchange rates and, unfortunately, a lack of confidence in our economy in the management of it outside.  When I first brought this to the attention of the House over four months ago I made a conservative estimate of undermining confidence. The facts now speak for themselves. I presented the facts.  Nothing new has been disclosed.  The media have now, apparently, published what was available for publication four months ago.  Confidence has been undermined in a Minister who has shown his capacity to ignore figures, to downface anybody who would suggest the opposite, and who has shown no capacity to generate a climate for investment which will ensure that we will not see outflows of this kind.  That is why we put down our motion.  It is not a matter of pleasure or gratification.  When the man responsible insists on ignoring the facts before his face then, in the interests of the national economy, we are totally justified in what we are doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to stand back a little from the specifics of the balance of payments revision this morning and to comment on a number of aspects which have become quite apparent. We know that the balance of payments figures are only one element in the whole range of statistical information which is collected and compiled by the CSO, by official bodies and by some private concerns.  It is of critical importance that the House should accept the integrity of the independence of the CSO in the work they do.  I found particularly reprehensible the implication this morning by the Leader of the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The people heard the radio programme this morning.  The Government were rebuking the Central Statistics Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I find particularly reprehensible the suggestion that there would be any effort on the part of Government to delay publication or to put <Col N="2712" /> a particular gloss on the publication of this data.  There was no effort whatsoever. It was discussed at Government in the normal way when a report is presented and permission sought for publication. I was surprised at Deputy Haughey's implication that the Government would endeavour to circumvent the public interest.  The data have been published without delay and the information is available for all other Government Departments, the banking community and the public at large.</P>
      <P>That being said, I confess that I was somewhat staggered by the size of the revision.  The Taoiseach has given a clear exposition as to how the problem arose and how it was resolved.  He has put the matter into correct perspective.  He has not indulged in the rhetoric of the Leader of the Opposition who cannot resist the temptation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I can justify it without much difficulty.  Deputy Haughey made no effort to deal with the issues in question.  Our record in the compilation of statistical data is reasonably good by international standards, taking into account the limitation on resources and the fact that in a small country the cost of collecting representative data is proportionately higher than in larger countries. Despite that reasonably good record, I was taken aback by the size of the revision. A revision of this magnitude is an exceptional and quite an unusual event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has pointed out that new ways of preparing the balance of payments statistics have now been established and I would suggest that there is no need to look for further major changes.  One point which has emerged is the prime importance of combining information from different sources in the public sector in order to obtain a full picture of what is going on in the economy.  Naturally there cannot be a free flow of information from one Department or agency to another, particularly where confidential information relating to individual companies and <Col N="2713" /> agencies is directly concerned.  That is an integral part of the compilation of data. In this case it was important to preserve the confidentiality of the information provided for exchange control purposes. This is the nub of the issue.  The use of exchange control information by the CSO in preparing balance of payments information would only be on the basis which preserved the information provided in confidence.  The Central Bank retain that aggregated information which is communicated for the purpose of obtaining the balance of payments figures. Nevertheless I hold the view that, without compromising the confidentiality of returns or the fundamental independence of the CSO, it would be timely to consider whether there is enough co-ordination between different agencies which have a statistical and data collecting function.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">

      <P>I would hope that the Statistical Council would be able to recommend ways of co-ordinating the compilation of official statistics.</P>
      <P>I am very upset by the reference made by the Leader of the Opposition to Mr. Brendan Walsh.  I know the paranoia the Leader of the Opposition has towards academics, particularly those with economic qualifications, but he should not descend to that level.  I do not know many of those who have agreed in the public interest to serve on the Statistical Council but those I know are persons whose integrity and independence of view has always been respected by individual politicians. I regret that the Leader of the Opposition should have descended to this level in his usual flurry of rhetoric, so magnificently delivered.  Our statistical services have been heavily burdened in recent years with a variety of new requirements imposed by our obligations in the EEC and this has led to some delay in the publication of statistics.  While it is not true to say that outdated data are of no use, very often the usefulness of data declines dramatically with age.  In the Department of Health and in the Department of Social Welfare, where we spend 40 per cent of the total national budget, the effective use of computerisation has led to the elimination of a number of problems that had become apparent in the compilation of official data.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This is supposed to be a deliberative assembly.  The new <Col N="2715" /> council will be of considerable assistance in giving advice and guidance.  I hope to see more effective use of computerisation in the compilation of official statistics and also in the regular consultations regarding data.  Computerised data banks have been increasing and at official level there must be greater development in this area. Therefore, I hope that co-ordination between the different producers of statistics in the public sector will extend to these developments as well as to the collection and preparation of data.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the fact that this revision has been suggested that for some reason the Government or the CSO have been trying to conceal the data.  To my knowledge there is no question of that.  The essential point is that the CSO have discovered &mdash; I use that word in a broad sense &mdash; profits by industrial firms, mainly foreign-based, that had not been recorded by the CSO.  In the health area I have seen at first hand the phenomenal growth of pharmaceutical and chemical companies as well as companies dealing with medical technology and I have seen the extent of their exports and the employment they give.  As the Minister for Finance pointed out, some 80,000 persons are employed by foreign-owned companies who pay £800 million a year in wages and salaries and they purchase £1,000 million of domestic goods and services.  It is of critical importance that the CSO should have access to all of those companies, particularly the major ones, to ensure that the data is up-to-date.</P>
      <P>I have always been surprised at the extent to which American investment analysts have indicated the profitability of the Irish industrial base.  The evidence before us of the repatriation of royalties and profits underlines that statement. Since repartriation of profits is treated as a current item in the balance of payments, rather like an invisible export, the discovery here means that the estimated balance of payments and current account deficit as revised are much higher than was anticipated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important in the national interest <Col N="2716" /> to stress that there was no implication that the profits were being concealed or repatriated in an illegal manner.  As the Taoiseach disclosed, confirmation of their existence has come largely from administrative records of the Revenue Commissioners.  It is important that there be no implications regarding loss of confidence in our currency situation.  That is not implied in relation to the revisions. We are dealing with large capital outflows and the legitimate repatriation of profits owned by foreign companies.  I may have a view about the extent to which our industrial strategy gives an incentive for the retention of those profits within an Irish industrial base, but that is a matter of industrial policy and strategy. It is not a matter of the accuracy of the data available to us in the House.</P>
    <P>The additional profits imply that the estimated value of industrial output is higher than was previously recorded, and that is a reality we should be prepared to accept.  Equally, it means that expenditure on personal consumption in our community is also higher.  We should try to keep a sense of balance.</P>
    <P>I accept this is a glorious opportunity for Fianna Fáil to smear the Minister for Finance.</P>

I reject the allegations made by the Leader of the Oppostion, and we should maintain a sense of perspective and balance.  I am pleased that this data has been published because it clears the air for once and for all and gives us an opportunity of ensuring the continued integrity of the CSO, the Department of Finance and the Central Bank in the compilation and publication of this data.</P>

      <P>Deputy Desmond said he was amazed that there was any questioning of the statistics on the international balance of payments.  However, Deputy Haughey referred to the <i>Economic Background to the Budget</i> which was printed prior to the budget which said:</P>
      <P>The coverage of the statistics for the international balance of payments is being reviewed and the results, which may be available later this year, could require the Estimates of the current account deficit for recent years to be revised.  However, the revisions are unlikely to alter significantly the improvement in the trend in the period under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know how accurate that statement is.  Deputy Desmond, in a typical conscience clearing statement, said that he had a doubt as to the particular industrial strategy in referring to the industrial policy that has been followed over the years by successive administrations, that is the right of foreign manufacturers to repatriate funds.  Surely that is sabotage of a Government and national sabotage when the Taoiseach said earlier this morning that there is no question of changing that incentive which has been available through successive administrations? <Col N="2718" /> Deputy Desmond cannot have it both ways but, in typical fashion, he tries to.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health also referred to the critical importance of the independence of the CSO and suggested that Deputy Haughey's contribution in some way damaged that independence.  What were the Government doing last night if they were not attempting to damage the independence of the CSO by giving out the clear message that they were setting up a watchdog?  There was a clear impression given by the Government spokesmen and handlers that it was in some way a reprimand to the CSO.  I quote from <i>The Irish Press</i> for today:</P>
    <P>The Government last night delivered a rebuke to the Central Statistics Office over the £500m. error in the country's balance of payments by appointing a seven-member council to examine the way statistics are gathered.</P>
    <P>It might suit the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Health to say that they are not criticising the CSO in any way or setting up a political watchdog body but, in another way, it suits them for the handlers to give a message through the media that the CSO are to blame and that it has nothing to do with the Government who are operating on the basis of the information available to them.  They cannot have it both ways despite the fact that they are like two asses pulling in different directions at all times.  The Government have been trying to mislead the Irish people and have got away with it for a while, but their message is no longer being heeded.</P>
    <P>The budget introduced annually by the Minister for Finance lays down the chart to be followed by the State for the following 12 months.  It sets out the Government programme of taxation, incentive for growth and indicates the goals which the Government are setting.  In setting out this year's budget the Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes, set as one of the pillars of his budget strategy what he at that time called the balance of payments deficit and the borrowing requirement. He spoke about the balance of payments <Col N="2719" /> deficit being reduced from over 8½ per cent of GNP in 1982 to about 2½ per cent in 1983.  We now see that that pillar was built on quicksand, and the Minister must have known this.  Deputy Haughey also quoted the Minister speaking in Cork on 2 February 1984.  He said:</P>
    <P>It is only by sound management of the nation's finances that the basis for sustainable and adequate growth in the economy can be firmly established. Our policies are clearly working in that direction.  They have succeeded dramatically in reducing the deficit for our balance of payments from 13 per cent of our national output in 1981 to less than 3 per cent in 1983.</P>
    <P>What are the facts behind that statement in the light of the admission which we have had in the last few days concerning what Deputy O'Kennedy, Deputy Haughey and others on this side have been saying about the accuracy of those figures and the claims being made by the Minister?  What has happened to Government strategy, which is now in shreds?  If the Minister's budget claims and statements with regard to the success of the balance of payments were not such a serious matter they would be the cause of a rather loud horse laugh.  It is a very serious matter that the Minister's claims have been found to be false.</P>
    <P>Not only was this information being used for the construction of the budget but it would also have been the type of information used with regard to the National Planning Board and the inforation being used by them.  We are all aware of what happened to the planning board's report which was to lay out a programme for the next four years.  It does not even have the status of a White or Green Paper, it is just like a shopping list.  The National Planning Board, in preparing that inadequate shopping list, would have prepared it on the basis of the false information which the Minister was using.  The Minister's overall strategy and planning have been seen to fall apart. Unfortunately also their implications at a national and international level on confidence in our economy are tragic.  I might <Col N="2720" /> give one indication of the lack of confidence in this Administration, that is the failure to have the stock taken up in the last few days in the Housing Finance Agency where a situation evolved in which no tenders, at acceptable prices, were received by that agency in response to their £25 million 2.5 per cent indexlinked stock, year 2004.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the results of reducing inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>None of the stock has been allocated, which may lead to the unfortunate collapse of that agency. There is now no confidence in our economy by investors at home or abroad. This can be seen every day of the week with the problems of unemployment, the collapse of the building industry and now probably the collapse of the Housing Finance Agency, one further indication of the damage being done to our economy by this Government.</P>
      <P>Then the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Health are surprised that Fianna Fáil put down a motion calling for the resignation of the Minister for Finance.  Surely we would be doing less than our duty as an Opposition if we did not highlight the damage being done to our economy by the Minister for Finance.  This Government have lectured us and the people generally on the need for financial rectitude.  I remember sitting on this side of the House in July 1981 when the Taoiseach returned from The Park having received his seal of office, telling us that he had examined the books in detail &mdash; when he would have had about two minutes to do so down the corridor &mdash; that everything was much worse, that the Fianna Fáil Administration had been leading the country onto the rocks and had been cooking the books.  We had that type of debate about financial honesty and integrity for two general elections immediately afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we have had the farce of the last couple of days, which could have been avoided had the Minister for Finance admitted to the research carried out by Dr. Antoin Murphy and the confirmation <Col N="2721" /> of that research by our spokesman on finance and our Leader, Deputy Haughey.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the honesty and integrity of national figures is the total level of foreign debt which rose from £3 billion to £7½ billion in three years, during most of which time this Administration were in office.  Is this an indication of the success of their policies of financial rectitude? We were told in the Minister's budget statement that it was important to reduce foreign borrowing.  Yet this year, in the period from January to March, £677 million were borrowed abroad, comprising 85 per cent of the total level of foreign borrowing for 1983.  Then, because we call for the resignation of the Minister for Finance responsible for this type of performance, the Taoiseach says we are involved in national sabotage, as does the Minister for Health.  Surely if there is national sabotage it is being performed by this Government and this Minister for Finance.  That is a matter of concern not just to politicians but to every man, woman and child in this country, the men and women who have not got jobs, the children attending schools, those who can get into second-level schools and those about to leave them without any possibility of jobs.</P>
    <P>This Government have destroyed the national morale.  Unfortunately because of the failures we have seen over the last couple of days they are also destroying our international reputation.  What will be the future for us in the international money markets with regard to our borrowing capacity?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Then there is the position with regard to the repatriation of funds and profits by foreign companies and investors.  In the past when they had confidence in the Government, in the country, funds were being reinvested <Col N="2722" /> here.  There was then no need to repatriate funds at the levels now being spoken about because there was then a Fianna Fáil Administration in office, there was the proud boast by the IDA &mdash; there is still the sign out at Dublin Airport as one embarks from a plane &mdash; saying that we were the most attractive and profitable location for industry in Europe, when the IDA were quoting a 29 per cent return on investment.  If that sort of return were still available why would those companies be repatriating their profits?  They are doing so now because of the investment climate, the climate for industry, for business generally here created by this Administration.  In their short term in office, by continually harping on financial rectitude, the continual knocking of our people, they have done close to irreparable damage to our economy.</P>
      <P>Then, because the information does not suit them, they blame the Central Statistics Office, setting up a watchdog committee over them.  That is no excuse for the failure of the Government.  To endeavour to use the Central Statistics Office as the whipping boy is not the way in which to tackle the problems of an economy with over 200,000 unemployed at present.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Taoiseach has a responsibility to speak to his Minister for Health with regard to the statement made by that Minister here, its potential damage to incentives and the programme of the IDA.  The Minister for Health, as a Government Minister, indicated his unhappiness with the incentives being given to foreign companies with regard to their right to repatriate profits.  Surely that is directly contrary to the Taoiseach's own line here this morning.  It is important that the Taoiseach clarify the situation, that he specifies that it is Government policy, not just some members of the Government, but total Government policy, that those incentives be allowed continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to this motion of no confidence in his Minister for Finance which the Taoiseach avoided this morning their whole performance in regard to the balance of payments figures constitutes a severe reflection on himself as Taoiseach <Col N="2723" /> and on his administration generally.  For example, in the Taoiseach's statement this morning he said:</P>
    <P>Turning finally to the Government's broad economic strategy, I would like to stress that the new figures in no way alter the fact that our policies have been dramatically successful in reducing the balance of payments deficit.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach says one thing and his Minister for Finance says something totally different.  His budgetary and economic strategy is in shreds.  It is time to change the Minister for Finance at least who, through his false information and his reluctance to accept &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>At column 808 on 21 January on the budget, 1984, the Minister for Finance said the balance of payments deficit was reduced from over 8½ per cent GNP in 1982 to about 2½ per cent in 1983. That is a false statement.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, the Deputy is taking up the very matter of our discussion here and using it to accuse me of misleading the House.  The matter we are discussing at the moment is a revision of the balance of payments statistics which was carried out by the CSO in consultation with the Central Bank and Department of Finance.  At any moment the information I will give this House &mdash; and this has always been the case &mdash; will be the most accurate and up to date information available.  What I gave the Deputy at that time was the most accurate and up to date information available at that time.  The Deputy must withdraw the allegation that I am misleading the House.</P>

      <P>The information I am quoting is the information the Minister gave the House on 21 January, the information on which he based his budget strategy.  The information which was questioned by Dr. Antoin Murphy in his brilliant article in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> was brought before the House by Deputy O'Kennedy, by the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party and other Deputies.  The Minister for Finance refused to accept it.  He is now accepting the basis of the arguments which were made by Dr. Murphy, by Deputy O'Kennedy and Deputy Haughey.  I have limited time.</P>

      <P>In the few minutes available to me I should like to refer briefly to some of the matters I would have wished to discuss in this debate if I had more time.  I should like to thank my friend Deputy Burke for allowing me the five minutes I have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many questions were raised by what has been disclosed in the past few days which have not been answered.  I do not know whether the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance will reply to this debate, but whichever of them it is might reply to some of the questions which I will raise. It has fascinated me for some time that, although we have regular monthly trade figures, we never had regular balance of payments figures so far as I can see.  It is interesting to notice that yesterday morning in London the British Government were able to publish their balance of ments as opposed to their balance of trade situation for the month of April.  We never get these monthly figures. I doubt that we even get annual figures.  We get estimates made in June or July of the following year of what the balance of payments for the previous calender or fiscal year was.  If the British can produce them on a monthly basis with a much more complicated internationalised economy than ours, I fail to see why we cannot do it.  If these figures had been given to us regularly, we would not be <Col N="2726" /> facing the very disturbing situation we face today.</P>
    <P>We and the country are entitled to ask why apparently there has been no co-ordination over the past four years between the Central Bank and the Central Statistics Office.  The position with regard to exchange controls which were introduced early in 1979 is that permission, even for small payments, has to be given by the Central Bank.  Under the regulations made in 1979 they are expected to report both outgoing and incoming receipts as low as £50,000.  If that was passed on in the normal way into all the various organs of Government, why is it that the Central Statistics Office did not get it or, if they did get it, why did they not take it into account?</P>
    <P>Obviously political responsibility for this mess has to finish up with the Government and individual members of the Government, but it is a bit facile to say certain organs of the public service have served the country well if they have neglected to take account of the quite different situation which has existed here since exchange controls were introduced on the present basis in 1979.  I note that a great deal of agitation has been stirred up within the past couple of days by the Government's original explanation that this extra £700 million represented transferred or remitted profits.</P>
    <P>When we look at it more carefully, we see that money does not represent profits at all.  To my mind, the reality of it is a transfer out of this country of positive cash flow as opposed to profits properly speaking.  It is perfectly understandable that that would take place.  For many of these companies their only activity here is in manufacturing.  The debate takes no account of the fact that multinational corporations are very well geared for the fixing of what are called transfer prices. Because of the tax regime here it suits such corporations &mdash; and we should expect that and regard it as perfectly normal &mdash; to seek to maximise their paper profits in a regime which from the point of view of corporate tax is particularly favourable, as this one is.  I wonder why it is that in deciding on these matters over the last number of years that those whose <Col N="2727" /> job it is to do that did not take into account, for example, the figures extrapolated by the IDA from the Department of Commerce returns in Washington which showed that the profits made in Ireland were only repatriated to the United States to the extent of about one third.  Unfortunately, there is a lot more I would wish to say but I do not have an opportunity to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that Deputy O'Malley had not a chance to develop his points more fully but I am not in a position to concede him time as I have only ten minutes myself.  I would have been happy to do so if I had a little more leeway.  When Deputy Haughey was speaking he suggested that the size of the balance of payments deficit was the essential determinant of budgetary policy. As a former Minister for Finance I believe he knows that is not in fact the case.  That is most simplistic approach. The direction in which the balance of payments is moving is at least as important &mdash; I think fundamentally more important &mdash; as the actual size.  The fact is that in the period in question the balance of payments deficit as a share of GNP has now been shown by the revised figures to have fallen by nine percentage points which is only fractionally less than what we thought was previously the case and the figures that have now been revised.  The Government's policy therefore has been shown by these figures to have achieved almost identical results in terms of the correction of the balance of payments deficit with that which we had thought was being done on the basis of the old figures.  That is really the fundamental point rather than the question of size.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have pointed out in my remarks, Deputy Haughey's suggestion that our budgetary policy was in some way totally incorrect because it was based on wrong figures is, first of all, wrong in itself and, secondly, would if it were true be a condemnation of his party's budgets of 1979, 1980, January 1981 and March 1982, all of which were based on the previously unrevised figures with differences of several <Col N="2728" /> hundred million pounds in each case. I do not think he pursued that argument much further having walked into that trap himself.  When he was talking about the difference he alleged the knowledge of these figures would, or should, or could have made to budgetary policy he seemed to imply that it might have justified a less restrictive budgetary policy and one more likely to generate growth.  The logic of that defeats me because if the difference in the size of the current balance of payments were to have any influence on budgetary policy then the discovery that it is larger rather than smaller would require more restrictive policies.  I do not see that this is the case in the present instance.  Looking back at the budget of that time I think I can say that had I known that the figure for the balance of payments was as we now know it to be it would not have changed my view, or the Government's view as far as I can judge, as to the budget.  I do not believe it would have made it more restrictive or that we would have changed our minds about it.</P>
    <P>The thing that really staggered me about Deputy Haughey was when he said that there was no essential difference between an outflow of capital and an outflow of profits.  I find it very hard to believe that anybody who has had public responsibility should speak in those terms.  Of course they are totally different. Profits have to be earned and normally, as in our case, only part are repatriated. The IDA figures would suggest that the total profits of foreign firms are almost double those repatriated and that, therefore, a substantial amount was added to income kept here.  An outflow of capital on the other hand, could be a serious matter.  It could suggest a lack of confidence in the management of our economy.  The fact that this suggestion implicit in the earlier figures has been eliminated is basically a cause of great reassurance where some doubts were being cast upon the policies being pursued. There was suggestion that money was leaving the country but we now know that that in fact was not the case.  I cannot imagine two things more different than the situation when we discovered that the activities carried on in the country have <Col N="2729" /> been more profitable than one thought on the one hand and, therefore, enterprise was more successful and we are in a position to attract more capital into the country and, on the other hand, an implication that there is an outflow of capital from the country due to a lack of confidence. The two are directly opposite to each other.  How Deputy Haughey could suggest that there was no essential difference between them really defeats me and would suggest that in his case in dealing with this matter there was a total lack of seriousness.  I believe that ran right through his speech.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey stated that Fianna Fáil realised the significance of the residualising of the balance of payments and that he had raised it in the budget debate. He went on to quote from his own speech a passage which revealed that while he was aware, because we had drawn attention to the fact, that a revision was due in the document we published at that time that he knew some more than we did of what the magnitude of it was and what its significance would be.  His own quotation makes nonsense of what he purported to be putting forward here.  He suggested that the Government got their sums wrong.  What we have done is to get the sums right.  For the first time in a very considerable number of years we know that we have balance of payments figures which are much more nearly exact than the ones we have had to live with for a long time.  We are the Government who got the figures right and have published them when available.  We have made them available so that people would know the true position.  To suggest that we got the sums wrong does not seem to make a lot of sense in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>There is a suggestion coming from the other side of the House that in some way we are trying to blame the CSO.  We are not blaming the CSO but the figures we are dealing with are ones that were prepared by the CSO in consultation with other agencies.  They have revised and corrected them.  That is the matter we are here to discuss, the significance of that revision.  We have not cast any particular blame on the CSO or any other agency. <Col N="2730" /> The fact is that the data required in order to establish the scale and nature of these payments became available only with the introduction of exchange control following the EMS.  It took a good deal of time, firstly, before this data could be organised into a shape and form where it was useful and, secondly, before it could be then translated into actual figures.  That work has been going on for some time. Indeed, the preliminary consultations go back to 1981.  It was in 1982 when the Opposition were then in office that the work on this project started leading to the result we now have.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition, and Deputy O'Kennedy, seemed to be suggesting that the establishment of the new Statistical Council is to oversee the CSO and that in appointing it we are in some way introducing a political element.  I find that allegation detestable.  Professor Brendan Walsh is one of the most eminent economists in this country.  I think he has published more academic work of distinction than any other economist and it is highly regarded.  There are very few economists who are as highly regarded. That the Leader of the Opposition should make such a contemptible remark and to suggest that the appointment of an economist of his distinction was in any way politicising the CSO goes beyond any normal behaviour in the House.  Point scoring of that kind is undesirable.  Anything that casts doubts on the independence of the CSO is undesirable.  In establishing a council of the most eminent people available in a particular field of statistics, whether demographic, agricultural, social, mathematical or econometric, we have endeavoured to ensure that the CSO will have the maximum assistance with its work from the most distinguished people available.  I hope the Leader of the Opposition will reconsider what he said and have the good manners and decency to withdraw it.</P>
    <P>In his speech Deputy Haughey referred to the measurement of the GNP being seriously miscalculated.  He said that if the measurement of GNP had been seriously miscalculated because the wrong figure was entered for the balance of payments deficit then all the calculations <Col N="2731" /> became equally useless.  The fact is, as the Deputy would know if he had the document, that the GNP figures have not been significantly affected.  The change in the GNP increase is a .3 per cent reduction in the growth of GNP in 1980 offset by a .4 per cent increase in the growth in 1981 with no change in 1982.  The net effect is .1 per cent over three years.  To talk about that as a serious miscalculation is on the part of the Leader of the Opposition a serious miscalculation.  I have replied to the limited points in the <Col N="2732" /> debate.  Frankly, the quality of the debate has been remarkably disappointing and very little has come from the Opposition. However, it has given us the opportunity to clarify a matter which has been the source of some public confusion.  The nonsense talked on the other side of the House has now been thoroughly and effectively exposed and we can now get back to the ordinary work of running the country.</P>
