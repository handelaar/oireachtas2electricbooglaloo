    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the matters he intends to raise at his forthcoming meeting with the President of the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will avail of his forthcoming meeting with the President of the United States to convey to him the concern of Members of this House at the situation in Central America, as expressed in the resolution unanimously passed by the Dáil on 27 April 1983.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will avail of his forthcoming meeting with the President of the United States to express concern at increased dangers of nuclear war brought about by the decision of the US Government to station Cruise and Pershing missiles in western Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the practice nor would it be appropriate for me at this point to go in detail into the topics to be discussed at my meeting in the White House, at the President's invitation.  I do, however, expect that we will discuss <Col N="1290" /> Northern Ireland, investment and employment, EEC-US affairs and other matters affecting relations between our two countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Taoiseach if the discussions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely sorry. I should have indicated to the House that I was going to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together and I omitted to say so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach has the right to take the three questions together but they deal with three separate issues.  Could the Taoiseach indicate if, in relation to the discussions concerning Northern Ireland, he proposes to discuss the expected outcome of the New Ireland Forum and if he thinks it wise that the US should be involved in any way with the Northern Ireland situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be difficult and also improper for me to endeavour to anticipate the results of the New Ireland Forum in such discussions but, as I said, I will be discussing Northern Ireland with the President and informing him on the situation as we see it and of the Government's policy and our hopes for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>What role does the Taoiseach see the US having in relation to Northern Ireland?  Is it in relation to whatever outcome results from the Forum or does he see the US having some other relationship with us here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All one can say about that is that the US is a friendly country, the leaders and members of Congress of which have shown an interest and concern for the problem of Northern Ireland over the years, and successive Irish Governments have sought to keep the President and Congress informed and to ensure their continued constructive interest in this problem.  I will be pursuing that same path.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Question <Col N="1291" /> No. 2, the situation in Central America, does the Taoiseach propose to raise the question of Fr. Niall O'Brien and his co-accused in the Philippines and the views expressed by responsible people in the Philippines who have expressed doubts about the possibility of a just and fair trial there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to go into more detail than I have about topics. In relation to the matter raised by the Deputy, I cannot predict at this stage what the position in the US will be in respect of the trial.  In any event it will be impossible for me to comment.  I do not propose to go into more detail than I did in my reply as to the topics that will come up in our discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the very close relationship between the US and the Government in the Philippines? It would be appropriate if the Taoiseach would indicate that he will at least mention the fact of our concern&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must confine himself to a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that of many people about the trial of the people in the Philippines.  Could the Taoiseach indicate if he will raise that matter with the President?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not indicate so at this point in any event.  If I saw any advantage in doing so I would naturally do so but at this stage I do not know what the position will be at the time I meet the President.  I would prefer not to go into further detail about the topics under discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Taoiseach's reply, in which he referred to the fact that he would discuss the employment problem with the President, what steps does he intend to take while in America to further the request of the Government to meet with the Ford Motor Corporation regarding the future of the Ford plant in Cork?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1292" />
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not answer that question at this stage.  That matter is still under discussion between the Government and Ford and I would not know at this stage whether there will be anything to be done usefully in the US.  If there is while I am there I will certainly do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me remind the Taoiseach that two of his Ministers indicated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>A question, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;some months ago that they had requested a meeting with the management of the Ford Motor Corporation in the US.  As a result of that, would he see it wise for him now to pursue the possibility of holding that meeting in the economic interest of Cork and the nation generally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at this moment and this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to the Deputy, I do not think that the matter arises on that question in that form, but in considering what matters to raise in the United States with the people I will be meeting there I will be taking account of the position in respect of those matters at the time I am there, which is a week away.  As of this moment I would not propose to take that matter up.  That could change in the light of developments in regard to Fords in the meantime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's answers are disappointing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Taoiseach, in view of the fact that President Reagan is coming here later on in the year, is his journey to the United States really necessary at this stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That question does not arise on Question Nos. 1, 2 or 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1293" />
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not pursue it then. Could the Taoiseach tell me is it true that at the time of his visit, or around that time, there will be actually 15 Ministers of this Government in the United States?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very interesting question.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I regard my visit as necessary and useful and trust and believe it will be as much so as the Deputy's visit there as Taoiseach two years ago when he took over from me at short notice and did his best to stand in. A number of Ministers and Ministers of State will be in the United States.  We are anxious to ensure that the maximum impact is made at this time of year in the United States in respect of a number of aspects of policy, in particular the development of industry here, the development of tourism at a time when conditions are particularly favourable to that and also to ensure the fullest possible understanding among people in various parts of the United States of the problem in Northern Ireland which is a subject, as the Deputy well knows, of some misunderstanding in that country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, there is the question of Fords in Detroit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I might ask the Taoiseach, in relation to Question No. 3 concerning the siting of Cruise and Pershing missiles in Europe, if he intends raising the question of the United States withdrawing Cruise missiles from Europe particularly in view of the fact that Ireland is involved in a conference in Stockholm attempting to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the total number of persons employed in fish processing plants in County Donegal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Barrett, Dún Laoghaire) Nuala Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Barrett,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dún Laoghaire</i>): The 1979 Census of Industrial Production is the most recent for which detailed final results are available. According to the results of that census, there were 341 persons engaged in the fish processing industry in County Donegal in September 1979.  Indications from the short-term inquiries are that employment in September 1983 was approximately at the same level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will allow a period of grace to all development farmers to allow for the submission of farm accounts for previous years for the modernisation scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton)</NameTxt>
      <P>A development farmer is required to submit to ACOT an extract of farm accounts for each year of his development plan.  The period allowed for this is 12 months from the end of the accounting year.  However, <Col N="1295" /> I have decided to allow up to 31 July 1984 for submission of farm accounts extracts for accounting years ending not later than 31 July 1983.  Appropriate instructions have been issued to ACOT, who will notify relevant farmers accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>From what I heard of the Minister's reply I understand he mentioned an extension of the time limit. Might I put it to the Minister that a reasonable period should be allowed for farmers to submit accounts especially in view of the Minister having told us here last week that in many cases the Department will be looking for a refund from farmers who have not submitted accounts under the Farm Modernisation Scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, it has always been a condition of the scheme for persons classified in the development category that they would have to submit accounts for that particular year and that they would be given a year from then to actually have that done. For one reason or another that has not actually happened.  Because of the problems involved I am extending this particular date to 31 July 1984.  That will have the effect that some farmers who were paid grants at a reduced rate will now be eligible for the total grant they would have received in the first instance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been decided to allow up to 31 July 1984.  It will be applicable to grants paid since 1 January 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of what the Minister for Agriculture told us last week would the Minister of State confirm that it is more a question of making up for deductions rather than taking money from people who have already received it?</P>

    <Col N="1296" />
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>As all Deputies are aware, the exact position with regard to this is that, because of the necessity under the rules governing the farm modernisation scheme, some farmers were unable to supply accounts within the specified period and, because of that, were paid a lower rate of grant.  Under the decision I have now made, provided they come up with the relevant documentation, they will receive their full grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any question of anybody who received a full grant having anything deducted from them now?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said last week, not on the actual grants they received.  But, as I understand the position, in respect of grants for which they might become eligible in the future, account will have to be taken of whether or not accounts have been kept.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It may not be helpful but it is the truth.  Would the Minister reconsider his decision &mdash; though welcome &mdash; and give an across the board reduction to everybody?  Does the Minister agree that it is ridiculous to go back to farmers asking them to repay grants already paid in respect of development which has been carried out?  Will the Minister give an across the board commitment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is well aware, this is not possible.  There are certain laws laid down regarding those categories.  The decision I have taken is <Col N="1297" /> a very welcome one in so far as it goes, but it is important for me to point out that in future in respect of all grants in the development category accounts will have to be made available within 12 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that the Minister has said that he has taken this decision himself.  Would the Minister tell the House what importance he attaches to farm accounts and if, in view of the fact that he has now made a decision to extend the accounting period to 31 July 1984, he would now reconsider grant-aiding farm accounts as they are very important to the future of farming and agriculture?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is satisfied that the actual test being used in the TB eradication scheme is sufficiently accurate and specific; the research that has been done on this problem and funds allocated for it in the last 30 years; if any other country is using or has used this particular test; the number of reactors subsequently slaughtered that turn out to be free of any symptoms of the disease; the number <Col N="1305" /> of clear herds that have had spontaneous outbreaks of TB; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The tuberculin test is the most reliable test available and it has been the basis of bovine TB eradication programmes throughout the world.</P>
      <P>In other countries research has been carried out with a view to finding an alternative reliable serological test; this research has proved fruitless.  No such research has been undertaken here but all batches of tuberculin are laboratory tested to ensure that the standard of potency is maintained at the highest possible level.</P>
      <P>Visible lesions are detected in 25 per cent of TB reactors during routine <i>post mortem</i> examination.  That is consistent with the experience in other countries. The absence of visible lesions does not mean, of course, that the animal is free of the disease.</P>
      <P>Spontaneous outbreaks of bovine TB do not occur.  All breakdowns arise from direct or indirect transmission of the disease from an infected animal.  About 6,600 herds are at present restricted because of bovine TB.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that the figure of 2 per cent given by his Department on this programme does not include the 6 per cent of reactors showing up under the 30-day test or the 8 per cent in reactor herds?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, in absolute terms the number of herds restricted is 6,600.  Whatever way one tends to equate that in percentages, as far as we are concerned 6,600 herds are restricted. In my view, that would represent about 2.3 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the failure of the entire TB eradication scheme, despite the large amount of money which has been invested in it over the last 30 years, is largely due to the current TB test not being used sufficiently <Col N="1306" /> elsewhere to justify our taking it as a measure?  Also, what investigation has been done heretofore on the method of the spread of TB infection in Ireland and does the Minister stand over his statement that it is only from direct contact with other animals that the disease can be spread?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall take the last part of the Deputy's question first.  On this whole question of the spread of TB, veterinary experience down through the years, not alone in this country but in Europe, shows that it is by lateral spread, in other words, it must be transmitted from an infected animal.  Many would question that finding in the sense that there are outbreaks of this disease in isolated areas, but the information at my disposal would indicate that if the reason is traced back properly, the flare-up of a particular disease can be traced to an infected animal somewhere.  On the whole question of the movement of cattle, all these regulations have been tightened up in recent years.  Despite that, we have not been happy with the results of the TB eradication scheme.

The absence of visible lesions is not an indication that animals are free from TB.  Restrictions must therefore continue to apply to all TB reactor herds until these have passed two consecutive herd tests, and there can be no question of returning cattle identity cards to herdowners when <i>post mortem</i> inspection fails to reveal visible TB lesions.</P>

      <P>Some 200,000 application forms under the various livestock grant schemes for cattle are issued annually in May and this procedure will be followed again this year.  However, in December 1983 farmers were invited to make separate applications in respect of calves born in the second half of 1983. This will enable the farmers concerned to get the calf premium some five months earlier than would otherwise be the case and will also facilitate the Department's inspecting operations.</P>

I am concerned about this and I am asking the local authorities concerned for a full report on the matter.  In the meantime I am assured that there is <Col N="1316" /> no health hazard involved and further understand that the city manager has undertaken, so as to allay any public disquiet, to have more tests carried out to confirm that the water supply is not a health hazard to the users.</P>
      <P>The overloading of the Leixlip plant results in the water supply passing through the filtration system faster than it should, giving rise to water discolouration. The present alternative to overloading the situation would be to ration the supply, which is an undesirable option.  Dublin County Council propose to increase the capacity of the Leixlip plant but the additional capacity will not come into operation until the end of 1985.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that this is the third occasion in a matter of three months where attention has been drawn to the fact that the water is polluted and has a bad odour?  His own Department have notified me that they have been concerned and have endeavoured to identify it.  A suspect area is the Newbridge sewage disposal works which is considerably overloaded and receives several industrial effluents.  Secondly they are concerned because they have discovered that the disinfectant is used in the scheme for the eradication of bovine TB.  That is in the Minister's own letter.</P>

      <P>The question concerns my awareness in relation to the whole city of Dublin.  I am not aware that the inconvenience is widespread but I am aware that certain areas of the city are receiving discoloured water.  This is not a health hazard.  The answer to the problem is obviously to increase the capacity but that cannot be done before 1985. Contracts are at present being considered in my Department.  We hope work will commence in May this year and be completed in May 1985.  The other alternative is to reduce the amount of water.</P>

      <P>The possible acquisition of a controlling interest in the Irish Civil Service Building Society by a bank or other organisation is still being considered by the Government.</P>
      <P>The Deputies may be assured that, in whatever action the Government may decide to take, the interests of the individual house purchasers and of the housing programme generally will be a primary concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The building societies legislation specifically provides for the control of building societies to be in the hands of all their members.  The Civil Service Building Society has some exceptional <Col N="1318" /> provisions which would enable a take-over bid by the acquisition of investment shares, as distinct from the total shareholding.  Does the Minister not agree that it would be inconsistent with the whole spirit and purpose of the building societies legislation to allow an intervention outside the building societies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of its peculiar structure the building society in question is one for which take-over bids can be made and one such bid is apparently in the process of preparation.  The Government are considering the matter and whatever the result of these discussions &mdash; there is not just one going on &mdash; our concern would be to protect the interests of those who have obtained mortgages from the society and the housing programme generally.  Those would be our primary concerns in judging the most appropriate action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to note the statement of the Minister's concern. Would the Minister acknowledge that the building societies legislation is specifically drawn up to ensure the protection of that interest?  Without any criticism of the banks, obviously they operate in the interests of shareholders and their profits as distinct from the depositors in building societies.  Will the Minister take all this into account in order to protect vital interests and ensure that this distortion does not occur because of the exceptional provisions made in the 1976 legislation? Will he recommend if necessary that an amendment to the 1976 Act be introduced to seal off this loophole which clearly was not intended when the legislation was introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I am aware that the 1976 Act, which did a number of things including codifying previous Acts, is intended to bring about a situation in which the activities of building societies can be regulated in order to conform to certain objectives and criteria which are generally accepted as being in the interests of those who want to buy their own homes and those who choose to put their savings on deposit in building societies. <Col N="1319" /> My concern would be to ensure the protection of those interests in the Irish Civil Service Building Society, whatever the outcome of the present discussions.  More than one option is being examined.  The 1976 Act was framed in a particular way and an exception was made for this society because of its peculiar structure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there always has been among the commercial banks a certain hostility to the favourable conditions which are afforded to building societies in the interests of house purchasers?  Will he keep in mind the fact that this attempted take-over by a commercial bank of a building society would have repercussions in that area, and that it is suspected among building societies that this is a move to undermine the special position of building societies from, as it were, the inside? Secondly, could he indicate whether this attempted take-over would be subject to the mergers and monopolies legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the first part of the Deputy's question, as the Deputy well knows there is a degree of jealousy among different kinds of financial institutions if only for the reason that the far away hills always seem to be green.  I know of no financial institution which does not feel that some other kind of financial institution has a benefit or an advantage which it would like to have.  I take the basic point being made by the Deputy that there is this feeling among some of the institutions that others have advantages they would like to have and have not got on the basis of their statutes. That and the possible repercussions which the Deputy has referred to are matters which are very much to the forefront of the Government's mind in considering this.  On the second part of the Deputy's question, the Mergers and Monopolies Act applies in this case and any bid made for the society would have to be dealt with in accordance with the terms of that Act.</P>

Would he not acknowledge that, whatever motive the commercial bank in question have, it is certainly not to advocate the best interests and the welfare of house purchasers?  In view of that, would he not be prepared to give the House an assurance that the Government will ensure that this undesirable take-over does not take place?</P>

There are other factors, as I said, which have to be taken into consideration.

      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry if he is aware that 200 trees on the Dorney Court Estate, Shankill, County Dublin, most of them in excess of 100 years old and including oak, ash, sycamore, chestnut and scotch pine, will be felled within days; the <Col N="1321" /> action, if any, he intends taking to save and preserve the trees; and if he will make a statement in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. O'Toole)</NameTxt>
      <P>The company applied for a felling licence in respect of 102 trees on 22 December 1983.  A prohibition order was issued in the normal way and served by the Garda on the company.  The effect of this order was to prohibit any felling until the matter had been investigated by a forest and wildlife service inspector. Inspection took place on 9 and 19 January 1984.  The inspector recommended a licence for 33 trees.  These were numbered on a site map.</P>
      <P>In the meantime the Department had brought the application to the notice of the local authority in case they wished to take any action from an amenity point of view.  Their attention was drawn to the fact that the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry was not empowered to refuse a licence solely on amenity grounds and that it would, therefore, be a matter for the local authority either to make a tree preservation order under the Local Government and Planning Acts, or to allow the felling to take place.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the residents of the Shankill area are not objecting in principle to the housing development?  What they want is a combination of housing and the retention of all the trees.  Can the Minister tell the House that he will request or direct the local authority to issue a preservation order?  Is he aware that this is a beautiful linear forest and that it would be a tragedy to see these trees go on the basis of the willingness of the residents to accommodate the house builder on the one hand, and to preserve the trees on the other hand?  Will he pre-empt this act of institutional violence or vandalism before it happens?</P>

      <P>I feel that I should once again draw the attention of Members to the Standing Order relating to the Order of Business.  That Standing Order provides</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach shall have the right to determine the order in which Government business shall appear on the Order Paper and, by announcement at the commencement of public business, the order in which it shall be taken each day.</P>
      <P>What is involved is simply an announcement by the Taoiseach and strictly speaking, there should be neither comment nor question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each of my predecessors over many years, however has allowed questions of a nature which he considered could be relevantly raised on the Order of Business. The practice which grew up was <Col N="1412" /> crystallised by one of my predecessors at Volume 326, columns 541 and 543.  The principal points made by him on that occasion were that: questions may be asked about the business of the day; about the taking of other business on the Order Paper; about business that the Government have promised to bring forward; about arrangements for sittings, and as to when Bills or other documents needed in the House will be circulated.</P>
    <P>He ruled that other matters were disorderly and could not be raised on the Order of Business.  I have indicated already to the House that I agree with his ruling.  Indeed, the longer I am in the Chair the more satisfied I am that the ruling was and remains a fair one as our procedure at present stands.  Indeed, as my predecessor pointed out if a Member wishes to have procedure changed the matter should be raised at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I have been asked on many occasions when Deputies can raise this, that and the other and the following statement contains the answer.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that there are many procedures available to them to raise matters in an orderly way.  They can ask Questions on ordinary notice.  If the matter is of urgent public importance a question may be tabled on very short notice indeed.  A Member may raise a matter for discussion on the ordinary half hour Adjournment or, exceptionally, under Standing Order 30.  In this Dáil we have had a number of topical discussions by agreement between the Whips.  We are having one such discussion today. Then there is Private Members' time where a large number of Members support the raising of a matter.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would earnestly appeal to Members to co-operate with the Chair in applying the procedure as it stands.  If they feel strongly that the procedure should be reviewed they can, as I have already said, bring the matter before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>

      <P>Arising out of what the Chair has said I should like to ask him to repeat the part of his statement about the capacity of the Opposition to raise matters under Standing Order 30.  The Chair <Col N="1413" /> in his statement seemed to indicated that the Opposition have the facility under Standing Order 30, in addition to the time available to them in Private Members' Time.  Can the Chair reconcile that with his decision last week to refuse the Opposition permission to raise something under Standing Order 30 because they could raise it in Private Members' Time?</P>

      <P>I am surprised that Deputy Haughey should seek to engage in an argument on a statement I have read.  I will read the paragraph again.  It was:</P>
      <P>Deputies are aware that there are many procedures available to them to raise matters in an orderly way.  They can ask Questions on ordinary notice [that is three or four days notice.]  If the matter is of urgent public importance a question may be tabled on very short notice indeed [a couple of hours as we had today when three questions were allowed].  A Member may raise a matter for discussion on the ordinary half hour Adjournment [I think we have had one of those each day that the Dáil sat] or, exceptionally, under Standing Order 30.  [Standing Order 30 speaks for itself, subject to the interpretation by the Chair].  In this Dáil we have had a number of topical discussions by agreement between the Whips.  We are having one such discussion today. Then there is Private Members' Time where a large number of Members may support the raising of a matter.</P>

    <Title>Programme for Action in Education: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>We are debating here today our <i>Programme for Action in Education</i> for the next four years.  It is both timely and apt that we should have such a programme and important that this House should consider it.  There has been a widespread demand for a clearly-charted sense of direction, a clearing of our minds regarding priorities and where we are going. Education has been characterised for too long by <i>ad hoc</i> decision-making and short-term action.</P>
      <P>During the early months of 1983, I was constantly told that a plan was needed, and that this was particularly so given that resources were scarce and that every item of expenditure was being scrutinised. The call was to clarify the issues, define the targets and set the goals.  We now have such a plan.  It is not a wish-list of hopes, it is all about action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike the White Paper of December 1980 this programme deals in specific proposals which can and will be acted upon over the next four years.  In fact, action has already started.  The Estimates for 1984 include specific measures, decided in anticipation of and in the knowledge of what the action programme would contain. Furthermore, there is great activity at present within my Department with regard to implementing the various items to be acted upon.  Some can be done quickly, others more slowly.  Some <Col N="1418" /> require detailed discussion and consultation and this will be carried out.  The Special Working Party in my Department who helped me to draw up the programme have now turned their attention to the plan's implementation.  This working group will ensure that appropriate action is taken in order to put in train each of the commitments outlined in the programme.</P>
    <P>To be successful, all concerned in education must also play their part as without the maximum co-operation it will not be possible to achieve our goals.  This is extremely important.  We must all share in common purposes so that our young people may gain the greatest benefit possible. To this end we must ensure that sectional interests are not allowed to dictate events.  Our collective efforts must avoid this possibility at all costs.</P>
    <P>The House will recall that when introducing the Estimates for my Department last June I said that I would be happy to afford the House an opportunity of debating the Programme for Action when available.  I gladly fulfil that promise today.  I am glad for two reasons. First, the programme is a precise, realistic and educationally-sound document.  It has generally been welcomed as such by the various educational interests.  Second, it represents the culmination of much work and extensive consultation.</P>
    <P>Before I treat in specific terms of the major components of the programme, however, I want to refer to a change in emphasis in financial policy for the educational services.</P>
    <P>We all remember the furore which the Opposition created last year over the economies which had to be made in the educational services.  In all, a sum of £14.0 million approximately was saved. What did these measures do?  I was enabled to provide for the educational services this year without recourse to further economy measures.  More importantly, I was able to order, in financial terms, my priorities and to launch the Programme for Action.</P>
    <P>The Government were able to make available an additional £7 million approximately to improve the capitation grants for national schools and the grant to secondary <Col N="1419" /> schools in lieu of school fees, to initiate a programme for the disadvantaged and to accelerate the school building programme for national schools.</P>
    <P>It is a truism to say that when resources are scarce the concept of choice arises.  In the context of scarce resources if a service is to be funded it must be done at the expense of another perhaps equally meritorious service.  There will never be enough money for education to satisfy all.  Therefore, priorities must be ordered.  That is precisely what I have done and been enabled to do as a result of last year's economies.  I have transferred resources so as to enable me to implement what I regard as my main priority &mdash; the care of the disadvantaged. I propose to come back later to this matter of the transfer of resources.</P>
    <P>For a moment, however, let me look at the economy measures which were necessary last year.  For the record again, I have to say that on becoming Minister for Education I was handed a whole series of cuts determined by the previous Government.  My Government examined them as sensitively and as flexibly as possible. Because of our scale of priorities and concern for the socially and economically deprived we modified a number of them.  The former Government's proposed cut-back in remedial teaching in national schools was restored.  Free transport was restored to pupils whose parents possessed medical cards.  The less-well-off in our post-primary schools were given relief from the increase in examination fees.</P>
    <P>These measures can in no way be interpreted as a climb down by me or the Government and it was quite wrong of the Opposition to attempt to interpret them in such a way.  They represent in tangible form our concern and our care that the disadvantaged children in our society be given every opportunity to advance in the educational system.  Such sensitivity stands out in stark contrast to the insensitive approach by the former Administration.</P>
    <P>I have already said that the economy measures of last year enabled me to order my priorities and to start the action programme <Col N="1420" /> this year.  I want to go further than that.  At a time when resources for education are scarce I want to ensure that the educational services are cost efficient and cost effective.</P>
    <P>I want to look at the expenditure on all our services.  If wastage can be identified, I want it eliminated.  I want, where possible, to transfer resources to meet the most pressing of our problems.  In other words, on behalf of the taxpayer, I want to get the best possible value for money, to extend the best possible education to as many children as possible.</P>
    <P>A major area we are examining urgently is that of the rationalisation and co-ordination of facilities at second-level. Not alone must I do so in the interest of better value for money but, more importantly, from the point of view of providing the best possible level of facilities in any given centre.</P>
    <P>Educational improvements can be achieved through a more effective and cost efficient use of resources.  I accept, of course, that this is a most sensitive area.  It demands, in the first instance, full consultation with the major interests at national level.</P>
    <P>As stated in the programme, I am arranging for my Department to initiate discussions as speedily as possible.  In this regard all traditions must be respected. A number of these traditions go back a long way in our educational history.  I will respect those traditions.  Having said that, I must make the point, however, that given a typical situation of two or three small post-primary schools in a given centre &mdash; all requiring replacement &mdash; it does not make either educational or financial sense to perpetuate that system. There should in such circumstances be a coming together of the school authorities and the seeking of a consensus on the form of a unitary school and management structure for the area.  Such is clearly in the educational and social interests of the pupils.  I intend to pursue this objective as best I can.  I hope I will have the co-operation of all the major educational interests in this objective.  In addition, I will also press for the co-ordination of facilities in existing centres where rebuilding is not in question.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1421" /> All of us involved in education &mdash; managers, teachers, parents, Minister and Department &mdash; are there for one purpose, namely, providing the best possible education and facilities for our young people.  I am responsible on behalf of the Government, through the Oireachtas, to the people for educational policy and its execution.  I cannot and do not intend to shirk that responsibility.</P>
    <P>In rationalising our post-primary facilities difficult decisions may have to be taken by me in individual cases.  It is my hope that my guiding principle &mdash; the best interests of our pupils &mdash; will be respected as the objective basis on which any decision will be made.  In this I am confident that I will have much co-operation and understanding from all in whatever lies ahead in this regard.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I want to refer to the principles underlying the Programme for Action.  I see the educational system enabling all citizens to have access to an education relevant to their needs, abilities and aptitudes.  The system requires updating on a continuing basis to take account of change, the development in technology and changing employment patterns.</P>
    <P>The programme seeks to make continuing education available for all and to equalise opportunities between the various socio-economic groups and between the sexes.  It postulates positive discrimination in favour of the educationally disadvantaged. It sees the development and flowering of our linguistic and cultural heritage.  Finally, it seeks to achieve a full partnership between all interests involved by way of consultation and maximum delegation of responsibility and authority.</P>
    <P>From those principles flow the programmes' proposals.  In addition, they order my own and the Government's priorities.  Our actions hitherto point the way towards our main priority &mdash; the care of the disadvantaged.  As the programme states, education cannot, by itself, redress the social imbalances in our society but it certainly has a major role to play.</P>
    <P>We must do all in our power to remove barriers to equality of opportunity facing <Col N="1422" /> the educationally, socially and economically deprived.  In this regard the period of compulsory education merits special attention.  It is the base of the educational pyramid.  It is at this initial stage of the education process that positive discriminatory action must begin.  My Government have this year taken the initial step by allocating £500,000 to this area.  It is our intention to build on that each year over the next four years, as resources permit.</P>
    <P>Initially the attention will be focussed on the major urban centres &mdash; Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  It is recognised, however, that other areas, including rural centres, must receive attention in due course.</P>
    <P>Access at every rung of the education ladder must be open to all.  Special care must be taken of the students who drop out before the end of compulsory schooling. The next category is those who drop out at the end of the compulsory cycle. Then there is the student of average or less than average ability who completes the Intermediate Certificate Course and who requires alternative courses at the Leaving Certificate cycle.</P>
    <P>These then are the young persons most in need of assistance.  They will be our special concern over the next four years. That is not to say, of course, that the third-level student is to be neglected; far from it.  The Government's objective is to provide third-level education for all those capable of benefiting from it.  What we want to ensure is that every child can be given the opportunity of reaching the highest rung of the education ladder. That is the essential task.</P>
    <P>I am firmly convinced that good relations, leading to a realistic partnership, are essential among the various educational interests.  I attach great importance to this factor.  The more we work together and co-operate in harmony, the more effective our educational system will be. For my part, I am committed to a greater delegation of authority and responsibility. I am also committed to achieving a partnership with all interests involved in the educational process.</P>
    <P>Achieving this ideal requires a great degree of trust, an avoidance of needless <Col N="1423" /> confrontation and a desire to co-operate. The less public confrontation there is, the better for the educational system.  It is my earnest hope that a harmonious relationship between all interests will be achieved.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go through the programme and highlight all its proposals.  I do, however, wish to refer to some of the specific provisions.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Curriculum and Examinations Board represents one of the most important initiatives ever taken in Irish education.  The 1980 White Paper envisaged a curriculum council.</P>
    <P>The board now set up and due to be established statutorily in two years time is a major advance on that proposal because it brings together the two very important aspects of post-primary education &mdash; curriculum and examinations. Too often in the past these matters have been considered in isolation from one another.  This is not the way things should be, as there is a very real danger that the influence of examinations can become much too dominant and limiting on teaching.</P>
    <P>I am determined to give maximum support to the board and to allow it the greatest possible freedom in its operation. Its members have been carefully chosen to represent a wide range of educational interests.  Already the board has set about establishing committees to assist in its work.  These committees are a vehicle through which teachers and other professional interests can be fully involved in the board's work.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the board does not mean of course that my Department will no longer have a role to play in educational policy formulation.  Far from it, the Department, particularly the inspectorates, will be in an even stronger position to bring forward new thinking and to establish closer working links with schools.</P>
    <P>The board, in association with my Department, will work as a close partnership in which no voice will dominate &mdash; in the true spirit of democracy.</P>
    <P>One important point is addressed in the Action Programme.  This refers to the <Col N="1424" /> introduction of a flexibility in the rules under which schools operate so that they can be free to adapt curricula more closely to local needs.  I believe that this new flexible approach will be greatly welcomed by school authorities.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the curriculum and examination board assign to it major tasks in relation to reforming the examination system.  In particular, the board has been asked to bring forward a new unified junior cycle assessment system to replace the intermediate and group certificate examinations.  The aim is to enable all pupils to have a certification of their achievements available to them at the end of the period of compulsory schooling.  In the past, too many young people left school without any formal qualification.  This has been a serious weakness in the system which must be redressed.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important that the examination system is appropriate to pupils across the whole ability range.  It is also vital to ensure that all pupils achieve an adequate standard in basic functional literacy and numeracy.</P>
    <P>At senior cycle level the Curriculum and Examinations Board has two major jobs to do immediately.  The first relates to a reform of the leaving certificate examination to make it a better measure of general education and in this regard to consider the feasibility and desirability of introducing a separate assessment system for selection for entry to third level degree courses.</P>
    <P>The second concerns the development of alternative senior cycle courses, more closely related to the world of work, including the extension of pre-employment courses to selected secondary schools.  In this respect the proposals to achieve a greater co-ordination between education and training programmes are of particular relevance.</P>
    <P>Our young people must be enabled to achieve their full potential.  The individual's qualities &mdash; spiritual, moral, intellectual, aesthetic and physical &mdash; must be developed.  On leaving school, the young person should have a trained mind, an openness to change and acceptable social skills.  What takes place within the four <Col N="1425" /> walls of the classroom determines in large part to what extent these objectives are achieved.  This, in turn, hinges on the quality and professionalism of the teacher.</P>
    <P>We are fortunate in this country that we have a highly trained and dedicated cadre of teachers.  I want to assist that professionalism by giving special attention to their pre-service and in-service training.  I am aware that for a number of years in-service training of teachers has been neglected.  Conscious as I am of the fundamental importance of the teacher within the classroom, I intend to develop significantly the in-service training of teachers.  A start has been made this year, a sum of £287,000 has been made available for in-service courses this year compared with £141,000 last year &mdash; an increase of over 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>At this point I want to make a special reference to sexism and sex stereotyping. Discussions on sexism and sex stereotyping sometimes provoke a hostile reaction among people whose understanding of these terms is limited.  Let me be quite clear that in speaking of these matters in connection with education what I am referring to is at the core and centre of educational policy, that of redressing as far as possible any inequalities of opportunity that occur within the system, and secondly, that of preparing our young people, all of our young people, for the demands which adult life is going to make on them.</P>
    <P>Nobody in education would consciously set out to discriminate against girls, to limit their horizons, to afford them lesser chances of full participation in adult life as professionals and as citizens. Nevertheless this happens to a substantial extent by virtue of the survival of traditional attitudes depicting in school texts a more limited role for women in society by virtue of traditional structures and provisions which militate against the opening up of a full range of subjects and of career prospects to girls.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of deep concern at any time because apart from being inherently wrong, no country can afford to neglect the development of half of its talent.  It becomes a matter of even greater concern <Col N="1426" /> when many of the jobs which were traditionally filled by women are rapidly disappearing with the advance of technology.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Action sets out a strategy which will help to correct these defects in our educational system.  At the attitudinal level much of this strategy consists of convincing parents, educators, publishers and pupils themselves, both boys and girls, that they are not well served by the maintenance of these traditional attitudes.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to deal with the topic of sexism as a component of in-service courses for teachers.  Discussions are planned with publishers of school texts and the Curriculum and Examinations Board has a specific remit to ensure that sexism/sex stereotyping is not reflected in the curriculum set down for the schools.</P>
    <P>Regional seminars will be held during the present year aimed at making school managers and teachers more aware of all aspects of differentiation based on sex within the school situation and in particular in relation to curricular provision and subject choice.  Discussions will be undertaken with school management authorities with a view to ensuring that women will be adequately represented on selection boards for posts within the educational service.</P>
    <P>Co-operation between boys' and girls' schools has in many areas contributed to an enlargement of curricular provision and subject choice.  School authorities will be encouraged to extend such co-operation also as a means of securing a better preparation for both boys and girls for the challenges of adult life.</P>
    <P>I am confident that much good-will exists within the education sector and that the harnessing of this good-will will produce positive action in the direction of eliminating sexism and sex stereotyping in our educational system.</P>
    <P>I believe that educating boys and girls together is more in keeping with the concept of equality between the sexes and provides a better basis for developing co-operative but equal roles for men and women in adult life.  There is no question, however, of forcing co-education on people.  The views of parents must be <Col N="1427" /> respected and the practical difficulties, particularly in the case of large urban schools, have to be reckoned with.  But proposals for new schools on a co-educational basis will be encouraged and the reorganisation of school provision on that basis will be facilitated.</P>
    <P>In this regard it may not be generally appreciated how much co-education there is already in our system.  In national schools more than half the pupils are in co-educational schools.  In all 75 per cent of national schools are co-educational. At the second level roughly half of the schools are co-educational and account for about half of the pupils.</P>
    <P>The role of parents as the primary educators of their children is enshrined in our Constitution.  None of us needs to be reminded of the efforts and the sacrifices which Irish parents have made down the years for the education of their children, but because they were not organised as such, parents have not been in a position to make their full contribution to discussion and decision-making in education.  I believe that parents have a central role to play and a special wisdom to contribute in all matters relating to the education of their children.  In drawing up the Programme for Action different parent groups were consulted and the proposals they put forward were taken into account.</P>
    <P>I have stressed in the programme the need for parents to organise themselves into a representative parents' council.  I have promised that I shall facilitate the setting up of such a council in any way that I can, and that I shall consult the council when established on matters relating to education.</P>
    <P>In the interim, as an earnest of my intention, I have nominated a parent representative to the Curriculum and Examinations Board.  Discussions are also taking place with a view to having parents represented on the boards of management of comprehensive schools, as is already the case in community schools.</P>
    <P>Primary education is the most fundamental of all our educational provision. It is in our 3,400 national schools <Col N="1428" /> throughout the country that the majority of our children first learn to socialise with their peers, first become aware of the wider world beyond the home, acquire the skills basic to living and to further learning.</P>
    <P>It is during this period of primary schooling that their characters and attitudes are developed and formed, that they inherit the value systems of our civilisation. It is during this period, too, as recent studies have shown, that their future life's chances are, to a very large degree, determined.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Action attaches a major priority to the funding of national schools in the allocation of resources available for education.  It does so because the Government recognise the importance of a proper environment, conducive to learning, for the children of this country.</P>
    <P>While chalk, talk and cornflakes boxes still have their uses, it is abundantly clear that the resources required for proper teaching and learning are becoming sophisticated and expensive.  It is essential that our national schools be equipped and maintained to the best possible extent which our resources will allow.</P>
    <P>In this connection I would wish to pay tribute to the managerial authorities and local communities who share with the State the burden of financing the operational costs of our national school system. The inflationary increase in such costs in recent years have left many school boards of management in positions of difficulty in covering the basics of heating, cleaning and lighting.  Maintenance and the acquisition of requisities, learning aids and equipment have had, in many cases, to be postponed, or have had to depend on the further voluntary efforts of the community.</P>
    <P>In such a situation, the schools in the poorer and disadvantaged areas are the ones which suffer most.  They are the least able to meet, let alone supplement, the basic local contribution.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate, then, that the first proposal of the action programme to be implemented in the provisions for 1984, was the granting of a substantial increase of £4 in the capitation grant to national <Col N="1429" /> schools, the largest single increase since such grants were established in 1975-76. There is a special provision, too, of some £500,000 in the present year, to give extra aid to schools which cater for a high proportion of disadvantaged children or for children with special educational needs.</P>
    <P>The programme also proposes that an examination be carried out as to whether the present system of funding based totally on enrolments can deal adequately with the variety of changing circumstances found in national schools. This examination will be undertaken without delay.</P>
    <P>An important policy initiative of all Governments over the past decade has been the progressive improvement of pupil/teacher ratio in national schools, as a result of which pupil/teacher ratio and average class size were substantially reduced.  The estimated overall pupil/teacher ratio for January 1983 was 27.33:1 and the average class size for ordinary classes was 30.57.  The pupil/teacher ratio in Ireland is considered high by comparison to that obtaining in our neighbouring island and in most countries of the European Community. What is frequently overlooked in these comparisons is that improvements were achieved in many of these countries by simply maintaining teacher numbers at a time of falling enrolments.  Improvements here in our country, by contrast, have had to be achieved at a time of growing pupil numbers and at very considerable extra cost to the taxpayer as numbers of teachers were increased.</P>
    <P>The Vote for Primary Education reflects very strongly the labour-intensive nature of our primary education service. In the Estimates for the Public Services for 1984, for example, from a total of approximately £349 million, in the Vote for Primary Education, more than £268 million is accounted for by teachers' salaries.  When capital is excluded, a staggering 94.9 per cent of the Vote is accounted for by pay and superannuation provision.</P>
    <P>A reduction of one point in the pupil/teacher ratio, from 27.33:1 to 26.33:1 would entail an estimated 775 teaching posts and add some £7 million <Col N="1430" /> annually to the salaries bill.  It is against this background that the Programme for Action makes its proposals in respect of improvements in the teaching service.</P>
    <P>When resources are scarce it makes educational, as well as economic sense to assign them to areas of greatest need. While not losing sight of the objective of improvement in the overall pupil/teacher ratio as soon as financial circumstances permit, the programme proposes to allocate such extra teaching resources as become available to the alleviation of educational disadvantage and to the remedying of difficulties which certain pupils experience in acquiring the basic literacy and numeracy skills.  A concerted effort in this direction will, with the co-operation of teachers, school authorities and my Department, secure a more certain educational future for the children in question and contribute significantly to their life chances.</P>
    <P>It would be an extremely difficult task to put an exact capital value on our total stock of national schools throughout the country.  It is possible to estimate that the replacement value of the stock at current prices would be of the order of £1,000 million.  Since 1976, more than £155 million has been spent on grant-aiding the building and improvement of national schools.</P>
    <P>Manifestly then, the maintenance and improvement of the existing school stock, as well as the planning for replacement and for the provision of new schools has significant economic and financial implications.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Action addresses these implications.  It proposes to examine the existing financial arrangements for the maintenance of national schools so as to ensure that internal and external painting, which helps to extend the useful life of the buildings, as well as keeping them in a condition appropriate to an educational environment, is carried out on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>Refinement in the planning of school provision, in the light of recent information on the peaking of demand for national school places, is envisaged, as well as exercises in the joint planning of primary and post-primary school facilities <Col N="1431" /> so as to extend the optimum usage of school buildings.</P>
    <P>These developments, as well as improvements of a practical nature in the administration of the national schools building programme will be facilitated by the Government's decision to transfer responsibility for the technical aspects of this programme from the Office of Public Works to the Department of Education. Discussions are taking place at official level with a view to the implementation of this decision at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>The Government are concerned that our national school buildings should cater adequately for the curricular and environmental requirements of our school-going population.  An expression of this concern was the voting in the context of the budget of an extra £2.0 million for the improvement and extension of national schools, over and above that provided for primary school building in the Estimates for the Public Services, 1984.</P>
    <P>A policy of amalgamation of smaller national schools was pursued vigorously from the mid-sixties to the mid-seventies. While this policy brought about a significant reduction in the number of smaller schools, a substantial proportion, more than 30 per cent, of our national schools were still, in 1981-82, of the one teacher, or two teacher category.</P>
    <P>The policy of amalgamation is essentially educationally derived, in that it recognises the practical difficulties of teaching together children of widely varying span of age and ability.  These difficulties are enhanced by the continually increased demands being made on the school curriculum by the expansion of knowledge and the complexity of everday living.</P>
    <P>It is intended during the period of the programme that this policy of amalgamation be maintained and that wherever practicable, following consultation with parents, teachers and school authorities, smaller schools be consolidated into more viable educational units.</P>
    <P>An aspect of amalgamation policy hitherto was that it applied mainly to rural <Col N="1432" /> areas.  The arguments for amalgamating urban schools, where the enrolment has fallen well below the capacity of the provision, are compelling, both on grounds of financial viablility and range of educational services.  The possibilities of amalgamating such schools will also be pursued during the period of the programme.</P>
    <P>If I might mention the curriculum at primary level, the curriculum of the primary schools was reviewed and a new curriculum introduced in 1971.  There are a number of important qualities with respect to this curriculum which it is important to emphasise.  One is that it is child-centred, the second is that it is an integrated curriculum and the third that it is highly flexible, affording the professionally trained treacher the opportunity to interpret it in a way which best suits the circumstances of the children she is teaching.</P>
    <P>Any broadly based surveys carried out on the primary curriculum have indicated that it has a high level of acceptability among teachers, pupils and parents and that it has added significantly to the scope and range of primary education.</P>
    <P>The various aspects of the curriculum have been the subject of a number of evaluative studies by the curriculum unit of the Department of Education and the publication of these studies during the period of the programme will provide a useful pointer to any changes or adaptations that may be required.</P>
    <P>The Curriculum and Examinations Board will take on responsibility for recommending such changes and will pay particular attention to the problems arising on the transfer of pupils from the child-centred primary to the subject-centred post-primary system.  Pilot projects of a curricular nature which it is planned to undertake during the period of the programme concern the teaching of science and of computing in selected schools.  The initial definition of these projects is being undertaken by the inspectors of my Department, following which consultation will take place with the appropriate authorities.</P>
    <P>It will be seen that the proposals regarding primary education in the Programme <Col N="1433" /> for Action are very practical and address themselves to three main themes. Firstly, the schools must be enabled to operate at the best possible level.  There is little point in spending large sums of money on teachers' salaries if they then have to go to work in schools where environmental and resource factors militate against good teaching and good learning.  Secondly, increased resources, to the extent that they are available, are directed towards pupils who are socially disadvantaged or otherwise experiencing learning difficulties.  It is our firm conviction that such a policy is justifiable at any time but is especially justifiable at a time when resources are scarce.  Thirdly, the proposals aim for increased efficiency in the planning, provision and use of schools, in their maintenance and preservation and in the implementation of curricular and teaching strategies which will be supported by in-service training. It is my hope, indeed my conviction, that the end of the four year period will see positive and tangible progress in primary education.</P>
    <P>In the chapter dealing with second level education the major issues of our time are examined.  The question of the structuring of the post-primary cycles will be addressed at a later date in the promised discussion paper linking the issues of the ages of entry to, transfer within and leaving from the educational system. Many of the topics discussed have curricular implications and will fall to be considered by the Curriculum and Examinations Board.  However, at the same time the general debate about them must also be given a wider audience.</P>
    <P>The programme sets out to ensure the rational and complementary development of the secondary, vocational and community/comprehensive sectors.  Each has its own strengths and our aim will be to draw on the best of all of them.  It is not in the interest of the development of our young people that these sectors should be in competition with one another, each out to protect or advance its own position.  Rather we must achieve harmony, complementarity and the maximum degree of co-operation between them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1434" /> In the sixties a veritable revolution occurred in Irish education in that almost overnight access to full second-level education became available to all Irish children.  Widespread access to this level is now taken for granted and it is agreed by most people that the time is now ripe for us to consolidate our achievements. This consolidation is to take the form of examining more closely the system of second-level schooling to ensure its continuing significance and relevance to the individual pupil and to society as a whole. This scrutiny of our second-level system of education is, in my opinion, a task of even greater fundamental significance than the decisions of the sixties, in the sense that it is going to require self-examination of a high philosophical nature which will demand from educators and adults in our society a commitment calling for great discipline, learning and humility.</P>
    <P>The general area of education for life is already the subject of several quite unique educational pilot schemes in this country and of many special programmes formulated by individual schools in response to these needs.  Convent and Protestant schools in particular have done some remarkable work in this area.</P>
    <P>Adolescents are becoming more and more the object of commercial interests and an extensive teenage industry has developed based on their buying power. This industry make use of widespread advertising and aims at creating new needs, desires and preferences.  This, unfortunately, strengthens adolescents' identity as a separate group and widens the gulf between them and the parent generation.</P>
    <P>Furthermore the role of parents as primary educators and counsellors has been eroded with the advent of modern technology and developments in the mass media.  Non-occupational training, which parents once gave to their children, has been taken out of their hands, not by the teacher but by the very social changes which has separated adolescents into a society of their own.  Adolescents may now be an independent youth culture. Yet modern research continues to indicate <Col N="1435" /> general goodwill of adolescents towards family and school.</P>
    <P>Do our schools, or do schools anywhere, respond positively on behalf of pupils' needs?  I believe there is a positive growing awareness, born of genuine concern and humility, in our society that we have not been doing enough to support adolescents and that it is time that we responded on several fronts to help our teenagers to gain fulfilment on as many planes as possible.</P>
    <P>The whole question of sex education needs to be addressed urgently.  This is of course an area of particular delicacy and sensitivity.  It is important to involve all the relevant parties, parents, teachers, school management, social workers, Health Education Bureau, together to formulate a programme of sex education which would be open to all schools to use.  The Action Programme stresses the importance of collaboration between agencies to achieve the formal introduction of health education in all schools. Sex education is an important aspect of this.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of course that many schools have already devised very successful programmes of sex education.  In this they have had regard to the views of parents.  In many cases sex education is dealt with in the context of pastoral care programmes, or religious education classes, alongside the straightforward informational aspects which arise in classes such as in science and home economics. I am anxious to encourage all schools to face up to these issues.  I am told that boys schools in particular have still a long way to go in this respect.</P>
    <P>For my part I want to ensure that assistance will be forthcoming from my Department in helping schools to plan sex education programmes.  Within the present range of subjects at secondary level there is the means to create eventually a positive approach to dispelling ignorance of elementary areas of sexuality and of offering students constructive guidelines for fulfilling their social and personal potential.  But the usual problem exists: a subject-based approach where there is no effective cross-reference <Col N="1436" /> between the subjects which can incorporate this knowledge.  This is one of the major tasks confronting the Curriculum and Examinations Board: making the subject-based curriculum more flexible in a school staff's mind so that it can cope with urgent or ongoing problems which do not lend themselves to treatment in single subject areas.</P>
    <P>Today as never before our young people are exposed to the widespread availability of drugs.  Drugs are an additional hazard to be encountered by boys and girls in the process of growing up. Drugs education must be seen in the context of preparation for life and not separated out for special attention.</P>
    <P>A series of information days for teachers from schools in &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; areas have been planned and will commence shortly. These seminars will provide information for teachers and will provide a means of consultation on further action.  The information days will be followed up by longer courses of about one week's duration for selected teachers so that progress will be made towards the goal of having at least one teacher per school in &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; areas in a position to advise on issues relating to drugs.  These courses will commence in the summer.</P>
    <P>My Department are co-operating with the health education bureau in updating the training of a group of 25 teachers who took a course some years ago so that they might be available to parent groups and to other teachers to give talks on drugs.</P>
    <P>Collaboration has begun with the Health Education Bureau in the production of material which may be used for drugs education.  A set of video film has been developed and these are being used on a pilot basis in about 40 schools.  These will be available for wider dissemination, with accompanying teaching notes, before the end of this school year.  In addition there is co-operation in the production of a general drugs education package for schools.  It is planned to continue to develop a range of materials.</P>
    <P>A diploma course in addiction studies has been established in Trinity College. This course is being funded by the Department of Health for an initial three-year trial period.  I hope that some <Col N="1437" /> interested teachers will be enabled to attend this course.</P>
    <P>I realise that it will take time for educational action to affect what is happening on our streets and elsewhere.  I realise, as well, that education alone is not the only answer.  I feel that a good beginning has been made.  What is important is that what we are doing is developed and sustained and that we do not allow ourselves to become complacent.  I hope that the actions I have mentioned will attract broad support and that these will make an important and continuing contribution to the prevention of drug abuse.</P>
    <P>Another important thrust of the action programme is the emphasis on the development of science and technology in educational programmes.</P>
    <P>In recent years scientific and technological developments in microelectronics, telecommunications and data processing techniques have had profound effects not only on industrial and commercial activities but also on society in general.</P>
    <P>As a consequence, there have been many changes both of a qualitative and quantitative nature which affect virtually all members of society.  Indications are that the rate of advance in scientific knowledge and technological know-how will continue at an equally rapid pace.  It is predicted that by the year 2000, not so far away, the amount of knowledge available will be three to four times more than the amount available today.</P>
    <P>As we have a small open economy with a high percentage of our population in school, it is important that the educational system is capable of producing persons with appropriate expertise and skills.</P>
    <P>In order to optimise the social impact of technological change, educational programmes must be designed so as to ensure that pupils acquire the requisite knowledge and flexibility of approach to be able to adapt to technological changes and to assimilate new knowledge throughout their adult lives.</P>
    <P>We must promote and foster in young people creative talents and encourage the acquisition of entrepreneurial skills.  In this respect the advances made in the <Col N="1438" /> information technologies and in particular in microcomputing systems are of great significance.</P>
    <P>It is now generally accepted that in so far as it is possible, all pupils in post-primary schools should have some knowledge about the applications, limitations and implications for society of the new information technologies and in particular of computing systems.</P>
    <P>In order to enable all schools to provide computer awareness programmes, micro-computers, as stated in the Programme for Action, will be supplied to all post-primary schools which have not already benefited by the scheme and which have suitably trained teachers to use them.</P>
    <P>Appropriate in-service courses in computer studies will be provided in 1984 and subsequent years to ensure that teachers will be given opportunities to acquire competencies in the educational uses and applications of microcomputers.  Microcomputers will also be provided in the principal teacher centres.</P>
    <P>In order to make the most effective use of microcomputers in schools my Department has sought the views of management and teaching interests on various strategies relating to the development of computer education.  It is hoped that arising from this it will be possible to introduce some new computer based innovations in the near future.</P>
    <P>It is encouraging for me as Minister for Education to witness the increase in co-operation between schools and industrial interests.  Particularly at a time of economic constraints and financial restrictions, I am glad to know that strong links between industry and schools are being forged and that a number of industries have initiated schemes whereby schools in their locality can avail of their services and in certain instances acquire equipment and materials for school use at little or no cost.</P>
    <P>In the area of modern languages the need has long been felt for a form of assessment that takes full account of aural/oral skills.  This need has been articulated over a period of years by the language associations, the universities, the teacher unions and by commercial and <Col N="1439" /> industrial interests.  It is a lack in our assessment procedures of which I have been personally conscious.  It is now a source of satisfaction to me that preleaving-cert classes in French, German, Spanish and Italian are at this moment preparing for a new format of examination which includes a listening component. This means that in June 1985 candidates will, for the first time in this country, be examined on their ability to understand the authentic spoken language. I am pleased to state too that the written papers for that year and the years following will test candidates' reading fluency and their ability to respond in a personal rather than an academic way to written questions.</P>
    <P>It is clear that reform of this order cannot be carried out without Government investment.  Teachers must be given opportunities of attending information sessions, in-service courses in teaching methods, language-proficiency courses at home and in the foreign country whose language they teach.</P>
    <P>As well as raising the allocation for in-service courses, my Department has already embarked on a scheme for the provision of cassette-recorders to schools.  This scheme is to continue over the next few years.  The reforms in modern language teaching that are already under way have by and large been welcomed by practising teachers.  The importance of oral competence in languages goes far beyond the world of education alone.  It is very important for our economy generally that there is a high level of language competence among those who will market our products abroad.  There is also the question of an increasingly mobile work force throughout Europe generally and this gives an added impetus to the need to develop language skills.  On both these accounts I am most anxious to see schools encourage the learning of what are sometimes called `minority' languages, particularly German, Spanish and Italian.  A question can be raised as to why so many schools concentrate exclusively or principally on French.</P>
    <P>The need to co-ordinate educational <Col N="1440" /> and training activities has been mentioned in the programme and the Government have appointed Deputy George Birmingham as Minister of State at the Department of Education as well as at the Department of Labour.</P>
    <P>He is in the process of consulting all the interests involved and will be reporting to the Minister for Labour and myself and through the Ministers to the Government on the measures which he sees as necessary to bring about greater co-ordination of education and training activities, to eliminate any waste or overlapping and to concentrate available resources in a way which will deliver the best possible service to our young people.</P>
    <P>The EEC pilot projects on transition from school to work, the first series of which have been completed and the second series of which have recently been launched, have highlighted the needs in this area and the kind of programmes required to meet those needs.</P>
    <P>The revamped guidelines for projects eligible for assistance under the European Social Fund have put great emphasis on basic vocational training and preparation for work.</P>
    <P>The opportunity for providing new and expanded courses afforded by the new emphasis in the Social Fund regulations is being actively pursued by my Department and the lines on which developments could proceed have been indicated in the programme.</P>
    <P>Such developments would accord closely with the priority tasks which have been assigned to the Curriculum and Examinations Board and would herald a greater emphasis within the education system on provision for those for whose needs the present academically weighted programmes do not provide the answer.</P>
    <P>The chapter on third-level education in the Programme for Action is written in the context of the growing number of young people who will be seeking entry into third-level institutions.  Unlike most other European countries, we have a growing population.  While the rate of increase in our school-going population is slowing down at primary and secondary level we are only now experiencing the brunt of the population growth at third <Col N="1441" /> level.  In terms of actual numbers, the third-level student population in 1982-83 was of the order of 47,000.  It is anticipated that by the end of the decade this number will have increased by about 20,000.</P>
    <P>The Government are committed to providing third-level education for as many young people as possible and it is, therefore, very important that every effort should be made to make the system more cost effective and to improve productivity. The Programme for Action lays great stress on considerations of this kind and indicates a number of areas which would repay attention.  All of the proposals in the programme will be taken up in discussions with the authorities of the various institutions involved and particularly with the Higher Education Authority, the IVEA and the National Council for Educational Awards.</P>
    <P>The emphasis on cost effectiveness and improved productivity is one side of the coin, the other side of which is the provision of additional places and the updating of equipment and facilities generally, all of which must be financed out of the Public Capital Programme.  The position in this regard in the years immediately ahead will be considered by the Government as part of the medium-term capital programme which is at present being drawn up.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that no matter what may be achieved in terms of cost-efficiency and greater utilisation of resources, increased numbers of students will give rise to substantial increases in the provision of current funding also. This leads inevitably to consideration of the level of fees to be charged to students. In the university sector, students fees have been increased regularly over the last few years.  For the current academic year, fees were increased substantially in the technological sector but from a very low base in comparison to the fees charged to university students.  Notwithstanding these increases, the total current cost of university education met from fees is still only about 17 per cent whereas in the early seventies fees accounted for 20 per cent of the total costs.</P>
    <P>In the non-university sector, fees represent <Col N="1442" /> a lower percentage of the total costs.  It has been the policy of Coalition Governments to provide aid for students who could not otherwise afford to avail of third-level education.  As evidence of this policy it must be pointed out that the Coalition Government announced major improvements in the higher education grants scheme for the year 1981-82.  The improvements brought about in student aid schemes at that time may be gauged from the fact that in 1980-81 the total expenditure on the higher education grants scheme was £4 million and there were 5,021 grant holders.  By 1982-83 expenditure had more than doubled and the number of grant holders had increased by almost 50 per cent to 7,410. In the case of the VEC scholarship scheme there were 1,762 scholarship holders in 1980-81 and the cost was £953,000.  By 1982-83 the number of scholarship holders had increased by more than 150 per cent to 4,440 and the cost more than quadrupled to £4.04 million.</P>
    <P>The Government are naturally concerned to ensure that the level of fees is not pitched at a level which would adversely affect the numbers of students availing of third-level education.  There is a need, therefore, to examine this question carefully to see if alternative funding arrangements are possible.  It is with this in view that the Programme for Action refers to the possibility of a mixed grant-loan system of student aid.  The programme points out that such a scheme is under consideration at present by the Government and that an announcement on it will be made in due course.</P>
    <P>In the foreword to the programme I refer to the scope of the consultations held with the various interest groups and this applied to those involved in third-level education as much as any other sector.  I look forward to continuing that consultation with the relevant interests.</P>
    <P>The Government's role with regard to third level education is not solely one of making provision for an increased number of places.  Since the sixties there has been an unprecedented surge of activity in the development of new institutions <Col N="1443" />&mdash; the regional technical colleges, the national institutes for higher education for example &mdash; and in developing new roles for existing institutions &mdash; the development of new courses in the colleges of education is an obvious example.</P>
    <P>As a necessary corollary to this activity, we have had the growth of new regulatory agencies to cater for the orderly expansion of new and old institutions. The Higher Education Authority and the National Council for Educational Awards are the most important of these agencies.  The work of providing a legislative framework for the changed situation at third level is not yet complete.  In particular, there is a need to consider whether legislation is required to break up the National University of Ireland and to provide a modern responsive, democratic structure of government for the university institutions formed as a result of this break-up.</P>
    <P>The contribution by our universities to economic growth, to political stability and to social development has been inestimable. Distinguished scholars from our universities have rubbed shoulders with the world's outstanding intellectual giants.  The inter-action between State, industry, trade unions and universities is a full and mutually rewarding one and I consider that political life is all the richer because it has attracted eminent academics to its ranks.</P>
    <P>The challenge facing universities today to work with me and the Government in finding ways to throw open our resources to a bigger number of young people is as great as anything that has faced them in the past.  I know they will face that challenge with generosity and true patriotism.</P>
    <P>During the period of the Programme for Action extensive consultations are envisaged with the providers of teacher education at both first and second levels. These consultations will be concerned both with the quantitative and the qualitative side of teacher education.  On the quantitative side there has for many years been a need to refine methods of fore-casting teacher requirement.  It would be difficult to defend to taxpayers the <Col N="1444" /> maintenance of a capacity to train teachers in excess of our needs, or to young people the maintenance of a system which would offer them training for a profession which many of them would never be able to exercise.  On the qualitative side it is some years now since the Bachelor of Education degree courses for primary teachers have been established and it stands to reason that the review envisaged at the time of their establishment should take place at an early date.</P>
    <P>In-service training as a concept is widely accepted throughout industry, business and the professions.  In the field of education teachers have to cope with the advances in knowledge in their subjects, with the changes in pedagogic methods signalled by research and evaluation, with the inclusion of new disciplines in schools and the redundancy of old ones, with the varying curricular demands set down by curriculum planners and developers.  Much of this adaptation to change is carried out by teachers on a personal basis because teachers are, in the last analysis, students in their own right.  Support structures for in-service training are however necessary and in the main these consist of courses organised by the Department, by various professional organisations or by the teachers themselves in association with the teacher centres.</P>
    <P>Adult education is an area where it is important for us to clarify priorities.  To do this we must await publication of the Adult Education Commission's Report. However, the Action Programme promises that literacy provision will receive special attention.  As an earnest of our intentions here, I am pleased to tell the House, that for the first time ever a grant of £10,000 will be made this year to the National Adult Literacy Agency to support them in their extremely important work, as I am much impressed by all that they are doing.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that our debate on the Programme for Action in Education should conclude with a discussion of the proposals regarding the Irish language and culture.  The position in the debate defines it as the last but by no means the least of our concerns.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1445" /> I would say that had every institution in our society supported the Irish language as well as our schools have done in the past, then there is little doubt but that Irish would be a vernacular language in daily use in this country to a much greater extent than it is at present.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate too that I should pay tribute to teachers generally, but particularly to the teachers in national schools who in the early years of the State gave sterling service to a language revival policy which was then seen as essential to the development and maintenance of our self-image as a distinctive people and nation.  Their efforts continued throughout the years with diminishing support from the environment outside of the school and under increasing assault from the ready access to media messages and entertainment in the world language, English.  Many would have given up in despair, but our teachers persisted and they have weathered criticisms about the standard and position of Irish in the schools when many of these criticisms might have been more appropriately directed at the lack of a supportive and applicative environment outside the school, which is essential for the progress of a living language.</P>
    <P>The Irish language remains as essential to our recognition as a distinctive people, as a source of a culture from which we can contribute much of unique and inestimable value to the civilisation of Europe and the world.  What Plean Ghníomhaíochta na Gaeilge in conjunction with the Action Programme for Education offers is the opportunity for a new beginning.  For the first time Irish is seen, not as a replacement of the world language, English, but as a vernacular national language that can and should co-exist with English in a bilingual society.</P>
    <P>Specific actions and targets are set down for the Gaeltacht, for the State and for the community generally as well as for education.  These actions and targets are and should be supportive of one another, so that the education sector in undertaking its component of the task will not be acting alone.  From this broad approach should emerge a new environment <Col N="1446" /> in relation to Irish, an environment which will be supportive of our young people in the learning of the language, an environment which will afford them the opportunity to use what they learn outside the confines of the school and stimulate them to do so, but above all an environment which has defined and accepted our national language and culture as something which we must retain and develop in all aspects of our life as Irish people.</P>
    <P>In my foreword to the Programme for Action, I stated that it was the Government's hope that the programme would initiate a constructive debate on the educational system.  I look forward to today's debate.  I look forward, too, to continuing discussions with the various educational interests.  I am not naive enough to think for one moment that the production of this document will be the panacea for all the ills in the educational system.  I need hardly tell this House that I am aware now, as never before, of the complexities in education and the challenges which face us.</P>
    <P>Of course, there are difficulties. Resources are going to be scarce, but that is the spur to greater effort.  There is much that we can do to improve the quality of our education system without resources or with small additional resources.  I submit that the Programme for Action sets out clear courses of action which will guide us on the right lines for the next four years.</P>
    <P>I commend the programme to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>As Fianna Fáil spokesperson for education I welcome the opportunity to debate the recently published <i>Programme for Action in Education</i> for the Years 1984-87.  A programme for action in any sphere of activity is a worthy and sensible objective. Goals and objectives if clearly defined and realistically costed are useful sign-posts to persons operating within that sphere of activity.  The Minister's programme is full of correct educational concern but there is very little commitment of cash.  The booklet and the Minister's speech show a strong awareness of the <Col N="1447" /> problems in education but there are no promises of definite action.  I would cavil at the title of the booklet which states that it is a programme for action.  It is a programme for deferred action, for action in the future at some unspecified date.</P>
      <P>The Minister said her proposals were not a wish list of hopes.  In preparing my speech I said that many of the outlined proposals read like a shopping list of highly admirable but deferred educational aspirations.  Throughout the publication we see references to &ldquo;training of teachers &mdash; pre-service and in-service &mdash; will be given special attention within the overall limited resources that will be available for education&rdquo; and &ldquo;when it is possible to consider the re-establishment of these schemes...&rdquo;.  That refers to the appointment of caretakers and clerical assistants.</P>
      <P>There are various references to the proposals for the future.  In many instances the document clearly identifies the problems and the needs, but fails to come up with realistic proposals.  Any plan for any sphere of activity has cost implications which should be listed realistically. Otherwise such a plan loses much of its authority and authenticity.</P>
      <P>We see sentences like &ldquo;Such a thing will be reviewed&rdquo;, &ldquo;can be considered later&rdquo;, &ldquo;when it is possible&rdquo;, &ldquo;as soon as resources permit&rdquo;.  They can be seen throughout the whole programme.  They do not inspire much hope or confidence that positive action will be taken despite the title of the book.</P>
      <P>I am very glad the Minister recognises that substantial progress has been made in the educational system over the past two decades.  In any review of a forward plan we have to look back at past developments and talk about them before dealing with what we hope to do in the future.  In paragraph 1.16 of the preamble the Minister set out the phenomenal growth in education over the past two decades almost.  She said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of primary school pupils has increased from 505,000 in 1966 to 574,000 in 1983, while teacher numbers <Col N="1448" /> rose from about 15,000 to 20,000.  Following the introduction of &ldquo;free education&rdquo; numbers in second-level schools increased from 143,000 to 325,000 in the period 1966 to 1983, while the number of teachers rose from 9,000 to 19,000 in the fourteen years to 1983.  At third level the number of university students increased over the same period from 13,000 to 24,000.</P>
    <P>There has been a forecast of a further bulge in the third level educational system towards the end of this decade.</P>
    <P>The quotation continues:</P>
    <P>Successive Governments since 1966 have consistently been committed to the development of the educational system...  Among the major developments were the provision of nine new Regional Technical Colleges, the establishment of two National Institutes of Higher Education, the setting up of forty-two new Community schools, a massive building programme at all levels of the system and an extended scheme of Higher Education Grants and Scholarships.</P>
    <P>During those years I was starting out on my teaching career.  I witnessed a great deal of that growth without realising at the time that I was witnessing it, particularly the growth in the late sixties and early seventies.  It behoves all of us to reflect on that phenomenon of the massive growth in education and the advances made to cope with it.</P>
    <P>In doing so we recall the distinguished names which were associated with that massive educational development such as the late Donogh O'Malley, the late Minister for Education.  The Minister did not refer to him by name but she referred to the impetus given by the overnight announcement of &ldquo;free&rdquo; second level education and the opening up of the second level educational system to young people at one stroke.  It was a marvellous thing to do.  It showed imagination and initiative.  He looked at the problem and decided there were huge inequalities. Large numbers of pupils were not able to go to second level schools.  Later in life they would look back with opprobrium <Col N="1449" /> at the society which had not provided the opportunity for them.  He looked at the problem and then he tackled it.</P>
    <P>As we are at such an important stage of development in education now, it behoves all of us to pay tribute to him.  I should also like to pay tribute to the work done by people like President Hillery, Deputy Wilson, Deputy Faulkner, Commissioner Burke, Deputy Boland, the present Minister for the Public Service; Dr. Martin O'Donoghue and Deputy Brady.  Perhaps I have left out some people but those are the names which spring to my mind.  A tremendous tribute is due to the foresight and skill of these former Ministers for Education.</P>
    <P>As the Minister correctly pointed out, everybody is involved in education &mdash; parents, teachers, young people and educationalists.  Credit is due to all of them.  They saw the challenges and they rose to them and produced plans for positive action.  Looking back we remember the stories about the late Donogh O'Malley and how he got his way with regard to the announcement of the opening up of second level education.  It was an act of bravado and in retrospect it was quite right.</P>
    <P>The Minister identified various programmes of action and she went through the various stages of education.  Later I will comment on her speech if I have time.  This document was the format in which the plan was put to us.  That is the format I shall adopt for my contribution. The plan went on to deal with primary education.  In regard to that level of education, as one involved in the teaching profession, I fully support the expressed declaration in the action plan with regard to placing special emphasis &mdash; I hope this also means special financing &mdash; on disadvantaged groups and areas.  I am committed, as my party have been down the years, to the idea that special emphasis should be placed on aiding disadvantaged groups.  I am sure any person remotely connected with education is committed to that idea also.  In conjunction with that, special emphasis will have to go special financing.  The £500,000 to be given to primary school disadvantaged areas this year is not realistic <Col N="1450" /> to support the hopes expressed in the plan.  The commitment is specific but it is irrelevant when one considers the extent of the problem that exists in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>I should like to tell the House that the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party are carrying out a review of the primary education system.  We are consulting with experts in this area and they have indicated to us that there is a great need for more remedial teachers and a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools, especially in disadvantaged areas.  The Minister's allocation to commence this programme in 1984 is a token amount.  There is need for a greater financial commitment.  A stronger political will is needed if the programme is to achieve what is expressed in the action plan.</P>
    <P>I should like now to refer to the input of a former Minister for Education, Deputy Faulkner, to the Rutland Street project.  There are many lessons to be learned from that project, in particular that changes in the young child's total environment will greatly increase the effect of positive intervention in the educational system and the input by parents in the educational development of their children.  I discussed this project at length with Deputy Faulkner.  In this context I should like to express my appreciation to those who have been involved in education in Fianna Fáil for the assistance they have given me since my appointment as spokesperson on Education. Deputy Faulkner is still very interested in the area of dealing with disadvantaged young children.  The Rutland Street experiment did not fail but, unfortunately, such experiments did not take place elsewhere.  From the conversations I have had with those involved in that scheme I am convinced that it is a model for other disadvantaged areas.  I liked the idea that parents went to the school with their young children.  The children were not divorced from the culture and the environment from which they had come. At second level I have had experience of dealing with disadvantaged children and I found that children were unable to cope with the lack of motivation in their home environment and what was put on offer <Col N="1451" /> to them at school.  There was an enormous cultural gap.  It is a huge undertaking for such children to go through a formalised setting that is in our educational system in which there are rules to be obeyed.  In fact, they must adopt two different roles if they come from a disadvantaged home.</P>
    <P>One of the most beneficial aspects of the Rutland Street project was that it was a two-way process of sharing with the parents and children receiving benefits in return.  The children benefited because of the presence of one of their parents.  It was not necessarily the mother who was involved in going to the school with the child.  In today's climate where some families have just one wage earner it may happen that the father would be the person to go to the school with the child.  In the Rutland Street project the children were not removed too much from their home scene because they were close to a comforting family figure.  Parents benefited because they witnessed a formal type of education for their children, although it was not in a very structured sense, as one would expect for children between three and six years of age.  Parents in the Rutland Street project were exposed to a type of educational system and they could see knowledge being imparted.  Projects such as that should be carried out in other areas.  I hope the projects outlined in the Minister's programme will take cognisance of the Dublin experiment.  I am sure that an examination of that project would indicate that it was not all of a valuable nature but a lot of it was.</P>
    <P>I intend to ask the Minister at Question Time in the coming weeks to give details of the schools listed for assistance under her scheme.  I am glad the Minister did not rule out rural schools for that type of assistance.  We tend to think that disadvantaged children live in built-up urban areas where there is bad housing, overcrowding, an element of malnutrition or a lack of facilities such as libraries. Another type of deprivation occurs in rural communities.  I intend to ask the Minister how many children will benefit from her scheme, how many are listed as <Col N="1452" /> being disadvantaged and how many teachers will be employed to deal with those children.  I will be asking the Minister what skills the teachers will have. However, we must have a commitment also to the lowering of the pupil-teacher ratio.  I accept that the Minister announced that there is a commitment to lowering that ratio, but her statement was vague.</P>
    <P>Many of the problems experienced by disadvantage pupils would diminish if there was a more acceptable level of pupil-teacher ratio.  I am aware that at the early stages of second level it is possible to identify difficulties in reading or learning or social problems in pupils but it is not possible to do that if one has to deal with a large class.  One tries to do one's best by putting some children in a section of the classroom and giving them special attention, but one must always bear in mind the responsibility to the other children.  Parents are entitled to see that their children are not deprived because a teacher has a strong social conscience.  A lowering of the pupil-teacher ratio may not be the answer to all problems in regard to disadvantaged children but it would help.  It would help teachers identify the problems and then deal with them.  In the weeks and months ahead we hope to get this commitment in relation to this area.  I want to put on record my total approval of a commitment to cope with the disadvantaged. That would be an essential element of all educational systems.  In the weeks and months and, I hope, not too many years that I will be on this side of the House my quest will be for information in reply to queries dealing with the disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal to remove responsibility for national school building from the Commissioners of Public Works to the Department of Education.  This will eliminate many headaches and frustrations and I hope that the Minister will speed it up.  Dealing with the Board of Works and then the Department of Finance, back to the Board of Works and then being referred to the Department of Education, at this stage you give up and say that you will try again next week and <Col N="1453" /> contact somebody else.  It has always struck me as odd that when you would put your query you were told that it was, say, Deputy Bermingham's responsibility but it had to do with education.  We hope that will be sorted out and so the number of headaches and, we hope, the delay will be reduced.</P>
    <P>If I seem to compartmentalise or put education into slots I do not intend to do so because I believe strongly that education is interlinked and the areas within it are dependent on each other and what went before and what will come after. For this debate today I took my lines from the book which dealt with it in segments although it referred back and forward also and so for the purpose of clarity or elucidation that is how I will do it.  The transition from primary to second level should be explored fully, and I am glad to see that this issue is highlighted in this document.  Our party have been probing and discussing this a great deal and eventually something will be worked out in regard to it.  I used to think that on transition to second level somebody should have specific responsibility for dealing with pupils newly in from the primary school sector.  The committee's document outlined the suggestions of perhaps a teacher holding a post of responsibility for dealing with the transition of new pupils into second level.</P>
    <P>Now I wonder if it would be better to have in the final years of primary school a little more diversity of subjects, maybe diversity of teachers, perhaps a different way of teaching, so that the easy, happy way would continue but slightly more formalised; yet I would hope that the early stages of second level would be less stylised and formalised.  It is an area for growth to which I am sure the Curriculum and Examinations Board will devote themselves in their brief as needing attention.  Possibly I am boring the House in talking about myself, but when one has been in education it is very difficult not to give of one's experience just as a doctor talking about health gives of his experiences.  I see children coming in after travelling six or seven miles on buses on cold winter mornings and it is very difficult for these new pupils to cope with <Col N="1454" /> the system of second level with bells every 40 minutes, a new schoolmistress, schoolmaster or teacher, eight or nine subjects, being hushed along corridors into more subjects, more teachers, more timetables.  It is a wonder they cope, but young people have great resilience.  I am glad the book mentions that great area of development to which the curriculum board are appropriate.  That board would be concerned mainly with the leaving stages of primary school and second level curricula.</P>
    <P>The major challenge facing the board would be to appreciate and absorb into our education curricula the new technological subjects but yet to seek to retain our traditional academic base.  I have spoken about this previously and I make no excuses for referring to it again because I would not like us to be caught up in the computer and micro age without keeping in touch and in tandem with our traditional academic base which has given us and our young people a sound foundation and knowledge of our history, culture, traditions and language.  I hope that in our haste to keep up with the times we do not become unstuck.  This is a little <i>caveat</i> which I introduce here.</P>
    <P>As our party's spokesperson I welcome officially the setting up of the curriculum board.  I have spent too long in education not to know and understand fully the limitations to many of the present rigid examination structures at second level.  I have felt and perhaps still feel unease at the lack of representation on this board by many who, I felt, would have an important role to play on it.  Perhaps they are already on the board's sub-committees. Of course I have not the opportunity of appointing them but I would like to see on this board some people who have been involved in curriculum development over the years.  I would like to record our appreciation of the work done by Deputy John Wilson who in his term of office formally proposed the formation of a curriculum council which, as the Minister said, has expanded to become the Curriculum and Examinations Board.  The two matters are interlinked. You cannot propose a change in curricula without a change in the follow-up to those <Col N="1455" /> curricula and assessment procedures and then some sort of examination.</P>
    <P>Dealing still with second level, there is need for research and development into the area of schooling up to the end of compulsory education, as the Minister has mentioned.  Continuous assessment for examination purposes is discussed. Agreeing that continuous assessment is a very important area to be debated, one must be always conscious in assessment of the fear of the lowering of standards of one kind or another.  Again I am entering a <i>caveat</i>.  Assessment is always very subjective and it must be worked out by the curriculum board in their studies and in their liaison with teachers.  I participated in an assessment programme at intermediate certificate level of history when part of the marks could be apportioned by the teacher if a pupil in that class took up a project.  We did that for two years in Summerhill where I taught. It was marvellously successful.  The pupils took local and environmental studies. They went to the old workhouse and traced back the story of the inmates and what they did, and then sketched out what life would have been like in the workhouse.  That developed into the project on the Famine.  Another group took on the study of commercial development in the town of Athlone in the 19th century. They traced shops that had been set up there, the kind of business that was done and so on.  I enjoyed doing that with the pupils for two years although I was very conscious of my huge responsibility with regard to marking.  An inspector would have come to vet the results although I do not remember that happening. The number of marks for that segment was about 20.  When I read about the curriculum board and what they said about assessment I was very impressed, remembering the anguish I went through over the 25 girls who took part in that project, wondering whether Mary Ann should get 12 and Emily 13 marks out of the 20.  It is a very difficult position for a teacher.  I presume there will be courses devised for that.  One would have to question whether a blanket proposal of assessment, <Col N="1456" /> in its own way, would lead to a lowering of standards.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 5.8 of Chapter 5 deals with the role of guidance counsellors and says:</P>
    <P>In future the allocation of guidance posts will be made on the basis of school needs and taking account of the range of programmes available in the school.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would tell me what exactly is meant by that, if not today then on another occasion, particularly the phrase that &ldquo;the allocation of guidance posts will be made on the basis of school needs&rdquo;.  I do not like that phrase because, whether it was meant or not, there is an implied threat to existing guidance counsellor posts, limited and all as they are. If the resources were available each school could need a guidance counsellor particularly in the complexity of modern life &mdash; to which the Minister referred &mdash; the stresses and influences to which students are subjected through the media, the pressures of the consumer society which impinge so much on young people, the pressures from their peer groups.  The whole complexity of life today would lead one to believe that there is more and more need for guidance counsellors, perhaps not strictly career guidance counsellors but rather in terms of pastoral care.  I would hope the Minister would elucidate that point for me at some future date.  However I want it on the record that I do not agree with any further curtailment of the provision of guidance counsellors in schools.  There is need for syllabi of content for guidance counsellors for schools so that they would have some criterion on which to act.  But always the role of a guidance counsellor is open to his or her interpretation because of the nature of their work on a one-to-one basis with any given student. Therefore they are very much bound by their interpretation of the situation with which they are dealing with regard to any student.</P>
    <P>The cutbacks at second level last year have meant a worsening of the pupil/teacher ratio in second level schools.  These are only now beginning to bite.  They did not have the same effect <Col N="1457" /> last year because schools kept going, they poked about, amalgamated classes, got one teacher to take one class and another teacher to take another.  Indeed it must be said that principals, vice principals and teachers performed heroic deeds in making do.  But as time progresses if that pupil/teacher ratio continues more and more agonising decisions will have to be taken with regard to subject options which will result in many subjects becoming fringe ones.</P>
    <P>Coincidentally in the course of her remarks the Minister said she was worried that particular languages were seen to be becoming fringe subjects: she may not have used the word &ldquo;fringe&rdquo;.  These were languages like Spanish, German and whatever others she mentioned.  The only one that appeared to be thriving was French.  The answer there is very simple, the only language that will continue to thrive will be French because schools know they must maintain one continental language in order to cope with third level entry.  The reason that there is not the uptake of these subjects is the broadening of the bands of the pupil/teacher ratio. There is no point in the Minister piously saying she hopes these subjects will be taken more and more in schools, that she wishes to encourage, say, German, Spanish, Portuguese, particularly EEC languages, without there being the cash commitment to enable schools employ the teachers to teach those subjects.</P>
    <P>As the situation stands it will not be merely German and Spanish that will become esoteric luxuries but subjects like honours mathematics for girls at senior level.  One might well pose the question: will art disappear; will history disappear? There was a survey undertaken by Trinity College at the end of last autumn when it was discovered that participation by students at the higher level in history had dropped from 68 per cent to 33 per cent in a given number of years; I am not sure how many.  I have asked students in various schools I have visited, for example: &ldquo;do you take history here at pass and honours level in the leaving certificate?&rdquo; when invariably I am given the answer: &ldquo;Oh no, it is a choice between history and biology, between history and art or <Col N="1458" /> history and something else&rdquo;.  That is all wrong because history is a central subject to education and not something to be regarded merely as comprising dates, numbers, battles and so on.  Rather it should be regarded as an essential part of one's educational development.  I say that because it is a pet subject of mine.</P>
    <P>After Easter secondary school principals will be drawing up their schools time-tables for next September.  I have spoken to one or two of them who have told me that their hands will be tied when it comes to September next and they have to put a choice of subjects options before their pupils.  That choice will not be as open or as liberal as it was.  The reason for that is that the pupil/teacher ratio will remain as it was with the cutbacks announced last year.  Therefore, there is no point in the Minister saying that she wants to see girls taking up woodwork or boys domestic economy, something of that nature, unless the finance is provided to enable school principals to employ the teachers or otherwise improve the pupil/teacher ratio at second level.  If the pupil/teacher ratio remains as it is the choice of subject options will continue to narrow.  This is something that will have to be examined by the Curriculum and Examinations Board.  I am particularly worried about continental languages, higher mathematics, arts, science subjects but, above all, history.  The schools principals are performing trojan work in this respect but, unless the Minister rescinds last year's decision on the pupil/teacher ratio, subject choice will continue to narrow.  Real action is necessary in this area.  Otherwise specialist subjects will become esoteric luxuries.</P>
    <P>We welcome also the promise of computers. Here I would urge the establishment of courses not only for teachers but for parents who want to know all about them.  Certainly I do not know anything about computers but should like to know. Perhaps this is a subject that could be included in adult or third level education. I know my own children have come home and said: &ldquo;you are old hat&rdquo; when I do not know what they are talking about.  Therefore I would welcome the establishment of some type of course for parents in <Col N="1459" /> order to gear them to an understanding of the whole realm of computers.</P>
    <P>In this area the Minister spoke of the growing public concern about the proliferation of courses, agencies and groups dealing with training schemes for young people.  Of course there is growing concern, not merely in educational circles. We had our annual estimates meeting of the county council yesterday when there was half an hour's debate on the overlapping of moneys, courses and agencies to deal with training schemes for young people.  I would hope there would be concrete proposals from any examination of this area.  Indeed I would advocate greater use of the European Social Fund and its finances so that they might be used directly to fund work-related courses at senior cycle in all second level schools, not just in vocational or community schools but all second level schools.  I know they would all welcome such work-related courses at senior cycle.</P>
    <P>We could talk all day about second level education.  I couple it with my commitment to the disadvantaged area of primary education.  I have a strong commitment to the working out of a better life for students at second level.  I associate with that, of course, a better life for teachers at that level because I know from talking to teachers and friendship with many of them that they welcome the proposals of the Curriculum and Examinations Board.  Society blames the education system and says that it is the fault of the schools for turning out students not knowing enough about everyday living.</P>
    <P>However, for a long time the teachers had wanted to expand educational curricula but because they had ramparts around them through the examination system they had to try to cope.  I know the difficulties of going into a class of fifth or sixth year students, going into leaving certificate, faced with having to do A, B, C, D, which had to be got through &mdash; so many books of history, so many poems, so many Shakespearian plays.  All of this is highly necessary, but there is so little time to deal with what one would like to do or talk about to students.  Within their class structures most if not all teachers <Col N="1460" /> try to relate their subjects to real life, but the whole time the examinations press upon the teacher and the pupils and, of course, there is the pressure from parents who see the examination system as the only way their sons or daughters can get further education or some sort of a job &mdash; parents saw examinations as the passport to these things.  The pressure on the students has been unbelievable.  They are far too young to be caught up in such pressures.  The parents were at them to study to get their examinations.</P>
    <P>All that will still be part of the system, but there is much more to second level education than getting A, B, C and D after the student's name at the end of the course.  I repeat what I said on the radio, that I have seen far too many young people in tears and tatters with their feelings of self-consciousness and self-worth diminished, sometimes for life, because of what they got or did not get in their intermediate or leaving certificate examinations.  This is wrong and it must be changed, and if the Minister does that I will be with her all the way in the curricula changes she hopes for.</P>
    <P>The chapter dealing with third level education has a number of suggestions. Among them are ideas to make courses more cost effective, rationalisation of courses, restructuring of some third level courses, reviews of regional colleges, sharing of resources.  They are sensible things which a person in a tight economic situation would come up with in an effort to make resources stretch.  Many of them are admirable and useful as a backdrop or a jumping off point for a wider debate on third level education.  However, a basic problem will remain, and this is when I come back to my carping.  There are huge numbers of young people to be educated at third level within an unexpanded education budget.  That is the real problem.  More and more young people have been going into third level education and they will be until the end of this decade and until the end of the next.  The numbers will continue to grow until they level off &mdash; that is the forward demographic prognosis.</P>
    <P>We have huge numbers of young people to be educated at that level but <Col N="1461" /> we have not got an expanding education budget to cope with it.  The Minister said there will have to be consultations and thorough investigations into third level education.  It demands a very high level of political will and of finance to cope with the problem.  In the past 12 months there has been a carefully fostered feeling that the student is somewhat to blame. There is a sort of general imputation of guilt.  Indeed universities have been known to adopt a very defensive attitude, as if they were rushing to the ramparts with apologies instead of bayonets.  They have been defensive in their efforts to explain themselves, what they are and what they are about.  I do not think this is healthy or right.  There has been a reiteration of the high cost of education without considering the corollary of the high cost to parents or what the young people will give back to society when properly educated.  This general imputation of guilt is not good for young people. I have been to different universities in the past month addressing meetings of different societies and I have found that an awful threat hangs over young people in third level colleges.</P>
    <P>First of all, there is the worry about jobs &mdash; will they or will they not get jobs? We are all concerned with huge unemployment figures.  Then there is the threat of examinations &mdash; that has always been there for young people.  There is also the knowledge that third level education is costing their parents so much and they wonder if the parents can afford it with less take home pay.  The grants have not gone up in the past two years, and for that I blame both the previous and present Governments.  Young people cannot get summer jobs except occasionally.  All these exert great pressure on third level students.  They have got to prove themselves. There is room for debate on the proper use of education and the need for education that is beyond the strictly educational sense.</P>
    <P>In her speech and in her book the Minister referred to the possibility of the introduction of a student loan scheme in third level education.  This is one of my hobby horses.  I do not think the suggestion stands up to scrutiny.  Today the <Col N="1462" /> Minister referred to the student loan/grant scheme as distinct from a student loan scheme.  I do not know what this scheme is about yet.  I do not think a student loan scheme would stand up to scrutiny, particularly in the present economic climate with such a large measure of job uncertainty for graduates.  In more favourable economic times Fianna Fáil would be prepared to examine such a scheme, but the Minister and the Government must realise that if students were compelled, through an inadequate educational grant system, to take up loan schemes, they would be facing life not only without job certainty, but with the added burden of a financial albatross hanging around his or her neck when leaving college &mdash; no job and a loan to pay back starting life.  It is not a happy scenario and I do not think it is one we should envisage at all.</P>
    <P>The chairman of the Curriculum and Examinations Board in a recent speech reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> seemed to have very advanced knowledge of what such a loan scheme might be.  He defended the educational cuts.  The first question I would ask about such a loan scheme is: who would decide which applicants would qualify for such loans? Where would the relativities lie?  Would they lie with the finance institutions?  If so, that could lead to great discrimination. A manager in charge of a finance company would have the power to say to a would-be student at third level, &ldquo;You will get a grant&rdquo;, and to another, &ldquo;You will not&rdquo;.  There is enormous potential for discrimination there.  Would an applicant entering a technological discipline be more favoured than one entering an arts or humanities course?  There could be a great danger there.  If there is great expansion in the use of computer technology, engineers will be sure of getting a job, so their bank managers would consider them a safe bet for a loan, while the opposite might be the result for someone deciding to study for a BA degree and this could lead to discrimination.</P>
    <P>Also there could be sex discrimination. Boys might be considered potentially more employable than their female <Col N="1463" /> counterparts.  I know we have gone beyond the day when girls on marriage, gave up their jobs to push the pram.  Nowadays they do both &mdash; but not at the same time. The financial institutions would want to get their loan back, considering it, not from a scholastic or philanthropic but from a financial angle.  They would be giving out money which they would expect to get back.  The situation would be fraught with difficulties and needs a much wider debate.  I do not want to read in the papers or hear on the radio that the Minister has announced the details of a students loan scheme.  That would be completely unfair to parents and young people.</P>
    <P>Right now, the young are making their choice of course.  The CAO application forms are out and the parents are counting their pennies to see if they can afford to give their children third level education, apart from their academic qualifications. They need to know what the economic climate will be when their child goes to college next October and the Minister is fond of forward planning.  I have many reservations and have considered the matter in great detail.  I do not care what Professor Dale Tussing said or what the American system is; I do not agree with it in the present Irish economic climate.  I hope that there will be no student loan scheme and that the grant scheme will be greatly expanded.  I call on the Minister to open up a debate on this issue and on third level education. Parents and young people are extremely worried and confused.  I have had many letters from both students and parents saying that they do not agree with this proposal and I do not, either.  Now is the time for a full statement on this matter.</P>
    <P>Two major topics are mentioned in the document, one being the primary school starting age.  This is linked cleverly with the idea of going from primary into secondary school and it is in that context that the debate will be launched upon the unsuspecting public.  It will not be a stark question of whether a child will go to school at four or not.  Eventually, however, the question will boil down to that. We should debate everything and talk <Col N="1464" /> about everything.  My party and I are not intransigent or entrenched on the matter, but we opt for a continuation of the right of choice as heretofore.  The choice of entry age rests with the parents, but the choice should start at four years.  Some children are socially ready for school at four and others are not.  Historically, that choice has always suited the Irish educational scene.  No parents would push a child to school at four, but if they are ready, it should be open to send them.  I do not countenance in any way a cost-cutting exercise in that area.  This proposal will be cloaked in the guise of pseudo theories of various kinds and studies will be produced to show that it would be beneficial in one way or another to raise the entrance age.  Whether there is a wide or a narrow debate and irrespective of the theories advanced, the right of entry at four years of age should remain.</P>
    <P>The second area is that of teacher training. The Minister said that this was highly important and highly necessary.  However, although there is a huge increase on last year, the money is nothing compared with what would be needed in this area. I am ashamed to say that I taught for many years and hardly went on a course at all.  How much I would have needed and benefited from such courses.  Many of the proposals in this document will be strongly dependent on in-service teacher training, particularly at first and second level.  There is a great need for ongoing, comprehensive in-service training courses for teachers.  There will be a completely new thinking, with curricular developments, new computer science technology, different types of classes and different structures.</P>

      <P>There should be sabbaticals for teachers who have taught for so many years, giving interrelated academic studies which would benefit teachers in their particular subjects.  They should have that chance to refresh themselves. Managers go on courses for weeks on end and listen to many lectures and <Col N="1465" /> perhaps do a year's training in the United States; but teachers who are teaching daily, coping with various complexities, do not have these opportunities.  I believe that the committee involved in such matters have given their findings and why have these not been acted upon?  Will they be?  I am disappointed at the Minister's tepid response to and lack of action regarding the findings of the committee, as expressed in this document.</P>

      <P>I welcome this as a plan, but it is not positive action.  It is a plan of deferred educational aspirations, has much good in it and much potential, but no commitment to the resources to carry it out.  I shall welcome a further action plan showing the necessary commitment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this debate and hope that it will result in some decisions and improvements in our educational system.  The Minister's Programme for Action is an indication of the Government's intention and, as such, is very useful.  It is, as it declares, a programme&mdash;it is not particularly a plan. The Minister is hopeful that it will initiate a debate, and that is my hope also, but that it be a constructive debate.  Unfortunately, educational programmes and Ministers' intentions in the past have been undermined by Government dictate over the years.</P>
      <P>In the foreword, the Minister said:</P>
      <P>Never before have such detailed consultations been held with a wide range of educational interests;</P>
      <P>I believe that that is an indictment of previous administrations.  It is to be regretted that consultations of the level claimed by the Minister to have taken place have not resulted in a more substantial, coherent, progressive plan for expansion in education.  That is something which the very young Irish population need just now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact, lack of planning is one of the major weaknesses in education as, possibly, <Col N="1466" /> it is in most other Departments of State.  In respect of third level education, the previous Minister, Mr. Richard Burke, was quite good at making decisions and made a number in the mid-seventies, but he made no plans and nothing has lasted.  It is not surprising that most of his decisions were never implemented. I recall his decision to strip the NCEA of their degree-awarding powers and other decisions which were not implemented.  There was no planning in them&mdash;they were just <i>ad hoc</i> decisions. Ministerial decisions are not just good enough, either.  We recall that the 1981 Coalition Government made a decision to raise the school entry age.  There was no planning or educational content in that.  It was a decision made for financial reasons which we vigorously opposed.</P>
    <P>The question then remains why there is such a lack of planning in education over the years.  I am not referring to the current Minister alone.  For years there was a consensus on quite a number of issues where reform was required&mdash;for instance, the examination system and closer alignment between school and work, as well as various other areas.  The planning to reflect this consensus has been most deficient.  Do the Department of Education not have the resources or is there something wrong with the structures which do not allow the Department to plan ahead for the educational system? Perhaps the concentration of the Department in a few buildings makes the Department clogged up with details so that the urgent is constantly driving out the important issues.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education is the first area the Minister must tackle in any programme or any plan for education. The Department of Education, next only to the Department of Justice, is the most backward and inefficient Department of State.  Any publication such as the Minister's which is even remotely connected with planning is to be welcomed.  The-most important factor underlying developments in education is the level of resources, the amount of money provided. It is all very well talking of systems of bulk buying or four term academic years, as the Minister does in this document, <Col N="1467" /> but it will not have any major impact on putting flesh on the skeleton education service.  There is no acknowledgment in the Minister's programme that Ireland is at the very bottom of the list of EEC countries in relation to <i>per capita</i> spending on education.  This can be seen in the Education and Training Statistical Bulletin of the EEC published on 4 July last year.  The Minister will probably explain that this is due to our very large young population.  My party believe that this young population is the very reason why there must be higher resources provided in education and why we must provide an education system of European standards.</P>
    <P>The real programme for action in the education field is to be seen in the Education Estimates for 1984.  We note cutbacks in real terms here in every Education Vote except for residential homes and special schools.  There are real cuts in training colleges, caretaker schemes, building projects and in the whole education field.  Meanwhile our primary schools are very poorly provided for.  One in every four primary schools have prefabricated classrooms, one in ten do not even have drinking water, three in every four do not have a telephone and one in eight of all primary classes have in excess of 40 pupils.  This is a reflection of the lack of resources in the primary education area.  In the light of the inadequacies of that system the failure of the Minister's programme to emphasise expansion is to be deplored.  Reality is being emphasised in the programme, as the Coalition see it.</P>
    <P>The budget this year again failed to tax wealth and left the farming sector amazed to have escaped so lightly.  Our party condemn the Minister's conception of reality in relation to this programme.  She and her Government see reality in terms of leaving capital, wealth and property largely untouched by taxation.  This programme rejoices in not setting out a philosophy of education.  It is difficult to understand from an educationalist's point of view what is wrong about setting out a philosophy on education.  There is an underlying philosophy in the programme. It is not an educational <Col N="1468" /> philosophy, but that education must wait until the reality changes and that we do not need to plan for major changes in education because these are determined by the needs of reality, that we have not any money because of various other factors of the monetarist policy of the Government.  This reality is created by the Coalition Government.  They say we do not need a plan because reality will decide what the future is.</P>
    <P>This party hold a different view, which is that education is the right of every citizen; and at a time when we have a large young population we should not be asking if resources can be found but rather where they can be found.  We can name many places where they can be found.  Education needs resources at the moment.  Details of this programme must be examined in the light of considering its serious inadequacies as a document which seeks to provide a coherent view of action in education to 1987.  The Minister has sought to have something for everyone in her plan.  References are made in the programme to proposals, without anything very specific in them, regarding gifted children, section 2.35; multi-denominational schooling, section 3.8; education of travellers' children, section 4.8; and evening degree and diploma courses, section 6.9.</P>
    <P>Positive discrimination is proposed where disadvantage is identified, but the housing and employment policies which cause disadvantage are not adverted to, as if education were alone adequate to turn around years of Government neglect.  Even the 1980 White Paper took a more enlightened view of the role of education regarding disadvantaged children.</P>
    <P>Training of teachers received special attention.  Chapter 7 is devoted to this topic.  It deals with the reduction in teacher-student numbers and rationalisation in colleges of education.  The number in teacher training was 900 in 1981 and only 600 in 1983.  That gives some idea of what is happening in the area of teacher training.  The Minister failed to tackle the problem and endeavoured to cover it up.</P>
    <P>There is a new stress on in-service <Col N="1469" /> training for teachers, emphasising strengthening of teacher centres.  This concept would be welcomed by teachers' unions but if we look at the Estimates for this year we find there is a cut-back in real terms for such teacher centres.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party welcome the new approach in discussions on the age of entry.  We opposed the Government's last decision which was taken as an <i>ad hoc</i> measure for financial reasons.  A change must be made in the present system. We propose setting up over a five year period a national State system of pre-school education for children up to six years.  Following the implementation of this, primary schooling would be from age six to age 14, which would include the full eight year programme up to sixth class.  Such a change would give every child the benefit of the extra two years child-centred curriculum in the important years at the beginning of adolesence.  This plan cannot be implemented unless and until the Government provide pre-school facilities for children up to six years of age.  The development of health education up to 14 years is essential, but this programme does not mention or provide for the area of sex education in schools. This is particularly important in view of recent tragic events and my party hope the Minister will press the Curriculum and Examination Board to examine this area as a priority.</P>
    <P>It is disturbing to note the suggestion in 2.25 that temporary accommodation is still seen as adequate for some children in the primary school area.  There are old pre-fabricated buildings which need to be replaced urgently so that many thousands of children presently being educated in unsuitable classrooms are accommodated in the most conducive environment for learning.  Some of the damp and draughty schools still being used date back to the last century and in some cases teachers have shown great patience in dealing with problems varying from rat-infestation to unsanitary conditions.  In other areas the pre-fab has made its appearance, sometimes in the grounds of our oldest schools and in other cases providing extra classrooms in new schools built only ten or 15 years ago.  They were <Col N="1470" /> originally intended as a short-term solution to the problem of overcrowding but many have become semi-permanent features. They are totally unsuitable as classrooms. They are not sound-proof.  If two of them are located side by side there are obvious problems.  They do not withstand the normal stresses and strains of daily use by 30 or 40 lively youngsters.  In May or June on a sunny day they are intolerably hot.  It is disturbing that in this document temporary accommodation is still regarded as acceptable.</P>
    <P>The chapter on primary education is notable for its omission of any plan to reduce class sizes generally.  One of the greatest obstacles preventing a teacher from fully utilising a curriculum to the maximum benefit of pupils is a class which is too large.  A large class does not just simply exhaust the teacher but severely limits the amount of individual attention which can be given, particularly to those who need it most.  Every pupil is an individual and a class of 30 or 35 will have a wide range of abilities as well as problems.  They will come from various types of homes, some ideal for the upbringing of children and others with the most serious domestic problems imaginable.  I was recently told of a school in Sexton Street in Limerick where in a class of 42 infants last year only five had a parent at work.  It is crucial that class sizes be reduced.  It is one of the most important demands to be made at present. There has been a slight improvement in the last few years but it is imperative that the pupil-teacher ratio be progressively reduced to 25:1 before the end of this decade.</P>
    <P>There is no use talking about a ratio of 27:1, 26:1 or 25:1 when in 1979 there were 11,425 classes all over the country in which there were over 30 pupils.  In 1980 there were 2,144 classes, involving 88,000 students, where there were more than 40 pupils in a class.  It does not matter if the average is reduced to 20:1 if there are 88,000 students in classes of 40 or over.  We must ensure that there is no class anywhere which has more than 30 pupils.  Then we will be talking about real progress and not just reducing averages. We have the worst teacher/pupil <Col N="1471" /> ratio in Europe and yet there are 600 primary teachers out of work.  Just to bring us into line with Northern Ireland we would need to employ 4,000 new teachers in the primary area.</P>
    <P>In chapter 5 on second level education the Minister foresees no structural change whatsoever.  Public finance will continue to support what are, in many cases, private facilities.  Democracy in running schools is advocated but the level of real democratic control over facilities paid for by the taxpayer is sadly lacking in the voluntary second level sector.  This is not noted by the Minister.  A proposed re-appraisal of the so-called vocational training programme is well overdue.  We call for an examination of the use of outside agencies at public cost to carry out AnCO training courses.  We also note that money seems to be freely available to give young people skills when they leave school.  There is no shortage of money for all kinds of courses run by AnCO for young people.  However, demands for schools of a similar level of <i>per capita</i> resources go unanswered and are ignored.  I am sure the Minister has noted this and has endeavoured to improve the level of resources available to the Department but she does not seem to be succeeding in the Cabinet against the little empires being set up in other areas.</P>
    <P>Serious issues of concern are also raised in chapter 6, third level education. Section 6.7 begs the fundamental question about the role of universities and other third level colleges.  It seems that a subtle implementation by stealth of the degree factory principle is about to take place here.  The programme here is particularly deficient and this area requires planning and discussions.</P>
    <P>In the third level area there is reference to the increased number of students receiving grants.  However, only about 20 per cent of students receive any form of grant.  In 1975 there were 6,168 students receiving grants but, by 1979, this had fallen to 5,541.  Therefore, the Minister had a very low base from which to increase and, quite rightly, the number of students receiving grants has increased <Col N="1472" /> substantially.  Of course as the number of students in third level education has increased enormously, the number receiving grants must increase and, therefore, the Minister's figures do not tell the whole story.  While she gives figures regarding the increase in the number of students and the large increases in grants, she omitted to say that the percentage of students receiving grants now is the lowest since 1972.  Her figures give a very false picture.  Unless the value of the grant is increased substantially and the income limits for eligibility also increase, it will be virtually impossible for anyone from a working or lower middle class family to afford third level education. Yet this section of the community is the largest proportion of the whole population and they also pay the bulk of taxation. Their tax bill this year will amount to well over £1,100 million.  They are paying the taxes but their children are not getting education.</P>
    <P>In 1963, a survey showed that only 2 per cent of students in third level education came from semi-skilled or unskilled workers' homes.  The later Nevin Survey done in UCD showed that a figure of 1.7 per cent came from semi-skilled or unskilled homes.  A few years ago, the latest survey showed that only 1 per cent of the children of unskilled workers received third level education.  It is clear, therefore, that the grant system must be overhauled and improved if equality of access to education is to be achieved.</P>
    <P>There is an apparent shelving of the plans for third level educational institutions in Dublin's new towns.  That is a major shock as the young people of areas like Tallaght and Blanchardstown are already starved of facilities.  They are major new towns and they have not even got a community centre.  There was a plan to provide third level education in these areas and it merits more than a dismissive phrase in this programme.  These are new cities, the like of which we have never seen before, each with a population of 100,000, yet they are hardly mentioned in this programme.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to student loans on the principle of the right to education.  Loans give a status to education of a possession <Col N="1473" /> to be bought, sold or loaned and the system fails to recognise the fundamental importance of education to each individual. I wish to lay most emphasis on primary education because everybody experiences it.  Only a tiny percentage go on to third level education and a relatively small percentage go through second level education.  Primary education, therefore, should get major resources, major injections of capital and the major attention of the Minister.  However, this does not seem to be the case.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of this century, as a result of the School Attendance Act, mass illiteracy had been wiped out but the foundations of a very divided and sectarian education system had been well and truly laid.  It was inherited by the new Department of Education in 1924 and was gradually reinforced under the new State.  Boys were separated from girls in most urban schools and Catholics were separated from non-Catholics almost everywhere.  Buried somewhere in the mass of political rhetoric in vogue during the following decades was the ideal of bringing Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter together.  The Northern Protestant, looking South, had no doubt whatsoever that home rule meant Rome rule. Teacher training colleges and most of the education system were firmly in the hands of the Roman Catholic Church.  In practically every town and country parish the most powerful man was the parish priest. He was the manager of the school even though in most cases he had no training as a teacher or educational administrator. He interviewed and hired teachers and visited the schools regularly.  The State provided the bulk of the money in building grants and teaching salaries but the schools were privately owned, vested in and controlled by the clergy.</P>
    <P>It is still the same today.  There are now 570,000 children attending 3,400 primary schools around the country.  The majority begin their schooling between their fourth and fifth birthdays.  In 1980 it was shown that 99 per cent of five year olds had already started school.  Great credit is due to teachers who, despite large classes and other problems, ensure that the vast majority of children adapt to <Col N="1474" /> their new environment and develop and progress in the first vital two year period. One of the greatest obstacles, however, in preventing a teacher from fully utilising the curriculum for the maximum benefit of all pupils is the size of the class.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with class sizes and the lack of facilities in schools.  I now turn to the areas of segregation and co-education. An important and serious aspect of our system today is the division within it on the grounds of religion.  The origins of this can be traced back to the period during which the national schools were being set up.  The position today is that 99 per cent of all primary schools are vested in and controlled by the various churches.  The Roman Catholic bishops are patrons of 92 per cent of all schools, while the Church of Ireland bishops control 6 per cent.  The remaining 70 schools are vested in voluntary associations for handicapped children, the Presbyterian Church or in one or two cases the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>In very few instances, therefore, down through the years have children of different religions had the opportunity of attending the same schools and of learning together.  There have been some exceptions to this, but the over-riding aspect has been and still is that of a segregated system which cannot be justified on any psychological or sociological grounds.</P>
    <P>The consequences have not been so apparent here in the South, but in the North there is absolutely no doubt that separate education has contributed to misunderstanding and distrust.  The creation and perpetuation of myths and inaccuracies in history, for example, is but one aspect of the problem.  There are historic, economic and political reasons for the problems in the North and church authorities regularly reply that there is no proof that a divided education system has contributed to making matters worse. That there is no scientific proof is doubtful because some sociological studies have been carried out.  Independent sociologists and those favouring integrated education do not, however, attract the same attention as the sectarian politicians and para-militaries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1475" /> The following question must be posed to those who see nothing wrong with a divided system: Are the gunmen and bombers who have been responsible for the terrible toll of death and injury in the past twelve years the products of an education system in which all children have been taught together through a common curriculum?  The answer is no. The terrorists of all persuasions have been brought up under various family and other influences but they are also the products of an education system which is still stoutly defended by those who control it.  A majority of people are now questioning the whole concept of having such segregation, not just in the North but throughout the South as well.</P>

      <P>In 1976 a detailed survey carried out by the Dalkey School Project in County Dublin showed that 64 per cent of those questioned favoured multi-denominational education.  This percentage has increased considerably since then.  In a similar type of survey conducted in Dublin two years later the sociologist, Fr. Michael McGreil, found that 61 per cent of those interviewed considered that separate Catholic and Protestant schools had been a major cause of division in the Northern Irish community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At about the same time a comprehensive survey was under way in Knocknaheeny, a large housing estate on the north side of Cork city.  A carefully prepared questionnaire gave people adequate scope to express opinions on local educational requirements and problems. When it was completed in 1978, 75 per <Col N="1476" /> cent of the people had said that when the new school was built they were in favour of children of different religions being in the one school.  Only 9 per cent said they were against the idea.</P>
    <P>The second major division within the system is that between boys and girls. The original National Board schools of the nineteenth century were co-educational and almost every single school in rural areas today is mixed.  The origins of the segregated system which operates in most towns and cities date back to the decision by various religious orders of nuns and brothers to set up separate schools for boys and girls.  Today 600 of the biggest schools are single sex schools and such segregation cannot be justified on any grounds.</P>
    <P>There is no reason, except what must have been a religious reason in the last century, why boys and girls should not be learning in the same classroom.  They mix at home and on the street and nobody claims that somehow it is not right or natural.  Neither does anybody seriously suggest that the children of mixed schools do not benefit fully from the curriculum. There is strong evidence to suggest that not only should it be quite normal for them to mix in the school environment, as in the family and neighbourhood, but that there are important reasons why it should be advocated.</P>
    <P>Anything that helps young people to relate to, understand and communicate with members of the opposite sex must be encouraged.  This is especially vital in the last year or two of primary school as they approach adolescence and it will certainly help to avert more serious emotional and marital problems later in life.</P>
    <P>Many cutbacks have been made in the past few years but particularly during the past year.  The pupil-teacher ratio has been increased, there has been a reduction in the number of student teachers and a phasing out of the employment of caretakers and school secretaries.  There has also been a cutback on the employment of remedial teachers and guidance counsellors, as well as the imposition of charges for school transport.  All these measures strike at the heart of the principle <Col N="1477" /> of free education and equality of educational opportunity.</P>
    <P>There is a dangerous theory being floated about which is based on the idea that the unemployed, like the poor, will always be with us and that to deal with the increasing number of unemployed we must train them to deal with so-called leisure time.  Leisure facilities and leisure time are very important.  We constantly look for them in our local areas and they must be catered for.  Leisure is something to offer the people after a good day's work.  It is not an occupation and must not be allowed to become another word for unemployment.  We must plan for full employment and gear our educational system for it.  It is not a dream and can be worked out.  We have the natural resources together with the ability of our young people and teachers at all levels of education.</P>
    <P>The educational area is an essential feature of job creation.  Following publication of the recent ERSI report, I would suggest to the Minister that she should go back to the Cabinet and ask for a review of the cutbacks in education because of the role of education in job creation and because of the suggested outline of policy in the ESRI report, which is much more practical and in tune with what people want than the policy which has been pursued during the past 12 months.</P>

      <P>I leith an Programme for Action in Education 1984-87, ní fheadar an bhfuil sé so-chreidthe &ldquo;programme&rdquo; a ghlaoch air de réir an méid choinníollacha ar a bhunaigh an tAire é sa chéad áit.  Bheadh sé i bhfad níos oiriúnaí, dar liomsa, teideal mar, b'fhéidir, &ldquo;a consideration of priorities in education&rdquo; a chur air.  Admhaím go bhfuil smaointí polasaithe ann atá inmholta agus tá mé cinnte go nglacann na múinteoirí agus na oideachasóirí ar fud na tíre leo.  Ach aithníonn an tAire ceart go leor cuid de na príomh constaicí agus cuid de na príomh aidhmeanna atá á gcur isteach agus atá á bplé i gcúrsaí oideachais i láthair na huaire.  Déanann sí iarracht a bheith freagrach dóibh tríd is tríd.  Ach go hiondúil ní ceart a rá go n-éiríonn leis an gcáipéis seo freagra cuimsítheach a <Col N="1478" /> sholáthar dóibh.  Sin é mo thuairim agus sin é tuairim na dTeachtaí ar an taobh seo den Dáil.</P>
      <P>Tá díomá orm &mdash; agus bhí an mothú céanna agam le déanaí &mdash; ag tagairt di do chúrsaí Gaeilge, ag tagairt di do fhorbairt na Gaeilge nach ndearna sí iarracht dá laghad í féin Gaeilge a labhairt, agus iarraim uirthi arís, mar a iarr mé uirthi le déanaí, iarracht a dhéanamh anois Gaeilge a labhairt sa Dáil mar is ise an prime motivator, mar a déarfá. Déanann sí tagairt tríd an programme nó tríd an cháipéis do thábhacht motivation i gcúrsaí Gaeilge, do thábhacht an chúlra, do thábhacht na timpeallachta.

      <P>I am aware that time is limited.  At the outset I want to take up statements made by Deputy Mac Giolla in relation to the ethos which has existed in our Irish schools in the Twenty-six Counties since the foundation of the State.  I want to explode the myth which it is intended to promote here that, because we had a good, strong, heavy, Catholic ethos, this was a major factor or among the major factors promoting division and sectarianism in our State.  I want to state unequivocally on behalf of all those on this side of the House that we make no apology whatsoever to anybody for the ethos which has existed in our national and secondary schools for 60 to 70 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the contrary, the ethos which these schools inculcated played a major role in fostering good standards of behaviour and good attitudes to society.  I know there have been shortcomings in recent times in that area, but those schools have played a major role in fostering an appreciation of people and environment. On this side of the House we refuse to make any apology for that.  If there is evidence to suggest &mdash; and I am not satisfied with the evidence produced this evening &mdash; that the absence of multi-denominational schools is contributing to a resistance on the part of the certain elements of society in the North, I would say to those elements: &ldquo;Look to yourselves. Look at what you have cultivated <Col N="1479" /> or inculcated in your own society.  Look to the divisions you have fomented through your educational system&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Although we congratulate and compliment our national and secondary schools, nevertheless we acknowledge that there is a growing need for multi-denominational schools.  By and large, the Minister has our support in so far as she has expressed that view.  However, we will keep a constant monitor on this issue.  At the risk of being accused of repeating myself, it should go firmly on the record that we make no apology for good standards and a very healthy Catholic ethos which has pertained to the present day in our primary and secondary schools.</P>
    <P>This Programme for Action in Education is hardly entitled to be called a programme. It goes to quite extraordinary lengths to emphasise that its implementation is conditional on and subject to the priority which the Government accord to education within their programme of public spending.  That quotation is to be found in chapter 1.4.  It is also conditional on and subject to the availability of resources and the possibilities which the financial constraints permit.  This kind of conditional response dilutes and diminishes what purports at the outset to be a comprehensive and specific four year plan.</P>
    <P>I stress the word &ldquo;specific&rdquo; because in her preamble the Minister states that this is a specific plan.  She said the programme sets out to be specific and to avoid generalisation. I find that the document contradicts that statement.  Although specific areas of educational need and requirement are referred to, qualifications are multitudinous.  Therefore, it is not fair or correct for the Minister to say she is dealing specifically with the situation or she has a specific plan of action.</P>
    <P>I do not think anyone would take issue with the Minister when she stresses the need to ensure the best possible value for money.  Everybody on this side of the House wants the best possible value for money spent on education on behalf of the taxpayer, a very important person nowadays, and they are becoming fewer and fewer.  That point was made in chapter <Col N="1480" /> 1.7.  Nobody would quibble with the proposal that education should relate to the relevance of the educational process to the world of work.  This is an issue I intend to take up later on.</P>
    <P>Nobody would quibble with the proposal that the barrier to equality should be removed.  I am a great advocate of that.  All former Ministers for Education on this side of the House have promoted equality of educational opportunity. Deputy Wilson, Deputy Faulkner, Deputy O'Malley in his time, all played very substantial and fundamental roles in promoting greater equality of educational opportunity.  The facts and the statistics speak for themselves.  I do not need to expound on their virtues beyond paying them a passing tribute in that respect.</P>
    <P>Neither would anybody disagree that exceptional treatment must be accorded to the disadvantaged &mdash; another area to which I intend to devote a considerable amount of time &mdash; or that education should develop all the individual skills and qualities, spiritual, moral, intellectual, aesthetic and physical, providing what the Minister referred to as a trained mind, an openness to change, a creative approach and acceptable social skills.</P>
    <P>There are many other fine aspirations here which must be commended by teachers, educational theorists, analysts, or legislators. I do commend them, as has my party's spokesperson.  I know all previous Ministers for Education and all future Ministers for Education on this side of the House will commend these very fine sentiments.  Is it not a fact that teachers are already well aware of these fundamental goals and objectives and are committed to their implementationa and realisation?  Does the Minister think otherwise?  Surely teachers have consistently cried out for curricula which reflect intellectual, social, cultural and economic needs and provide for the personal development of individual pupils.  The teachers and educationalists are aware that they are the requirements.  I am delighted the Minister spelled them out but I do not see anything fundamentally new in this approach.</P>
    <P>Another declaration in the plan is that <Col N="1481" /> the programme does not propose to set out a philosophy of education.  Deputies O'Rourke and Mac Giolla dealt with that matter and I should like to refer to it.  I believe that any ordering of priorities within education must have philosophical overtones.  I see a philosophical approach in the programme.  I wonder what the Minister meant by her statement to which I referred and I trust she will get the opportunity later to clarify that matter.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> It is my pleasure to propose the following motion:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to provide the finance necessary to maintain an adequate arterial drainage programme in view of the employment it provides and the important contribution it makes to agricultural development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the country is to rise swiftly and steadily out of the recession it is vital that we optimise every resource we have, human and natural.  Despite rumours of an oil find, and talk of the growth in importance of natural gas, our farmland remains our greatest natural resource.  For decades the prosperity and the difficulties of agriculture have been a barometer as to how our economy has been faring.  Successive Governments have tried to guide the industry through various schemes in an attempt to help it reach its true potential. When we joined the EEC we got an <Col N="1482" /> enormous boost and a lot of pressure was taken off our own financial resources. During those early years of our membership the Government had to ensure that our agricultural industry moved in the right direction.  To this end at different times a comprehensive list of national aids was introduced.  Farming, and agricultural development, is more important to us than to any other EEC country because one in four of our workforce is employed in farming.  Indeed, agricultural exports account for about one quarter of our total exports.  In fact, because of their low import content that figure under estimates the net value and benefit to our economy of such exports.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand when I look at those figures the attitude adopted by the Government in regard to that industry. Above all I cannot understand the Government's attitude to arterial drainage schemes.  The Government do not appreciate the vital role an expanding farm sector can play in leading us out of the recession.  We could help solve our terrible unemployment problem if we kept more on the land and we could provide thousands of new jobs in agriculture based industries.  That would in turn improve our balance of payments deficit.  We should gear ourselves towards increased productivity and getting the maximum yield for the input of farmers, the Government and European agencies. To ensure a reasonable income for our farmers, particularly our rural community, the drainage of land is fundamental and must be a basic pursuit by the State. It is imperative that arterial drainage schemes are continued and that the design work recommences.  I understand that the design work for future schemes has been suspended.  That work should recommence so as to ensure that when the work on existing schemes is completed plans will be available to carry on with other projects.  If that is done more land will be available for development. Apart from providing additional employment such an expansion would be of tremendous benefit to the country.</P>
    <P>The effect on the balance of payments if such work is carried out would be dramatic. Unlike many other industries the <Col N="1483" /> technology to ensure such expansion in agriculture is readily available.  It must be recognised that farmers need to plan well ahead before they expand their enterprise. Therefore, every effort must be made to ensure that they get the best use of every acre they have.  The five schemes in progress at present were started by Fianna Fáil when in Government.  The financial commitment to the three major schemes, the Boyne, the Maigue and the Corrib-Mask, is about £7½ million for this year or a figure equivalent to the 1979-80 figure.  If one takes into consideration that the consumer price index in that period went up by 250 per cent one gets an indication of the Government's commitment, one of scaling down the whole concept of arterial drainage.</P>
    <P>The schemes I mentioned are about 80 per cent completed and yet the Government have deferred any new surveys or design work for future schemes.  The EEC allocation of £400,000 for a survey of the Shannon, which corresponds to about 40 per cent of the cost of the scheme, has been abandoned representing a great loss of funds from that source to Ireland.  In the 1983 budget that survey was deferred and the money let go by default.  The Government were prepared to let 230 workers involved in arterial drainage work go but that figure has been reduced by about 90 as a result of trade union pressure, representations by farming and rural organisations and, in particular, as a result of Fianna Fáil tabling the motion under discussion.</P>
    <P>I should like to commend the Office of Public Works on the marvellous work they are doing under the Arterial Drainage Act.  The land that has been improved under that Act is being utilised fully for farming purposes and many people, particularly in rural areas, gain employment under the schemes.</P>
    <P>This Government are prepared now to pull the plug on all the fine, excellent work which can be done in future.  The cost-benefit analysis of the schemes which has been carried out, despite statements to the contrary, has proved them to have been economic.  This year sees a token gesture of the drainage of <Col N="1484" /> the Boyle and the Bonet, but employment there is for only about 80 as distinct from the normal major schemes I have mentioned which would provide employment for well in excess of 200 people. Surely it is far more favourable to have people employed on these schemes with consequential benefit rather than to have them thrown on the dole queue with the social consequences and, of course, the cost to the Exchequer of social welfare benefits.  There is also loss of revenue to the State of EEC funds as many of these schemes are funded to up to 50 per cent of the total cost.</P>
    <P>Every day we hear Government Ministers bringing forward various schemes, some of them hare-brained, for the purpose of creating employment.  Surely we have ready-made employment in this area.  Surely it is commonsense for any Government to continue with these schemes, particularly with regard to their design, so that when major schemes which are now in progress are being wound down the others will come on stream.  The creation of employment must be a priority with any Government when there is so much unemployment.  I repeat that in this area worthwhile employment can be forthcoming and the consequences of the work can be seen in better farmland and subsequently better utilisation of that land.</P>
    <P>I will take and analyse one of these major schemes which concerns my constituency. The Maigue drainage scheme comprises approximately 420 square miles involving up to 270,000 acres.  The benefit to the farmland from this scheme has been enormous.  Despite the fact that since 1979 this scheme has been eligible for grant aid from the EEC Regional Development Fund, still the Government decided to make 56 men redundant. I have seen the benefit of this scheme to land which but for the scheme would have been under water continually during the winter months and right up to the present and which is now completely free from any flooding and has been utilised for the production of early grass.  The total figure of £10.9 million this year for drainage as a whole is down from last year's £11.2 million.  This year's figure for the three <Col N="1485" /> schemes I mentioned earlier, the Maigue, the Boyne and the Corrib-Mask, is only £7 million as against £10 million last year. The Government's policy in the context of arterial drainage, while it has affected the Maigue scheme in particular, has also affected the western drainage scheme administered by the Department of Agriculture in the sense that farmers cannot apply for these grants if they have not sufficient out-fall, and thereby we have a further loss of funds from EEC sources. We are now making massive deals with countries for exports of cattle &mdash; rightly so &mdash; yet Government policy is hostile to the production of beef cattle on our land. Farming organisations and all union interests are appalled by the Government's policy, the farmers from the point of view of greater utilisation of land, the unions from the point of view of employment. I repeat what is contained in this motion, the importance of restoring the money available for these schemes to its former amount and moneys being made available for the future development and design of schemes.</P>
    <P>I want to make a short reference to another drainage scheme in Limerick, the proposed drainage of the Mulcaire. Not alone are the present schemes cut back but much-needed schemes such as the Mulcaire, the Dunkellin and the Owenmore in Sligo have obviously been thrown out of the window by this Government. It appears that for the first time in 150 years we are coming to the end of works in the arterial drainage scheme. The Mulcaire, which is in the constituency of East Limerick-North Tipperary, will give the greatest return.  Figures show that not only will the increase be £27 million per year in agricultural output, but this scheme should be ready in time for the workers on the Maigue scheme when that scheme is completed to go straight on to the Mulcaire.  There is a saving there of £5.8 million of taxpayers' money over the expected seven years it will take to complete the project rather than putting 250 men on redundancy and on the dole queue.  The present ban on arterial drainage planning will lead in the next two years to redundancies on the completion of the three schemes and that <Col N="1486" /> will mean a great cost to the Government. It means that hundreds and thousands of acres of good fertilised land cannot produce their full potential.  It means continuous flooding of houses, schools, land and roads, which is all unnecessary. It will mean that more farmers will leave the land looking for jobs to support their families, thus increasing the dole queues in our cities and towns.  It means less earnings for the country, fewer exports, fewer processing and service jobs, hundreds of redundancies and more on the dole of those working on drainage and also on the ancillary work.  The ESRI report reviews arterial drainage done to date and states in conclusion: &ldquo;The evidence available implies that the best investment opportunities in arterial drainage have already been taken and I expect that the same is true in the case of field drainage&rdquo;.  In my opinion, that statement is untrue.  Why did they not review those schemes still to be done?  Why draw conclusions when they do not know what they are talking about?  The schemes reviewed in that report were not done in areas of high fertility land.  Each scheme must be judged on the cost-benefit analysis, and I have no doubt that the Mulcaire scheme will stand up to that scrutiny.  I commend the Mulcaire drainage co-operative group who have done their own survey and are ready to organise follow-up drainage in order to maximise returns to the farmer, the region and the country Improvement in agricultural output is for everyone to see, as I have stated already, regarding the Maigue drainage scheme, although the scheme is not yet completed.</P>
    <P>We wonder why the Government continue to put very large sums of money into creating jobs through the IDA and youth employment, yet the most productive project in the country is turned down.  Is it because it is home-based?  Is it because it is agricultural, or is it obvious that the Government are prepared to turn a blind eye to it?  Arterial drainage must be examined under a number of headings, with regard to the present economic situation, the employment situation, the necessity of reducing public expenditure and, finally, increasing our <Col N="1487" /> exports to help the balance of payments. Therefore, two most important factors would seem to be to increase employment in the productive sector and so increase exports.  Agricultural products for processing and exporting would realise the greatest benefit to the country, therefore it is hard to understand the present cuts in the promotion of agricultural output which so far seems to have been singled out.  Therefore, investment of money in any scheme must be investigated fully and show its worth in a cost-benefit analysis.  I have put it to the Minister that the arterial drainage scheme will stand up to any scrutiny and, therefore, there is no feasible argument to be advanced in this respect except the lack of political will of this Government with regard to the arterial drainage scheme to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, support this motion.  I was utterly amazed to hear that the Office of Public Works were laying off 235 workers on arterial drainage.  I had a parliamentary question down recently to which the reply, given on 8 February, stated that there had been 25 workers laid off by the Office of Public Works on arterial drainage in December and 22 laid off in January.  If my arithmetic is correct that comprises 282 workers having been laid off by the Office of Public Works on arterial drainage.</P>
      <P>I had a parliamentary question down some time ago asking how many people working in national parks had been laid off and I was told the number was approximately 20.  Therefore the total number of people laid off by the Office of Public Works to date is 300, proving that the present Government have no commitment whatsoever to maintaining jobs or retaining the people who are in secure jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only last week the Minister for Labour said that the Government would devise new schemes for the creation of employment. I doubt his sincerity in this matter. These workers have been engaged on vital arterial drainage work.  Yet the Government lay off 300 while it must be remembered that half of their wages was <Col N="1488" /> paid by the EEC.  I contend it will cost the Government much more to render those workers redundant as they will have to be paid redundancy payments and pay-related benefit for the next 14 months and, as we are all aware, that pay-related benefit was reduced from 80 per cent in the last budget to 75 per cent. Therefore there will be no saving for the Government in laying off those men because half their wages emanated from the EEC.  It is a disgrace that they be laid off and is evidence of the fact that the Government do not care what is happening, that they are not in the least sincere about the creation or maintenance of jobs.</P>
    <P>The House will remember the closure of the Scarriff factory with a loss of 300 jobs and another 300 lost indirectly at a time when the raw material, the timber, was grown here.  Now we are importing chipboard.  At that time I felt it was a mistake for the Government to allow that Scarriff factory to close and I believe it is a mistake now to render 300 arterial drainage workers redundant.  It is of interest to note that arterial drainage was commenced in this country during the Famine.  It was initiated at that time to create employment when there was much need of it and also the drainage of waterlogged land.  Times are not as bad now but when one looks at an unemployment figure of 216,000 &mdash; while the Government endeavour to add another 300 arterial drainage workers &mdash; it is nothing short of a disgrace.  The rivers at present being dredged are the Maigue, the Corrib-Robe-Mask, the Boyle, the Bonet and the Boyne.  The Boyne is approximately 90 per cent complete and all of the others are 50 per cent EEC-funded. Therefore it is a disgrace to reduce the work force when half the cost of their wages is paid for by the EEC.  There is a cost-benefit analysis done with regard to all rivers before dredging and none is done unless proven to be profitable with many acres of land benefiting therefrom.</P>
    <P>The Boyle and Bonet were started by Fianna Fáil, with approximately 80 men employed.  There should be at least 200 men to carry out that work as quickly and effectively as was done with regard to <Col N="1489" /> other rivers in the past.  Last year £11 million was spent on arterial drainage, with only £10 million this year which, allowing for inflation, represents a reduction of approximately £1,250,000. When I was Minister of State at the Department of Finance responsible for the Office of Public Works there were £7 million spent on the Boyne, the Maigue and the Corrib-Robe-Mask with £7 million only being spent on those same rivers this year.</P>
    <P>I might point out also that the survey of the River Shannon has not yet commenced even though there has been a commitment from the EEC to meeting 50 per cent of its cost up to a maximum of £400,000.  That commitment was obtained by Fianna Fáil when in power and, as far as I can recollect, we were recruiting staff to initiate that survey.  I question why that survey has not been commenced because it would provide much needed employment.  As the House is aware, the Shannon is one of the largest rivers in Europe with many thousands of acres of adjacent land flooded annually. We hear constant complaints from farmers whose lands are flooded each year.  If the Shannon were dredged it would have rendered thousands of acres more fertile land.  The work is very necessary and I appeal to the Minister of State, and the Minister for Finance now in the House, to provide the money to have the Shannon survey started so that sometime in our lifetime dredging operations can be begun.</P>
    <P>Arterial drainage is very necessary for farmers who now try to work land which is waterlogged.  The big problem is that farmers cannot get drainage grants from the Department of Agriculture until the arterial drainage has been done in their respective counties because they would not have any outflow for the water.  The Government have discontinued the farm drainage grants.  If they had any intention of creating employment, arterial drainage is one source of jobs and, of course, the wages and salaries of the men as well as the work itself would attract 50 per cent funding from the EEC.  There is an excellent staff in the OPW, excellent engineers, gangers and skilled workers, <Col N="1490" /> who would be capable of handling many extra workers.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is up to the Minister of State to request the Minister for Finance to have the 300 men reinstated in arterial drainage and some extra men taken on. It would give much needed employment. The Minister for Labour might be able to help if he is sincere in his statements about providing extra jobs.  The Minister of State need not be thinking of new schemes, because arterial drainage plans are already there while farmers are suffering great setbacks in their standards of living because of wet land.  In the past 12 months the Government have added to their problems by withdrawing the farm modernisation and loan subsidy schemes and have changed the system of paying assistance to small farmers.  Nearly 60 per cent of the small farmers in my county will be without assistance when they have been investigated.  Now the Government are engaged in scaling down arterial drainage, another setback for farmers.  I question this especially when most of our river drainage is being funded 50 per cent by the EEC who must be having a right laugh to see that we are not spending all the money allocated to us for arterial drainage.</P>
    <P>The OPW should have a scheme to dredge small rivers as well.  This also would make many thousands of acres fertile and more productive.  We could have thousands more men employed and therefore it would be money well spent. I appeal again to the Minister of State and the Minister to have extra funds made available so that not only will the 300 workers be reinstated but many more men employed.</P>
    <P>Many more rivers, such as the Dunkellin, the Blackwater in Cork, the Mulcaire and the Shannon should be proceeded with.  In Kerry we had two major rivers done, the Maigue and the Feale, as well as the Brick and the Cashin.  I have seen the effect of the work done on them as far as the adjoining land is concerned. It made many thousands of acres more fertile.  Our young people are crying out for work which we cannot provide for them and here is a golden opportunity for the Government to provide extra <Col N="1491" /> employment, particularly with the prospect of a 50 per cent grant from the EEC. Much work would be provided for young and middle-aged people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion calls on the Government to provide the finance necessary for arterial drainage.  I do not intend to oppose it or to table an amendment.  I intend to demonstrate that the Government are making adequate financial provision for arterial drainage in relation both to our needs and our resources.  Though I agree with the terms of the motion I am somewhat disappointed that Deputies on the other side have not paid more attention to our resources.  However, I will refer to this in detail in a moment.</P>
      <P>Since the Arterial Drainage Act of 1945 was passed, 34 schemes have been completed and a further five are now in progress.  When these schemes have been completed over 620,000 acres of land will have been influenced or improved by drainage.  Over that period, since the passage of the 1945 Act, some £250 million at 1980 prices has been invested in survey and construction work by the Office of Public Works.  On average, arterial drainage has absorbed 1½ per cent of the Public Capital Programme and it has constituted about 12½ per cent of State capital spending on agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total capital provision this year for arterial drainage in the Vote for Public Works and Buildings is £11.65 million. This amount is being provided to fund the activities of the Commissioners of Public Works on five drainage schemes which are in the course of construction and to meet the State's commitment to the provision in Northern Ireland by the authorities there of an outfall for the Monaghan Blackwater cross-Border drainage scheme.  The five schemes which are in progress are the Boyne, the Maigue, the Corrib-Mask, Boyle and the Bonet.  This represents a considerable effort devoted to arterial drainage over a wide geographical area and must surely be seen to be an adequate arterial drainage programme.  In fact, the current programme <Col N="1492" /> is more widespread than at any previous time since the passing of the Arterial Drainage Act in 1945 &mdash; the main legislation under which this part of the capital programme is carried out.  I think it would be worthwhile spending a few minutes looking at those schemes in a little more detail in order to refute the suggestion that the on-going drainage programme is in any way to be described as inadequate.</P>
    <P>The Maigue scheme in Counties Limerick, Tipperary and Cork will have affected 30,500 acres when it is completed in the next couple of years.  It is now over 80 per cent complete, having been at the works stage for just over ten years and the total cost of that will be in the region of £29 million.</P>
    <P>The Corrib-Mask scheme is the last of three major projects to drain the very complex Corrib catchment, the other two schemes being the Corrib-Clare and the Corrib-Headford.  The Corrib-Mask has been going on since 1979 and it is now 80 per cent complete.  It will have cost £21 million when it is completed in 1986 and will have benefited some 24,000 acres of damaged land in Counties Galway and Mayo.  The Boyne scheme is the largest of the drainage projects undertaken so far.  It takes in large tracts of Counties Meath, Westmeath, Offaly, Kildare, Louth and Cavan and is designed to improve 119,000 acres.  Work on that scheme has been in progress for more than ten years and the scheme is now about 90 per cent complete.  The total estimated cost of the Boyne scheme is £42 million.  The Boyle and the Bonet schemes between them cover large areas of Counties Leitrim, Roscommon and Sligo and a small part of County Mayo. These two schemes started in 1982 and will have benefited 30,000 acres when they are completed in about six years' time.</P>
    <P>The Monaghan Blackwater scheme is being undertaken in conjunction with the Northern Ireland authorities with EEC assistance and it will give relief to some 5,900 acres in the northern part of County Monaghan.  I will come back later to the question of the extent of EEC aid.</P>
    <P>In the light of these facts, it is difficult <Col N="1493" /> to understand how anyone could imply that the arterial drainage programme is in any way inadequate.  It ranges from the borders of Kerry to the border with County Tyrone and from Drogheda to Ballinrobe.  It is giving sustained employment to 750 men and it is giving an opportunity to thousands of farmers to improve their holdings by making use of the arterial outfalls to provide their own field drainage and to build up their livestock numbers.</P>
    <P>When these current drainage schemes are taken with the 32 other schemes completed by the Commissioners of Public Works since the passing of the 1945 Act, and which are constantly maintained by the Commissioners, there is a very widespread network of arterial channels which are of great benefit to our farmers and provide immediate employment in construction and maintenance, not to mention &mdash; to coin a phrase &mdash; down-stream employment.  Of course, there are very many people in all those catchment areas who are perfectly well aware of the fact that the benefits of arterial drainage schemes are not confined to the agriculture sector, but have a wider effect than that.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the Monaghan Blackwater scheme.  This is a cross-Border project being undertaken in conjunction with the Northern Ireland authorities.  It is part of the process of improved cross-Border co-operation on economic matters agreed between this Government and the British Government.  There has, of course, been a long history of co-operation between the drainage authorities on both sides of the Border, but this scheme is the first major undertaking involving extensive works on both sides. The planning of this scheme called for a high degree of consultation and liaison and I am happy to say that the result is a comprehensive scheme for the entire catchment agreed to by both parties and by the EEC.</P>
    <P>The present state of the project is that a scheme in accordance with the 1945 Act has been exhibited in County Monaghan and the observations of the landowners concerned and of the county council are being considered by the Commissioners. <Col N="1494" /> They expect to be in a position to submit the scheme to my Department for confirmation in a month or so.  For their part, the Northern Ireland authorities have tenders for the first stage of their works and they expect to be in a position to start work as soon as we confirm our scheme.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned £11.65 million is being provided this year to fund the arterial drainage programme.  I should like to put this figure in context and to detail, if I may, the capital amounts allocated each year since 1975 for this service in constant 1983 terms.</P>
    <P>In 1975 the value of the commitment to the arterial drainage scheme, as I have said, in constant 1983 terms, was £6,940,000; in 1976, it was £6,760,000; in 1977, £8,060,000; in 1978, £10,170,000; in 1979, £12,400,000; in 1980, £12,270,000; in 1981, £12,550,000; in 1982 £12,410,000 and in 1983 £11,950,000.</P>
    <P>Looking at those figures it can clearly be seen that, in spite of economic constraints, expenditure on arterial drainage increased substantially in real terms from the mid-seventies until the end of the decade and was maintained in or around that level until 1983.  As a proportion of the Public Capital Programme, drainage has held its own since 1980 though of course the Public Capital Programme itself has been reduced to accord with the availability of resources.</P>
    <P>The current allocation is a slight reduction in cash terms on the allocation for 1983.  Looked at in the context of the provisions made in previous years and given the reality of the current financial situation, I could contend that the amount of £11.65 million is a generous allocation for this service.  As I have already indicated, this amount will guarantee the continued employment of some 750 men for this year and will bring the Boyne and the Corrib-Mask to the verge of completion.</P>
    <P>In addition, maintenance is an indispensable part of arterial drainage.  Much of the improvement in damaged land resulting from the drainage work carried out in the last century was lost over the years from lack of maintenance and expensive reconstruction works had to be <Col N="1495" /> carried out again by later generations. The 1945 Act requires that completed drainage schemes be maintained by the Commissioners of Public Works and this year they will spend £4 million on such works giving employment to about 300 men.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a key part of the scheme and merits a little more attention than it is being given here this evening particularly in view of Deputy Noonan's stated and very real concern with the levels of productivity.  I am quite sure that Deputies Noonan and MacEllistrim and other Members on the other side of the House would agree when I say that it is essential that we ensure the continued maintenance of all of those schemes. That goes right from the level of the Commissioners of Public Works down to each individual farmer on the ground. We all know with what rapidity the benefits of drainage work carried out can be lost if we do not pay adequate attention, as I have said, at all levels to the proper maintenance of channels, outfalls and the field drainage that is carried out on farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Drainage schemes by their very nature are finite projects which come to an end. Like most other construction projects, a drainage scheme starts off from small beginnings, reaches a peak level of activity and tapers off as completion approaches.  As I mentioned, the Boyne, the Corrib-Mask and the Maigue are now approaching the final stages.  It follows that workers on these schemes could expect to be laid off in the relatively near future whatever the overall level of drainage activity.  Indeed for this very reason some 20 men were laid off on the Corrib-Mask scheme last November and further numbers will be laid off over the next 12 to 18 months as works wind down. While it has been expected that 230 men would have to be made redundant, certain savings on the cross-Border project which came to light in the last few weeks, following the outcome of consultations with the Northern Ireland authorities, have enabled the commissioners to <Col N="1496" /> reduce the number of redundancies to 140.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that this change came about as a result of what is happening in relation to the cross-Border scheme which I have mentioned.  It did not come about, contrary to what Deputy Noonan wanted to pretend, as a result of this motion or as a result of any particular pressure that the Deputy or anybody else has been putting on.  It came about because, with a constant review of the requirements on the expenditure side, we have been able to identify an area where we had some flexibility and where we could reorganise the expenditure allocated to this programme in order to produce the benefits in terms of employment which I have mentioned and to get the effects of that in terms of the rate of the work completion on the other schemes. One way or another, given the advanced stage of the works on the Boyne, Maigue and Corrib-Mask, practically all of the operatives on those schemes will unfortunately have to be let go over the next couple of years because, as I have said, arterial drainage, like any construction project, is a finite business which comes to an end at some point.  I do not intend to make any particular political point in saying this.  This is a factor which Deputies on the other side of the House should bear in mind when they are talking about the employment benefits of construction activity.</P>
    <P>As announced in relation to the Public Capital Programme for 1983 the planning of further arterial drainage schemes has been halted pending a review of the arterial drainage policy.  The Government decided that a thorough examination should be made of the bases and assumptions on which decisions to carry out these high schemes are made.  There have from time to time been some questions raised about the way in which the efficacy and merits of proposed schemes were assessed.</P>
    <P>Before going into the question of the review in more detail it may be helpful to put forward the historical perspective affecting drainage.  In the 100 years from 1840-1940 there were three significant programmes of arterial drainage.  Over <Col N="1497" /> that period, the State drained about 450,000 acres, equal to 4 per cent of farm land.  Individual schemes were typically quite small, averaging 2,000 acres each. The peak of activity occurred in ten years spanning the Famine period, when over half of all this work was carried out. Unfortunately, much of the work done under these programmes was allowed to fall back into chronic disrepair for lack of maintenance.</P>
    <P>An Act passed in 1945 gave arterial drainage new impetus.  This Act removed several obstacles which were impeding the drainage programme.  The notable change was the shift from tackling drainage problems in a piecemeal fashion to draining entire catchments at a time.  It became clear in the thirties that problems continued and needed a fresh examination. To this end the Browne Commission was set up in 1938 and sat for two years.  They reviewed arrangements and recommended fundamental changes in the whole approach to arterial drainage. The most significant change recommended by them was that all future drainage construction works should be planned to deal with the whole drainage problems in individual catchment areas and that the commissioners should be responsible for all drainage works, both construction and maintenance.  The 1945 Act gave effect to the recommendations of the Browne Commission and the first scheme carried out under that Act was the Brosna scheme started by the first Coalition Government in 1948.</P>
    <P>Drainage like all other capital programmes had to compete for scarce resources and an orderly basis for allocating those resources to best advantage had to be devised.  It was decided to establish a cost-benefit format within which drainage proposals could be tested.  Deputy Noonan referred to the fact that the Maigue scheme was chosen for analysis because it was the next catchment in which a large drainage scheme was likely to be started by the Commissioners of Public Works.  An in-depth study was carried out under the direction of a steering group drawn from the public sector.</P>
    <P>The analysis was carried out under the <Col N="1498" /> aegis of the Office of Public Works and within the context of the development of analytical studies in the Civil Service as an aid to policy formulation and review. While the analysis was confined to the Maigue scheme it was recognised that the methodology developed could be repeated in assessing further projects &mdash; and this has been done.</P>
    <P>In analysing the Maigue scheme the steering group sought to answer the following four main questions in relation to that scheme and, by implication, in relation to the whole arterial drainage programme</P>
    <P>(1)  will the scheme achieve its objectives?</P>
    <P>(2)  would the achievement of the objectives represent an economic return on the investment?</P>
    <P>This is an important one which very frequently is overlooked in public debate on the issue.</P>
    <P>(3)  could the objectives of the scheme be achieved more economically by alternative means?</P>
    <P>(4)  what principles of use for assessing future schemes might be observed from the analysis?</P>
    <P>A full report on the analysis was later published; it showed that the scheme could achieve its objectives provided the necessary follow up work was undertaken by the beneficiaries.  Studies using the methodologies derived from the Maigue report have been undertaken on all schemes subsequently proposed.</P>
    <P>I could go on about the question of the analysis of expenditure on these schemes and its ranking in terms of priority but that is something which, unfortunately, I do not have time to go into that this evening because my colleague, Deputy McCartin, is anxious to participate in the debate.  I am sure the Minister of State will take up the analysis from that point tomorrow evening.  As will have been clear from my remarks, I agree with the terms of the motion.  I agree that we need an adequate drainage programme. Everyone involved, those responsible for <Col N="1499" /> carrying out the work, those who will benefit from the work and those who have to provide the funds &mdash; the taxpayers&mdash;need to know that a proper analysis of the programme was carried out, related not only to our needs but also to our resources.  In the present framework, I submit that our programme meets the requirements identified in this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his generosity in giving me time to speak on this subject in which I have a great interest.  It was a good motion to put down for debate but the subject was treated in a very facile and superficial way by Members of the Opposition who have spoken on it so far.  I regret we could not come into the House and speak seriously about a subject which merits considerable attention and deeper thought than has been given to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are talking about is raising money from taxpayers and spending it so that we can get the best possible return for our economy.  We are talking about spending it on arterial drainage tonight. Two main arguments have been made by the Opposition.  They are that if we carry on a strengthened programme of arterial drainage we will help to solve the unemployment problem by creating jobs and that we will benefit the economy because we will increase agricultural production automatically.  The first argument follows but if it was possible to solve the unemployment problem by employing people to carry out public works, the Minister would have no problem.  There are many public works to be carried out.  I am sure the former Taoiseach, Mr. Cosgrave, would have solved the problem of 70,000 people unemployed in that way and when it reached 100,000 under former Taoiseach, Mr. Lynch and when it was 200,000 under Deputy Haughey as Taoiseach, I am sure they would have done the same.  We must ask ourselves whether in taking money from some area and spending it on carrying out public work, <Col N="1500" /> we will get a return which would justify spending the money.  There are some areas where we could spend it which would benefit the economy in the long term, taking into consideration the employment and economic benefits that would result.  However, it does not automatically follow that agricultural production would be increased by spending money on arterial drainage.</P>
    <P>I have been engaged on land improvement works over the years.  Look at the amount of money which was spent in the west under the western drainage package on field and arterial drainage.  Livestock units did not increase nor was there a higher rate of crop production.  I am not making a case that time will undo the work which was carried out.  In some cases it will, but in others it will not. When one makes an investment today, with our high interest and inflation rates, one needs to get a return fairly quickly. So far it cannot be shown that we got such a return.  I am not saying it is not possible to do so.</P>
    <P>What we are talking about from the point of view of a farmer is taking money from taxpayers and transferring it as a direct benefit to him because his assets in the form of land will be improved.  It does not follow the farmer will make good use of the investment.  It is popular to make arguments in favour of arterial drainage because we offer a number of people direct financial improvement.  The taxpayer from whom the money is collected does not see that the money is going from him to these people.  That is why it is easy to make this point.</P>
    <P>The money we spend on arterial drainage, some £12 million, should not be spent on the basis of decisions made 30 or 40 years ago.  We must update the system and look at the benefits which accrue to the community and the economy.  We must ask ourselves in light of the economic facts known to us today: &ldquo;Does it pay to invest £x to drain a river?&rdquo;  In the cost-benefit analysis which have been carried out, it has been found that a return will be got for the money in all cases.  I do not accept that.  Take a farmer with 20 acres affected by a river and 80 acres which are not affected.  If <Col N="1501" /> the 80 acres are not yielding the maximum production that could be obtained from them, why should we expect the 20 acres to yield the maximum production if we open the river?</P>
    <P>We must look at the system and involve the Agricultural Institute who have a lot of expertise which could be applied.  They could help us come up with sensible solutions. The priority list is 30 years old and should not be sacred today.  We should let out the work for tender.  Planning work to be carried out in a large catchment area over seven or eight years is not a good idea.  We should break the scheme up.  In regard to the Boyne, we are complaining because men were laid off.  It was projected that the river would be finished in 1979.  When we decided to drain the river, if we had set up the contract and provided money it would have been done by now at the cost at which it was originally estimated plus inflation.</P>
    <P>I would prefer to see individuals, co-operatives and groups involved in draining the minor catchments in these areas. Grants could be given to assist them and the work would be done more cheaply. Remedial work could be carried out on some rivers.  When the Department of Fisheries and Forestry plough a mountain for planting, it can result in the silting of some channels and remedial works should be considered in such cases.  Trees fall into channels and flooding is worse, although our climate has not changed, than it was 60 years ago.  That does not mean we must undertake a large scale arterial drainage programme.  We could benefit by doing remedial work on some rivers.</P>
    <P>As regards the EEC, we are leaving money after us under the farm modernisation scheme, FEOGA grants and in other areas.  It does not necessarily follow that we should proceed with arterial drainage.  If we decide on alternative investment we will get EEC money for it. Arterial drainage should continue but it must be in the context of an overall development plan for agriculture so that we will know the back-up work will be done and that farmers are efficient and capable of increasing production.  That is the only way to get a return for the money.  I hope <Col N="1502" /> the Opposition will apply themselves to these questions rather than the superficial and politically acceptable arguments they have made so far.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute on this motion.  I am glad the Minister has agreed in principle with our motion.  However, I could not agree with him when he said the Government made provision for an adequate drainage programme.  I and other Deputies on this side put down questions to the Minister in recent weeks concerning the lay-off of workers carrying out arterial drainage works.</P>
      <P>On 8 February the Minister of State informed me in the House that the lay-off of workers on arterial drainage schemes will have the effect of reducing the works programme for 1984 through the postponement of works which might otherwise have been done this year. Schemes which we hoped would be proceeded with will obviously be postponed.</P>
      <P>I am very interested in the Corrib-Mask-Robe which the Minister said was 80 per cent completed.  When a scheme is almost complete why should workers be laid off?  This scheme was started in 1979 and has benefited 24,000 acres of land in Galway and Mayo.  I am sorry that employment is not being maintained in that and other schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not refer to the fact that there is something like a 3 per cent reduction in construction work on arterial drainage for 1984.  On the figures he has given tonight there is a reduction in money terms &mdash; I am not allowing for inflation &mdash; of about £750,000.  It should also be noted that there is a 31 per cent reduction in the money to be spent on surveys.  What plans have the Government to continue arterial drainage when studies and surveys that should be prepared for ultimate schemes have been cut back by that amount?  This year £11.65 million has been provided for arterial drainage.  In the western drainage scheme £10.3 million was provided in 1983 enabling 5,000 farmers to drain 25,000 hectares of land.  There is a sum of only £9 million provided in 1984 for the western drainage scheme which, it is hoped, will <Col N="1503" /> enable a further 22,000 hectares to be drained.  There is a very close relationship between the western drainage scheme and arterial drainage because, as other speakers have pointed out, we need to speed up the arterial drainage programme so that we have outfalls for the western drainage scheme.  The money allocated to that important scheme has been reduced and applications have not been processed for the last two years. This is a very serious matter and the Minister should look very closely at it.</P>
    <P>I was amazed that the Minister for Finance did not refer to the Dunkellin river in Galway.  It is a very important river and has been the subject of deputations to various Ministers over the years.  It has also been the subject of Dáil questions and Deputy Sylvester Barrett told me at one stage that there would be studies carried out in 1982 on the Dunkellin river.  He also set out why these studies were needed and he said that the first study which would be carried out would be done on water flows on that river.  The second study was to be carried out on the oysterbeds at Clarenbridge and the third study was to be on a wildlife habitat near Craughwell.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works spent £157,000 on those studies in 1983 but I was very disappointed that the Forestry and Wildlife Service and the Department of Fisheries and Forestry did not engage in joint studies on the oyster-beds and the wildlife habitat.  The Minister for Fisheries and Forestry informed me quite bluntly in a reply to a Dáil question on 6 December that no expenditure had been incurred by his Department this year to date on surveys and studies of this river. He also said that the question of departmental involvement in 1984 had still to be decided.  I welcome the fact that £157,000 was spent on those studies but in view of the fact that there was a 31 per cent reduction in the revised Estimates for Public Services, will money be provided in 1984 to continue these studies? Unfortunately, that is where I see the Department of Finance reneging on their promise to provide studies and surveys. Studies on the oyster-beds and the wildlife <Col N="1504" /> habitat were to be carried out jointly but it now appears that, whatever about the goodwill of the Office of Public Works, they are not getting the co-operation they should be getting from the Department of Fisheries and Forestry.</P>
    <P>The Minister said tonight that the number of people being made redundant on arterial drainage will be reduced now from 230 to 140.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>One way or another, given the advanced stage of the works on the Boyne, Maigue and Corrib-Mask practically all of the operatives on those schemes will unfortunately have to be let go over the next couple of years.</P>
    <P>What about the cost-benefit analysis that should be carried out on schemes like Dunkellin and others which were mentioned tonight so that we will have definite plans for the future and that the Department of Finance and the Office of Public Works will have a definite arterial drainage plan from now on?</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the river Nanny drainage scheme.  This river was part of the old Corrib-Clare drainage scheme and it was held up because of the need to provide a water supply to Tuam. The Minister of State was the first person to tell me in 1981 that it was now feasible to do this.  He said that if the river was drained it would not interfere with the water supply for Tuam.  I put it to the Minister that nothing has been done since 1981 to carry out the action required.  He stated that it was feasible to do the drainage works without interfering with the water supply.  Perhaps he would say, when replying, what has been done to provide an alternative water supply for Tuam and when he will provide the £250,000 required to complete the drainage of that river.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the money provided in 1983 by the EEC to carry out a multi-purpose survey of the Shannon. This feasibility study was to be funded as to 40 per cent by the EEC and 60 per cent by the Government.  A total of £1 million was to be provided.  I am informed that the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Deputy Connaughton, said at a function some months ago that <Col N="1505" /> this study could not be done.  We are entitled to know whether he was speaking as a Minister and enunciating Government policy.  Will money be provided this year to carry out that multi-purpose feasibility study?</P>
    <P>Maintenance is an important part of arterial drainage.  The 1945 Act requires that a completed drainage scheme should be maintained by the Commissioners of Public Works.  The money is to be obtained by making a statutory demand on the local authorities.  Statutory demands have been increasing dramatically during the past few years.  Local authorities got an increase of 5 per cent in 1983 in lieu of domestic and agricultural rates and the allocation this year is less than 1 per cent above that for last year.  The OPW make increasing demands each year for arterial drainage maintenance.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about the £4 million which is to be spent in 1984 giving employment to 300 people, but this money will be recouped from the local authorities.  He should get extra money from the Government to put these 140 people back to work.</P>
    <P>I do not like to hear the Minister talk about schemes reaching 80 or 90 per cent completion.  He should be pushing to have them completed and telling us about plans to carry out studies, surveys and cost-benefit analyses for future schemes. I am glad the Minister has accepted our motion in principle but I cannot agree that he is providing enough money for an adequate arterial drainage programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak to this motion.  In the time remaining tonight I will speak in general terms about arterial drainage and tomorrow I will speak about the specific area in which I have the greatest interest, the Erne catchment area covering parts of County Cavan, County Fermanagh in the Six Counties and parts of County Leitrim.  It is particularly appropriate that I should speak on this topic because it was my predecessor in County Cavan, the late Deputy Paddy Smith, then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance in charge of the Office of Public <Col N="1506" /> Works, who put on the Statute Book the 1945 Arterial Drainage Act upon which all schemes since and for the foreseeable future rely.</P>
      <P>I endorse the remarks made by our spokesman about the importance of employment in general.  These drainage schemes provide opportunities for employment in areas which are at present badly hit.  When the OPW and the Minister did their sums it was discovered that it would not be necessary to lay off 230 people but only 140.  There was a little saving and this could only have happened because they got their sums wrong the first time, threw in a few extra pounds from the EEC and saved 90 jobs.  This is the typical cavalier way of looking at job creation adopted by this Government and the Minister for Finance.  It shows his general attitude to people and their lack of importance in his eyes in our community.</P>
      <P>Our spokesman emphasised the importance of land development and the damage that is being done by the Government in halting arterial drainage schemes.  I will be speaking tomorrow about the Erne catchment area.  Studies in productivity conducted in recent years show that the area came second only to south west Cork in agricultural productivity, despite all its disadvantages.  If we can do that without having had any advantage from arterial drainage, the Minister for Finance can be quite confident that on a cost-benefit analysis any investment in that area will pay off.</P>
      <P>We are sick, sore and tired hearing about reviews.  There are no plans for drainage schemes, but there will be a big review.  When you are in trouble and do not want to do anything, call out the review.  The Minister also referred to the great Famine.  That is one of the oldest tricks in the game.  When you want to cover up, to pad out a speech, do the little bit of history.  That is what we got from the Minister.  A decision has been taken not to provide money for arterial drainage, therefore we will have to pad out the speech giving the history of arterial drainage starting at the Famine, in this way hoping to pull the wool over the eyes of Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1507" /> I am also informed &mdash; and I would ask for confirmation or denial &mdash; that the maintenance work is funded by the county councils and not directly by the OPW.  If this is so I cannot see why the Minister should have spent so much time explaining the importance of maintenance works after completion of drainage.  I fully accept his thesis that arterial drainage without assiduous maintenance can be a waste of time and money.  I should like to know whether he is pulling the long bow in claiming some kind of credit for paying out money for maintenance when it is actually done by the county councils.</P>
    <P>Decisions have been made in the OPW to carry out major catchment area drainage schemes rather than to do them bittily, that one large catchment area will be chosen, studied and the actual drainage carried out.  The Erne drainage scheme is eminently suited for that purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down a Private Notice Question on this matter last Wednesday.  I also sought unsuccessfully to raise it on the Adjournment and again on Thursday last.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to discuss it tonight and I thank the Ceann Comhairle for facilitating me despite requests from about 12 other Deputies to raise matters on the Adjournment tonight.</P>
      <P>My Private Notice Question last Wednesday asked the Minister for Education if, in view of the extremely urgent need for a new vocational school in Killarney, in respect of which £1 million was allocated in 1982, she will permit the County Kerry Vocational Education Committee to seek tenders for building the new school in 1984, and if she will make a statement on the matter having regard to the serious overcrowding and dangerous conditions in 16 prefabricated classrooms attached to the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Efforts have been made down through <Col N="1508" /> the years to get a new vocational school in Killarney.  An extension to the existing school was proposed as far back as December 1967 and approved in May 1968.  Developed sketch plans and estimates of costs were submitted to the Department of Education in July 1968. The plans were abandoned in 1969 in favour of a new school on a new site.  It was August 1978 before the new site was purchased and the transfer of land took place.  The delay in transferring the site was due to legal and title difficulties and also administrative difficulties.</P>
    <P>The decision at that time to abandon the proposed extension in favour of a new school was the correct decision.  It was a wise decision.  Following the introduction of free post-primary education and a free public transport service to post-primary schools, there was a real expansion in post-primary education and in vocational education.  An extension to the school could not have catered for the growing needs of the pupils and teachers.</P>
    <P>There are now 426 pupils in the school as against 226 pupils in the early seventies. There are now 26 teachers in the school.  Prefabricated classrooms total 16 out of the 22 classrooms in use on a very small site on the side of the street.  Some of the prefabricated buildings are in an almost unworkable condition.  The floors are made of chipboard which has disintegrated. These prefabricated buildings present a serious hazard to pupils and teachers.  In bad weather it is quite common for some of the windows to be blown in.</P>
    <P>I have the height of praise for the 26 teachers who work in very difficult circumstances in this school.  They are working in grossly overcrowded conditions with the minimum of facilities.  The school and the prefabricated classrooms are very restricted.  I understand that £1 million was allocated to County Kerry VEC in 1982 for the building of a new school.  They are still awaiting sanction from the Department to enable tenders to be sought and to proceed finally with the erection of a new school.  I urge the Minister to issue sanction to the County Kerry VEC as soon as possible to enable them to seek tenders for the building of <Col N="1509" /> the new school.  I understand the plans are prepared, sanctioned and approved. All that remains is for sanction to be issued.</P>
    <P>The VEC, the teachers and the parents anticipated an extension of the school in the early seventies and were promised a new school in the mid-seventies.  We are now approaching the mid-eighties and they are faced with the prospect of no improvement in the school for some years to come.  The Killarney vocational school was overtaken by other schools which were not in the pipeline when the case for a new school in Killarney was conceded. The pupils, parents and teachers are becoming frustrated and disgruntled.</P>
    <P>The existing school and the prefabricated classrooms are in a very bad location, one of the worst locations in the town, at the junction of an entrance to and exit from a major car park off one of the principal streets in the town.  There is a serious traffic hazard in the vicinity of the school at all times during the day.</P>
    <P>I understand the post office authorities, or An Post, are very interested in purchasing the old vocational school and the site to provide an extension to the existing post office in Killarney or for use as an annexe or as ancillary buildings to the new post office.  In the existing post office there is gross overcrowding and additional facilities are required.  In view of the interest of the post office authorities in this building and in the site, I recommend that a higher priority should be given to the issue of sanction to the County Kerry VEC to enable them to seek tenders.</P>
    <P>There is a suitable site available for a new vocational school and it has passed all tests.  It is ideal from planning, traffic and building points of view.  The County Kerry VEC always gave Killarney a high priority but for some reason or another other towns by-passed the town in the queue for new vocational schools in recent years.  Of all towns in the south of Ireland Killarney deserves top priority for such a building.  The existing school is very dangerous.  One must take into account the decaying state of the pre-fab classrooms, the overcrowded conditions and the unhealthy atmosphere in which <Col N="1510" /> teachers and pupils work.  I implore the Minister to let this project out for tender as soon as possible so that work can proceed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Creed) Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Creed)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Creed)</NameTxt>
      <P>The planning of the new vocational school for Killarney to cater for 500 students has reached a very advanced stage.  Architectural planning has been completed and the bill of quantities has been submitted by the County Kerry Vocational Education Committee to the Department for examination and approval.  This examination should be completed shortly and if the relevant documentation is found to be satisfactory, the next step would be to give approval to the committee to invite tenders for the construction of the new building.</P>
      <P>However, there are problems.  This approval is not given automatically after the bill of quantities has been cleared. Much depends on the capital money being available not only in the current year but in the year to come.  A financial commitment entered into this year will mean a larger commitment for 1985.  It is the procedure in the case of all school building projects that at the initial meeting with the school authorities, when the planning of the school starts the school authority is advised that the planning will be processed as speedily as possible through the various stages up to and including the bill of quantity stage, and that when the bill has been found to be in order, the decision as to when the project may proceed to tender will be taken in the context of capital resources available.  We must take into consideration anticipated expenditure in the current and subsequent years on projects already under construction, to which we are contractually committed, and on projects which are ready to start construction. All of the Department's priorities and commitments must be looked at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment there are 68 school building projects under construction, with a further 222 projects at various stages of planning.  This latter figure includes some 65 projects in respect of which approval could be given in the next <Col N="1511" /> few months to the school authorities to seek tenders.  If approval were given, it would mean that all of these cases could commence construction in 1984.</P>
    <P>However, the total capital allocation for second-level building, (secondary, vocational and community), for 1984 is £33.2 million.  The Department are contractually committed to approximately £27 million in respect of ongoing projects, leaving only about £6 million available for possible starts in 1984.  As the 65 possible starts noted have an expenditure capacity far in excess of this amount, the House will appreciate the need for care in regard to the number of projects which may be allowed to go.  There is an ongoing review of those particular cases and to date, in 1984, eight projects have been approved to the seeking of tenders.  Further projects will be released when their particular circumstances have been examined.</P>
    <P>The condition of the existing accommodation is a factor taken into consideration in arriving at a decision.  The Department are very much aware of the situation not only in Killarney VS but also in other schools.  I have had an opportunity of visiting Killarney and discussing the matter with Kerry VEC.  I am very much concerned at the moment about temporary, prefabricated buildings at present being used in schools in the absence of more traditional type accommodation, and that this temporary accommodation should be phased out as quickly as possible, and replaced by permanent buildings.</P>
    <P>There is some discrepancy in the information about this.  I have been told that we have eight pre-fab buildings but I concede that Deputy O'Leary is more <i>au fait</i> with the position in Killarney.  He has stated that there are 16 pre-fabs but irrespective of the number in my opinion there are too many.  This project is not just a matter of replacing temporary classrooms with permanent classrooms which would entail a very piecemeal approach to the problem but it must be part of an overall evaluation of all the accommodation and upgrading needs of each case.  I am endeavouring to alleviate <Col N="1512" /> the problem within the limits of the capital available to me.</P>
    <P>In June 1981, during the course of planning this project, sanction was conveyed to the County Kerry Vocational Education Committee for the borrowing of a loan of £1 million from the Local Loan Fund in anticipation of expenditure arising in the future.  This was normal procedure at the time relating to all vocational school building projects.  I must emphasise that the sanction of the raising of a loan did not imply that, as soon as architectural planning was completed, there would be immediate approval to invite tenders and commence construction.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier I expect that examination of the bill of quantities will be completed shortly, and that at that stage the question of whether it will be possible to allocate sufficient capital will be considered.  I can assure the Deputy that I will have the matter considered sympathetically.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary said that the project started in 1967 or 1968 but my information is that an application for the project was received in May 1978.  From the information available to me the delay in proceeding with the project does not lie with the Department of Education.  The Deputy suggested that An Post was interested in the old school site but I am not aware of that.  However, I will make inquiries and will communicate with the Deputy about the matter.  That is not a factor in determining whether the school will be allowed to go to tender.  I hope to be in a position within six weeks to determine whether Killarney will be one of the projects to be released to tender.  I am aware of the problem there but I should like to assure Deputy O'Leary that Killarney is not the only area experiencing difficulties in regard to pre-fab buildings. There are many areas where teachers have to control and discipline children in pre-fab buildings which are totally unsuitable. I will deal with the Killarney application sympathetically but I do not have a magic wand to wave to get sufficient capital to deal with all the applications that are waiting to go to tender.  I am not in a position to give any more definitive <Col N="1513" /> information at this stage.  The ball is now in our court and I hope I will be able to give the Deputy, and the people concerned &mdash; I also have had representations from a number of other people &mdash; definite information in about six weeks.</P>

      <P>I understand that because of general economic recovery in Europe increased demand for the product in question is likely.  The market prospects are, thus, reasonably encouraging.</P>

I have no accurate information as to the level of this employment but I understand it to be substantial.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the number of people fatally injured on the Galway-Dublin national primary route during 1983; the number of people killed on this route in the first six weeks of 1984; if he will agree that on the basis of statistics in recent years that approximately 20 people will be fatally injured on this road during 1984; if he finds it satisfactory that local authorities find it necessary to cut the surface of the road because of its poor surface quality; and the financial resources that he is making available to local authorities to carry out immediate improvements at a number of locations that have been the scene of fatal accidents in recent years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The detailed analysis of fatal traffic accidents which occurred in 1983 will not be available from An Foras Forbartha for some months.  As regards the first six weeks of 1984, information concerning entire routes is not readily available for periods of less than 12 months. I am not, therefore, in a position to supply the information requested by the Deputy.  On the basis of information <Col N="1331" /> available to me, the average number of persons killed each year on the Galway-Dublin road (N.4 and N.6) in the period 1978 to 1982 inclusive was 14.</P>
      <P>Regarding road surfaces, a continuous programme of skid resistance testing is carried out by An Foras Forbartha.  Local authorities refer to the results of these tests in drawing up their surface dressing programmes each year.  Where emergency measures are needed due to sudden deterioration of the road surface, it is sometimes found necessary to roughen surfaces as an interim measure until permanent steps can be taken to rectify the situation.</P>
      <P>Road authorities are advised by my Department to continually monitor national roads for the occurrence of accident black spots, having regard to information provided by An Foras Forbartha. Approved schemes for the treatment of high accident locations may be financed from the £21 million in grants being made available to road authorities for normal improvement schemes on national roads in 1984.  Similar works on non-national roads may be financed from the 1984 block grant provision of £17 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department have approved the design standard to which this road is being constructed.  The rate of progress of works over 1½ miles is not unreasonable considering the limitation of resources during the present recession and the fact that the works are being carried out under difficult traffic conditions <Col N="1332" /> on this busy Dublin-Galway route. The use of tar barrels during construction is essential for safety purposes.  I am providing a further road grant to Westmeath County Council which should enable them to complete the works this year.</P>

      <P>Research aimed at promoting greater use of Irish timber is undertaken by the IIRS with funding from and in close association with my Department.  The overall objective is to ensure that the volume of timber which is now becoming increasingly available from the State forests is utilised to the best national advantage through the substitution of Irish timber &mdash; properly cut, finished and presented &mdash; for imported sawnwood.</P>
      <P>This objective is being achieved by a combination of measures e.g. improving the image of Irish timber; stimulating higher sawmilling standards; encouraging the use of stress grading and other quality assurances; developing new products and applications for Irish timber and promoting its use by various specifiers and users.</P>
      <P>Apart from promotional activities such as organisation of seminars and workshops, production of information brochers, and on-site surveys of timber usage, current IIRS projects include the assembly of data on physical and mechanical properties of home-grown timber, the development of suitable inexpensive stress grading equipment, the investigation of drying techniques, the establishment of ground rules for scaffold boards and the evaluation of the effects on wood strength and quality of various forest management and tree-growing processes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A considerable amount of information has been compiled in relation to such matters as the properties of Irish timber, wood preservation and drying techniques, physical and mechanical testing of joists and roof trusses, grading of timber and so on &mdash; all of which will, it is hoped, lead to the preparation of an Irish national timber standard.  The promotional <Col N="1340" /> and research efforts are already producing results in the form of increasing market penetration for Irish timber.</P>

      <P>Work on the preparation of a Green Paper on the Health Services is currently in progress in my Department.  This is a comprehensive discussion document which will cover the main issues of concern in the health services for the foreseeable future.  Some fundamental issues being examined include the financing and organisation of the health services and the structure by which they are delivered. Preparation of this document has demanded a greater commitment of resources and time than had originally been anticipated.  I intend to publish it this year, in the hope that it will stimulate a serious and informed public debate on the many issues involved.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 6 April 1983.  He was paid the appropriate rate of unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit from that date.  His claim was disallowed from 14 July 1983 to 13 September 1983 on the grounds that he was not available for employment as he had failed to attend for interview at the National Manpower Office with a view to securing employment. He appealed against the disallowance and an appeals officer also decided that he was not available for work.</P>
      <P>Weekly payments were resumed from 14 September 1983 and are continuing to be made as they become due.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has been awarded a widow's non-contributory pension at the rate of £52.55 per week with effect from 30 December 1983. This is the rate of pension payable to a widow under 66 years of age with two qualified children and whose weekly means exceed £10 but do not exceed £12. Her means derived from a two-thirds share in the profits from a holding were assessed at £11.07 per week.  In calculating her means a deduction of £6 per week per qualified child was allowed.  Her husband who died on 14 November 1983 had been in receipt of old age non-contributory pension of £78.20 per week which included an increase in respect of his wife and two qualified children and payment of this pension was continued for six weeks after his death, in place of widow's pension.  One of the children reached the age of 18 years on 27 January 1984 and as she is not still receiving full-time education by day she ceased to be a qualified child with effect from that date.  The rate of pension payable was accordingly reduced from that date to £35.70 per week in respect of the pensioner and one qualified child, based on weekly means exceeding £16 but not exceeding £18.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A pension order book payable for 27 January 1984 has been issued to the designated <Col N="1379" /> post office for collection by her and she has been notified accordingly.

    <P>The claim to pension in this case was made on 23 November 1983 and it was necessary before the pension could be awarded to investigate fully the widow's means.  This required a visit to her by a local officer of the Department.</P>

Payment of pension was not recommended by the social welfare officer for the period 25 October 1983 to 13 January 1984 as the claimant's means consisting of the weekly value of a holding were in excess of the statutory limit of £42 per week.  However, payment of pension was recommended at the maximum weekly rate of £38.60 from 14 January 1984, the date of transfer of the holding.  A pension book payable from 20 January 1984 issued to the person concerned on 2 March 1984.</P>
      <P>Submission of the claim to the committee was deferred in this case pending receipt of satisfactory evidence of age and a copy of a deed of assignment which was drawn up in respect of the holding.</P>

    <P>Two EC grants were awarded for the planning and development of various forms of co-operation (81-2, 82-3).  A comparative planning course has been jointly prepared on planning problems and systems in three small EC countries. Teaching materials and lecturing staff have been exchanged.  Each institution reserves annually five places for students from each of the two partner establishments for a minimum of three months. The student exchange became partially operational 82-3.  This further EC grant would allow some Danish staff members to teach in Edinburgh, to prepare students for their period abroad.</P>

      <P>I would draw the attention of the Deputy to paragraph 6.17 of the Programme for Action in Education 1984-1987 where it is stated in relation to capital projects at third-level that &ldquo;the provision of funds for capital purposes either by way of new buildings, extensions or equipment poses particular problems in view of the magnitude of the costs involved&rdquo;.  Decisions in relation to the projects which may be given priority are made in the context of Government decisions with regard to the Public Capital Programme.  It is not possible at this stage to sanction the purchase of a site for or to commence planning of the proposed regional technical college for Thurles.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;defray the expenditure of the Youth Employment Agency in the performance of its functions and such other expenditure in relation to the training <Col N="1409" /> and employment of young persons as the Minister (for Labour) may determine with the consent of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much aware that 1984 is the centenary year of the foundation of the GAA and already my Department have allocated grant-aid under the youth employment scheme to a number of GAA clubs for projects related specifically to the centenary year.  I should add that the Minister for Finance in his budget speech on 25 January announced the award of a special grant of £100,000 to the GAA for specific projects connected with the celebration of the centenary year of the foundation of the association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am prepared to consider further applications of a similar nature which will provide employment for young persons. I cannot, at this stage, state the total amount of money which will be allocated <Col N="1410" /> to GAA clubs.  Each individual application must be considered on its merits and the amount of money allocated to any individual organisation is dependent on the number of applications received from that organisation, the type of projects proposed and the funds available for the operation of the Scheme.</P>
    <P>The terms and conditions of the youth employment scheme are available from my Department.  In brief, grants are payable for the employment of young people on desirable community work which would not otherwise be undertaken in the normal course at the present time.</P>
    <P>The scheme is financed from the youth employment levy.</P>
